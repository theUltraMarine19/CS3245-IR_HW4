     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HOWIE J: On 23 August 2004 the applicant was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing two charges. The first alleged that on 19 September 2001 the applicant maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm on a police officer acting in the execution of his duty, an offence under s 60(3)(b) of the Crimes Act. The second count was in the alternative and charged that the applicant assaulted a police officer acting in the execution of his duty and by that assault occasioned him actual bodily harm. The applicant pleaded guilty to the second count and the Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. The offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty is contrary to s 60(2) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years. 
     
      
    2 On 12 November 2004 Acting Judge Mahoney sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 22 months and specified a non-parole period of 16½ months expiring on 25 March 2006 the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him. 
     
      
    3 The history of the matter is that on 12 December 2002 a jury convicted the applicant of five offences arising from an incident that occurred at Central Railway Station on 19 September 2001. Included in the offences, for which the applicant was convicted, was an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on a police officer (the s 60(3)(b) offence). The applicant was sentenced by Judge Sorby for five offences to a total sentence of imprisonment for 4 years to date from 12 December 2002 with an overall non-parole period of 2 years 4 months. That sentence included a period of imprisonment of 34 months with a non-parole period of 16 months to commence from 11 February 2004 that was referable to the s 60(3)(b) offence. The applicant appealed against his conviction for that offence and there was no Crown appeal against the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    4 On 6 April 2004 this Court quashed the conviction and sentence for that offence and ordered that the applicant be retried: R v Youkhana [2004] NSWCCA 87. The Court concluded that, although there was evidence to justify the conviction, there had been an error in the way the matter had been left for the jury’s consideration in the summing up. As a consequence of the order for retrial the matter came before the Judge and, as I have already indicated, the Crown effectively abandoned the more serious offence for which the applicant had been originally convicted. 
     
      
    5 There was an agreed statement of facts placed before the Judge together with a statement of the police officer, the victim of the offence, a medical report on the officer’s injuries and a record of interview with the applicant. The statement of facts was relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        At about 5.30 pm on Wednesday 19 September 2001 Constable Neale GORDON (who had completed his duties and in plain clothes) was waiting on platform 19 at Central Railway Station to proceed home. Constable GORDON saw a man, Donald MURPHY, attempting to board a train and the Offender apparently stopping him. Following a complaint by MURPHY to an employee of State Rail the Offender was requested to get off the train. At the time the Offender was with four other males. 
         
         
        After the Offender got off the train Constable GORDON saw him walk past MURPHY and punch him in the mouth and then walk towards a set of steps. Constable GORDON told the Offender he was a police officer and that he was under arrest and at the same time took hold of the Offender around the neck from behind. The Offender began pushing up against Constable GORDON in an attempt to get away. At this time the group of males who had been with the Offender approached and one of them (whom the Crown believes to be John OHANIAN) punched Constable GORDON to the left side of the face. Both Constable GORDON and the Offender fell to the ground where the Offender was pulled from the grip of Constable GORDON by one of the members of the group. During this time the Offender’s shirt was ripped from his back. The Offender and the other males ran down a set of stairs and through other parts of Central Railway (this was captured on CCTV). Descriptions of the Offender and the other males were given to police who attended the scene and photographs were downloaded from the CCTV footage. The Offender was seen on the footage displaying a large distinctive tattoo of a religious figure on the top left hand side of his back. John OHANIAN was seen on the footage as displaying a tattoo around his bicep and a ‘rats tail’ at the back of his head. 
         
         
        The Crown case against this Offender is that he was part of a joint criminal enterprise which was formed instantaneously and began at the point Constable GORDON took hold of the Offender and that enterprise has as its objective to do what was considered necessary to free the Offender from arrest and permit his escape. 
         
         
        On the 17 October 2001, just less than a month after the incident Senior Constable Scott WHITE (who had been aware of the descriptions of the males involved in the incident) saw the Offender and OHANIAN in George Street, Haymarket. They were arrested and taken to the City Central Police Station. 
         
         
        The Offender took part in an electronically recorded interview where he denied any knowledge of the incident. He was later charged. 
         
         
        INJURIES SUSTAINED BY CONSTABLE GORDON 
         
         
        As a result of the blow received to his face by one other offender Constable GORDON received a fracture to his left upper jaw and a damaged nerve in his left cheek. He continues to have numbness and loss of feeling in the area of his left cheek. 
         
         
        TIME SERVED IN CUSTODY 
         
         
        The Offender had been in custody serving his sentence for this matter from the 12 February 2004 until the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal on the 6 April 2004 being 1 month 26 days. 
         
        
       
      
    6 The applicant was aged 25 years at the date of the offence and had a criminal record dating back to 1993 for driving and street offences. In November 2002 he was sentenced for an offence of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence and placed on a good behaviour bond. However, he was arrested shortly thereafter for the offences arising from the incident at Central Station and remanded in custody. 
     
      
    7 A pre-sentence report in evidence before the Judge stated that, since being released from custody on bail from the sentences imposed upon him by Judge Sorby, the applicant had been living at home with his mother and two siblings. He was in full-time employment as a tyre fitter and also working on weekends at a service station. The applicant had a history of drug abuse but, apart from occasional cannabis use, he had not been using drugs since his release. He indicated to the officer preparing the report that he was willing to attend counselling because of his use of cannabis. The officer reported that the offence for which he was to be sentenced occurred at a time when the applicant’s lifestyle was unstable and he was heavily involved in drugs. The applicant had acknowledged the seriousness of his behaviour and expressed regret for it. He was found to be suitable for community service and periodic detention. 
     
      
    8 The applicant had served a period of 12 months imprisonment as a result of the sentences imposed upon him by Judge Sorby for the other offences for which he had been convicted. Those sentences expired on 11 December 2003. He was released to bail following the decision of this Court to quash the conviction on 8 April 2004, he having served 56 days on account of the offence against the police officer. He was returned to custody on 8 October 2004 when he was refused bail following his plea of guilty to the second count on the indictment. He remained in custody on remand until 12 November 2004 when he was sentenced for the present matter. Notwithstanding that the applicant had been in custody since 8 October 2004, the Judge dated the sentence from 12 November 2004 but deducted the period that the applicant had been in custody on remand. 
     
      
    9 The Judge determined that an appropriate starting sentence for the offence as against a maximum penalty of 7 years was one of imprisonment for 3 years. He then reduced that sentenced by 20 per cent to allow for the plea of guilty and arrived at a sentence of 29 months. The Judge then erroneously deducted a period of six months and 1 day for the period served prior to the quashing of the conviction, that period in fact being 1 month and 26 days. From the resulting period of 23 months his Honour then deducted a period of five weeks and 3 days to represent the period on remand prior to sentencing and so derived a head sentence of 22 months. In respect of this period his Honour fixed a non-parole period of 16½ months being the statutory proportion between the non-parole period and term of the sentence prescribed by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    10 It was quite wrong for his Honour to take into account the periods spent in custody in determining the head sentence. The period spent in custody is deducted from the whole of the sentence including the non-parole period. The difference between the approach adopted by the Judge and the correct approach becomes most obvious when there is no finding of special circumstances. In such a case, as was the position here, the offender obtains the benefit of only 75 per cent of the period served by way of a reduction in the non-parole period. In the proper approach, that is to fix the sentence and the non-parole period and then to make allowance for the period in custody the applicant gets the benefit of the whole of the period served. The mathematical problem would not have arisen had his Honour taken the course that decisions of this Court have consistently urged a sentencing judge to take: that is to back date the commencement of the sentence even if this results in the sentence being deemed to commence at a point when the offender was not in custody: see R v Newman and Simpson (2004) 145 A Crim R 361. 
     
      
    11 It should be noted immediately that the sentence imposed by Judge Sorby for the more serious offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, taken in isolation, was less severe, insofar as the non-parole period was concerned, than the sentence imposed upon the applicant by Acting Judge Mahoney for the offence to which he pleaded guilty. The non-parole period imposed by Judge Sorby was one of 16 months yet the minimum period of imprisonment the applicant was required to serve under the sentence imposed by Acting Judge Mahoney was 16½ months. Because of the way the Judge took into account the period already served, the applicant would have served a minimum period of custody of over 19½ months before being released to parole. And this is notwithstanding that Acting Judge Mahoney was sentencing the applicant for a less serious offence than that for which Judge Sorby sentenced him. This means that, by reason of his successful appeal against conviction, the applicant is being required to serve a longer period in custody than was the case before he appealed and for a less serious offence. 
     
      
    12 This result is appropriately addressed under the third of the four grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant. That ground of appeal states:  
     
      
       
        
         
        The learned judge failed to recognise the application of the principal of double jeopardy in the circumstances of the case. 
         
        
       
      
    13 The applicant relies upon a statement as to the principle of double jeopardy contained in the judgment of this Court in R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at 145. That statement was made in the course of considering the re-sentencing of a respondent following a successful Crown appeal. In respect of the re-sentencing of an offender after a re-trial following a successful appeal against conviction, this Court has recognised the principle of double jeopardy and sought to address it by promulgating a rule of practice to the effect that, on sentencing after a retrial, an offender should ordinarily not receive a heavier sentence than that which was imposed at the original trial. The application of that rule of practice was recently considered in R v MM (2003) 135 A Crim R 216. 
     
      
    14 It is unnecessary to once again examine the rationale for that rule of practice or its limitations. It is enough to note that the practice lays down no more than a prima facie approach to the re-sentencing of the offender and the second sentencing judge has a discretion to depart from the earlier sentence based upon that judge’s assessment of the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the offence. However, if the judge is to depart from that prima facie approach, the judge would be expected to give reasons for having done so: see R v Bedford (1986) 5 NSWLR 711 and MM at [8] to [12]. 
     
      
    15 In the present case the Judge started with a sentence before discount of 3 years. That was in fact a higher sentence than that chosen by Judge Sorby. Of course the sentence imposed by Judge Sorby would have taken into account the totality of the criminality of the offences for which the applicant was then before the court. But the sentence to be imposed by Acting Judge Mahoney also had to take into account the other sentences that the applicant had already served. The sentencing exercise in which Acting Judge Mahoney was engaged differed from that performed by Judge Sorby only in ways that had to be to the applicant’s advantage, even before taking into account any subjective matters in the applicant’s favour. 
     
      
    16 In my view the whole sentencing exercise miscarried because the Judge simply did not have regard to the rule of practice discussed in MM. In the present case the prima facie approach was not simply that the applicant should not receive a heavier sentence than that originally imposed for the offence for which he had stood trial before Judge Sorby. Rather the prima facie approach should have been that the starting sentence before the discounts were applied for the plea of guilty and the period served in custody had to be manifestly less than that imposed for the offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm. There is no recognition of the rule of practice in the remarks of sentence let alone any analysis of the situation in which the applicant found himself following the quashing of the conviction and the plea to the less serious offence. Nor are there any reasons advanced for fixing a starting point that was longer than the sentence imposed by Judge Sorby for the more serious offence arising from the same facts. 
     
      
    17 Because of my view that the Judge’s sentencing discretion completely miscarried it is unnecessary to deal with the remaining grounds of appeal, which are to the effect that the sentence was manifestly excessive. This Court must determine the appropriate sentence and there is in my opinion no reason for determining other than that a sentence of significantly less severity than that imposed by Judge Sorby should be the commencing point for the determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the applicant. 
     
      
    18 The Judge in determining that a starting point of imprisonment for 3 years was appropriate to reflect the objective circumstances of the offence failed in my view to appreciate that, as the applicant was to be sentenced on the basis that actual bodily harm was occasioned to the police officer, some limitation had to be imposed upon a consideration of the extent of the officer’s injury. After all the significant difference between the two charges in the indictment was the nature of the injuries inflicted upon the officer. There was no difference in the nature of the assault that caused those injuries or the applicant’s part in that assault. Yet the applicant was sentenced on precisely the same factual basis as if he had pleaded guilty to the more serious charge on the indictment. 
     
      
    19 On a number of occasions this Court has stressed that the facts and material placed before a sentencing judge, particularly after a charge bargain, must accord with the offence for which the applicant is to be sentenced and not some more serious offence: see R v Palu (2002) 134 A Crim R 174; R v Barri [2004] NSWCCA 221 and R v Falls [2004] NSWCCA 335. Otherwise there is the real risk that the sentencing judge will take into account a fact or facts that give rise to a more serious charge than that to which the applicant pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    20 In the present case the injuries relied upon by the Crown to prove actual bodily harm were exactly the same as those relied upon on the charge of infliction of grievous bodily harm. Yet some effect had to be given to the charge bargain in the factual basis upon which the applicant was to be sentenced. It was not enough simply to recognise, as the Judge did, that there was a difference in the applicable maximum penalty. That result flowed from the fact that the Crown was no longer asserting that the injuries suffered by the victim were as serious as the Crown was alleging when the charge was one of the infliction of grievous bodily harm. Of course there was a degree of sophistry in such reasoning but this is not unusual in charge bargains. 
     
      
    21 There does not seem to be any appreciation in the sentencing remarks that the Judge could not sentence the applicant as if the injuries amounted to grievous bodily harm notwithstanding that the evidence revealed that the injuries were capable of amounting to harm of that severity. Rather the sentencing remarks contain the following statements referable to the extent of the injuries: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……..Constable Gordon sustained momentary unconsciousness and injury to his nose, mouth and teeth. Detailed medical examination disclosed a slightly depressed fracture of the wall of the left maxillary sinus and associated injury to the left infraorbital nerve. The sequelae of those injuries is manifest in reduced sensation over the left cheek, lip and left maxillary teeth. This condition is permanent and irreversible. 
         
         
        
       
      Later the judge stated: 
       
        
         
        Based upon the medical report which is at tab 6 in exhibit A in the Crown case, it was submitted that the victim had sustained “no significant continuing injury”, but I reject that submission. A lifetime legacy of impaired sensation in a significant area of one’s body cannot be dismissed lightly. 
        
       
       
      Perhaps a more appropriate submission would have been in terms that the Judge had to treat the injuries as if there were no significant continuing injury because to do otherwise would punish the applicant for a more serious offence. 
       
      
    22 The basis upon which the applicant was to be sentenced was that he was criminally responsible for the act of the co-offender who struck the police officer and inflicted the injury upon him on the basis of an instantaneously formed joint enterprise between that offender and the applicant to do whatever was necessary to secure the release of the applicant from the custody of the police officer. All that the applicant had done before the blow was struck was to push against the police officer in order to get away. On that basis of liability the applicant’s criminal responsibility for the injuries suffered was much reduced. 
     
      
    23 That is not to say that in all cases of joint criminal enterprise there will be a marked difference in the degree of criminal responsibility between the participants for the consequences of their joint actions. It all depends upon the particular facts and circumstances of the particular enterprise including the nature of the joint enterprise, its object, the period during which the enterprise was on foot, and the conduct of each of the participants. In many cases there will be no significant difference between the criminality of the person who caused the injury and any other person involved in the joint criminal enterprise. 
     
      
    24 The offence occurred in September 2001 when the applicant was aged 25 years. Since the commission of the offence he had served his first gaol sentences for various offences including the period of 12 months for the other offences that arose from the fracas on Central Station. As I have already indicated he had a positive Pre-sentence report, and apart from his cannabis use, he abided by his bail conditions and remained in full-time employment. He has now been in custody since October last year, a period of a little more than 8 months. He had served a period of custody referable to the offence pending release on bail of almost 2 months. 
     
      
    25 In my opinion the starting sentence of three years chosen by Acting Judge Mahoney was manifestly excessive having regard to the conduct of the applicant and his criminal responsibility for the injuries suffered by the police officer as against a maximum penalty of 7 years. Although it was argued that the Judge erred in concluding that a custodial sentence was warranted, I do not accept that submission. There was a significant element of general deterrence and retribution required notwithstanding that it was not the applicant who actually struck the policeman. The applicant was the main offender in the events that precipitated his arrest and it was his conduct in trying to avoid apprehension that led to the involvement of the co-offender and thus the attack upon the officer. 
     
      
    26 In my opinion an appropriate starting sentence was one of two years allowing for the limited use that could be made of the injuries suffered by the police officer and taking into account the period of time that had transpired since the commission of the offence and the efforts of the applicant at rehabilitation in the meantime. In determining that starting point I take into account the seriousness of the offence and the importance of general deterrence in relation to offences against police officers. The sentence is to be reduced by 20 per cent for the plea of guilty, that being the discount applied by the sentencing Judge. This results in a head sentence of 19 months. 
     
      
    27 In my view there are special circumstances having regard to the prospects of further rehabilitation set out in the pre-sentence report and the need for supervision identified by the probation officer. 
     
      
    28 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The application for leave is granted and the appeal is allowed. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The sentence imposed by Acting Judge Mahoney is quashed. 
        
       
       
        
        3. In lieu the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 19 months. There should be a non-parole period specified of 10 months. The sentence should be taken to have commenced on 25 August 2004 and, therefore, the non-parole period expires today 24 June 2005. The applicant is to be released to parole today. His parole is to be subject to the usual conditions as to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service.

    JUDGMENT 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application to extend until further order an interlocutory injunction granted by Mr Justice Hamilton on an ex parte application on 17 June 2005. His Honour's orders have subsequently been extended on two occasions until today. The injunctions restrain the second defendant by himself, his servants and agents, from maintaining the domain <www.hunterholdensucks.com> or displaying the material contained in that domain or similar material on any internet site. His Honour also ordered that the second defendant instruct the first defendant to shut down the domain <www.hunterholdensucks.com> forthwith.  
     
      
    2 The first plaintiff, Mr Kaplan, is a director of the second plaintiff, which trades under the name Hunter Holden. On 17 June 2005, that is the same day as that on which ex parte relief was obtained, Mr Kaplan discovered a domain called hunterholdensucks.com.  
     
      
    3 On 6 June 2005, the second defendant, Mr English, had used the services of the first and third defendants to establish a blog website under that domain name. A blog website is one which enables anyone with internet access to post comments. The site is registered in the name of a US company, T Group Holdings LLC, which is controlled by Mr English. He deposes that the website was established as an unrestricted website, meaning that there were no controls on the posting or removal of items by any visitor to it.  
     
      
    4 The second plaintiff carries on business as a dealer for Holden motor vehicles at St Leonards in Sydney. Since February 2005, Mr English has been in dispute with the second plaintiff over a motor vehicle which he left for servicing and which was stolen from the premises. The second plaintiff put the matter in the hands of its insurers and arranged a replacement vehicle until the matter was finalised. The insurer sought to settle the claim without an admission of liability and offered to pay what it claims was the indemnity value of the vehicle at the time of the loss. Mr English has not accepted the offer and his dispute with the second plaintiff is unresolved.  
     
      
    5 The domain name of the website Mr English established, was hunterholdensucks.com. He denied that he used the name intending to disparage the second plaintiff or its business or products, but that evidence is not credible. According to him, the only part of the website for which he was responsible was the name which appears in large letters, ""Hunter Holden Sucks"" and the invitation which follows to, ""Share your comments about Hunter Holden Automotive here"".  
     
      
    6 Mr Kaplan printed out a copy of the website page on 17 June 2005. Apart from the heading and the invitation to post comments, the page consisted of a number of postings each of which was introduced by its own headline. The postings then invited comments on the material posted.  
     
      
    7 There were 6 such postings, all between the hours of 01:49 and 02:07 on 9 June 2005. In order, they were introduced by the following headings: Car Stolen, Fraud, Overcharging, Management, Adam Kaplan owner of Hunter Holden Automotive Direct Contact Details, and Warranty Issues. The second last of these headings contained a posting giving Mr Kaplan's mobile and direct phone numbers.  
     
      
    8 Under the heading ""Car Stolen"" there was a statement ""Adam Kaplan, director of Hunter Holden Automotive refuses to admit liability for the theft of motor vehicle stolen from St Leonard's dealership"". Under the heading ""Fraud"" there was a statement ""People say that overcharging on customer cars is rife at Hunter Holden."" To this was added a comment later on the same day purportedly from an N Barnier, which made complaints about service and about defects in accessories in a used car which she had purchased. Her comment made no complaint about fraud or overcharging. In July, 2004, Ms Barnier had posted that comment to a different website called ""Complaints Corner"" at MotorsSM.com. Her complaint was resolved. She did not post her old comment to the website established by the second defendant.  
     
      
    9 Mr English professed ignorance of how the comment was posted. He denied having any involvement in its posting. He denied posting any of the headings or comments on the website, except that he said that he responded to the comment under the heading ""Car Stolen"", by adding a comment ""My car was also stolen from St Leonards"".  
     
      
    10 Having gone to the trouble of establishing the website under a disparaging name in a way which invited disparaging comments, it is difficult to fathom why he should have confined himself to such a benign observation.  
     
      
    11 There is a serious question to be tried as to whether the second defendant is responsible not only for the establishment of the site, but for all of the headings and comments posted on it. That is so despite his denial of having been responsible for such postings. The fact that the comments were all posted at about 2am on 9 June invites an inference that one person was responsible for them all.  
     
      
    12 The second defendant has an unresolved dispute with the second plaintiff. In my view, he established the site for the purpose of disparaging the second plaintiff, its business and products. I draw that last conclusion from his use of the name Hunter Holden Sucks. Mr English said in evidence, although not in these precise words, that the expression carried no adverse imputation in his mind. I do not believe that evidence.  
     
      
    13 There is a strong prima facie case that the website was established by the second defendant with a malicious intent, and for the purpose of damaging the second plaintiff's business. There is a serious question to be tried that he also posted the headings and comments to the website. However, that does not mean that the plaintiffs are necessarily entitled to a continuation of the injunction.  
     
      
    14 If the second plaintiff's only complaint was that it had been defamed, it might face difficulties in obtaining an injunction to restrain the continued publication of defamatory material or the publication of new defamatory material. That is not to say that the principles which govern the grant of interlocutory injunctions in defamation cases become irrelevant because the second plaintiff did not address an argument based on its having a cause of action in defamation. I return to this question later. Suffice it to say for the moment, that in defamation cases, an interlocutory injunction is only granted in very clear cases and with caution lest its grant interfere with the right of the community in general to discuss, in public, matters of public interest and concern. (Chappell v TCN Channel 9 Pty Limited (1988) 14 NSWLR 153 at 163 to 164.  
     
      
    15 Before Hamilton J, the plaintiffs appear to have put their case on the basis that there was a prima facie case that the second defendant had contravened s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW). However, that was not the cause of action on which the plaintiffs relied before me. That may be because the plaintiffs may have perceived difficulties in establishing that the representations, which the plaintiffs says are misleading and deceptive, were made in trade or commerce.  
     
      
    16 At the hearing before me, the plaintiffs contended that the second defendant should be restrained from committing and threatening to commit the tort of injurious falsehood.  
     
      
    17 The second defendant's first position was that he was entitled as of right to have the ex parte injunction discharged on the ground that there had been a concealment of material facts when the injunction was obtained from Mr Justice Hamilton. The alleged concealments were, first, that the comment from Ms Barnier had not been made up, but was a comment which she had previously posted to another website. Mr Kaplan was aware of that at the time of the application. In his affidavit, which was read before Hamilton J, he deposed to having been informed by Ms Barnier that she was unaware of the site and had not made a post on the site.  
     
      
    18 The second alleged non-disclosure was that the statement that Mr Kaplan refused to admit liability for the theft of motor vehicles stolen from the St Leonards dealership was true.  
     
      
    19 The third alleged non-disclosure was that the balance of the contents of the website was not disclosed to his Honour.  
     
      
    20 In Trewenack v Clippers Anchorage Pty Ltd (1983) Ritchie Practice Decisions 13,030, Powell J, as his Honour then was, said that:  
     
      
       
        
        ""A party applying to a court ex parte for the grant of an injunction in his favour... is bound to bring to the notice of the court to which he applies all facts material to the determination of his right to that injunction, and a party fails in that duty unless he brings to the notice of the Court all material facts known to him which might afford to the intended defendant, if he were aware of it, a defence to the application. Since this is in effect the condition upon which such applications are entertained and such injunctions are granted, prima facie in a case in which the duty has not been fulfilled, the defendant against whom such an injunction has been granted is  
        ex debito justitiae 
         entitled to have it discharged."" 
        
       
      
    21 A non-disclosure will not be material unless it is likely to influence the Court in acceding to the application (see cases cited at Ritchie para 28.1.3). 
     
      
    22 If an ex parte injunction is dissolved on the ground of concealment, the plaintiff is not precluded from making another application for an injunction on the merits. 
     
      
    23 The last matter of alleged non-disclosure was not even arguably a relevant non-disclosure. It was plain from the affidavit before Hamilton J, that the plaintiffs had not reproduced the whole of the website. The defendant has not pointed to any other information on the website that may have afforded him a defence.  
     
      
    24 The other alleged non-disclosures are not material. As to the first, the fact that Ms Barnier had posted a complaint made nearly a year before on a different website, being a complaint which had nothing to do with fraud or overcharging, does nothing to lessen the sting of the inference that the second defendant was responsible for the statements which appeared.  
     
      
    25 As to the second alleged non-disclosure, it was not the whole truth for the website to state that Mr Kaplan had not admitted liability for the theft of motor vehicles. In relation to Mr English, the whole truth was that the matter had been placed in the hands of insurers, who, without admitting liability, had made an offer of what they contended to be the indemnity value of the vehicle, which was an offer Mr English had not accepted. There were other cases where vehicles had been stolen where Mr Kaplan agreed he had not admitted liability. As he carried insurance he could hardly be expected to do so. He said that the other such cases had been satisfactorily resolved. I do not consider that there was any material non-disclosure before Mr Justice Hamilton. 
     
      
    26 I return to the issue of whether there is a serious question to be tried that the second plaintiff has a cause of action in tort for injurious falsehood. The elements of that tort are that the second defendant has published statements which are false, that the false statements concern the business or property of the plaintiff, that they were published maliciously, and that they are calculated in the ordinary course of things to produce, and that they do produce, actual damage. Such damage must have been wilfully and intentionally caused by the defendant's publication. (Ratcliffe v Evans [1892] 2 QB 524 at 527 to 528; Ballina Shire Council v Ringland (1994) 33 NSWLR 680 at 692 to 694; Palmer Bruyn & Parker Pty Ltd v Parsons (2001) 208 CLR 388 at paras 1, 52, 57, 114, 154 and 192.) 
     
      
    27 Although no special damage has yet been demonstrated an injunction can lie to restrain the commission of the tort, to prevent such damage (Swimsure Laboratories Pty Ltd v McDonald [1979] 2 NSWLR 796 at 802).  
     
      
    28 The only element of the tort that could be disputed is whether what the second defendant has published was false. As Hayne J said in Palmer Bruyn & Parker Pty Ltd v Parsons at paragraph 154, ""If there is no false statement made it is not enough to establish injurious falsehood to show that the plaintiff is held up to ridicule."" In the same way, it is not enough for the plaintiffs to show that the website was established maliciously for the purpose of disparaging the second plaintiff to its injury. To succeed at a final hearing the second plaintiff must show that the statements the second defendant published were false. 
     
      
    29 However, in identifying the statements published, the second plaintiff is not confined to the literal words of the representation. It would be sufficient if the words used conveyed an imputation which was false. (Haines v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1995) 43 NSWLR 404 at 409 to 410; Palmer Bruyn & Parker Pty Ltd v Parsons at paragraphs 34 and 157).  
     
      
    30 The first question is what did the second defendant publish?  
     
      
    31 He admittedly published the name of the site and the headline to the site ""Hunter Holden Sucks"".  
     
      
    32 There is also a serious question to be tried that he was the author of the other headings and comments on the site to which I have referred.  
     
      
    33 Even if he was not the author of those headings and comments, there is still a serious question to be tried as to whether he published the statements which appeared on the site. He established the site and thereby invited disparaging comments. He maintained some control over the site. He said that he, along with anyone else, could remove any of the comments from the site. The extent of his control over what was, or was not, published, was not fully explored, but it is seriously arguable that he was at least as much in control of the site and responsible for what appeared on it as was the internet service provider in Godfrey v Demon Internet Limited [2001] QB 201; [1999] 4 All ER 342, or the proprietors and secretary of a golf club which allowed a defamatory statement to remain on a notice board in Byrne v Deane [1937] 1 KB 818; 2 All ER 204. In Godfrey v Demon Internet Limited, it was held that an internet service provider was a publisher at common law of the defamatory comments posted on the site by an unknown user.  
     
      
    34 It is arguable that the words ""Hunter Holden Sucks"" convey the imputation that the business of Hunter Holden is poorly managed, and that it provides poor products and services. There may be other available imputations which are disparaging of the business and products of the second plaintiff. There is a serious question to be tried that such imputations are false.  
     
      
    35 There is also a serious question to be tried that the other comments and headings on the site which state or imply that the second plaintiff engages in fraud, and that overcharging of its customers is rife are false. As I have said, there is a serious question to be tried that the second plaintiff is the author or publisher of those comments.  
     
      
    36 There is therefore a serious question to be tried that the second defendant has committed and threatens to commit the tort of injurious falsehood.  
     
      
    37 The balance of the convenience is all one way. The second defendant would suffer no damage if the injunctions are continued. On the other hand, if the injunctions are dissolved, the second plaintiff may suffer substantial damage which it could never prove as potential customers may be deterred from visiting it.  
     
      
    38 It was submitted for the second defendant that an injunction should not lie to prevent him and members of the public from exercising their right of free speech to comment on the second plaintiff's services and business. In Swimsure (Laboratories) Pty Ltd v McDonald, Hunt J, as his Honour then was, said that the concepts of free speech and discussion and liberty of the press had little relevance to an action for slander of goods. That action is one variety of the tort of injurious falsehood. His Honour said that some of the other categories of injurious falsehood may not be exempt from the special rule that applies in defamation cases.  
     
      
    39 The plaintiff cannot avoid that special rule merely by framing its case, not in defamation, but in another tort. 
     
      
    40 The basal reason why the ""special rule"", applicable to defamation actions, was held to be inapplicable in Swimsure (Laboratories) Pty Ltd v McDonald, was that the slander of the plaintiff's goods involved no matter of public interest or concern. Hunt J said (at 801):  
     
      
       
        
        ""It is difficult, if not impossible, to see how these concepts of free speech and discussion and the liberty of the press can be involved in the ordinary slander of goods action. The conflict in defamation actions between the plaintiff’s right to his unblemished reputation and the defendant's right publicly to discuss all matters of public interest, simply does not arise in an action for slander of goods. The issue is not whether the defendant in disparaging the plaintiff's goods had a right or privilege to do so, but rather whether he has done so maliciously and whether in doing so he has caused actual damage to the plaintiffs.""  
        
       
      
    41 Here there is a prima facie case of falsity and malice to establish a case of injurious falsehood. 
     
      
    42 There is a prima facie case that the second defendant seeks to use the internet to publish anonymously false and misleading disparagements of the plaintiff following his dispute with it. The comments and headings on the website are posted anonymously. The evidence was not clear as to the extent to which the very establishment of the website was done anonymously. The plaintiffs identified the second defendant as the creator of the website by deduction, he being the person who made the complaint about the stolen car.  
     
      
    43 The name of the website and the comments posted on it do not relate to matters of public interest or concern any more than did the defendant's comments about the plaintiff's goods in Swimsure (Laboratories) Pty Ltd v McDonald.  
     
      
    44 Accordingly, I do not consider that the special rule which applies in defamation cases in relation to matters of public interest and concern, preclude the grant of an interlocutory injunction.  
     
      
    45 The orders made by Hamilton J should continue until further order, subject to consideration of their terms. The injunction in paragraph 3(b) of his Honour's orders has been complied with and is spent.  
     
      
    46 The second defendant justifiably complained as to the form of the latter part of the injunction in paragraph 3(a) which restrains him from displaying the material contained in the domain, or similar material, on any internet site. The evidence has not disclosed what was all of the material on the site. As the site has now been closed, it would be well nigh impossible to enforce an injunction in those terms.  
     
      
    47 However, I consider that a modified form of paragraph 3(a) should be made, to restrain the defendant, not only from maintaining the current domain, but from establishing or maintaining an internet website of the same or similar name. I also consider that the second defendant should be restrained from publishing false statements of or concerning the second plaintiff.  
     
      
    48 It is true that an injunction in those terms would go wider than the cause of action in injurious falsehood which requires that the second plaintiff establish additional elements. However, interlocutory injunctions may be granted, in appropriate cases, in such wider terms. In this case, I consider that there is strong evidence of the second defendant's malicious intent and the likelihood of special damage being occasioned to the second plaintiff if he publishes false statements concerning it.  
     
      
    49 For these reasons, I discharge the injunction granted by Mr Justice Hamilton on 17 June 2005 and continued to today. Upon the plaintiffs by their solicitor giving to the Court the usual undertaking as to damages, I order that until further order, the second defendant by himself, his servants and agents be restrained from maintaining the domain <www.hunterholdensucks.com> or establishing or maintaining an internet website of the same or similar name, and from publishing false statements of or concerning the second plaintiff.  
     
      
    50 On the question of costs, the second defendant asked for costs of the application. For the reasons I have given, I do not consider he is entitled to that order. Alternatively, the second defendant submitted that he was entitled to his costs of an appearance on 21 June 2005 when the matter was adjourned whilst the plaintiff obtained further evidence, and so that Mr Kaplan, who was in Melbourne could attend, to be cross-examined. The plaintiffs were forced to bring the proceedings urgently, and I consider that it cannot really fairly be said that the plaintiffs should be forced to bear their own costs, or pay the second defendant's costs for that day. The plaintiffs seek their costs of the interlocutory hearing. Although, as I have said, the conduct of the second defendant which has brought about the proceedings is deserving of criticism, I do not consider that to be a sufficient ground for not applying the usual rule on such an application, that costs of the interlocutory application be costs in the proceedings. The costs will be costs in the proceedings. 
     
      
    51 These orders may be entered forthwith. 
     
      
       
      (COUNSEL PREPARED SHORT MINUTES FOR THE FURTHER CONDUCT OF THE PROCEEDINGS.) 
      
    52 I make orders in accordance with the short minutes of order prepared by counsel for the parties which I have initialled, dated today, and which I will place with the papers.

     REGINA v DARREN RODNEY TAYLOR 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Bell DCJ in the District Court following the trial of the applicant at Tamworth upon an indictment containing two counts charging breaking, entering and stealing and robbery with a dangerous weapon. Those offences carry prescribed maximum penalties of fourteen years and twenty five years imprisonment respectively. His Honour sentenced the applicant on count 1 to imprisonment for a fixed term of four years and on count 2 to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of two years with a total term of four years and six months commencing after the service of three years, part of the sentence imposed upon the first count. The effective aggregate sentence amounted to a non parole period of five years with a total term of seven years and six months. His Honour’s statement in his remarks that the totality of sentence was eight and half years was inaccurate. 
     
      
    2 The first offence had occurred between 23 and 28 December 1997 and the second on 1 January 1998. The applicant was arrested on 31 May 2000 at Darwin in the Northern Territory. His Honour set out the detailed history which led to the delay in the applicant being presented for trial. Significantly he had been referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal and was not declared fit for trial until 2004.  
     
      
    3 The offences occurred when the applicant was aged eighteen years. He was staying with his mother at her residence in Tamworth. Mrs Taylor’s neighbours were leaving their house to visit Sydney. There was an arrangement for Mrs Taylor to feed their animals. The neighbour was the President of Tamworth Pistol Club and kept a number of weapons in a safe in the bedroom of his house. The applicant and one Walters broke and entered the neighbour’s house and removed the safe. They took it to Walters’ home where they, in company with a third man, Blackman, attempted to open the safe. Their attempts were unsuccessful and they acquired the assistance of a fourth man, Carr, who used tools to open the safe. The safe contained mainly weaponry. 
     
      
    4 The second offence, as can be deduced from the date specified in the indictment occurred within three to eleven days of the first offence. The applicant, Walters and Blackman went to premises at Calala on information that the occupants there were in possession of “hydro” (hydroponically grown marijuana) and possibly money as a result of dealing. The three entered the premises their faces disguised by balaclavas or in one case a scarf. Each was armed with a pistol. Violence was administered, in particular one of the occupants was struck on his back with a weapon. Contrary to a written submission by the Crown that it was the applicant who struck this victim, his Honour expressly found that he was unable to determine beyond reasonable doubt that it was the applicant who struck this man and he stated that this “does not become part of the facts”.  
     
      
    5 The occupants of the house denied that they had any drugs and the intruders left. Blackman took a wallet and a package of cigarettes. 
     
      
    6 The implication of the applicant, Walters and Blackman in the offences became known to authority as a result of contact by Carr (who had assisted in breaking open the safe) when he contacted Crimestoppers in May 1998. 
     
      
    7 As a result Blackman and Walters were both arrested. Blackman pleaded guilty to one count of being an accessory before the fact to breaking, entering and stealing, one count of being an accessory after the fact to that offence and one count of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon. For the first two offences he received a good behaviour bond for a period of four years and for the armed robbery he was sentenced to two years imprisonment which was suspended upon his entering upon an appropriate recognizance.  
     
      
    8 Walters pleaded guilty to one count of breaking, entering and stealing and one count of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon in respect of the first count of which he was ordered to enter a bond to be of good behaviour and for the armed robbery he received a two year suspended sentence similar to that received by Blackman. The charges against Walters were identical to those upon which the applicant was ultimately found guilty by the jury. 
     
      
    9 Three grounds of appeal are pursued: 
     
      
      (1) His Honour erred in the sentencing proceedings by taking into account as aggravating factors, matters which were elements of the offence. 
       
      (2) The disparity between the sentence imposed upon the applicant and the sentences imposed upon his co-offenders is such as to leave the appellant with a justifiable sense of grievance. 
       
      (3) The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    10 Using language which I regret to observe is becoming increasingly common, but which must have been totally incomprehensible to the offender who should be the prime recipient of remarks on sentence, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         “As to the second offence, the following aggravating factors are established: sub paras (b), (c) and (g).” 
        
       
      
    11 The references to sub paras (b) and (c) may be understood as references to s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which specifies that aggravating factors to be taken into account include a circumstance that the offence involved actual or threatened use of violence and the offence involved the actual or threatened use of a weapon. The use of such aggravating factors for the purpose of sentence assessment is subject to the qualification (within the statute itself) that the Court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor (as specified) in sentencing if it is an element of the offence. 
     
      
    12 In a written submission the Crown conceded that actual or threatened use of violence and actual or threatened use of a dangerous weapon were elements of the offence of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. That concession is correct. The Crown argued, however, that his Honour was entitled to take into account the actual level of violence being greater than that necessary to establish the elements of the offence and that the offence was committed by more than one person, each of whom was armed with a hand gun which was a dangerous weapon. His Honour had found in accordance with subparagraph (e) of s 21A(2) that each of the offences was committed in company and no complaint is made of his Honour’s taking this into account as a factor of aggravation in accordance with the statutory prescription. 
     
      
    13 Whilst the correctness of the principle argued by the Crown cannot be doubted, it does not reflect what his Honour said he was doing. He did not say that he was measuring the level of violence as being greater than that needed to establish the offence nor that he was dealing with the actual threatened use of a weapon in the context of others being also armed. What he said was simply what I have recited above.  
     
      
    14 It is apparent therefrom that his Honour did take into account as additional factors of aggravation matters which were elements of the offence and ground 1 is made out. 
     
      
    15 Ground 2 is an appeal to this Court based upon the asserted disparity between the sentences received by co-offenders and the applicant. The applicable principles have been canvassed so often as not to require repetition for the purposes of this appeal. It is relevant that Walters and Blackman pleaded guilty in contrast to the applicant who stood trial. Therefore the applicant was not entitled to leniency on utilitarian or any other basis connected with a plea of guilty. Further, both Walters and Blackman gave evidence against the applicant and their cooperation with authority by so doing is an additional matter which entitled them to leniency to a significant degree.  
     
      
    16 It is convenient to observe that, in a Crown appeal asserting the inadequacy of the sentences received by Walters and Blackman there had been a finding at first instance in the proceedings against them that the applicant was the ringleader in the commission of the offences. In the light of the evidence before him, Bell DCJ found that the applicant’s role was more that of primus inter pares than ringleader. He was, of course, the possessor of the information concerning the absence of the President of the Pistol Club and the presence of the weaponry in the unoccupied house. To that extent his Honour found that the applicant’s responsibility was more substantial, and that finding is not the subject of challenge. 
     
      
    17 The challenge is simply based upon the stark disparity between two offenders who received entirely non custodial penalties and the applicant who was sentenced to a minimum period of custody of five years with an overall term of seven and half years. All of the offenders, including the applicant, had no prior convictions. They were all just beyond the threshold of adulthood.  
     
      
    18 In my opinion the disparity between a minimum of five years in custody and no custody at all, even allowing for the matters of leniency upon which the co-offenders could draw, was so gross as to attract the intervention of this Court.  
     
      
    19 The third ground can be looked at sufficiently for present purposes in the context of the undisputed serious illness of the applicant. As the delay in bringing him to trial manifests, his mental health has been severely compromised. The evidence before his Honour was that, this having been identified, he was amenable to suitable drug treatment. There was also evidence before his Honour, unchallenged, that those psychiatrists and psychologists who had the opportunity of examining him only some considerable time after the offences, were nevertheless able to postulate that he must have been affected by, at least incipient mental illness at the time the offences were committed.  
     
      
    20 Apart from these offences, the applicant had a blameless record and an initial sentence of the severity here imposed is such as that, in my opinion, the ground that it was manifestly excessive is made out.  
     
      
    21 This Court should proceed to resentence. For that purpose we have received an affidavit by the applicant affirmed on 23 June instant. That affidavit demonstrates that the applicant has been the subject of neither charge nor disciplinary proceedings whilst in custody. To the extent that it has been available to him he has used his time in custody to progress towards rehabilitation. Importantly he is continuing to be treated for the diagnosed schizophrenia and is currently on appropriate medication. He has stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “I believe that my illness has been stable since I came into custody this time and is still stable now. I know that I must keep taking medication or I may relapse.” 
        
       
      
    22 The applicant was in and out of custody during the period between arrest and his ultimate conviction. It was agreed that the total number of days in custody was 404 and that any sentence should commence on 10 April 2003 in order to accommodate that pre sentence custody exclusively referrable to these offences.  
     
      
    23 For the reasons given by his Honour which I need not repeat, there should be a departure in favour of the applicant from the statutory proportion between non parole period and total term. 
     
      
    24 As I have indicated his Honour saw fit to include a marked element of accumulation in the sentences imposed upon each offence. It was open to him so to conclude. However, there is another view open which I would apply when proceeding to resentence, namely that the first offence which involved the acquisition of weapons was intimately connected with the second offence in that it was obvious that the acquisition of weapons was for the purpose of the second offence. I am not suggesting that the evidence shows that the applicant had the particular offence which was committed in mind, but what is clear is that weaponry was obtained in order to enable the carrying out of an offence of that nature. To that extent some accumulation is appropriate but in my mind not to the extent that orders for accumulation were made at first instance. 
     
      
    25 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      (1) Application for leave to appeal granted. 
       
      (2) Appeal allowed and sentences imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      (3) In lieu thereof the applicant sentenced as follows: 
       
       On count 1 (breaking, entering and stealing) to imprisonment for a fixed term of two years and six months commencing on 10 April 2003 and expiring on 9 October 2005. 
       
       On count 2 (robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon) to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of two years commencing on 10 April 2004 and expiring on 9 April 2006 with a total term of four years commencing on 10 April 2004. 
       
      (4) The effective overall sentence thus consists of a non parole period of three years and a total term of five years. The fixed term on count one co-ordinates with the approach of the original sentencing judge and it is convenient to continue to adopt it. 
      
    (5) The earliest date of eligibility for parole is specified as 9 April 2006. 
     
      
    26 HOEBEN J: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    27 HALL J: I also agree with the reasons and the orders proposed by Grove J. 
     
      
    28 GROVE J: The orders of the Court will therefore be as I have proposed.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by English DCJ at Campbelltown District Court.  
     
      
    2 On 7 October 2003, the scheduled trial date, the applicant pleaded guilty to a count charging robbery whilst inflicting grievous bodily harm which offence carries a prescribed maximum penalty of twenty five years imprisonment. The offence had occurred on 22 November 2002. 
     
      
    3 Her Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of three years commencing on 30 June 2004 with a total term of six years.  
     
      
    4 The applicant was born on 14 May 1984 and was therefore aged eighteen years when he committed the offence. 
     
      
    5 The victim and the applicant were known to each other, having attended school together for a time. At 10 pm on the night in question the applicant and three other young men were sitting in a car parked near a shopping complex at Glebe. As a matter of coincidence the victim, who had left a school formal, drove a car and parked it behind that in which the applicant was seated. The victim was accompanied by a male passenger. The applicant was out of the car and the victim recognized him and he approached to greet him. Other males then alighted from the vehicle from which the applicant came. The victim’s friend, correctly anticipating that there would be trouble of some sort, fled.  
     
      
    6 In evidence given in the sentencing proceedings the applicant confirmed that at a time when he struck the victim he believed that the other persons with him were intending to rob him. There were several exchanges of blows initiated by the applicant, joined in by his companions and the subject of retaliation in self defence by the victim. The grievous bodily harm suffered by the victim consisted of fractures of the jaw which required pinning. Her Honour found that it was a blow struck by the applicant which caused that damage.  
     
      
    7 The victim was wearing jewellery and the indictment specified that he was robbed of a gold bracelet, gold chain and necklace, a Seiko wristwatch and $100 in currency. The lastmentioned was taken by the applicant. There were other items which were taken from the victim, examined by the offenders who rejected them and returned them to him.  
     
      
    8 The applicant has not identified his co-offenders nor have their identities been otherwise established. He says that he would be in fear of them. Although he acknowledged his belief in their intention to commit the robbery in which he joined, his explanation for the attack upon the victim was that he was jealous of the victim’s apparent success in having material possessions such as the jewellery display which he wore, in contrast with his own, as he perceived them, relatively impoverished circumstances. There was evidence that his mother had been the victim of violence from his father and that consequent upon their separation he, as the eldest of eight children, was required to contribute to the support, particularly of his siblings, despite his modest means. There was evidence that he made such contributions. 
     
      
    9 Two grounds of appeal were advanced by counsel on behalf of the applicant. It is convenient to deal first with ground 2 which complains that her Honour failed to demonstrably take into account the pre sentence custody. It is common ground that the applicant was kept in custody for fifty two days prior to being released on bail. Her Honour dated the sentence from 30 June 2004 which was the date upon which she remanded him into custody during the sentencing proceedings which took place on various days between the plea of guilty on 7 October 2003 and the ultimate imposition of sentence on 20 August 2004. Upon announcement of the sentence and the date of commencement (as 30 June 2004) counsel for the applicant made an enquiry about “the two months spent initially in custody and also the fifty days that he has been on remand” and her Honour responded “Yes, I did take that into account but I consider that the three years to have been adjusted to take those matters into account.” 
     
      
    10 It appears that counsel was referring to two different periods which coincidentally were almost the same. As I have noted, the period of pre sentence custody prior to the entry of bail was fifty two days whereas the time in custody since remand by her Honour until the date of sentence was fifty days.  
     
      
    11 It has long been said to be desirable for a judge to commence a sentence so as to take into account a period of pre sentence custody referrable exclusively to the matter then the subject of imposition: R v McHugh 1985 1 NSWLR 588. On occasion this Court has upheld a ground of appeal that the taking into account of pre sentence custody of that nature has not been demonstrated: R v Howard [2001] NSWCCA 309.  
     
      
    12 Whilst I do not doubt the integrity in her Honour’s statement above referenced, it is not clear that she had both the periods of fifty and fifty two days in mind. As well, as above noted, the plea of guilty was offered on the scheduled first day of trial and her Honour expressly indicated that she was reducing a sentence otherwise assessed by 18 percent in order to reflect the utilitarian value of that plea. Taking into account the ambiguity concerning the reflection of the applicant’s service of pre sentence custody and that “discount” it is difficult to perceive what initial assessment led to a final imposition of a rounded total term of six years imprisonment or the rounded three years mentioned by her Honour. 
     
      
    13 I consider that ground 2 is made out. 
     
      
    14 Ground 1 asserts that the judge erred in the manner in which she took into account the applicant’s subjective case. In her remarks on sentence she described, no doubt by way of contrast with the objective seriousness of the offence, “powerful subjective circumstances raised during the sentencing proceeding”. Her Honour immediately went on to say that nothing short of a full time custodial sentence would satisfy the requirements of general and specific deterrence. I see no error in that conclusion. There were, as she commented, powerful subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    15 There was however an error in her notation of subjective matters, in particular in her recitation of what was said to be the juvenile record of the applicant including matters of affray and larceny, but, as the particulars of trial demonstrate there were no findings of guilt in respect of such offences and the charges were “filed in court.” 
     
      
    16 Having regard to the applicant’s success in establishing the complaint in ground 2, the issue of resentence becomes a live matter in this Court.  
     
      
    17 Her Honour noted the youth of the applicant and that he had given evidence that he had severed his ties with the other offenders since the incident although she did not say whether she accepted that evidence or not. At the sentencing proceedings there was some investigation of information concerning the applicant’s juvenile record (which was other than clear) but it was eventually stated by the Crown that enquiry was unable to provide a date upon which a recognizance was granted in the Children’s Court and the Crown expressly stated that it did not rely at all upon the applicant being the subject of a recognizance to be of good behaviour at the time of the offence. Her Honour said in response to the Crown’s concession “My finding will be that he was not on conditional liberty at the time in those circumstances”.  
     
      
    18 She did however find that he was on conditional liberty but this related to another circumstance, namely that he was on bail at the time in respect of other charges. It was common ground that the applicant was in due course, and prior to being sentenced for these matters, in fact found not guilty in respect of those particular matters. However that does not alter the situation that he was on conditional liberty on bail at the relevant time.  
     
      
    19 For the purposes of resentence, a combination of factors can be noted. The applicant was aged eighteen at the time of offence; his prior record was relatively minor; he had been the victim of violent and degrading sexual assaults whilst aged between eight and ten years; he had been brought to Australia at age eleven and was put into a school at a time where he could not speak English and had a very difficult time in his school years which he described in his evidence; he had worked as a panel beater and/or a spray painter consistently since leaving school except of course when in custody and I have mentioned his contribution towards the family after the break up between his mother and father. Her Honour found that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. It is not necessary to recite all the detail of what her Honour accurately categorized as a powerful subjective case. For the purpose of resentence the Court has been provided with two affidavits, one from the applicant himself and one from Ms Jocelyn Burdon, and these establish that he is making good use of his time in custody. 
     
      
    20 There were discrepancies between what the applicant said and what was reported in a pre sentence report but he claimed that he had not formed a good rapport with the probation officer concerned. On the other hand he had seen a psychologist Miss Collins, and it was to her, indeed, that he first revealed the history of abuse as a child in Lebanon. He described the offender in his evidence as a stranger, whom he estimated about the age of nineteen by reason of that person’s beard. He had never revealed these matters to his parents and indeed requested Miss Collins not to pass that information onto them. Miss Collins thought that the applicant was clearly depressed. She noted from what he had said to her some suicidal ideation. She thought he should have treatment for his current symptoms.  
     
      
    21 Whilst I do not in any way seek to diminish the seriousness of the offence, it is a curious circumstance that as the applicant and the victim were known to each other, the applicant could not have expected that he could not be identified as at least one of the perpetrators. Whilst, as I have said, I would endorse her Honour’s finding that this offence necessarily had to be met with a period of full time custody, I consider that, having regard to the applicant’s age, the subjective matters and the finding of good prospects of rehabilitation, a lesser sentence would be appropriate in all the circumstances. Like her Honour I would find there were special circumstances justifying departure from the statutory formula concerning the relationship between total sentence and non parole period. 
     
      
    22 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      (1) Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL:  I have read in draft form the judgment of Grove J. I agree with the orders proposed, and with the reasons of his Honour. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act seeking the increase in sentences imposed at Campbelltown District Court by Maguire DCJ following trial of the respondent before his Honour and a jury. The relevant indictment contained thirty one counts, to two of which the respondent pleaded guilty and on the remaining counts which were the subject of trial he was convicted on twenty counts; verdicts of not guilty were found by the jury on two counts; verdicts of not guilty found by direction of the presiding judge on a further five counts, and no verdict was taken on the remaining two counts upon which the jury were unable to agree. 
     
      
    3 The overall effect of the sentences imposed was a total term of 13 years imprisonment with 10 years to be served before the respondent will be eligible for consideration for parole. 
     
      
    4 There were convictions on seven different species of offence and there were two victims involved. In categories the offences were, using short descriptions, kidnapping contrary to Crimes Act 1900 s 86(1)(b) (one count numbered 1, prescribed maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment); indecent assault contrary to s 61L (three counts numbered 2, 4 and 28, prescribed maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment); administering a stupefying drug contrary to s 38 (four counts numbered 3, 10, 17 and 18, prescribed maximum penalty 25 years imprisonment); aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J(1)(b) (ten counts numbered 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 23, 29 and 30, prescribed maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment); obtain benefit by deception contrary to s 178BA (two counts numbered 11 and 24, prescribed maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment); steal from person contrary to s 94 (one count numbered 25, prescribed maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment) and steal from dwelling contrary to s 148 (one count numbered 31, prescribed maximum penalty 7 years imprisonment). 
     
      
    5 The pleas of guilty entered by the respondent were to one count of obtaining benefit by deception (count 24) and the count of stealing from a dwelling (count 31). 
     
      
    6 A summary prepared by the Crown Prosecutor was expressly accepted by senior counsel for the respondent and the following recitation of facts and circumstances has been extracted from it. 
     
      
    7 Count 1: at about 8 pm on 29 April 2003 an eighteen year old girl (JA) was walking in Macquarie Street, Liverpool, talking to a friend on her mobile phone when the respondent commenced to follow her. She noticed this and hurried but he caught up with her and produced a knife, saying, “Don’t scream or I’ll stab you”. As the events next to be described took place, JA was detained by the respondent for about twenty hours. It can be noted that after arrest, the knife described by JA was found in the respondent’s car.  
     
      
    8 Count 25: JA said to her friend who was still connected to the telephone, “He’s got a knife”, and the respondent then took her telephone.  
     
      
    9 Thereafter the respondent took JA by the arm and directed her into his car which he drove to a house in Eagle Vale. During the journey he said that he had previously stabbed a girl who had not listened to him. At the house he took JA to his bedroom, commenced to display a pornographic film on a television set and forced JA to remove her own clothing and put on a see-through bodysuit and a pair of gold “hot pants”.  
     
      
    10 Count 2: The respondent then kissed JA on the mouth and all over her body following which he cut the clothing from her. He then put handcuffs on her restraining her hands behind her back. He then put a blindfold on her and made her lie face down on the bed. While she was in this position he stroked her buttocks with a knife and said, “If you don’t do everything I tell you, then I’m going to stab you”. 
     
      
    11 Counts 3 and 4: The respondent then proceeded to shave JA’s pubic hair and afterwards injected her with amphetamine.  
     
      
    12 Count 6: The respondent then inserted a large dildo in her vagina. This item was later found in the respondent’s possession. 
     
      
    13 Count 10: Following the insertion of a dildo, the respondent again injected JA with amphetamine. 
     
      
    14 After restoration of some clothing, the respondent placed a knife in his bag and took JA to a nearby ATM.  
     
      
    15 Count 11: At the ATM he said, “Give me your PIN or I’ll stab you”. JA complied and the respondent was then able to withdraw $300 from her account.  
     
      
    16 He then took JA to an abandoned house in Liverpool which was described as a place frequented by drug users.  
     
      
    17 Counts 13, 14, 15 and 16: At this abandoned house the respondent applied his tongue to JA’s vagina, put his penis into her mouth and told her he was not going to let her go until he ejaculated, he put his penis into her vagina and afterwards placed his fingers there.  
     
      
    18 Count 17: Before taking her from the house the respondent injected JA with amphetamine for the third time.  
     
      
    19 They travelled from the house and went to a truck stop where the respondent took JA into the male showers where he forced her to join him in showering, and whilst this happened he used his hands to rub all over her body. He then went to Liverpool Hospital where he obtained some needles and then went to a shop where he bought a female school uniform. He then drove JA to a block of flats at a nearby construction site and made JA put on this school uniform. 
     
      
    20 Counts 19 and 20: At this site the respondent successively inserted his fingers and his penis into her vagina.  
     
      
    21 Count 18: Whilst there he injected JA with amphetamine for a fourth time. 
     
      
    22 After departure from this site they went to some bushland and the respondent ordered JA to remove her pants. She did so, but complained about sitting on wet grass, as a result of which he supplied a piece of cardboard for her to sit on.  
     
      
    23 Count 23: He inserted his fingers into her vagina whilst she, at his insistence, applied her hand to his penis. This activity stopped when mosquitoes began to bother the respondent.  
     
      
    24 Thereafter the respondent drove JA to another ATM.  
     
      
    25 Count 24: At this ATM the respondent withdrew a further $200 from JA’s account. 
     
      
    26 Thereafter the respondent, having written some details of the victim’s address on a piece of paper (later found in his possession), drove her near to the home of a friend and released her. As previously indicated she was forcibly detained for about twenty hours. 
     
      
    27 On the following Tuesday evening, the respondent approached a sixteen year old girl (BA) in the vicinity of Liverpool Railway Station. He told her that he was an undercover police officer and that he would handcuff her if she did not accompany him. She did so and he drove her to a flat in Liverpool where he both handcuffed and blindfolded her with a tie, and whilst she was in this state he drew a knife across her neck. After this he took her back to a car and handcuffed her to a seat telling her that if she screamed he would slit her throat. They drove around for some time and then he drove her to her own flat.  
     
      
    28 Count 28: At the flat the respondent tied BA to a table with bandages and whilst she was there he shaved her pubic hair. This activity caused two lacerations which were later confirmed by medical examination.  
     
      
    29 Counts 29 and 30: Whilst BA was disabled the respondent licked her vagina, after which he inserted his fingers into it.  
     
      
    30 Count 31: Thereafter the respondent exclaimed, “I can’t do this”, and he left the flat but took with him a number of items of her property including a television, video recorder, mobile phone and her purse.  
     
      
    31 After his departure BA was able to contact her mother and police. In a drawer in the kitchen police discovered a knife which BA said did not belong to her. The respondent later admitted that this knife belonged to him. 
     
      
    32 Each sentence and specified non parole period for the offences in which JA was the victim was directed to commence on 10 May 2003, the date on which the respondent was taken into custody. They were as follows:  
     
      
      (a) Count 1 (kidnap), imprisonment for 3 years 6 months with a non parole period of 2 years 8 months.  
       
      (b) Counts 2 and 4 (indecent assault), and counts 11 and 24 (obtain benefit by deception), imprisonment for 3 years with a non parole period of 2 years 3 months. As noted the respondent had pleaded guilty to count 24.  
       
      (c) Count 3, 10, 17 and 18 (administer stupefying drug) and counts 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 and 23 (aggravated sexual assault), imprisonment for 12 years with a non parole period of 9 years.  
       
      (d) Count 25 (stealing from person), imprisonment for 6 years with a non parole period of 4 years 6 months.  
       
      
    33 Each sentence and specified non parole period for the offences in which BA was the victim was directed to commence on 10 May 2004. They were as follows: 
     
      
      (a) Count 28 (indecent assault) and count 31 (steal from dwelling), imprisonment for 3 years with a non parole period of 2 years 3 months. As noted the respondent had pleaded guilty to count 31.  
       
      (b) Counts 29 and 30 (aggravated sexual assault), imprisonment for 12 years with a non parole period of 9 years.  
       
      
    34 It is convenient at this point to summarize some subjective features relating to the respondent. Again, the statement of these features in a Crown submission was accepted on behalf of the respondent.  
     
      
       
        
        “The respondent was 40 years old at the time of the offences and 41 years old at the time of sentencing. He was born in Chile and migrated to Australia with his family when he was aged 7. He had difficulty adjusting as he could not speak English, and was often assaulted and ridiculed at school. This led to a lack of self-confidence. 
        
       
       
        
        The respondent commenced using marijuana and alcohol at the age of 13. He began to use amphetamines when he was 16 and soon became addicted. He also occasionally used cocaine and heroin. Since 1987 he has attempted rehabilitation treatments with varying degrees of success. In late 2002 to early 2003 he was undergoing treatment with the Salvation Army Ridge (sic – Bridge) Program, where he progressed well but left after six months, against advice. The respondent’s use of amphetamines increased after the breakdown of his second relationship, and he reported that in the two months prior to the offences he was using it on a daily basis. Gambling also became a problem for him during periods of heavy drug usage. 
        
       
       
        
        He was in a relationship with his partner for eleven years, which ended in 1995, due to financial hardships and the respondent’s drug addiction problems. He has three children, who were aged 15, 13 and 10 at the time of sentencing. A second 6-year relationship ended in 2001. He has the support of his parents and siblings. 
        
       
       
        
        The respondent achieved his School Certificate and (was) accepted into the Australian Army, but was discharged within two years when his services were no longer required. Since then he was primarily employed as a truck driver, until diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in early 2002, after which he was on a disability pension. 
        
       
       
        
        A report by Associate Professor Zagami was tendered in relation to the respondent’s Parkinson’s disease. He noted that he ‘did not believe that a long custodial sentence per se would have any significant impact on respondent’s Parkinsonian condition. However, he would need access to regular and timely medical review periodically …. He is likely to encounter significant complications as time goes on … [and] most likely need periodic changes in his medication regime and may need to dose more frequently. He will clearly need to have regular access to his medication in a timely fashion, because if it is delayed, then he will be exposed to being relatively immobile’. 
        
       
       
        
        A report by Dr Christopher Lennings, consultant psychiatrist, was also tendered. His Honour found that opinions by the respondent expressed in the report were suggestive of the ‘greed and self indulgence which underlie these offences’.”  
        
       
       
       
        
        (He also found that “the report proceeds on the basis of the facts asserted by the offender and has no regard for the effect of the jury’s verdicts. That defect renders it largely useless”). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “The respondent has a prior criminal record, which contains drug and dishonesty offences, but no offences of violence or sexual assault.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    35 The offences of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act have attached to them pursuant to Part 4 Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act) a standard non parole period of ten years. For each of these ten offences (eight committed against JA and two against BA) his Honour set a non parole period of nine years. The prescription of the ten year non parole period was expressly drawn to attention by counsel (25 June 2004 T3), again somewhat cryptically in a written submission and yet again in relation to the decision in R v Way 2004 60 NSWLR 168 in which judgment had been delivered on 11 May 2004 (22 October 2004 T11-12). 
     
      
    36 Regrettably, the statutory prescription appears to have been overlooked when the judge came to pass sentence and there is no reference to it in his remarks and, of course, he made no record of any reason for reducing the standard non parole period as obliged by the Sentencing Act s 54B(4). 
     
      
    37 The occurrence of error in this regard is not in dispute but it is disputed that a consequence of the error should be intervention by this Court and increase in any practical sense of the term to be served by the respondent. 
     
      
    38 The contention of the Crown that the sentences were manifestly inadequate is sought to be supported by a series of compounding considerations in addition to the explicit submission of error by failure to comply with the abovementioned statutory directive. 
     
      
    39 These considerations can be summarized as: 
     
      
       
      (a) insufficient weight having been given to general deterrence; 
       
      (b) the individual sentences for kidnap (count 1) and aggravated sexual assault (counts 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 23, 29 and 30) were inadequate; 
       
      (c) the sentences were not structured to allow for their separate criminality and 
       
      (d) the structure of the sentences did not allow for totality. 
       
      
    40 Given the conceded omission, an initial issue arises as to whether at least the standard non parole period should have been set for the offences of aggravated sexual assault. It is applicable for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of that particular offence: Sentencing Act s 54A(2). I reject the submission of the respondent that the paraphrase of the statutory language as a “mid range offence” demonstrates an error of approach in Way and R v Pellew [2004] NSWCCA 434 by adverting to a range rather than to a notional point in the middle of the range. Where that language has been adopted it is clear that it is not being suggested that the statute be other than faithfully implemented. 
     
      
    41 Although the learned sentencing judge did not advert to the statute, he considered where “the sexual offences” lay “on the scale of seriousness”. He found: 
     
      
       
        
        “…….they all lie toward the top of the scale. The offender must be regarded as a calculating sexual predator who chooses young women as his victims and employs weapons and drugs to enable him to have his way with them”. 
        
       
      
    42 As I have already said, at the time of the offences JA was aged eighteen, BA was aged sixteen. 
     
      
    43 The question arises whether, in applying the statute, individual offences are assessed for the purpose of designating where they fall within the range of seriousness by reference to only the factual ingredients or by reference of the context of the case. In a case such as the present, where the context includes multiple offences, the Crown submission that “context” includes multiple offences should be rejected. The statute speaks only of “an” offence and its location in the middle of the range of seriousness. That does not mean that consideration of the immediately surrounding circumstances to the commission of an offence is to be excluded. In the present case there is significance in how each victim came to be where the assault took place, as well as the particular forms of sexual assault in each case, and the particular facts giving rise to the circumstance of aggravation. The table of standard non parole periods in s 54D of the Sentencing Act sets the one term for any offence contrary to s 61J, but there are seven different defined circumstances pursuant to s 61J(2) and it is obvious that those could be contributors to different levels of seriousness to an offence which is still charged within the ambit of the section. Senior counsel for the respondent did not submit that none of these offences was to be assessed as mid range. He did submit that some were more serious than others and, although he submitted that some should be assessed as falling below that point of range, he accepted that this did not prevent different penalties so as to reflect the escalating seriousness of repeated offence. He submitted that there should not be a global assessment of the seriousness of the total offences and I agree with that contention. 
     
      
    44 Had his Honour adverted to the statute, the first step ought to have been to assess whether the individual offences lay in the middle of the range of seriousness. 
     
      
    45 In each case of offence in which JA was the victim, the circumstance of aggravation was a threat to inflict actual bodily harm. A significant element of the ongoing threat to which she was subject was delivered whilst she was blindfolded, thrown on a bed and stroked on her buttocks by a knife. The oral threat was in terms “if you don’t do everything I tell you, then I’m going to stab you”. Thereafter, omitting reference to what was separately charged as counts 2, 3 and 4 (indecent assault prior to the activity that I have just described, amphetamine injection and pubic hair shaving) the first aggravated sexual assault offence in sequence was the insertion of a large dildo into the vagina (count 6). That offence falls at least in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    46 After events leading to the arrival at the abandoned house, JA was subjected to cunnilingus (count 13), fellatio (count 14), penile penetration to the vagina (count 15) and digital penetration (count 16). Those offences should also be assessed at least as falling in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. It could be argued that the act of digital penetration constituting count 16 fell below that level and, if it were considered in isolation, there might be substance in that view. However, it was the fifth sequential assault and the factor of escalation deriving therefrom was correctly recognized and that, taken with the immediate circumstances and the nature of the threat, places this offence on this occasion, at least in the middle of the range of seriousness. 
     
      
    47 Counts 19 and 20 involved successively inserting fingers and penis into the victim’s vagina after the shower at the truck stop and the acquisition of the school uniform described. Individually viewed, these offences fall at least into the middle of the range of seriousness in the particular circumstances. 
     
      
    48 The final aggravated sexual assault on JA (count 23) occurred in bushland and again involved digital penetration whilst JA was forced to apply her hand to the respondent’s penis. This culminating offence, recognizing the escalation derived from repetition, also meets the criterion for the application of the standard non parole period. 
     
      
    49 Once the initial requisite for the application of that non parole period exists, it arises for determination whether, for any offence against JA, a non parole period longer than the standard ten years should be set. Available reasons for this are limited to factors referred to in s 21A of the Sentencing Act. See s 54B(3). It is convenient to defer this matter. 
     
      
    50 I turn to the offences charged under the same section (s 61J(1)(b)) in which BA was the victim. Two offences occurred at her own flat and involved cunnilingus (count 29) and digital penetration (count 30). It is important to bear in mind that the jury failed to agree and the respondent is unconvicted in respect of offences of kidnap of (count 26) and administering a stupefying drug to BA (count 27). In his remarks Maguire DCJ said that he would pay little attention to the fact that these offences occurred in BA’s home which was not “invaded”. He added: 
     
      
       
        
        “The jury’s verdicts suggest that she took him there voluntarily”. 
        
       
      
    51 The basis for this remark is not clear but it may refer to the absence of agreement on the count charging kidnap. It was an ingredient, upon which the jury must be taken to have been satisfied of both counts 29 and 30, that the sexual assaults on BA were accompanied by a threat to do actual bodily harm to her. Although I have recited the unchallenged facts, what is said must be viewed as not constituting the offence of detaining for advantage, upon which charge no finding of guilt was made, and I draw from the stated facts that the threat was in terms that, if BA screamed, her throat would be cut. It was not open to finding that this threat was uttered in circumstances of BA’s detention. I am conscious that the recitation of facts did not segregate those which described elements of kidnap, but undertaking the requisite severance and, of course, viewing the offences independently of those in which JA was victim, I would not conclude that the sentencing judge ought to have assessed these offences or either of them as falling in the middle of the range of seriousness of such offences  
     
      
    52 If such assessment had been made, a consequence would be that departure from the standard non parole period (as his Honour did) is permitted: Way; Pellew supra. 
     
      
    53 The Crown contention of error such as to attract the intervention of this Court by reason of the sentencing judge’s failure to assess the offences of aggravated sexual assault as falling within the middle of the range of seriousness for such offences, thus rendering the standard non parole period applicable, should be sustained in respect of the eight offences involving JA.  
     
      
       
      DETERRENCE 
       
      
    54 His Honour limited his remarks on the subject of deterrence to observing: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sentences are required that will deter other potential offences (sic) and this offender himself”. 
        
       
      
    55 That statement is not, and could not be challenged, but the Crown submits that his Honour failed to implement his expressed intention. An offence of administering a stupefying drug as I have mentioned, carries a maximum penalty of twenty five years imprisonment, and an offence of aggravated sexual assault a prescribed maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. 
     
      
    56 The respondent is guilty of four offences of the former category and ten offences of the latter. The implied rhetorical question posed by the Crown is how an effective sentence of thirteen years imprisonment with a non parole period of ten years could operate as an effective deterrent to a person contemplating a like offence. The answer is that it is inadequate for that purpose and the Crown submission is made good. 
     
      
      STRUCTURE OF THE SENTENCES AND SEPARATE CRIMINALITY 
       
      
    57 In a written submission it was conceded by the respondent that the structure of the sentences did not recognize their separate criminality, but it was not conceded that this demanded intervention by this Court. 
     
      
    58 As already noted in respect of the offences against JA, his Honour imposed individual sentences of nine years non parole period and total term of twelve years on all of the counts for administering a stupefying drug and the same sentences on the counts of aggravated sexual assault, with the result that twelve sentences for offences of two different natures were to be served concurrently. A different sentence was imposed for the offence of kidnap but the service of it was entirely subsumed within the twelve concurrent sentences abovementioned. 
     
      
    59 When dealing with the offences in which BA was the victim, his Honour again imposed a sentence identical to the twelve sentences imposed in respect of JA for the two offences of aggravated sexual assault. However, he ordered that these sentences commence one year after those imposed for the offences in which JA was the victim. 
     
      
       
      TOTALITY 
       
      
    60 It is received doctrine that where a judge sentences an offender for more than one offence the judge must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of accumulation or concurrence, as well as questions of totality: Pearce v The Queen 1998 194 CLR 610. 
     
      
    61 In this case it does not appear that this process was followed and it is difficult to identify how the pattern of sentences determined by his Honour could have derived from adherence to the required process. 
     
      
    62 The Crown contention was that, in whatever fashion his Honour approached his task, the resultant effective sentence was manifestly inadequate in all the circumstances. I regard this contention as made out but some express matters raised on behalf of the respondent should be addressed. 
     
      
       
      SUBMISSIONS AT FIRST INSTANCE 
       
      
    63 An outline of submissions by the Crown was tendered to the sentencing judge. In this Court it was argued that  
     
      
       
        
        “defence counsel did not disagree with what was said in those submissions. There is no requirement that his Honour had to recite in his remarks as if by rote, matters which were not in dispute before him”. 
        
       
      
    64 There is no such requirement but the present submission does not proceed to indicate how anything favourable to the respondent can be derived from what was presented to the trial judge in that written outline. In that it might be assumed that his Honour took the matters into account, the question remains whether appropriate weight was given. It is instructive to recapitulate the outline presented to his Honour. 
     
      
    65 The various maximum prescribed penalties were tabulated and, in relation to the aggravated sexual assault offences, an addendum “SNP ten years” was apparently designed as a reminder of the existence of the standard non parole period. 
     
      
    66 The submission continued to note matters such as the commencement of the respondent’s custody and some sentencing principles which are scarcely in doubt. The statutory prescription of maximum penalty is a first step in gauging seriousness; it was open to find that the jury accepted the evidence of both victims; that there were two victims on separate dates is relevant for rebutting any claim to mitigation based upon an assertion that crime was an isolated instance of offending; sentence should reflect the totality of criminality and the aggregation of sentences appropriate to each offence must be a just and appropriate measure of that totality.  
     
      
    67 Reference was made to the prescription of aggravating and mitigating factors set out in s 21A of the Sentencing Act. The Crown drew attention to aggravating factors (using subparagraphs in the statutory provision); (b) the offence involved the actual or threatened use of violence (noting that this was an ingredient of the aggravated sexual assault charges); (c) the offence involved the threatened use of a knife; (d) the respondent’s record of previous convictions (limited to denying leniency); (g) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial; (i) offence was committed without regard for public safety in those offences which involved the forcible injection of stupefying drug; (l) the victims were vulnerable given their respective young ages; (m) offences involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts (bearing in mind that the separate acts are the subject of individual charges) and (n) the offence was part of a planned criminal activity in that the respondent was armed with items such as police identification, handcuffs, bandages, knife, lingerie and the dildo, all of which show a degree of planning.  
     
      
    68 His Honour was reminded that he should assess where a particular offence lay on the scale of seriousness, particularly in respect of the aggravated sexual assault charges: R v Gabriel, unreported, NSWCCA 18 November 1994; of the seriousness of committing a sexual offence when the victim is in her own home; insofar as the respondent may claim to have a problem with alcohol or drugs, that it would have no mitigating effect particularly as the respondent had admitted that the consumption of amphetamines increased his sexual desire.  
     
      
    69 Reference was made to the absence of any manifestation of remorse and the gloomy prognostication in the pre sentence report. 
     
      
    70 As matters of mitigation the Crown document recorded the pleas of guilty to two charges and that ill health may be a mitigating factor if there is evidence to establish that undergoing imprisonment will be more burdensome upon the offender for that reason. 
     
      
       
      PROPORTIONALITY 
       
      
    71 Further submissions on behalf of the respondent articulated that a sentence cannot be increased “to send a message”. It is not perceived that his Honour did so, nor would this Court do so in any resentence. It is, of course, increase beyond proportionate sentence which would become otiose, but that is not to say that sentence should not include an element of general deterrence.  
     
      
       
       
      THE RISK OF SERVICE OF FULL TERM 
       
      
    72 The respondent seeks to rely upon information presented to the Court in the affidavit of Mr Hutchison, the solicitor in charge of the Prisoners Legal Service of the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales. In summary, Mr Hutchison testifies that the Parole Board exercising its function with regard in particular to s 135 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 takes the view that it is not in the public interest to grant parole to an untreated sex offender and that the risk of reoffending is high. Alternatively the Parole Board may grant parole only towards the end of sentence (six months is suggested) so that there is only a brief period of parole supervision and monitoring before the sentence expires.  
     
      
    73 He claimed that this means in practical terms that an offender must undergo therapy programmes of various sorts which are available under the umbrella title CUBIT (Custody Based Intensive Treatment). An offender who wishes to participate in such programmes, but denies offences, is not accepted into the programmes. 
     
      
    74 The submission that this should be taken into account as a reduction factor in the assessment of sentence should be rejected. The core of jurisdiction to impose any sentence is guilt of the offender. It is an election of the offender not to accept guilt but it would be inconsistent with the task of the sentencer to make an assessment other than on the basis that guilt has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    75 Counsel referred to no authority for the proposition that this particular risk of service of full sentence could be a factor in assessment. The absence of authority is not surprising. It requires little imagination to postulate a situation that, if a persistent claim of innocence after conviction were maintained and this attracted a reduction in sentence, an offender could adopt that position but, after receiving the discounted sentence, alter his stance, undertake a CUBIT programme and earn release from the shortened sentence. Once sentence is passed (absent express legislation such as applies to persons who renege on offers to assist law enforcement authority) there is no facility for cancelling a discount received by a manipulative offender. 
     
      
      COMPENSATING ERROR 
       
      
    76 The ultimate submission of the respondent was that, accepting that error can be identified in the process of formulating the sentences, those favouring the respondent and those contrary to his interests “cancelled each other out” and the final effective sentence of thirteen years total term with a ten year non parole period was not so inadequate as to justify intervention. Alternatively, the respondent sought implementation of the residual discretion of this Court to dismiss a Crown appeal, particularly on the basis that if regard be paid to “double jeopardy” and the principles of restraint in resentence after a successful Crown appeal, a greater sentence would not be warranted. 
     
      
    77 In my opinion the Crown submission that the sentence, in the sense of its overall effective term and non parole period, was manifestly inadequate is made out. The most convenient way to deal with that outcome is to undertake the task of resentence. In assessing the various terms for this purpose there must be implemented the restraint appropriate when increased sentence is imposed following successful Crown appeal: R v Allpass 1993 72 A Crim R 561 with the result that they will generally be less than what ought to have been imposed at first instance: R v Holder and Johnston 1983 3 NSWLR 245; Dinsdale v The Queen 2000 202 CLR 321 (per Kirby J).  
     
      
       
      RESENTENCE 
       
      
    78 It is submitted by the respondent that the sentence of three years six months with a non parole period of two years eight months was “well within” the range generally imposed for an offence of kidnap. The detention of the victim JA was for the respondent’s sexual gratification. She was captive for approximately twenty hours during which he pursued his purpose, although the criminality of the offences committed during captivity are to be separately assessed.  
     
      
    79 Against the statutory maximum of fourteen years imprisonment a total sentence of one quarter of that maximum fails to reflect the gravity of that particular offence and an appropriate sentence for this offence by this offender is a non parole period of four years six months with a total term of six years. 
     
      
    80 I repeat that in making that assessment and those following, there is taken into account the restraints applicable when resentencing after successful Crown appeal. 
     
      
    81 There are four counts of administering a stupefying drug to JA. Whilst conscious of the escalation of seriousness which derives from repetition of offending, in the immediate circumstances pertinent to these offences, the submission of the Crown that the sentences may be served concurrently can be adopted. Caution has to be taken against making an assessment on a global basis rather than focussing upon individual offences. Nevertheless, a gauge to the seriousness with which Parliament has regarded offences of this type can be found in the prescription of a maximum term of twenty five years imprisonment. Except where life sentence is available this is the equivalent of the highest available determinate sentence to be found in the Crimes Act. For these offences it is of great importance to pay heed to general deterrence and significant weight should be given to it: R v Bulut [2004] NSWCCA 325. 
     
      
    82 I would assess a sentence of twelve years non parole period with a total term of sixteen years for each of counts 3, 10, 17 and 18.  
     
      
    83 I turn to the counts of aggravated sexual assault committed on JA. Section 61J of the Crimes Act includes a variety of categories of sexual attack and there is no implication that each is as heinous as another if done without consent: Ibbs v The Queen 1987 163 CLR 447. I have already observed the available different matters which might provide the element of aggravation although in the present cases it is the same.  
     
      
    84 For reasons along the lines I have mentioned in relation to the multiple offences of administering a stupefying drug, I would assess sentences to be served concurrently for the offences of aggravated sexual assault on JA. My conclusion that these offences fell at least in the middle of the range of objective seriousness has been earlier discussed. I am unpersuaded that any basis is shown departing from the standard non parole period. In the circumstances of these offences, I consider that an appropriate sentence would have a higher non parole period than the prescribed standard but resentencing after Crown appeal, I would apply no more than the standard non parole period. Section 44 of the Sentencing Act requires the setting of a non parole period first and (absent special circumstances) a balance of term not exceeding one third of that period. For these offences I would set a non parole period of ten years with a total term of thirteen years. The two counts of indecent assault committed against JA attracted sentences at first instance of a non parole period of two years three months and a total term of three years to be served concurrently. Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that these sentences were appropriate and neither excessive nor inadequate. I agree and would not alter them. 
     
      
    85 Sentences of the same length were imposed for the offences against s 178BA of the Crimes Act which amounted in essence to forcing JA to disgorge money by using automatic teller machines. These were charged as counts 11 and 24. The respondent pleaded guilty to count 24. Utilitarian value of that plea was nugatory given that it was made in the context of requiring trial on twenty nine other counts. Nor does the plea of guilty impress in this case as an indication of contrition or remorse. The respondent submits that these sentences were in fact excessive. The threat to stab accompanying the withdrawal from the ATM charged in count 11 is recounted in the Facts summary and there is no detail concerning count 24. 
     
      
    86 Counsel appearing for the Crown in appeal stated that he was not concerned that those sentences be served wholly concurrently with others. The respondent has not appealed against any of the sentences and the course suggested by the Crown would extinguish any practical effect and the approach can be adopted. In so doing I do not overlook the submission of the respondent that, although appeal asserting excessiveness of sentence is not brought, it is relevant to look at possible compensating errors. 
     
      
    87 I turn to the offences committed against BA. For the reasons given above it was open to the sentencing judge to depart from the standard non parole period. I would not intervene to alter the assessments made by him of nine years non parole period with a total term of twelve years. 
     
      
    88 I would reject the submission of the respondent that the imposition of a non parole period of two years three months and a total term of three years for the indecent assault (pubic shaving of BA) is excessive. 
     
      
    89 Count 31 charging stealing goods from BA’s dwelling was the other count to which the respondent pleaded guilty. The utilitarian value of such plea does not rise above infinitesimal. The available maximum sentence was seven years imprisonment. His Honour also sentenced the respondent to a non parole period of two years and three months and a total term of three years for this offence. The Crown does not seek accumulation in respect of this sentence and I would not intervene. I would reject the submission that it was excessive in the circumstances.  
     
      
       
       
      CUMULATION, TOTALITY AND SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES ON RESENTENCE 
       
      
    90 Setting to one side those sentences in respect of which the Crown does not seek intervention and is content for concurrent service, a tabulation of sentences assessed as abovementioned can be created.  
     
      
    91 The table is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        
         
         Non parole period 
         
        
         
         Total term 
         
       
       
       (a) Kidnap (JA) 
        
         
         4 years 6 months 
         
        
         
         6 years 
         
       
       
       (b)Administering stupefying drug (JA) 
        
         
         12 years 
         
        
         
         16 years 
         
       
       
       (c) Aggravated sexual assault (JA) 
        
         
         10 years 
         
        
         
         13 years 
         
       
       
       (d) Aggravated sexual assault (BA) 
        
         
         9 years 
         
        
         
         12 years 
         
       
       
       Total: 
        
         
         35 years 6 months 
         
        
         
         47 years 
         
       
      
     
     
      
       
      
    92 Whilst the criminality of the respondent is grave and I would endorse the finding of the trial judge that he is a calculating sexual predator upon young women, adherence to the approach articulated in Pearce would contra-indicate accumulation in whole of the tabulated sentences and non parole periods. 
     
      
    93 I would set an initial sentence for the kidnap commencing upon the date in which the respondent was first taken into custody, commence sentences for administering a stupefying drug two years after the commencement of that sentence, commence sentences for aggravated sexual assault three years after the commencement of those sentences and sentence for aggravated sexual assault on BA one year after the commencement of those sentences. 
     
      
    94 The sentencing judge did not find special circumstances. I also see no reason to find special circumstances so as to alter the proportion between the non parole period and balance of sentence specified in the statute. 
     
      
    95 As indicated, I would propose variation of sentence and orders in respect of the offences of kidnap, administering a stupefying drug and aggravated sexual assault against JA and aggravated sexual assault against BA. It will be convenient and allow easier reference if I include reimposition of sentences on other matters in which intervention is not to occur. 
     
      
    96 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      a. Crown appeal allowed. 
       
      b. Sentences imposed in the District Court quashed and in lieu thereof the respondent sentenced as follows: 
       
        
        (i) Count 1 (kidnap JA). Imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of four years six months commencing on 10 May 2003 and expiring on 9 November 2007 and a total term of six years commencing on 10 May 2003. 
         
        (ii) Counts 2 and 4 (indecent assault JA). Imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of two years three months commencing on 10 May 2003 and expiring on 9 August 2005 and a total term of three years commencing on 10 May 2003. The sentences on these counts to be served concurrently with each other. 
         
        (iii) Counts 3, 10, 17 and 18 (administer stupefying drug JA). Imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of twelve years commencing on 10 May 2005 and expiring on 9 May 2017 and a total term of sixteen years commencing on 10 May 2005. The sentences on these counts to be served concurrently with each other. 
         
        (iv) Counts 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 and 23 (aggravated sexual assault JA).

        (v) Counts 11 and 24 (obtain benefit by deception JA). Imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of two years three months commencing on 10 May 2003 and expiring on 9 August 2005 with a total term of three years commencing on 10 May 2003.

        (vi) Count 25 (steal from person JA). Imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of four years six months commencing on 10 May 2003 and expiring on 9 November 2007 and a total term of six years commencing on 10 May 2003. 
         
        (vii) Count 28 (indecent assault BA). Imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of two years three months commencing on 10 May 2004 and expiring on 9 August 2006 with a total term of three years commencing on 10 May 2004. 
         
        (viii) Counts 29 and 30 (aggravated sexual assault BA). Imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of nine years commencing on 10 May 2009 and expiring on 9 May 2018 with a total term of twelve years commencing on 10 May 2009. The sentences on these counts to be served concurrently with each other. 
         
        (ix) Count 31 (steal from dwelling BA). Imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of two years three months commencing on 10 May 2004 and expiring on 9 August 2006 and a total term of six years commencing on 10 May 2004. 
        
       
       
      c. The earliest date of eligibility for parole is specified as 9 May 2018.

    2 JAMES J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: The applicant, who was at the time a juvenile, appeared in the District Court before Judge Latham (the Judge), as she then was, to be sentenced on a charge of aggravated break, enter and steal contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act. That is an offence for which the maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 20 years. In addition the applicant asked her Honour to take into account a charge of malicious wounding contrary to s 35(b) of the Crimes Act. As a consequence the Judge sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a term of 5½ years to date from 9 December 2003 and set a non-parole period of 3 years to expire on 8 December 2006, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. The Judge ordered that the sentence be served in a Juvenile Detention Centre. 
     
      
    4 The offence for which the applicant was to be sentenced and the matter taken into account on the Form 1 were both committed on 21 September 2003. The history of the proceedings thereafter is significant. The applicant was arrested on 9 December 2003 and charged with both the offence of aggravated break enter and steal and malicious wounding. He appeared initially before the Children’s Court and on 21 January 2004, having pleaded guilty to both charges, was referred to the Youth Drug Court sitting at Campbelltown Children’s Court. He was to appear in that court on 29 January 2004. 
     
      
    5 However, on 28 January 2004 the police prosecutor notified the applicant’s solicitor that the applicant was to be charged with an offence under s 112(3) of the Crimes Act, that is an offence of break, enter and steal in circumstances of special aggravation. The circumstance of special aggravation was to be the fact that the applicant wounded the occupier of the premises. Such an offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. Perhaps more significantly in the applicant’s case it was a “serious children’s indictable offence” for the purposes of the Children (Criminal Procedings) Act, and, therefore, was not an offence for which the applicant could be sentenced in the Children’s Court: see sections 3 and 28 of the Act. 
     
      
    6 When the applicant came before the Youth Drug Court on 29 January 2004, the magistrate was informed of the intention of the police to re-charge the applicant with the more serious offence and the matter was accordingly referred back to the Children’s Court. On being charged with the offence under s 112(3), the applicant pleaded not guilty and was committed for trial on that offence to the District Court. 
     
      
    7 On 13 August 2004 the applicant appeared before the Chief Judge of the District Court on an indictment dated 12 August 2004 which contained two charges, the first being the charge under s 112(3), that is the special aggravated offence of break, enter and steal, and, in the alternative, the s 112(2) offence of aggravated break, enter and steal. The applicant pleaded guilty to the second count on the indictment and the Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. On the same date the applicant signed a Form 1 under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act containing the charge of malicious wounding and asking that that matter be taken into account when he was sentenced for the s 112(2) offence. 
     
      
    8 The applicant appeared before Judge Latham initially on 1 October 2004 but the matter could not be heard on that date. The sentencing proceedings finally took place on 5 November 2004 and the applicant was sentenced two weeks later on 19 November. 
     
      
    9 There are three grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. Her Honour erred in law when taking into account the Form 1 offence of malicious wounding and (sic) in treating that matter as aggravating the indictment offence. 
         
         
        2. Her Honour gave insufficient, if any, consideration to a relevant factor of delay and its resultant hardship occasioned to the applicant. 
         
         
        3. The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    10 The facts can be stated very briefly. In the evening of Sunday 21 September 2003 the victim was at his home in Erskineville waiting for his partner to arrive. He had closed the front door of the premises but left it unlocked so that his partner could enter. At about 9.30 pm he heard his dog growling and went to the front door which he found open. He shut the door but realised that someone was in the house. The applicant emerged from the front bedroom and attacked the victim with a wooden fence picket causing him to fall to the floor. He then proceeded to punch the victim about the head and body. The victim called for help but the applicant left the premises taking the victim’s wallet with him. As a result of the attack upon him the victim suffered relatively minor facial injuries, bruising and abrasions. However, he had a number of lacerations to his scalp requiring the insertion of a total of 25 stitches. 
     
      
    11 The offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty stated that the circumstances of aggravation relied upon was that the applicant knew that there was a person in the premises at the time of the commission of the offence. The malicious wounding offence taken into account on the Form 1 related to injuries inflicted upon the victim by the piece of wooden fencing. 
     
      
    12 So far as the charges were concerned the applicant ended up in a better position than he had been in the Children’s Court because he was to be only sentenced for one offence, albeit that in sentencing for that offence the matter on the Form 1 was to be taken into account. On the other hand the applicant found himself in the District Court as a result of the fact that the s 112(3) charge, now effectively abandoned by the Crown, required that he be dealt with at law. The Crown had determined not to proceed on the more serious charge, notwithstanding the gravity of the conduct giving rise to that charge and the strength of the Crown case against the accused. Yet it sought to have the court sentence the applicant on the basis of conduct that would have amounted to the more serious charge that it had abandoned. According to the Crown, the applicant was guilty of conduct amounting to the more serious offence yet was not guilty of that offence. One can readily understand how members of the public, and the victim in particular, might have thought that this was an exercise of sophistry of the kind that tends to bring the criminal justice into disrepute. 
     
      
    13 However that might be, the Judge was confronted with the difficult and delicate sentencing exercise of attempting to appropriately deal with the criminality involved in the s 112(2) offence while taking into account the malicious wounding on the Form 1, yet not effectively sentencing the applicant for the s 112(3) offence and, thereby, breaching the principle in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. I accept that this could technically be achieved by a strict adherence to the principles stated in Attorney-General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 (the “Guideline Judgment”). I also acknowledge that there should be a manifest difference in the penalty imposed upon the applicant for the s 112(2) offence taking into account the offence on the Form 1 than that which would have been imposed upon the applicant had he been sentenced for either the s 112(2) or the s 112(3) offence alone. The judge had also to take into account the fact that by the applicant being charged with an offence now abandoned by the Crown he had lost any opportunity that he might have had for the matter to be dealt with by diversion to the Youth Drug Court. One should not underestimate the difficulty imposed upon the sentencing judge by the approach taken by the prosecution or the subtleties involved in the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion in this particular case. 
     
      
    14 It is in these circumstances that the first ground of appeal arises and which contends that the Judge erred in the way that she approached the task confronting her by the nature of the charge and the existence of the matter on the Form 1. During the course of her remarks on sentence, the Judge set out in a brief, but accurate form, the history of the proceedings from the date of the arrest of the applicant until he appeared before her. Her Honour then went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Thus the offender now stands to be sentenced on the same basis which initially qualified him for a form of diversion, namely the Youth Drug Court. This feature of the sentencing proceedings introduces a degree of artificiality in that it must be accepted that pleas of guilty were entered at the first available opportunity to the charges as presently framed. More particularly the aggravating feature of the more serious charge which resulted in committal to this Court now finds expression as a separate offence on the Form 1.  
        As such, it nonetheless aggravates the offence on indictment to which the offender has pleaded guilty. 
         The objective gravity of the principal offence must however be assessed by reference to the maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. 
        
       
      
    15 Later in the course of the sentencing remarks, when dealing with a submission that the applicant be dealt with under the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act rather than according to law, her Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The principles to be applied in determining that issue and those matters to which the Court must have regard under s 18(1A) of the  
        Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 
         are not in dispute. Of the matters mandated by s 18(1A) I have already noted the seriousness of the principal offence,  
        the fact that it is aggravated by the Form 1 offence 
         and the fact that it represents a gross violation of the safety and security of a young man in his own home. 
        
       
      
    16 Based upon these two passages in the sentencing remarks, and in particular the two parts I have underlined, the applicant submits that her Honour erred by finding that the offence on the Form 1 aggravated the offence on the indictment. The argument is that her Honour used the malicious wounding offence as a factor that aggravated the objective seriousness of the aggravated break and steal offence rather than, in accordance with the approach adopted in the Guideline Judgment, by considering whether the Form 1 offence gave rise to a need to give more weight to personal deterrence and the community’s entitlement to exact retribution when sentencing for the offence on the indictment. It was argued that the Judge had infringed the principle in De Simoni by in effect sentencing the applicant for the more serious offence contained in the first count in the indictment than for the second count in the indictment to which he had pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    17 In support of this ground of appeal the applicant relies upon the judgment of this Court in R v Dowd [2005] NSWCCA 113. That was a case where the judge, in sentencing for a number of offences for which the applicant had been committed for sentence, was asked to take into account a number of similar offences on a Form 1. During the course of her remarks and when referring to the committal charges, the judge, not Judge Latham, stated that the matters on the Form 1 “increased the objective gravity of those offences”. Giles JA, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, found that her Honour had erred in the use made of the Form 1 offences and stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        45 The judge did not otherwise refer to objective gravity, but earlier described the applicant’s crimes as “objectively serious”. In the absence of an acceptable alternative, which I can not discern, I conclude that she meant much the same thing in referring to objective gravity. The judge did not express her regard to the offences in the Form 1 in a manner reflecting the approach described in  
        Attorney General’s Application under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002, 
         and the unfortunately preferable reading of her remarks on sentence is that she impermissibly treated the offences in the Form 1 as increasing the objective seriousness of the principal offence(s). 
         
         
        
       
      
    18 I accept that, on the face of it, those parts of the remarks that I have highlighted suggest that in the present case the Judge also took into account the matter on the Form 1 as aggravating the objective criminality of the offence on the indictment. However, a consideration of the remarks in more detail convinces me that her Honour did not fall into the error committed by the judge in Dowd. During the course of her remarks on sentence Judge Latham made the following statements relating to the objective seriousness of the s 112(2) offence. It should be noted that these passages follow directly after the first passage earlier quoted and contain the second passage set out above. 
     
      
       
        
         
        There are a number of features of the principal offence which warrant its description as objectively very grave. Firstly the offender entered a private home in the late hours of a Sunday night. Secondly, he did so armed with a fence paling which he used as a club to assault the victim from behind, striking the victim to the head. Thirdly, he continued the assault upon the victim by punches to the head and body after the victim had dropped to the floor. 
         
         
        I refer to the features of the offence on indictment independently of the fact that the offender is taken to have known of the victim’s presence in the home and independently of the assault constituting the malicious wounding. 
         It is always possible to think of a worse example of such an offence but for sheer brutality and callous disregard for the wellbeing of another, the offender’s conduct on this night ranks high on the scale of criminality. The offender’s legal representative submits that it is open to me to deal with the offender as a young person, pursuant to the  
        Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 
         rather than according to law. The principles to be applied in determining that issue and those matters to which the Court must have regard under s 18(1A) of the  
        Children (Criminal Procedure) Act  
        are not in dispute. Of the matters mandated by s 18(1A) I have already noted the seriousness of the principal offence, the fact that it is aggravated by the Form 1 offence and the fact that it represents a gross violation of the safety and security of a young man in his own home. 
        
       
       
        
       
      Later in the remarks the Judge stated: 
       
        
         
        ………Taking into account the premeditation displayed by the offender in arming himself prior to entry in circumstances where he knew a person was inside the premises and taking into account the unprovoked assault on the victim, I have come to the view that this offence cannot sensibly be characterised as anything other than an adult crime. 
         
        
       
      
    19 In the first of the two passages quoted above her Honour was attempting to assess the objective seriousness of the particular offence committed by the applicant in order to determine where it fell within the range of offences under s 112(2) and as against the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence. In the first part of the underlined sentence the Judge was indicating that, in order to make that assessment, she was considering those aggravating features “independently of”, or putting to one side, the aggravating feature alleged in the offence and which brought it within the compass of s 112(2). In other words, the judge was contemplating the objective features of the applicant’s offending in determining how serious it was as an instance of an offence of break, enter and steal aggravated by the fact that the applicant was taken to know that there was a person in the premises at the time. 
     
      
    20 In undertaking this assessment, the Judge took into account those matters, of which she makes mention in the first passage quoted in that paragraph: the fact that the applicant entered private premises in the late evening of a Sunday; that he had armed himself before entering the premises; that he used that weapon to assault the victim to the head; and that he continued to assault him as he lay helpless and injured on the floor. Her Honour concluded that, having regard to those facts in aggravation of the offence, it “ranked high on the scale of criminality” although it was not the worst example of the offence. 
     
      
    21 The second part of the underlined sentence indicates that, in undertaking the assessment of the objective seriousness of the particular offence of aggravated break, enter and steal committed by the applicant, the Judge was also considering features of the offence “independently of”, or disregarding the fact that, the applicant inflicted a wounding to the victim. Clearly her Honour was putting that fact to one side because it could not be taken into account in determining the objective seriousness of the s 112(2) offence as it gave rise to a more serious charge. If, as is asserted by the first ground of appeal, her Honour was taking into account the malicious wounding as a factor aggravating the objective seriousness of the s 112(2) offence, I do not understand why the Judge would be putting aside the malicious wounding when considering the facts aggravating the objective seriousness of the s 112(2) offence. Nowhere, when referring to the facts that she considered as aggravating the objective seriousness of the break, enter and steal offence, does the Judge mention the wounding of the victim. 
     
      
    22 In my view her Honour’s reference to the Form 1 offence “aggravating” the break, enter and steal offence was merely a looseness of expression not truly conveying what it appears to suggest on its face. The fact that the Judge used a similar expression later in the same paragraph as that in which she states that she was putting aside the malicious wounding when determining the objective seriousness of the offence committed, confirms my view that her Honour did not mean to convey that she was taking the malicious wounding offence into account as a matter of aggravation of the objective seriousness of the break, enter and steal offence. 
     
      
    23 The Crown sought to answer this ground of appeal by submitting that the Judge should be taken as using the word “aggravating” “to signify the requirement for an enhanced sentence to accommodate the totality of criminality” arising from the principal offence and the Form 1 matter. By relying upon statements of this Court in R v Bavadra (2000) 115 A Crim R 152 at [30]-[31] and R v Barton (2001) 121 A Crim R 185 at [5] and by distinguishing passages in the Guideline Judgment, the Crown argued that her Honour was entitled to reflect in the sentence the added criminality of a matter on a Form 1 where it had “an objective gravity nexus” with the principal offence. In other words, the Crown submitted that there was a difference of approach permissible in a situation, as here, where the matter on the Form 1 was connected with the offence charged and for which sentence was being passed, as distinct from a situation where, as in R v Dowd the matter on the Form 1 had no such nexus. 
     
      
    24 Because I do not believe that the Judge in the present case was intending to, or did, take into account the Form 1 matter in determining the objective seriousness of the s 112(2) offence, it is unnecessary to examine in detail the Crown’s argument or to consider the ramifications of such approach, particularly in the situation as was presented to her Honour. However, I should indicate my firm opinion that there is no different approach to be adopted in taking into account a matter on a Form 1 depending on it’s connection or lack of connection with the principal offence. A proper analysis of the Guideline Judgment does not permit of such a distinction. Statements in Bavadra, which are relied upon by the Crown as supporting this submission, and which suggest that the sentencing judge takes into account the total criminality of the matters on the Form 1, were interpreted by the Chief Justice at [29] in the Guideline Judgment as merely indicating that a sentencing judge “should give due recognition to the gravity of those offences”. But, as the Chief Justice pointed out, in so far as the offender is being punished for his criminal conduct, “the focus…..must be on the ‘principal offence’ alone”. 
     
      
    25 Had I been persuaded that the Judge in the present case had taken into account the malicious wounding offence as a matter aggravating the seriousness of the break, enter and steal offence, I would have concluded that this was an error of principle. However, as her Honour did not approach the matter in that way, the ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    26 The next ground of appeal asserts that her Honour failed to take into account the delay in the sentencing of the applicant and the hardship that would have arisen to the applicant during the course of that delay. 
     
      
    27 There is no doubt that significant delay between the date of the commission of an offence and the date on which sentence is imposed is a matter that should be considered by a sentencing judge and may need to be taken into account in a proper case to reduce the otherwise appropriate sentence R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517. I am prepared to accept that delay, which may have little impact upon the sentencing of an adult offender, may be of more significance when sentencing a juvenile. 
     
      
    28 In the present case her Honour was clearly aware of the delay between the charging of the applicant and his sentencing because she set out in her remarks the history of the proceedings from the date of the applicant’s arrest in December 2003 until he appeared before her. The delay in the present matter was one of 14 months from the date of the commission of the offence to the date of sentence and, of that period, almost 7 months occurred between when he first appeared in the Children’s Court in January 2004 and the date upon which he pleaded guilty in the District Court on 13 August 2004. 
     
      
    29 There was no suggestion in any of the material before her Honour that the delay in the sentencing of the applicant had any significant impact upon him or, in particular, that it in any way disadvantaged him in terms of his prospects of rehabilitation or in any other way. Although I am prepared to accept, without evidence of it, that the applicant was in a state of anxiety and suspense for the period pending the resolution of the matter in the District Court, it does not seem to me that the delay or its consequences was of such significance that the failure to advert to it should be seen as an error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. It is a matter, however, that should be considered together with the other subjective material placed before the Judge when determining the third ground of appeal, asserting that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    30 The applicant was aged 16 and 10 months when the offence was committed and was just two weeks short of his 18th birthday by the time he came to be sentenced. He had a criminal record of some significance commencing on 1 May 2002 when he was before the Children’s Court for offences of possessing house breaking implements and aggravated break, enter and steal. In respect of both of these matters he was placed on a good behaviour bond. In October 2002 the applicant was again before the Children’s Court for offences including common assault, malicious damage and break, enter and steal. He was placed on unconditional probation for 18 months in respect of three of the offences and probation with supervision for the offence of break, enter and steal. 
     
      
    31 On 5 September 2003 he appeared on numerous offences including escape police custody, receiving, stealing a motor vehicle and break, enter and steal. He was once more placed on supervised probation. The applicant was subject to this probation order when he committed the offence for which he was before Judge Latham. 
     
      
    32 The Juvenile Justice report in evidence indicated that the applicant maintained that he had been smoking cannabis at the time of the offence and could not recall anything about it. However, the officer reported that, when the facts were brought to his attention, the applicant appeared to be “genuinely shocked and upset by what had occurred”. 
     
      
    33 The applicant’s parents separated when he was very young and he had no contact with his father until 2002. However, this reunion was unsuccessful and the report indicates that the applicant wished to have no further contact with his father. The applicant resided with his mother during his formative years but left the family home in 2001 after problems developed in his relationship with his mother and stepfather. Thereafter the applicant resided in different types of accommodation including boarding with friends and youth refuges. At one stage he lived with his paternal grandmother and her husband in Kurrajong. They had provided him with support and encouragement both when he resided with them and during his period in custody. 
     
      
    34 The applicant had completed his formal education to year 10 level but had been undertaking a course of horticulture while in custody. He has also completed an occupational health and safety course. Prior to entering custody the applicant was employed on a fishing trawler and the Juvenile Justice report indicated that the position was available to him on his release. 
     
      
    35 The applicant’s responses to supervision since May 2002 was generally unsatisfactory, as he had failed to keep in contact with his supervising officer and because of his re-offending. However, the applicant did not present as a “major management problem” in custody and had completed a number of courses in respect of which certificates were placed before her Honour. 
     
      
    36 The Juvenile Justice officer expressed an opinion that the majority of the applicant’s criminal behaviour stemmed from his use of cannabis and that there was a high risk of re-offending when affected by that drug and alcohol. The applicant acknowledged this state of affairs and apparently was keen to seek treatment when he was released from custody. The officer believed that the applicant was shocked by his behaviour whilst under the influence of cannabis on this occasion and it was for this reason that he had expressed his determination to avoid the drug. He had, however, acknowledged that he would require assistance in this regard. The applicant had also expressed remorse and concern for the victim. 
     
      
    37 There was in evidence a psychological report dated 30 August 2003 prepared by a psychologist who had interviewed the applicant when he was at Exodus House School. The psychologist found that the applicant presented with the following problems at that time: firstly, the fact that he was homeless; secondly his use of illegal drugs; and thirdly that the applicant claimed that he needed help to obtain his school certificate and change his life style. The psychiatrist expressed the view that the applicant was an emotionally disturbed boy who may have a major depressive illness that he medicated with illegal drugs. 
     
      
    38 A more recent psychologist report was prepared on 28 September 2004. That report disclosed that the applicant commenced drinking alcohol at the age of 13 years after he left home but that the applicant was of the view that his use of alcohol was not a problem. The applicant also reported use of cannabis from the age of 13 and believed that he was addicted to the drug. The applicant had used other prohibited drugs from time to time although his drugs of choice were cannabis and amphetamine. He denied any history of hallucination or other psychotic symptoms, although he had experienced paranoid thinking at times when under the influence of drugs. The applicant acknowledged that he tends to aggression when using cannabis. 
     
      
    39 As a result of the psychological tests administered to the applicant, the psychologist summarises the position as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “ [the applicant] is a young man who has limited abilities in verbal intellectual functioning, reading, attentional resources and more complex cognitive tasks. His functioning is likely to be further compromised under periods of stress or distress, including the ingestion of alcohol or illicit substances. This assessment of his cognitive functioning is likely the result of the Attention Deficit syndrome, limited education, and extended substance abuse.” 
         
        
       
      
    40 The psychologist formed the view that the applicant’s prognosis was poor and that he was likely to require a high level of intervention. She stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The applicant] is an impulsive and psychologically immature young man who would benefit from developing skills with respect to self-management. An integral part of this is anger and aggression management. Whilst he has engaged in some intervention in this respect, it is unlikely to have been sufficient given his ongoing volatility in custody. Therefore, it is recommended that [the applicant] engaged in psychological counselling through the Department of Juvenile Justice’s Violent Offender Programming to assist in this regard. Such intervention is available in the community through local Juvenile Justice services.” 
         
        
       
       
      The psychologist concluded her report by expressing the opinion that “there is some hope for [the applicant] but he is likely to require a high level of support to achieve his more prosocial goals.” 
       
      
    41 As against the applicant’s need for rehabilitation, the Judge was confronted with an offence of substantial seriousness, regardless of the malicious wounding offence on the Form 1. Her Honour was clearly correct to regard it as a “gross violation of the safety and security of a young man in his own home”. She was also correct, with respect, in forming the view that, notwithstanding the applicant’s immaturity, the offence “cannot sensibly be characterised as anything other than an adult crime”. In my view that assessment of the offence had to follow from the fact that the applicant armed himself before entering the house and was prepared to use the weapon immediately the victim posed any threat to frustrating his attempts to obtain property of value from the premises. 
     
      
    42 The Judge found that the applicant was entitled to a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty and noted that he had expressed real contrition to the Juvenile Justice officer. The Judge also found special circumstances, observing, with respect correctly, that while general deterrence was necessary in fixing both the head sentence and the non-parole period, the community’s interest lay also in the rehabilitation of the applicant. In my view that observation was appropriately addressed by the relationship of the non-parole period of 3 years to a head sentence of 5 years 6 months. 
     
      
    43 I am not persuaded that there was any patent error disclosed in the sentencing remarks or in the sentence imposed. As I have already indicated, her Honour was confronted with a difficult sentencing exercise not only because of the history of the matter and the way the Crown ultimately proceeded on the charges arising from the applicant’s criminal conduct, but also because of the task in attempting to balance the somewhat competing interests arising from the commission of a very serious crime by a disadvantaged youth. The High Court has recently stressed the importance to be given by an appellate court to the exercise of discretion performed by a sentencing judge where no error is obvious in the sentencing process and where minds might legitimately differ as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 at [27]. I am far from persuaded that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    44 I propose that the application for leave be granted but the appeal dismissed.

      2004/10 REGINA v Prehector Keith TROCIO 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 31 March 2005 the prisoner Prehector Trocio pleaded guilty, when arraigned before me on a charge that on 15 December 2002 at Regents Park in the State of New South Wales he murdered Palatavake Tauveli. On 31 March 2005 the proceedings for the sentencing of the prisoner were adjourned to 26 May, when a sentence hearing was conducted. During the adjournment of the proceedings on sentence a report about the prisoner by a psychologist Suzanne Freeman was obtained by the prisoner’s legal representatives. 
     
      
    2 A joint trial of the prisoner and another man Angelito Almirol on a charge of murdering Mr Tauveli had been fixed to commence on 7 March 2005 but the trial did not proceed, because of the absence overseas of a witness the Crown wished to call. Almirol has maintained a plea of not guilty to the charge of murdering Mr Tauveli and a separate trial of Almirol on that charge has now been fixed to commence on 4 October 2005. 
     
      
    3 In these proceedings for the sentencing of the prisoner a document setting out facts which were agreed was admitted into evidence. The agreed facts were in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
         
        “On 30 December 2002 human remains were located in two separate garbage bags in bushland near Hepburn Road, Linden in the Blue Mountains. Examination of these remains revealed that they were the upper torso and lower torso of a male person. The head and lower legs of the body were not located. The remains were identified by way of fingerprints as that of Palatavake Tauveli, a Tongan male who had been residing at the Angus Yagoona Lodge, Yagoona. Also located on one of the garbage bags was a pharmaceutical sticker. This sticker was in the name of Herbert Davis of 164 John Street, Lidcombe. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On 31 December 2002 further human remains were located in bushland near Weemala Avenue, Faulconbridge. Examination of this scene revealed the head of the victim and a number of other blood stained items, including a bed sheet, a cushion cover and the seat of a chair. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On 4 January 2003 further human remains were located in bushland off the side of The Great Western Highway, Medlow Bath. These were identified as the lower legs of the victim. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Background enquiries on the victim revealed that he was employed as a factory hand at Brancourts Cheese Factory, Yagoona. He had no apparent enemies. Management informed police that two employees from the factory who used to be friends of the victim had ceased employment around the same time as the victim disappeared, that being about 16 December 2002. The names of these two employees were supplied to police as 'Hector' and'Lito'. Enquiries by police identified these persons as the accused Prehector Trocio (Hector) and Angelito Almirol (Lito). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        During investigations police discovered that Almirol resided at 1 Maunder Street, Regents Park. These premises were also occupied by Rodney Davis. Rodney Davis is the son of Herbert Davis, whose pharmaceutical label was discovered on the garbage bag containing the torso of the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        On 5 April 2003, Trocio was spoken to at his home address. He claimed that he knew Almirol, but did not know him well. He stated that he assisted Almirol leave the country urgently as his father was sick in the Philippines. 
        
       
       
        
        On 15 April 2003 a search warrant was executed on the premises at 1 Maunder Street, Regents Park. Scientific examination showed a significant amount of blood throughout the premises. Cushion covers exactly the same as the cushion cover located at the Faulconbridge crime scene were located in a linen press at the premises. A seat with exactly the same cushion as that located at the Faulconbridge crime scene was also located. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Police discovered that Almirol had left Australia suddenly on 19 December 2002, four days after the suspected murder of the victim. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Rodney and Corazon Davis had been living at 1 Maunder Street during December 2002 and Almirol was staying with them as a friend and tenant. Trocio was also a friend of Rodney and Corazon. 
        
       
       
        
        Rodney and Corazon Davis went for a holiday to the Philippines on Sunday 15 December 2002, leaving Almirol in charge of the house. On or about 16 December 2002 Corazon received a telephone call from Trocio and Almirol. Both men told her about killing someone in her house but she can't say with certainty who told her what. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        When they returned from the Philippines Rodney and Corazon noticed that furniture had been moved around the house. They noticed various pieces of carpet had been removed and they could see staining 
          
        on the floorboards. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On 24 April 2003 Trocio was again spoken to by police and taken to Bankstown Police station. Trocio said, ""I know everything, I was there but it wasn't me, it was Lito, but I'm just as bad, I was there and I helped with the body."" He then participated in an ERISP and gave the following version of events [as summarized]: - 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        He was present at 1 Maunder Street, Regents Park on a Sunday in the middle of December 2002. When he arrived at the premises that day Almirol and the victim were present and both persons were intoxicated. Trocio stated that the deceased was drunk as he saw him staggering to the toilet before he was killed. Shortly after Trocio arrived he alleges that Almirol and the victim became involved in a heated argument, he was not aware how the argument started or what it was over. During the argument, the deceased said to Trocio ‘I kill you, I kill you.' At that stage, Trocio feared for his safety. Because of this [argument] Trocio claims he left the house. He alleges that shortly after leaving Almirol rang him on his mobile phone four or five times and asked him to return. Trocio claims he didn't want to go back but decided he should. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Trocio states that as he walked in the backdoor of the house Almirol raised a chair and struck the victim over the head with it. The victim fell to the ground and was unable to regain his feet. Whilst the victim was on the ground he attempted to pull Almirol to the ground with him. Almirol went to the kitchen and obtained a machete type knife. Almirol walked back to the victim, who had still been unable to regain his feet after being struck with the chair, and cut his throat using the machete. The victim looked at Almirol and said, ""It was only a joke, it was only a joke."" Almirol cut the victim's throat a number of times using a sawing motion. While this occurred Trocio stood at the door watching out for someone coming in because Almirol told him to. Almirol then asked him to check the victim for a pulse. Trocio did this and could find no pulse. When Trocio informed Almirol of this he allegedly replied ""So what?"" 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Almirol and Trocio then wrapped the victim in a bed sheet and left him where he was. Trocio claims he went home shortly after wrapping the victim in the sheet. He was at home for a short time when Almirol rang him and asked him to come back. He discussed this with his wife who told him not to, however he decided to return. Upon his return to the premises he assisted Almirol dragging the body into a bedroom at the front of the premises. Almirol and Trocio then slept at the house for a while before Trocio returned home in early hours of the morning. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The next day Almirol and Trocio both attended work. At the completion of work they returned to 1 Maunder Street, Regents Park. Shortly after arriving at the premises they moved the body from the bedroom to the bathroom. Trocio alleges that at this point Almirol used a hacksaw to cut up the victim; he claims that it was too gruesome for him and he kept a watch at the front door. After the body had been cut up they placed the body pieces into garbage bags and carried them out to a car in the garage. Trocio then drove the vehicle with Almirol as a passenger to the Blue Mountains where they disposed of the body parts in the locations they were later discovered. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        When questioned about the reason for cutting the body up Trocio stated that they did this as once the victim was dead they needed to move the body and it was too heavy for them to carry as a whole. He also stated that he knew what he had done was very bad and had wanted to report it to police but he was too weak a character to do so. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Trocio said that he had known Almirol since 1998 and they were close friends. He admitted helping Almirol get his passport fixed so that he could leave the country and he says that he gave Almirol $250 and took him to the airport. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Telephone records confirm that during the afternoon of 15 December 2002, the day on which it appears that the deceased was killed, Almirol telephoned Trocio. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On 8th May 2003, an information was laid and a first instance warrant issued for Almirol for the murder of Tauveli. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On 25th May 2003, a work-mate of both accused, Edgardo Manalaysay, provided police with a statement. He says that he was at 1 Maunder Street on the afternoon of Sunday 15th December 2002 with Trocio, Almirol and Tauveli, (who was often called `Mr T'). He left about 3 or 4 pm and received a call from Almirol at about 10 pm. He says Almirol put Trocio on the phone and Trocio told him, in Tagalog, words that meant they that they had either  
        'killed'  
        or  
        `got rid of'  
        Tauveli. At a later stage Almirol told Manalaysay that he was the one who actually killed the deceased, and that he (Almirol) was the one who actually cut up the body. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On 5th August 2003, the police submitted a report requesting approval for the extradition of Almirol from the Philippines. On 6th May 2004 confirmation was received from the Australian Federal Police confirming that Almirol was in custody in the Philippines. On 21st June 2004 he, having agreed to voluntary extradition, was accompanied by NSW police officers on a flight back to Australia. 
        
       
       
        
        In March, 2005, Jigger Labang and Alexander Macapagal, associates of Trocio's, gave statements (In 2003, Labang had made denials to police that he had gone to the house, stating that Trocio had phoned him but he had declined to go to the house) indicating that they attended 1 Maunder Street on the evening of the murder (presumably not long before it occurred) with a third person, Theo Lo, at the request of Trocio. Trocio claimed that an Islander was threatening to kill him, had pointed his finger at him and threatened him. Trocio wanted to kill the Islander. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Labang told Trocio not to do this because he had a wife and a child but Trocio replied that he didn't care. Labang and Lo went inside with Trocio when they arrived and Macapagal stayed outside near the car. They say that they believed there was a party on but when they went inside they saw a big Islander guy who was lying on the floor being struck with a chair wielded by Almirol. Almirol hit the islander guy with the chair 3 or 4 times. The Islander guy was putting his hands up in front of his face. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In the kitchen Trocio kept looking in the kitchen drawers for something. Labang asked him what he was doing and Trocio just ignored him. Labang states that at that time Trocio seemed to be sobering up. He seemed stressed and angry. Theo Lo took the chair from Almirol. Labang grabbed Trocio and tried to take him away but Almirol told them to leave and that they didn't need him. When they left the victim was lying on the floor and moaning. He saw no blood. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        As they left Trocio told them not to tell anyone. Then Almirol told them the same but threatened to involve them if they told anyone. 
        
       
       
        
        A post mortem examination of the deceased was performed by Dr Neil Langlois, a forensic pathologist. He concluded that the dismemberment of the deceased had occurred after death 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        On 2 March 2005 the accused offered to plead guilty to murder as a principal in the second degree, and to give evidence for the Crown against Almirol. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused was born on 8 January 1973 and so is 32 years old. He is a married man with a daughter, Precious, who is aged 4. He has no prior criminal convictions. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The accused Trocio has been in custody for this matter only since 24 April 2003.” 
        
       
      
    4 The way in which many parts of the agreed facts are expressed raised the question of whether, when it is stated that the prisoner or some other person said or stated or claimed or gave a version that something had happened or was the case, I should proceed on the basis that that thing had in fact happened or was in fact the case. I raised this question with counsel in the proceedings on sentence and was asked to proceed, in general, on such a basis. For example, I should accept, as a statement of what in fact happened, the summary of the version of events the prisoner gave to police on 24 April 2003, which is set out in the agreed facts. However, it was submitted by one or other of the Crown prosecutor or counsel for the prisoner that there were occasional assertions set out in the agreed facts which I should not accept as stating the true facts, for example, the claim made by the prisoner to police on 5 April 2003 that he did not know Almirol well and that the reason why he had assisted Almirol to leave Australia and go to the Philippines was that Almirol’s father was sick in the Philippines. Although the position is not entirely satisfactory, I have proceeded, in general, on the basis on which counsel asked me to proceed and, in particular, I have accepted as a statement of what in fact happened, the summary of the version of events given by the prisoner to police on 24 April 2003. 
     
      
    5 The prisoner pleaded guilty to the charge of murdering Mr Tauveli as being a principal in the second degree, Almirol being the principal in the first degree. By pleading guilty as being a principal in the second degree to the murder of Mr Tauveli, the prisoner necessarily admitted all the elements of the offence of being a principal in the second degree in a crime of murder. The elements of this offence are:- 
     
      
       
      1. The principal in the first degree committed the crime of murder. 
       
       
      2. The prisoner was present at the time the principal in the first degree committed the crime of murder. 
       
       
      3. The prisoner knew all the facts which the Crown would have to establish to show that the principal in the first degree was guilty of murder. 
       
       
      4. Having that knowledge, the prisoner intentionally assisted or encouraged the principal in the first degree to commit the murder.

    6 In the present case, on the agreed facts, the only way in which the prisoner assisted or encouraged Almirol to murder Mr Tauveli was in standing at the door watching for anyone coming, that is in acting as a lookout, while Almirol cut Mr Tauveli’s throat a number of times with the machete. The prisoner acted as a lookout, because Almirol had told him to do so. 
     
      
    7 However, although the prisoner’s only participation in the murdering of Mr Tauveli was to act as a lookout while Almirol cut the victim’s throat, the prisoner, after the murder was committed, did a number of acts which, I am satisfied to the requisite standard, were done by him with the intention of concealing the commission of the crime of murder and enabling him and Almirol to avoid detection and prosecution. In the proceedings on sentence counsel for the prisoner accepted that these further acts should properly be taken into account in sentencing the prisoner for the murder of Mr Tauveli. 
     
      
    8 These further acts included:- on the Sunday, joining Almirol in wrapping the body in a sheet and dragging the body into a bedroom; on the Monday, joining Almirol in moving the body from the bedroom to a bathroom, keeping watch while Almirol dismembered the victim’s body with a hacksaw, joining Almirol in placing the parts of the body in garbage bags and carrying the bags to a vehicle, driving the vehicle with Almirol and the garbage bags to the Blue Mountains and jointly with Almirol disposing of the parts of the body at three different locations. 
     
      
    9 I do not accept that the victim’s body was dismembered, merely because the body was too heavy for the prisoner and Almirol to carry. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at least one reason for the dismembering of the body was to hinder any investigation of the murder of Mr Tauveli. If the reason for dismembering the body had merely been that the body was too heavy for Almirol and the prisoner to carry, there would have been no need to dispose of the various parts of the body at widely separated locations. 
     
      
    10 The further acts by the prisoner also included his acts in assisting Almirol to leave Australia, which, I am satisfied to the requisite degree, were done by the prisoner with the intention of assisting Almirol to avoid prosecution. 
     
      
    11 The prisoner did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence and the only evidence tendered on his behalf was a report by Suzanne Freeman psychologist. The information before me about the prisoner is almost entirely limited to what is set out in Ms Freeman’s report. 
     
      
    12 The prisoner was born in the Philippines on 8 January 1973. Part of Ms Freeman’s report is as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As the first male grandchild in his Filipino family, Prehector was expected to be responsible, competent and successful. During his first year of high school, he failed to achieve academically, whilst his brother, less than a year younger, performed with outstanding success. Prehector then began socializing with a peer group involved in drinking and drug taking. After his brother’s death from lung cancer when Prehector was 18, he increased his substance abuse as a means of lessening his grief, and as a means of sidestepping the perceived expectations of his family.” 
        
       
      
    13 The prisoner completed high school in the Philippines and commenced but did not complete a university course. 
     
      
    14 In 1996 the prisoner came to Australia. He told Ms Freeman that he had made a conscious decision to change his life. He ceased taking drugs and lessened his consumption of alcohol. He completed a six months TAFE course in book keeping. In Australia he obtained work as a labourer, as a car detailer and as a process worker. 
     
      
    15 Part of Ms Freeman’s report is as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Personality testing indicates Prehector is eccentric, disorganized, anxious and apprehensive. He feels inadequate, insecure, has low self-esteem, and he feels incapable of functioning independently of others. He will identify with stronger people, and define himself in terms of them. He wants others to care for him, dislikes conflicts, and is often submissive, but at times feels resentful, angry and pessimistic. He can be perceived by others as loyal, passive, timid and gullible. Until he came to Australia, Prehector expected to be directed by his father as to where he would live, even as he continued to resist his father’s expectations with his drug usage. He has few strategies to reduce tensions and stress, and he is currently suffering from symptoms of anxiety”. 
        
       
      
    16 I accept the parts of Ms Freeman’s report which I have quoted or referred to. 
     
      
    17 In 1998 the prisoner met a young woman, whom he married in 2000. They have a child now aged four. The prisoner’s wife is a committed evangelical Christian and after their marriage the prisoner attended church every week with his wife. The prisoner’s wife attended Court at the sentence hearing. 
     
      
    18 The prisoner has not previously been convicted of any criminal offence. 
     
      
    19 The prisoner was arrested on 24 April 2003 and has remained in custody ever since. While he has been in custody, his wife, who is the manager of a Starbucks outlet in the city, has visited him twice weekly and he has also been visited by other members of his church. While in custody the prisoner has attended weekly church services. In more than two years in custody he has not committed any prison offence. 
     
      
    20 In the proceedings on sentence the Court received a combined victim impact statement from some relatives of Mr Tauveli, expressing their pain and distress at the death of Mr Tauveli.  
     
      
    21 In sentencing the prisoner I take into account the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, including s 3A and s 21A. 
     
      
    22 The objective facts of the offence are stated in, or can be ascertained from, the agreed facts. The offence of murder was a serious offence, involving the cutting of the victim’s throat a number of times with a machete. However, I accept that the commission of the offence was unplanned and unpremeditated on the part of both Almirol and the prisoner. I also accept that the victim, Almirol and the prisoner were all affected by the consumption of alcohol. According to the agreed facts, Jigger Labang told police that on the Sunday the prisoner “wanted to kill the Islander” and I find that the prisoner formed such a desire, although, by himself, he would not have done anything to fulfil that desire. 
     
      
    23 The prisoner’s participation in the killing of the victim was limited to acting as a lookout, while Almirol as the principal in the first degree cut the victim’s throat a number of times with the machete. The prisoner acted as a lookout, because he had been told to do so by Almirol. While he was acting as a lookout, the prisoner realised that Almirol in cutting the victim’s throat with the machete had the intention of killing the victim and not merely the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm.  
     
      
    24 After the killing of the victim the prisoner participated in the further acts of moving the body of the victim within the house, keeping watch while Almirol cut up the victim’s body and joining Almirol in disposing of the parts of the victim’s body. 
     
      
    25 I accept submissions made by counsel for the prisoner that the victim was already dead when his body was dismembered, that the prisoner did not himself take part in the actual dismembering of the victim’s body and that the dismembering of the body was not undertaken out of any macabre motive. I have, however, found that the dismembering of the body was done at least partly in an endeavour to hinder any police investigation. 
     
      
    26 I accept that there is no universal principle that the culpability of a principal in the second degree should be regarded as less than the culpability of a principal in the first degree. However, in the present case, on the agreed facts, I would regard the criminality of the prisoner as significantly less than the criminality of Almirol as the principal in the first degree. 
     
      
    27 The prisoner made his plea of guilty on 31 March 2005. This plea of guilty was made after a joint trial of the prisoner and Almirol had been fixed to commence. However, in assessing the timing of the plea of guilty, it is necessary to take into account some earlier events in the criminal proceedings against the prisoner. 
     
      
    28 At an arraignment on 7 May 2004 the prisoner pleaded not guilty to a charge of murdering Mr Tauveli but pleaded guilty to a charge of being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Mr Tauveli by Almirol. The Crown was not prepared to accept the plea of guilty to the charge of being an accessory and a date for a trial of the prisoner on the charge of murder was fixed for 22 November 2004. It was estimated that the trial would last four weeks.  
     
      
    29 On 13 August 2004, Almirol having been extradited from the Philippines, the trial date of 22 November 2004 was vacated and a new trial date of 7 March 2005 was fixed, in the expectation that the trial which would commence then would be a joint trial of the prisoner and Almirol. Subsequently, Almirol was committed for trial and his trial fixed for 7 March 2005. 
     
      
    30 On 2 March 2005 the prisoner offered to plead guilty to a charge of murder as being a principal in the second degree and the Crown accepted this offer. 
     
      
    31 As was submitted by counsel for the prisoner, the agreed facts on which I am sentencing the prisoner are largely based on admissions made by him in the interview by police conducted as long ago as 24 April 2003. 
     
      
    32 I take the prisoner’s plea of guilty into account in sentencing the prisoner and have decided that I should allow a discount of between 15 percent and 20 percent for its utilitarian value. 
     
      
    33 I find that the prisoner has shown contrition for his offence. It is true that the prisoner did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence and, hence, there is no direct evidence from him of his contrition. However, he pleaded guilty to the charge; according to the agreed facts, he told police on 24 April 2003 that he was “just as bad” as Almirol and on that day he made extensive admissions to the police; and Ms Freeman recorded in her report that the prisoner had expressed remorse to her. 
     
      
    34 The question arises of what, if any, discount should be allowed in the sentencing of the prisoner for any assistance provided or to be provided or offered to be provided by him. 
     
      
    35 The prisoner has not so far provided any assistance, except to the extent of admitting his own guilt and giving an account of events which implicated Almirol. 
     
      
    36 The prisoner has offered to give evidence at Almirol’s trial and for that purpose, has offered to make a statement to police but, so far, only by way of an induced statement. The Crown has declined this offer from the prisoner to make an induced statement. What was described in the proceedings on sentence as an impasse or stalemate has developed with regard to the prisoner making a statement. The prisoner has not given any undertaking to assist law enforcement authorities in the prosecution of Almirol.  
     
      
    37 I was informed by the Crown prosecutor that the Crown’s current view is that it has sufficient other evidence to establish that Almirol is guilty of murdering Mr Tauveli, without the Crown needing to call the prisoner as a witness. I have only very limited information about what other evidence which might establish Almirol’s guilt is available to the Crown. 
     
      
    38 Counsel for the prisoner contended that the Crown will virtually be forced to call the prisoner as a witness at Almirol’s trial, because otherwise Almirol might be able to successfully blame the killing on the prisoner. 
     
      
    39 In the proceedings on sentence the Crown conceded that some discount should be made for the prisoner’s willingness to give evidence at the trial of Almirol. In the circumstances, it is difficult to make any assessment of many of the factors in s 23(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I have concluded that I should allow a small discount on account of assistance already provided and on account of the prisoner’s willingness to provide assistance in the prosecution of Almirol. 
     
      
    40 I accept that the prisoner has no previous criminal history, that he has committed no prison offence during more than two years in custody, that he is unlikely to re-offend and that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    41 As the offence was committed prior to 1 February 2003 I am to apply the repealed, and not the present, s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    42 I consider that I should find special circumstances in the prisoner not having any previous criminal history, in the prisoner’s good prospects of rehabilitation and in the prisoner’s need for a larger than usual period of supervised liberty in which to address residual problems from drug and alcohol abuse referred to in Ms Freeman’s report. 
     
      
    43 The sentence will commence from 24 April 2003, the date the prisoner went into custody. 
     
      
    44 Prehector Keith Trocio, I sentence you to imprisonment for twelve years, commencing on 24 April 2003 and expiring on 23 April 2015. I set a non-parole period of eight years, commencing on 24 April 2003 and expiring on 23 April 2011. The earliest date on which you will be eligible to be released on parole will be 23 April 2011.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN AJA: On Friday, 10 June 2005 the Court made orders in this matter upholding the appeal. I now publish my reasons for joining in the Court's orders. 
     
      
    2 The appellant was convicted of one count of sexual intercourse with the complainant, LNH, without her consent knowing that she was not consenting contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for the offence is a term of imprisonment for 14 years. 
     
      
    3 The appellant who pleaded not guilty gave evidence at the trial. Following his conviction he was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of three years and six months with a non-parole period of two years. 
     
      
    4 There are two grounds of appeal. The first ground is that the verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The second ground is that the trial judge erred when directing the jury with respect to lies. 
     
      
       
      Background facts 
       
      
    5 The appellant was employed as a carer for disabled people at premises at Winston Hills. On the day of the alleged offence, 15 November 2002, the complainant was employed in a similar capacity. Both the appellant and complainant were employed through an agency named Edmen Employment Agency. 
     
      
    6 The complainant gave evidence that the first occasion on which she worked with the agency was 25 October 2002 when she worked at premises at Baulkham Hills. The disabled people, referred to as ""clients"", of those premises suffered from cerebral palsy. On that day the appellant was also present at the house. One of their joint duties was to take the clients to Rooty Hill RSL Club to play poker machines and have lunch. On that occasion the appellant and the complainant had some personal conversation and the appellant told the complainant about himself. 
     
      
    7 A couple of weeks later the complainant and the appellant again worked on the same shift. On this occasion the appellant asked the complainant if she would join him for lunch. The complainant initially said ""yes"" but changed her mind and declined the invitation saying to the appellant that ""I've got other things to do."" After they had completed the shift on that day the appellant drove the complainant a distance to a bus stop where she caught a bus home. 
     
      
    8 On the day of the alleged offence, the complainant was rostered to work from 4 pm to 10 pm at Winston Hills House. She arrived at 3.40 pm when another worker and the appellant were present. There were four clients in the house each of whom had cerebral palsy and could not speak or walk. 
     
      
    9 The house was comprised of five bedrooms, a lounge room and a kitchen. One of the bedrooms was the office and staff bedroom which was used by a staff member who was rostered for night duty which required that person to sleep on the premises.  
     
      
    10 The complainant commenced her duties which included showering the clients and putting them to bed. She was wearing a grey shirt, jeans (described as stretch jeans) and joggers. At about 7.30 pm the appellant called the complainant into the kitchen and told her that she should complete the housework required of her before talking to the clients. The complainant apparently thanked the appellant for the advice and remarked that she was only new to the job. 
     
      
    11 Just before 10 pm the complainant received a phone call from her boss, Frank Barila from the Edmen Employment Agency. He told her that her shift the following day had changed from a 5.30 pm start to a 7.30 am start. After she hung up she spoke to the appellant and told him about the change of shift. The appellant then suggested that the complainant should stay the night at the house. The complainant said ""no"" she had a morning shift and her next shift was a sleep over and she had to get home to gather things. The appellant said ""it's okay, just sleep, spend the night"" and the complainant said ""no"" again. 
     
      
    12 Mr Barila rang a second time and informed the complainant that her shift for the following day was to change again and she was to commence work in the afternoon. The complainant told the appellant of this change in her roster which, of course, meant she did not have to commence work the following morning. The appellant then suggested that the complainant should stay back that evening which she agreed to do saying ""Yes that I'd stay back, but only for a little while"". 
     
      
       
      The Crown evidence 
       
      
    13 The complainant gave evidence that having decided to stay back she made a cup of tea and sat herself on the couch in the lounge room. The appellant sat on the other end of the couch and they were separated by some cushions. The complainant gave evidence that the appellant then asked her questions including whether or not she had a boyfriend. She replied to that question: 
     
      
       
        
        ""No, I just broke up with my fiancée a couple of months ago."" 
        
       
      
    14 She was then asked: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Did he say anything further? 
         
        A. Yeah, he said, ""Why am I still single, am I scared of guys or something."" 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you say? 
         
        A. I said ""No, I'm happy being single."" 
        
       
      
    15 The complainant then said that the appellant moved the cushions which separated them on the couch and gave the following account of the incident: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. After he did that did he do anything else? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did he do? 
         
        A. He reached across and grabbed me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he say anything at that time? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How did he grab you? 
         
        A. He grabbed the top of my arms. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say the top of your arms, can you just indicate what you mean by that? 
         
        A. There. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You have indicated your right arm? 
         
        A. Right, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Near the shoulder? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You have indicated he grabbed the top part of your arm, what did he do? 
         
        A. He then slung me onto him facing him, and then he started kissing me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you say anything? 
         
        A. Yeah I told him to stop and that I wasn't like that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did he do when you told him to stop and that you weren't like that? 
         
        A. He didn't do anything, he kept on going. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did you say anything further to him? 
         
        A. I kept on saying that I wasn't like that at all, and to stop. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. While he was kissing you did he have his hands on you? 
         
        A. Yeah he was holding me like a bear hug. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where were your legs at that point in time? 
         
        A. I can't recall. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How did he pick you up? 
         
        A. He reached and grabbed me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How? 
         
        A. Reached over and grabbed me towards him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. By what part of your body, what part of the body did he grab? 
         
        A. My upper body. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you try and do anything? 
         
        A. I tried to get away, but I couldn't move. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why couldn't you move? 
         
        A. Because he was holding me and I was scared. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did Mr Habib then do? 
         
        A. He reached down my top and started feeling my breasts. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was there anything said at that point in time? 
         
        A. He did say at some stage that I looked beautiful, but that was it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened next? 
         
        A. He pulled my jeans down and his tracksuit pants and he put his penis in my vagina and started moving. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were you wearing underwear? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he do anything with respect to your underwear? 
         
        A. He pulled it down. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you say anything at that point in time? 
         
        A. I had kept on saying 'stop' during the whole thing, but he didn't, wasn't saying anything. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And how did you feel when he grabbed you and put you on his lap? 
         
        A. I was very scared. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you scream for help? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why not? 
         
        A. Because I was scared and didn't know what to do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you try to get off Mr Habib? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And how did you do that? 
         
        A. I tried to move away but he just kept holding me tighter. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. For how long did Mr Habib have his penis in your vagina? 
         
        A. About 10 or 15 minutes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he ejaculate? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. After he ejaculated what did you do? 
         
        A. I got off him and I went to the office and grabbed my stuff. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you returned from the office did he say anything to you? 
         
        A. He said something about getting a taxi home, and I said no, that I wanted to walk home. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was there any other conversation with him? 
         
        A. I can't remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you want Mr Habib to penetrate your vagina? 
         
        A. No, I was at work, I was there to do my job. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was there any other conversation with Mr Habib before you left the premises? 
         
        A. I can't recall."" 
        
       
      
    16 In her evidence the complainant indicated that she left the premises at about 10.30 pm and walked home. As she was walking she called her friend Heather and left a message. Heather rang her back and they had a conversation during which the complainant gave evidence that she ""told her that an incident had happened at work and that I didn't know what to do"". 
     
      
    17 The complainant gave evidence that Heather ""asked me what had happened and I said that the guy I worked with started to crack onto me and she said ""What happened?"", I said that it went too far, and she said, ""So he had sex with you"". I said ""Yes, but I said to her that I kept on saying no, that I didn't want it to happen."" 
     
      
    18 The complainant also said that her friend told her ""I had to tell the police or my employer about what had happened"". She said that she replied to her friend saying that she was ""scared about losing my job."" She also said that she said to her friend: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I just said that I was scared and I didn't want to cause any trouble and that I felt guilty about what had happened and scared."" 
        
       
      
    19 After she arrived home the complainant called her mother and had a short conversation. She then called another friend Sharon and said in evidence that she told her: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I said that something had happened at work, and then I kind of thought it was a bad idea that I called her, so I said, 'It doesn't matter.' And she said, 'Well you've called me now, you might as well tell me, you know what happened.' So I told her that, about what had happened and about -- 
         
        … 
         
        I said that, I said that the guy I was working with had raped me."" 
        
       
      
    20 Shortly after that conversation the complainant called her friend Sherry. She gave evidence that she said to Sherry: 
     
      
       
        
        ""That something had happened at work, and I said that the, I didn't want to talk about it, and she said that she was going to come over and pick me up."" 
        
       
      
    21 Apparently Sherry did as she indicated and collected the complainant and took her back to her house where they watched a video and the complainant fell asleep. 
     
      
    22 The next morning when she woke, the complainant had a conversation with Sherry in which she indicated that she did not want to tell her boss what had happened because ""I didn't want to lose my job"". 
     
      
    23 Sherry apparently persuaded the complainant to call her boss which she did and indicated that she did not want to work with the appellant anymore. Mr Barila asked her why not and she indicated that ""something happened last night'. She gave evidence that she did not want to tell him what it was because she was ""really sacred of losing my job and what was going to happen"". That conversation was terminated but Mr Barila rang back and had a further conversation in which the complainant indicated that she was prepared to tell a female who worked for the agency what had happened. 
     
      
    24 After some time the complainant received a call from Angela from the Edmen Employment Agency. She had a conversation with her about what had happened the previous night. Angela called her back some time later and told her that Mr Barila had contacted the appellant who had denied the incident. Later that day the complainant called the Castle Hill Police Station and at about 5 pm she was taken by the police to Westmead Hospital where she was examined by Dr Smits. 
     
      
    25 Dr Smits gave evidence at the trial in which he confirmed that upon examination he notice a small longitudinal tear in the posterior fourchette. He was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Such a tear is indicative as much of voluntary as involuntary sex, isn't that correct? 
         
        A. No, it's not as much, about one-third of sexual assault cases have this kind of injury, and in the consensual intercourse it's about one-tenth. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So what you're saying is that you can't say whether this tear arose out of a consensual or a non-consensual act, isn't that right? 
         
        A. That's correct."" 
        
       
       
      Cross examination of the complainant 
       
      
    26 During the course of the cross examination of the complainant a number of matters were raised, some of which have significance in this appeal. 
     
      
    27 As I have related the appellant offered to pay for the complainant to take a taxi home. The complainant declined the offer saying that she would prefer to walk. However, out of a concern for her safety the appellant offered to give the complainant his mobile phone number so that she could ring him and tell him she had arrived home safely. The complaint accepted the mobile phone number and locked it into the directory of her own phone. However, she did not phone the appellant later that evening. She was asked about this event: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. After the incident with Mr Habib you've given evidence that Mr Habib gave you his phone number? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that you put it into your memory in your mobile phone? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you do that? 
         
        A. Because I thought that was the only way I'd get out of there - the house. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you ever call him? 
         
        A. No."" 
        
       
      
    28 She was asked by counsel to repeat her account of the incident. The following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. So you say that you found your way onto this sofa, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were sitting down on it next to Mr Habib? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I will keep the conversation aside for a moment, but you say that he grabbed you and put you on top of his lap, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And your legs were straddling his legs, weren't they? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. They must have been in that position, isn't that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You know what straddle means, don't you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What? 
         
        A. Over either side. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes, his legs were in the middle and your legs one each on either side of both his legs, correct? 
         
        A. Correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that's your memory of how it was? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And when Mr Crown was asking you that same questions, about where your legs were, earlier on you said you couldn't remember. Do you remember telling the jury that? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you now remember, do you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you say that this person puts you on top of him, that he undoes your jeans, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what happens with your jeans and underpants? 
         
        A. They went to my knees. Down. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well you've actually said on the previous occasion between your knees and your groin, isn't that right? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So which one is it, between your knees and your groin or your knees? 
         
        A. My knees and my groin. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And would you agree that by having the jeans still on but between your knees and your groin that that would restrict the amount by which you could open your legs? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No? Think about it for a moment, there you are on top of this person with both your legs straddling his legs, correct? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So in order to even straddle his legs you would have to open your legs, isn't that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So there's your jeans and your underpants still on, correct? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Mr Habib's legs are between yours, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you say that Mr Habib was able, in that position, to have sexual intercourse with you, do you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How was he able to do that? 
         
        A. Because my pants were down far enough. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Which pants? 
         
        A. My jeans were down far enough and my underpants. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well you say that, Ma'am, but just think about it. There you are, your jeans and underpants are between your groin and your knees, right. On your thighs. Correct? 
         
        A. A bit further down than that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. A bit further down. How much further down would you like to go? 
         
        A. About that much. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. About that much. Would you - your Honour I would ask the witness if she could actually go out of the witness box so we could have a look where she actually says, in relation to her own legs, the level of the underpants and the jeans were. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Could you stand up and do it or do you have to step down? 
        
       
       
        
        GELBERT: I can't see that. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You will have to come forward a bit so everybody can see, Ma'am. 
        
       
       
        
        GELBERT: At a point midway between the knees and the groin area. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So don't you agree that in order for Mr Habib to get access to have sexual intercourse in the way in which you've described, don't you agree that having the jeans and the underpants there would create an obstruction to him being able to perform that? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No? Well there must have been some obstruction, Ma'am, wasn't there? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So what was he wearing? 
         
        A. Tracksuit pants. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And so you say that he was just sitting as if in a normal position on the couch is that right? 
         
        A. Yeah a bit forward on the couch though. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. A bit forward. Is that something you've recently remembered also? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I take you to a position at page 32, line 3 of evidence that you gave at the last trial do you understand? These are questions that Mr Crown was asking you, all right. I will take you back to page 31, line 48. Question 'And how would you describe his position? Was he lying down or seated or was he somewhere in between?' Answer, 'Seated'. Question, 'And were you still on the lounge?' Answer, 'yes'. Question 'And where was his back relative to the normal back part of the lounge where you would normally expect our back to be in contact with the lounge, where was he in relation to such a position?' Answer, 'Yeah, sort of sitting up like, yeah, sitting up'. Question, 'So sitting up. What, generally in a position you would expect someone to sit on the lounge, is that what you're saying?' Then the transcript shows that you didn't reply verbally. Then the question was asked again, 'you're going to have to say yes rather than nod' and you answered 'yes'. Do you remember those kinds of questions and answers being asked of you and answered? 
         
        A. I can't remember. 
        
       
       
        
        GELBERT: I'd ask the Crown to concede that I just faithfully read from the transcript of 8 December 2003. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: The Crown concedes that your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        GELBERT: Q. When Mr Crown was asking you questions last year you said that he was sitting in a normal position, now you're telling the jury that he was sitting forward is that right? 
         
        A. I consider that to be a normal position. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So for you sitting forward is normal? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Because you when you answered my question earlier on you were, you seemed to be making a distinction between the forward position that you gave the answer about and the normal position that one would sit in a chair isn't that right? Weren't you making that distinction to the jury? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So when you say he was sitting a bit forward you mean he was sitting normally? 
         
        A. Yes."" 
        
       
      
    29 Of significance in this evidence is the complainant's assertion that she was grabbed by the appellant and put on top of his lap. However, there was no bruising on her arms, legs or back when she was examined at the hospital the following day. In re-examination she said that she noticed bruising on her back and shoulders at some time later. The complainant also said that she did not try to call out to anyone although she did tell the appellant to stop. Although her arms must have been free she did not try to scratch or hit the appellant in any way or push him from her. 
     
      
    30 It is important to appreciate that the complainant confirmed that she was positioned straddling the appellant who was sitting, and, in that position her jeans and underpants were lowered by the appellant to a position midway between her groin area and her knees. There is no suggestion that having been grabbed by the appellant and positioned on his lap she again stood up. In order to straddle the appellant her legs must have been separated by some distance. 
     
      
    31 When the appellant was tried for this offence on an earlier occasion the complainant apparently gave evidence that the appellant had swung her across to him in a bear hug with both arms around her. The complainant accepted that this was different to the account she gave in the current trial where she said that the appellant had held her by each arm and lifted her onto his lap. When the discrepancies were pointed out to her she said that her account in the earlier trial was correct and maintained she meant the same thing. 
     
      
    32 The complainant said that from the time the appellant inserted his penis until he ejaculated was 10 to 15 minutes. When asked whether this was ""quite a long time …in that situation"" she answered ""no."" Although if the appellant forced himself upon the complainant her recollection of the time is likely to be inexact and exaggerated it would seem reasonable to conclude that her recollection was of intercourse for a relatively lengthy period. 
     
      
    33 It was put to the complainant by the appellant's counsel that given the position she was in it would have been impossible for her jeans to be lowered to a point where intercourse could occur. The following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. I just want to now focus on this point of time where you say that you are straddling Mr Habib and that you're very close together, is that right, while you were on his lap straddling him? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And he, I think you have said to the jury that he had his arms, at least at any time he had one hand either on your shoulders, behind your shoulders or behind your back, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Tell me, how was it that he came to be able to move your jeans down midway between your knees and groin -- 
         
        A. He was -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. -- in that position? 
         
        A. -- still holding me with one arm and used the other arm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So with one arm he's holding you. Do you remember which arm it was? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. One arm he's holding you. And what's he doing with the other arm? 
         
        A. He took my jeans down. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So did you stand up or in some way allow easier access for that to happen? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were seated at the time, is that right? 
         
        A. No, I was on top of him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were seated on top of his laps (sic), weren't you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you agree that your jeans had a crutch? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So if you're seated on top of his laps and the crutch area is the apex area as we know, how were the jeans able to move when your bottom stayed in the same position on his laps? 
         
        A. (no verbal reply) 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you understand that question? 
         
        A. Not quite. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. All right. I'll try and make it a bit easier. Do you agree that by sitting on his lap that the jeans which you were sitting on, particularly this apex area that I'm pointing to, they wouldn't be able to go further than his laps. Do you understand what I'm saying? They wouldn't be able to move because the laps would stop them, because your jeans, one leg is on one side and one leg is on the other side of his laps. Do you understand what I'm saying? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. If I could have the jeans please. Thank you. I'll try and show you another way. These are your jeans, right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So imagine just for the purpose of this line of questioning that this book that I've got in my hand is his laps. I know it's not to scale but, for the purpose of this demonstration, there you are straddling that area, right? 
         
        A. I was around the other way. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. All right. This way, right? Is that right? Now how were the jeans able to move down your legs when this area, that apex area, it just wouldn't move past that book which is his laps, would it? Do you see what I'm saying? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well could you please tell the jury how those jeans were able to go down further when they were being, when his laps were there? Would you please tell the jury how it happened? 
         
        A. I think my knees were on the lounge -- 
         
         
        Q. So your knees were-- 
         
        A. --so-- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. -- on the lounge, all right. But the laps are still there, the books still there. How does he get it, these jeans down between your knees and your groin? 
         
        A. He did. I'm not sure how, but he did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he use one hand only to undo your jeans? 
         
        A. I can't remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he use one hand or both hands to bring the jeans down to a position between your knees and groin. 
         
        A. One. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. One hand. Which hand was that? Do you remember? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Because the other hand was still around your body in this bear hug that you've talked about, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you see him adjusting his clothing in any way? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well what did you see him doing? 
         
        A. He lifted his bottom off the chair and pulled his track pants down a bit. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He lifted his bottom off, up off the chair, is that right? Okay. And did he pull down both his jeans - his track suit and underwear? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where down to? 
         
        A. I'm not sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was it light in the room where you were, where this was happening? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Could you see his penis, for instance, as it, as this -- 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. --was happening? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No. And you say that as soon as he ejaculated there was no more bear hug, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I'm sorry, I may have asked the question the wrong way to get a confusing answer. Did you tell us was, after he ejaculated was there any more physical pressure placed on you on your version? 
         
        A. For a little while. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Beg your pardon? 
         
        A. For a little while. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So he kept hold of you for a little while-- 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. --is that right? And then what? 
         
        A. And then he let go. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And then you were able to put your clothes on, is that right? 
         
        A. Pull my pants back up."" 
        
       
      
    34 The complainant gave evidence when cross-examined that after she left the house she felt guilty. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I just felt - I don't know. I was feeling a lot of things. I was scared about losing my job, I didn't want it to happen --"" 
        
       
      
    35 When cross-examined as to what she was feeling guilty about she said; 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. I guess I was upset about what had happened. 
         
        Q. When we feel guilty as humans we feel that we have done something wrong, that's what feeling guilty is about? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Well, I'm a Christian and I don’t believe in doing anything like that before I get married. I guess I felt guilty to God about what had just happened. 
         
        Q. You don’t-- 
         
        A. Even -- 
         
         
        Q. Just a moment. If I can just get this straight. You're a Christian and you didn't want anything like that to happen before you were married? 
         
        A. That's correct 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Anything like what to happen before you were married? 
         
        A. Sleeping around, having sex before I was married."" 
        
       
       
      The evidence of the appellant 
       
      
    36 On the day after the event the appellant was telephoned by Mr Barila. When asked what had happened the appellant denied any activity of a sexual nature. Mr Barila apparently said to him: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(the complainant) made some allegations against you and they were of a sexual nature. Did you at any time sit with or touch (the complainant)?"" 
        
       
      
    37 The appellant replied: 
     
      
       
        
        ""No, what is she saying, what's going on?"" 
        
       
      
    38 The appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Nothing happened Frank. Winston Hills is a big house anyway, they would have heard me if I'd done something."" 
        
       
      
    39 After the complainant had been to the police the appellant was advised of the allegation and placed under arrest. When interviewed the appellant declined to comment upon the allegations but indicated he would make a typed statement. That statement was prepared in the form of an affidavit which was sworn on 19 November 2002 and tendered in evidence. 
     
      
    40 In the affidavit the appellant said that the complaint had sat on the lounge with him after her shift had finished. They were making small talk and she put her head on his chest. The appellant alleges that the complainant said to him ""I have not been in relationship for two years. I have not been kissed for two years."" The appellant says the complainant lifted her head up and they started to kiss and the complainant then stood up and climbed on the appellant straddling his legs facing towards him. The appellant said that the complainant pulled down the front of his track suit pants and exposed his penis. She then took his hand and placed it on her vagina which was very wet. The appellant says that this was the first time he realised that the complainant had removed her jeans. He says he took his hand away and the complainant began to rock backwards and forwards on his penis. As soon as she began to do this he ejaculated. He said in the affidavit that he did not have an erection and did not feel particularly sexually excited. He said his penis did not enter the complainant's vagina but just touched the outside. He said that from the time the complainant stood up to when he ejaculated no more than 2 minutes had passed. He said in the affidavit that ""at no time did the complainant ask him to stop being intimate with her but instead took the initiative in the encounter."" 
     
      
    41 The appellant gave evidence and was cross-examined. It was suggested to him that when he said in his affidavit he did not have an erection and his penis did not enter the complainant's vagina he was telling a lie. He denied that he had lied saying that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""No it's not a lie, it's - I say the truth. I didn’t know if it's enter inside or not."" 
        
       
      
    42 It was suggested to him that upon becoming aware of medical evidence which revealed that the appellant's semen had been found in the higher vaginal area of the complainant the appellant had moved away from the denial that he had an erection and that his penis did not enter the complainant. He was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. I'm suggesting, sir, that when you said the words in your affidavit, 'As I did not have an erection my penis did not enter (the complainant's) vagina', that you knew that to be lie?  
        
       
      
    43 The appellant answered: 
     
      
       
        
        ""No is not."" 
        
       
      
    44 In his evidence in chief the appellant gave the following account of the events: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. What then happened? 
         
        A. Then she sit down watching TV and I watching TV, then she told me 'Are you allergic from woman or girl?' something like that. I said 'No', you know, 'I'm working seventy hour this week, I was sleep over four days'. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Sorry, 'Are you allergic to women?' I've got that, what's the next thing? 
        
       
       
        
        GELBERT: Q. Did you answer anything when she said 'Are you allergic to women?' 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, I says 'I'm just very tired, I work hard this week, seventy hours and I sleep over four days.' 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did ……….then do something? 
         
        A. Yes. Between me and her, it's small cushion, it's - I can say that bit, not big cushion, small cushion, two, and I got one behind my back. She move it like that and she lie down in my chest here. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Let's just do that slowly, there were two cushions? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where were they? 
         
        A. In the middle. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In the middle of where? 
         
        A. Of the couch. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were they between you and her? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened to those cushions? 
         
        A She just move them like that to the ground, to the floor altogether. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What then happened? 
         
        A. Then she lied down in chest. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What part of her body went on your chest? 
         
        A. Her face, like that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you're showing that she leaned her body at 45 degree angle? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q With her head towards your chest, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes, yes. Excuse me, it's not exactly 45, because the couch is too small, it's two seater. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. She leaned over? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What then happened as she leaned over and put her head in your chest? 
         
        A. She didn't talk for a short time, then she tell me 'I haven't been relationship for two years.' 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did you say anything? 
         
        A. Yes, I said 'Oh, come on, you still young and still long time for that, you got plenty time for that.' 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did she then say anything? 
         
        A. No, she stopped, then she say again, 'I hadn't been kissed for two years.' 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And then what happened? 
         
        A. When she say that word exactly second or before second, she turn and face to my face, come face to face and it's too close to my mouth, and she kiss me in my mouth. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what did you do? 
         
        A. I kiss her. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did the two of you kiss? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. For how long? 
         
        A. Maybe - short time, three minutes, maybe. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did she then do something? 
         
        A. Then I - because the position is not comfortable for me and for her, I just sit like back again and my eyes just were on the ceiling, I was in that time I was thinking two minutes, think in my head. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Did you see what…………was doing? 
         
        A. She's standing up.

        A. Yeah, the elastic from my undies and the elastic from the tracksuit is very tight, she put them wrong way, it's tight in here, I start to move like that to make myself comfortable. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you do something to your tracksuit to make it more comfortable? 
         
        A. No, I just move like that, put it like that until I get comfortable, the elastic isn't hurting. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you notice what (the complainant) was doing? 
         
        A. She wasn't doing nothing when I moved like that, she just sit down. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And then what happened? 
         
        A. Then she moved again to chest to chest and she put herself on top of me, is coming straight away touch her and she moved very, very quick.

        HIS HONOUR: He must know what the act was, surely.

        Q. After you came, what then happened? 
         
        A. (The complainant) stood up and she put her jeans again, she put her jeans, she sit down on the couch, she put her boots, and I went to the bathroom, I wash myself, and I come back, and (the complainant) was ready, put the coat and everything ready to go home."" 
        
       
      
    45 Medical evidence was given at the trial which indicated that as the appellant had ejaculated he must have had an erect penis. Although it was possible that semen had moved from outside the vagina to within the evidence suggested that because semen was found in the high vaginal area this was unlikely. The jury was entitled to conclude that when the appellant denied that he had penetrated the complainant he was telling an untruth. 
     
      
    46 It is also apparent that when the appellant was speaking with Mr Barila he did not tell him the truth. Sexual activity had taken place and the appellant was not telling the truth when he denied that it had occurred. Apart from a denial out of a consciousness of guilt there were other reasons why the appellant may have taken this course. The most obvious was a concern that if he admitted to having sexual relations while working he would be likely to lose his job. 
     
      
    47 The account of the sexual activity which the appellant gave in evidence suggests that he did not encourage the sexual activity and although he did not resist the complainant's advances he was not particularly sexually excited. Having regard to the evidence that the appellant had invited the complainant to stay with him, suggesting that she stay the night, the jury were entitled to believe that he was not being truthful about his desire for sexual activity. Again, there were reasons, apart from a consciousness of guilt why he may have sought to give this impression. The most obvious would be a desire to leave his wife with the belief that although sexual activity occurred he did not encourage or desire it. This may also be an explanation for his assertion that he believed that he had not penetrated the complainant. 
     
      
       
      Verdict unreasonable? 
       
      
    48 Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
        
       
      
    49 Although the application of the section has at times proved troublesome it was authoritatively considered by the High Court in MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606, M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 and Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 493. 
     
      
    50 There are two joint judgments in MFA. Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ state that when the issue is whether the verdict of a jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported the test to be applied is that stated by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations."" 
        
       
      
    51 As the High Court emphasised in Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) (1984) 153 CLR 521 it is important to appreciate that the role of the Court of Appeal is to decide a question of fact. ""It is supervising or reviewing the findings of a tribunal of fact"" (see Darling Island Stevedoring Lighterage Co Ltd v Jacobsen (1945) 70 CLR 635 at 643; R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74). 
     
      
    52 In MFA the High Court was concerned with whether the analysis of the facts of a trial by this Court was appropriate. In carrying out the appellate task the joint judgment emphasised that it was relevant to identify whether the evidence in the Crown case was ""cogent and unequivocal, and it was not inherently implausible""[30]. The relevant question is whether ""it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt"" [36]. 
     
      
    53 In MFA, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ joined in a separate judgment. Their Honours emphasised that it was important to focus on the language of s 6(1) which because of the inclusion of the word ""unreasonable"" ""seems to state a very broad test""[47]. However, their Honours point out that the seeming amplitude is to be restricted by the context. Being a verdict of a jury which is given a special place in the law to set it aside involves ""a serious step""[49]. The requirement of the section is that the court must determine whether there has been a ""miscarriage of justice"" notwithstanding that the jury has returned a guilty verdict. 
     
      
    54 Embracing the test adopted by the majority of the court in M the joint judgment stated: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Instead of asking whether the jury 'must' or were 'bound to' have a reasonable doubt about the accused's guilt, the majority posed the question whether it was 'open to the jury' to be satisfied of the accused's guilt, applying the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, acting as a reasonable jury and reaching their verdict 'upon the whole of the evidence' "" [55]. 
        
       
      
    55 The joint judgment offered the following by way of guidance: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The majority in  
        M 
         pointed out that '[i]n most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced'. In such a case of doubt, it is only where the jury's advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence can explain the difference in conclusion about the accused's guilt that the appellate court may decide that no miscarriage of justice has occurred: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a  
          significant possibility  
          that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence'[56]."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    56 In their conclusion their Honours acknowledge that it is not uncommon for some aspects of the evidence in a trial to be less than wholly satisfactory although juries are usually well able to evaluate conflicts and imperfections of evidence. ""In the end, the appellate court must ask itself whether it considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred authorising and requiring its intervention"" [96]. 
     
      
       
      Analysis of the evidence in the present case 
       
      
    57 Turning to the evidence in the present appeal there are a number of matters which require careful consideration. Firstly, there is the inconsistency in the complainant's account of how she was grabbed by the appellant and lifted onto his lap. At the earlier trial the complainant says she was taken in a ""bear hug"" the appellant placing his arms around her and lifting her onto his lap. At the trial the complainant said that she was lifted by the arms, the appellant grabbing each arm above the elbow and below the shoulder and lifting her. However, when reminded that she had previously given a different account she said the earlier version was correct. 
     
      
    58 To my mind, the inconsistency in this evidence is not devoid of significance. If the complainant was, as she maintains, forced to straddle the appellant against her will her memory of the event would be likely to be vivid although it may have diminished with time. 
     
      
    59 This inconsistency needs to be considered in light of the fact that there was no bruising evident on the complainant's body when she was examined at the hospital, although she says she noticed some marks at a later date. Given the physical force required to lift the complainant, some bruising may have been thought to be likely although a lack of it is not determinative of the matter. There is also the evidence of a tear in the vagina which could be consistent with intercourse taking place when the appellant was using physical force, although Dr Smits conceded that it could happen when the sexual act was consensual. 
     
      
    60 To my mind, the actions of the complainant after the alleged assault also require careful consideration. Her decision to walk home is unremarkable but the acceptance by the complainant of the appellant's mobile phone number and the entry of it into her telephone may not be consistent with her allegation that she had been forced to have sexual intercourse with the appellant only a short time previously. The complainant gave no evidence of any aggressive conduct by the appellant toward her after intercourse had ceased or any suggestion that at that point in time she was overborne by the appellant which could explain her retention of the telephone number. Although she said that she did it because she ""thought that was the only way I'd get out of there -- "" she gave no evidence of any attempt by the appellant to further restrain her or stop her from leaving. 
     
      
    61 Questions arise in relation to the complainant's account of the events to her friends including whether she made a complaint of sexual assault until she was prompted. The first person she called was her friend Heather to whom she initially gave an account of an event where the appellant had ""started to crack onto me"" but it ""went too far"". However, the complainant also said that she told her friend that she kept on saying ""no"". The complainant also related that she was concerned about telling the police or her employer because she was ""scared about losing my job"". Some people may find it difficult to accept that the complainant would fear losing her job if she had been forced to have sexual intercourse against her will. However, the complex of emotions created by a sexual assault may also leave the victim feeling unsure whether some blame may be wrongly attributed to her by others with the possibility that her standing with her employer could be diminished. 
     
      
    62 The complainant gave evidence that after the event she felt guilty about what had happened. She explained her guilt as being a concern that because she was a Christian she did not believe in sexual activity before she was married. She said that ""I guess I felt guilty to God about what had just happened"". If the complainant had been sexually assaulted as she alleged some people may find it difficult to understand why she should feel ""guilty to God"" and believe such a feeling would be more likely if she had engaged in consensual intercourse which she now regretted. However, I accept that the reaction of a devout Christian to such a situation may give rise to a range of responses which could include a feeling that she had failed to honour her Christian beliefs. 
     
      
    63 Although all of these matters require careful consideration it must be remembered that the complainant did, shortly after the alleged assault, report the matter to her friends and ultimately went to the police and was examined in hospital. Given her concerns about her employer and her Christian faith, if the sexual activity was consensual it may be thought more likely that she would not have informed anyone. Accordingly, the act of informing her friends is consistent with her concern to report the fact that she had been violated. However, it could possibly be explained by the fact that she was feeling guilt and remorse about a consensual act and in confusion sought counselling from her close friends. 
     
      
    64 Counsel for the appellant places emphasis on the fact that the complainant denied that she owned or was wearing a long coat and boots on the evening of the alleged offence. The appellant says that she was wearing this clothing which she removed before the sexual activity occurred. There was evidence from friends of the complainant which contradicted her evidence at least to the extent that they confirmed that the complainant did own the suggested items of clothing. It is submitted that the complainant lied about these matters. I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to come to this conclusion. 
     
      
    65 To my mind, all of these matters raise issues which the jury was required to consider and resolve. Notwithstanding the fact that some, or perhaps all of the issues, could have been resolved in the appellant's favour they are not such as would entitle this Court to intervene. This Court can only intervene in a serious case where it is satisfied that a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt was not open. 
     
      
    66 However, there are other matters of fundamental importance which, to my mind, do require this Court to intervene. Irrespective of how the complainant came to be on the appellant's lap, she maintains that she was positioned straddling him with her legs apart and, probably, with her knees on the couch beside his hips or thighs. She was seated on his lap facing him. In this position, she alleges, the appellant fondled her breasts and while restraining her with one hand used the other hand to lower her jeans and underpants to a position between her groin and her knees. At about the same time the appellant is alleged to have lowered his own pants having lifted his bottom from the couch.  
     
      
    67 It is conceivable that the complainant could have been effectively restrained by the appellant holding her with one of his arms - she was of slight build with a weight of about 40 kilograms. However, because her legs were separated so that she straddled him and she was seated on his lap it is, to my mind, unlikely that her jeans could have been lowered over her buttocks to a position where penetration could occur. In the position which the complainant suggests intercourse occurred her thighs must have been apart which would make it most unlikely that her clothes could have been lowered as she asserts. As she was seated on his lap, the account which she gives is open to doubt.  
     
      
    68 To my mind, there are three difficulties with the complainant's account. Firstly, the appellant would have had difficulty releasing the complainant's jeans and moving them past her buttocks while she was sitting on him. Secondly, he would have difficulty moving her underpants and jeans down her thighs to any considerable extent. If, however, both these acts occurred the jeans and underpants would still have been around her thighs and between her groin and the appellant's body providing an obstruction to penetration. I believe there must be serious doubts whether vaginal penetration in the manner the complainant suggests, could have occurred against her will with her body and clothing in the position she indicated. 
     
      
    69 Although the other matters, to which I have earlier referred, may be accepted as imperfections in the evidence which a jury are well able to evaluate, the evidence of the physical position of the appellant and the complainant during the act of intercourse is of quite a different character. Having regard to this evidence I am of the opinion that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that intercourse occurred in the manner suggested by the complainant without her consent. A miscarriage of justice has occurred which requires this Court to intervene. 
     
      
    70 In these circumstances, it is unnecessary to deal with the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
    71 The appropriate orders are: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed. 
       
      2. Conviction and sentence quashed.  
       
      3. Enter a verdict of acquittal. 
       
       
      
    72 SIMPSON J: The facts are set out in great detail in the judgment of McClellan AJA, which I have read in draft. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour. My reasoning process differs in some respects from that of his Honour. 
     
      
    73 The principal ground of appeal is that the verdict of guilty is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. That calls for careful analysis of the competing considerations. The case has a number of unusual, and troubling, features. 
     
      
    74 By the time the charge came to trial, there was no issue that sexual intercourse between the complainant and appellant had occurred. There was no issue that it had occurred during the late evening of 15 November 2002, in premises at Winston Hills occupied as their residence by a number of sufferers of cerebral palsy in the care of the Spastic Centre of NSW. It was common ground that the appellant and the complainant were, on that evening, employed by Edmend Employment Agency as casual carers for these occupants. The sole issues in the trial were whether the by then admitted intercourse was consensual, or, more accurately, whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time the appellant had sexual intercourse, the complainant was not consenting and the appellant knew that she was not consenting. No issue arose as to any honest but mistaken belief in consent. Given the respective positions taken by the parties, the true issue for determination by the jury was that of actual consent. 
     
      
    75 Argument on the appeal focussed heavily upon the physical, or mechanical, possibility or impossibility of the sexual intercourse occurring as described in her evidence by the complainant. Her account, essentially, was this. She and the appellant were sitting on a three-seater sofa. She was wearing stretch jeans. There were small cushions between them. Some conversation took place. The appellant removed the separating cushions and put them on the floor, reached across, and grabbed her by the top of the arm or the shoulder. He “slung” her onto his knees, facing him, her legs straddling his. Holding her in a bear hug, he began kissing her, and then reached down into the upper part of her clothing and began feeling her breasts. During this time she tried to get away, but the force with which he held her prevented her from doing so. He pulled down her jeans and his tracksuit pants, inserted his penis into her vagina, and started moving. She repeatedly asked him to stop, but he persisted, without answering. The intercourse continued over about ten to fifteen minutes, until the appellant ejaculated. The complainant did not scream for help because she was very frightened. After the appellant had ejaculated, the complainant stood up and went to the office to collect her belongings. The appellant offered to pay for a taxi home for her but she preferred to walk. He gave her his mobile telephone number, which she keyed into her own mobile telephone memory. 
     
      
    76 Cross-examination by counsel for the appellant was largely directed to undermining the credibility of the complainant’s account, by questioning the feasibility of the events having occurred as she outlined them. Both in her evidence-in-chief and in cross-examination the complainant said that the appellant “pulled” or “took” her jeans down. In cross-examination she settled on saying that they had been pulled to between her knees and her groin. She said nothing (and was not asked) about whether, and if so, how, the appellant undid the fastenings on the jeans. The jeans were an exhibit in the trial and have been inspected by this court. They are of stretch fabric, with, in my assessment, a good deal of elasticity. The fly is secured by buttons, not a zipper. 
     
      
    77 The proposition to which the cross-examination (and the argument on the appeal) was directed was that it was physically impossible for the appellant to have held the complainant, facing him, with her legs opened across his legs, and to have removed the jeans; or to have penetrated her in that position. In this respect it is of some significance that the complainant denied having stood up, or otherwise cooperated in allowing the jeans to be removed. When pressed, she said that she thought her knees were on the sofa. (Earlier she had said that her feet, still shod, were “just in the air, like ... not touching the ground”.) When pressed further, about how the appellant was able to pull the jeans down to between her knees and her groin, she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “He did. I’m not sure how, but he did.” 
        
       
      
    78 At an early stage of the proceedings, it is evident that the jury was alive to this issue and had some concerns about the complainant’s evidence. Early in the afternoon of the first day of the trial, while the complainant was still giving evidence-in-chief, they sent a note containing three questions. They were, as read onto the transcript by the trial judge, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Question 1. Can you please describe how the accused managed to grab and manoeuvre her into position? What in fact was the position of [the complainant] on top of the accused? Straddled or other? 
        
       
       
        
        Question 2. How was [the complainant] actually restrained, were her arms free? 
        
       
       
        
        Question 3. Did [the complainant] say anything like, ‘I am going to call the police’ or struggle more than, ‘I’m not like that’.” 
        
       
       
       * * * 
       
      
    79 Initially, when asked on the following day (Saturday 16 November) about the complainant’s allegations by a manager employed by Edmend Employment Agency, Mr Frank Barila, the appellant falsely denied that any sexual activity had occurred. 
     
      
    80 On Monday 18 November the appellant presented himself with a solicitor at the Parramatta Police Station where he was arrested and charged. He declined to comment on the allegations that were put to him. However, the following day he swore an affidavit which was then provided to a police officer a day later. This document also contained some assertions which the appellant later conceded to be untrue. In it, he deposed, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “4. I recall that [the complainant] started at 4.00 PM and worked until about five minutes before 10.00 PM that night. There were no incidents of any note during this period... I did not abuse this position nor make any remarks to [the complainant] of a sexual nature. 
        
       
       
        
        ... 
        
       
       
        
        6. After this [two telephone calls from Mr Barila to the complainant] and around 10 o’clock [the complainant] said, ‘I am going to stay a while my feet are tired from standing up. I will stay and watch TV until around 10.30’. 
        
       
       
        
        [The complainant] took off her boots and then sat on the lounge next to me. A minute or so later [the complainant] got up and took her coat off. 
        
       
       
        
        ... 
        
       
       
        
        8. [After some conversation]  
        
       
       
        
        [the complainant] then put her head on my chest. After a while [the complainant] said to me ‘I have not been in a relationship for two years ... I have not been kissed for two years.’ 
        
       
       
        
        9. Straight after she said this [the complainant] lifted her head up and was directly in front of my face. We started to kiss. I recall that we kissed for a minute or two. ... 
        
       
       
        
        10. In less then (sic) thirty seconds after [the complainant] stood up she climbed onto me straddling my legs and was facing me. As [the complainant] did this she pulled down the front of my tracksuit pants and exposed my penis. 
        
       
       
        
        ... 
        
       
       
        
        As I did not have an erection my penis did not enter [the complainant’s] vagina. It just touched around the area outside. I am not aware where my spermatozoa landed when I ejaculated. 
        
       
       
        
        11. ...  
        
       
       
        
        [The complainant] said, ‘I am going to go home now.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘Are you walking? Don’t walk it is not safe as it is late. I will give you some money for a taxi.’ 
        
       
       
        
        [The complainant] refused this offer and left. ...” 
        
       
      
    81 Subsequently, the appellant, through his solicitor, was provided with copies of statements on which the Crown proposed to rely in support of the charge. Included in these was a statement or certificate from Dr Gael Smits, a medical practitioner who examined the complainant and who later gave evidence. 
     
      
    82 Dr Smits’ statement revealed to the appellant that, on medical examination of the complainant, semen was detected in a high vaginal swab. On DNA comparison with a sample taken from the appellant, the semen proved to be that of the appellant. 
     
      
    83 The appellant gave evidence in the trial. He now agreed that intercourse had taken place, and gave an account that was, to a large extent, consistent with that contained in his affidavit. It is of some interest that, while maintaining that it was the complainant who initiated the activity, his description of the manner in which it had taken place had broad parallels with the complainant’s description – that is, that sexual intercourse had occurred when the appellant was sitting on the sofa, and the complainant sat in or on his lap, facing him, with her legs straddling his. On the appellant’s version, however, not only had the complainant initiated the activity, but, at the time that she did so, she had already removed her shoes and her jeans. The appellant went on to describe sexual intercourse in which the complainant was extremely proactive. 
     
      
    84 Contrary to what he had said in his affidavit, the appellant now accepted and admitted that he had ejaculated, and that he had achieved a degree of penetration. In evidence-in-chief, in accepting that he had ejaculated, he appeared to attempt to maintain some level of denial of having achieved complete erection. The transcript records the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: When you said you felt you came, was the feeling that you had a normal feeling that you had? 
        
       
       
        
        A: No, not at all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: In what way wasn’t it normal? 
        
       
       
        
        A: The way was normally, you know, when you came and you stop like that, you came, but this time it was moving, I didn’t know where I’m landing, it’s finished, I came, that’s the quick way.” 
        
       
      
    85 And in cross-examination he denied that the passage in the affidavit that reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I did not have an erection my penis did not enter [the complainant’s] vagina.” 
        
       
       
      was a lie. (T 48, 10-6) 
       
      
    86 Medical evidence was given in the Crown case by Dr Smits (that is, before the appellant’s evidence). Two matters of significance emerged from Dr Smits’ evidence. Firstly, on examination of the complainant, he identified a small longitudinal tear in the posterior fourchette. 
     
      
    87 A scenario, postulated on the appellant’s affidavit account, was put to Dr Smits. Included in the hypotheses were two premises drawn from the appellant’s affidavit – firstly, that he had ejaculated, but had not had an erect penis; secondly, that he had at no time penetrated the complainant’s vagina. Dr Smits thought that, on those hypotheses, it was “highly unlikely” that the tear would have been occasioned and he would not have expected to find semen in the high vaginal swab. Finally, while Dr Smits acknowledged that it was well-known that ejaculation without erection could take place when asleep, he knew of no literature about ejaculation without erection in the awake state. 
     
      
    88 In cross-examination an attempt was made to have Dr Smits agree that a vaginal tear was equally indicative of voluntary as involuntary intercourse, but he declined to do so, saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “No, it is not as much, about one third of the sexual assault cases have this kind of injury, and in consensual intercourse it’s about one tenth.” 
        
       
       
      He agreed, however, that he could not say whether the complainant’s tear arose out of a consensual or a non-consensual act. 
       
       
       * * * 
       
      
    89 Before moving to some more of the detail of the argument raised in support of the appeal, it is convenient to recall the test laid down for the determination of a criminal appeal on the ground that a verdict cannot be supported by the evidence. Although the High Court has spoken of this on a number of occasions, and the judgments are referred to in the draft judgment of McClellan AJA, perhaps the best known and most quoted passage is that which appears in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493 of the CLR: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.  
        But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations. 
        ” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    90 This was a case in which the jury was confronted with the sworn evidence, principally of two witnesses, with very little extrinsic evidence available to cast light upon which should be accepted. (It framing the proposition in that way, I should not be taken to have overlooked that the onus of proof lay at all times upon the Crown. That is a matter which was adequately put to the jury, about the directions concerning which there is no complaint.) 
     
      
    91 It is of some interest that, even before the complainant was cross-examined, the jury recognised the issue concerning the physical possibility or impossibility of the intercourse having occurred as the complainant described. Notwithstanding that, and the other matters to which I shall come, the jury ultimately accepted the complainant’s version. That is no small matter, and not to be lightly put aside. 
     
      
    92 There were other circumstances capable of bearing upon the ultimate outcome. Adversely to the Crown case, for example, were the following features, referred to in more detail in the judgment of McClellan AJA. The appellant gave a description of some clothing he said was worn by the complainant. In his affidavit he said, besides a pair of tight jeans, she was wearing a pair of knee-length platform boots, with zippers, and a long coat. In his evidence-in-chief he described the boots she was wearing as “a big bulky one”. He described her coat as: 
     
      
       
        
        “A black coat, it’s old-fashioned one, you got something in her neck like that, like a furry thing, like a tiger or something like that, and in here too, in her hand, and in the bottom one.” 
        
       
       
      He said the coat was a long one, extending, not to the floor, but “to the end of the shoes”. 
       
      
    93 The transcript records the following cross-examination of the complainant: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: Did you have a long black coat? 
         
         
        A: No. 
         
         
        Q: You sure about that? 
         
         
        A: Yes. 
         
         
        Q: You don’t have a long black coat which has grey kind of furry collar on it? 
         
         
        A: No. 
         
         
        Q: Black coat that goes down almost to your ankles? 
         
         
        A: Yes. 
         
         
        Q: You’re telling the truth, are you? 
         
         
        A: Yes. 
         
         
        Q: And do you have a pair of boots? 
         
         
        A: Yes. 
         
         
        Q: Black boots? 
         
         
        A: Yes. 
         
         
        Q: And the boots come up a bit of the way up the calf? 
         
         
        A: No they’re only ankle length. 
         
         
        Q: Ankle-length boots, is that right? 
         
         
        A: Yes. 
         
         
        Q: And how do they do up? 
         
         
        A: Just lace-ups. 
         
         
        Q: Lace-ups in the front or on the side? 
         
         
        A: The front. 
         
        
        
        Q: And you know how you have – it seems to be the contemporary fashion to have boots which have big toes on them, you know what I mean? 
         
         
        A: Yes. 
         
         
        Q: You do know what I mean, they’re kind of puffed up exaggerated toes, do you know what I mean? 
         
         
        A: Mm. 
         
         
        Q: Do you have a pair of boots like that, that has a look like that? 
         
         
        A: No. 
         
         
        Q: You’re sure about that? 
         
         
        A: Yes. 
         
         
        Q: See on this last night when you say the assault took place, I suggest to you that you had with you on that night a long black coat, as I have described to you earlier, do you agree or disagree? 
         
         
        A: I disagree. 
         
         
        Q: Disagree? 
         
         
        A: I disagree. 
         
         
        Q: And I suggest to you, you were wearing a pair of these boots, boots that went up the calf and were black with a big toe? 
         
         
        A: I disagree it would be impractical for that sort of work. 
         
         
        ... 
         
         
        Q: We’re not talking about boots with a high heel, stiletto high heel, I’m talking about boots with a platform with a big toe, rubber-sole type boots, you don’t know about anything like that? 
         
         
        A: I don’t own anything like that.” 
        
       
      
    94 The complainant was then cross-examined about evidence she had given in a previous trial, which had not run to conclusion, the complainant agreed that she had there said that she did not own a pair of boots but she said that by this she meant that she did not own a pair of knee-high boots. She agreed that she did own ankle-length boots. 
     
      
    95 A number of witnesses who were acquaintances or friends of the complainant were called to give evidence of complaint. One of these said that she had sometimes seen the complainant wearing a long black coat, and that she had also seen her wearing calf-length boots. 
     
      
    96 It is necessary also to refer to the evidence of complaint. Three complaint witnesses were called. The first was a friend of the complainant’s whose first name is Heather. She gave evidence that the complainant telephoned her at between 10.38 and 10.40 pm (that is, very shortly after she had left the Winston Hills house). She left a message for Heather which was: 
     
      
       
        
        “I had got myself into a bad situation and something happened to me, can you ring me.” 
        
       
      
    97 Heather telephoned the complainant who repeated what she had said and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “I should have known better, he forced himself on me.” 
        
       
       
      Heather then asked if it was done without the complainant’s consent, and the complainant said that it was. 
       
      
    98 There was some other conversation which it is not necessary here to relate. 
     
      
    99 At about 11.30 pm the complainant telephoned another acquaintance, Sherry. The complainant said to Sherry: 
     
      
       
        
        “Something really bad has happened at work.” 
        
       
       
      Sherry thought that the complainant appeared to be upset; her voice was shaky and trembling, and she sounded as though she had been crying. The complainant asked Sherry to come to her home and pick her up as she did not want to stay at home alone. Sherry did so. When she arrived at the complainant’s home the complainant looked pale and shaken, worried. Sherry did not press the complainant that evening, but helped her to relax. The next morning the complainant told her that she had been raped by a work partner. Sherry was with the complainant when she made contact with the Castle Hill Police Station and attended the hospital with her. At the hospital the complainant said to her: 
       
       
        
        “He asked me to stay overnight at the house and I said no. He then asked me to stay for coffee. I agreed and stayed and had a coffee with him. He started touching me and trying to kiss me. He then pulled me on top of him and I just kept saying, no, no.” 
        
       
      
    100 The third witness of complaint was called Sharon. She received a telephone call from the complainant at about 11.30 pm on the evening of 15 November. The complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I just got raped.” 
        
       
      
    101 Sharon asked her what happened and she replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “I stayed back from work and the guy that I was working with started kissing me. I said no, I don’t want this, I didn’t want to do it but it happened.” 
        
       
      
    102 Sharon thought that the complainant sounded very upset and was at times crying, and her voice quivering. 
     
      
    103 The complainant’s own evidence of complaint, was, in fact, more damaging to the Crown case. Her evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        “She [Heather] asked me what had happened and I said that the guy I worked with started to crack on to me and she said ‘What happened?’,  
        I said that it went too far 
        , and she said, ‘So he had sex with you’, I said ‘Yes’, but I said to her that I kept on saying no, that I didn’t want it to happen.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    104 Another aspect of the evidence which is not to be overlooked is that concerning the relative weights of the complainant and the appellant. The complainant was a young woman of very slight build, weighing only about 40 kg. The appellant said that his weight was about 75 kg. To some extent, this would support the complainant’s account, in that it would be at least physically possible that the appellant could lift her onto his lap as she said. 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            * * * 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    105 I am acutely conscious of the advantage enjoyed by the jury in observing the two principal witnesses. However, I have come to the view that, from the whole of the evidence, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the events occurred as described by the complainant. In coming to this view I am not moved by a perceived lack of logic in the complainant’s evidence that she was “scared” and feeling guilty. Human behaviour and emotions do not always follow logical pathways, particularly at a time of enhanced emotional activity. In my opinion it would be dangerous to read too much into the complainant’s evidence in this respect. Having said that, however, it would have to be recognised that the complainant’s feeling of guilt is more consistent with consensual sexual activity than non-consensual. 
     
      
    106 If this were the only matter casting doubt upon the complainant’s evidence it would not be sufficient to persuade me to depart from the jury’s verdict. 
     
      
    107 It is not the only matter. Another matter, again insufficient on its own, is the complainant’s apparently ready acceptance of the appellant’s telephone number. Again, I do not see this as pointing unequivocally to doubt about the complainant’s evidence. She gave an explanation which, in my opinion, is at least acceptable: that is, that by accepting the telephone number she had a greater opportunity of getting out of the house. Again, having said that, the evidence is more consistent with consensual than non-consensual sexual activity. 
     
      
    108 Nor am I persuaded by the absence of bruising. The complainant gave evidence, which was not challenged, that bruising emerged subsequently. There was no medical evidence about the period of time over which bruising can become manifest after rough treatment. 
     
      
    109 In the end, there are two principal aspects of the evidence that persuade me that the verdict of guilty was not reasonably open. The first is the somewhat unguarded and revealing evidence given by the complainant herself about her complaint to her friend Heather. Her evidence is that she said “... it went too far ...”. It is of some interest that this was not replicated in the evidence given by Heather, but it seems to me to be of real significance in suggesting that there had been some degree of willing participation by the complainant. I also find some echoes of this in the evidence given by Heather, who attributed to the complainant: 
     
      
       
        
        “... I had got myself into a bad situation ...” 
        
       
       
      and: 
       
       
        
        “I should have known better ...”. 
        
       
      
    110 It is true that the latter was followed immediately by the assertion that the appellant had forced himself upon her, and this renders the communication somewhat equivocal. Further, against that has to be put the evidence given by Sherry and Sharon. To Sherry the complainant said that she had verbally resisted the appellant’s advances; to Sharon the complaint was quite unequivocal and was an allegation, in terms, of rape. But this was the third telephone call made by the complainant, and was framed in language which may have been influenced by the conversations she had had with Heather and Sherry. She had been asked by them whether the activity had been consensual, and had denied it. The sequence of the complaint evidence suggests that the complainant “firmed up” in her denial of having been a willing participant as she discussed the matter with others. 
     
      
    111 On this issue another piece of evidence given by the complainant, extracted in the judgment of McClellan AJA, cannot be overlooked. This was her evidence that she had become a Christian, and her Christian beliefs did not permit her to indulge in sexual intercourse outside of marriage. It would not be right to disregard the possibility that the feelings of guilt which the complainant claimed to have experienced caused her to reconstruct the events of the evening in her mind. 
     
      
    112 Finally, and most importantly, I have had regard to the complainant’s evidence as to how, physically, the sexual activity occurred. Notwithstanding the complainant’s slight build, it is not easy to envisage how the appellant was able, from a seated position, to lift her, turn her body, and place her, facing him, legs astride, on his lap. Nor is it easy to envisage how, without any cooperation on her part, he was able to undo and lower her jeans and underwear while she remained in that position. The spread of her jeans must have made manipulation of the jeans difficult if not impossible. 
     
      
    113 In coming to the view I have that the conviction cannot be sustained, I should not be taken to suggest that the appellant’s version is to be preferred. It may well be that the truth lies somewhere in between the two accounts. It may be that the jury’s verdict is explained by their rejection of the appellant’s claim to have been seduced by the complainant. It is possible that they proceeded on the basis that only two alternative scenarios were available, and that the appellant’s evidence did not disclose a reasonably possible version of the events of the evening; and that, if they rejected the appellant’s account, then that left them only with the complainant’s account. Such an approach would, of course, be erroneous. Even if the jury rejected the appellant’s self-serving account, there remained a range of alternative hypotheses consistent with sexual relations having taken place that were consensual. Some of these alternative hypotheses dovetail neatly with those aspects of the evidence giving rise to uncertainty that I have referred to above. 
     
      
    114 The appellant was shown to have been untruthful, on more than one occasion, but, in the circumstances of this case, that was really of little significance. He advanced explanations which were, in my view, credible: that, as a married man, he did not wish his sexual infidelity to be known, and that, if his employers became aware of sexual engagement taking place in the house, his employment would almost certainly have been terminated. Thus, what the jury had was, as I have indicated above, the sworn testimony of the complainant to the effect that she was forced by the appellant into the sexual activity, against the sworn testimony of the appellant that it was the complainant who initiated sexual activity, and, indeed, seduced him. In my opinion the evidence as a whole was not capable of permitting a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant’s version was correct. 
     
      
    115 For those reasons I concur in the orders proposed by McClellan AJA. Like his Honour, I do not find it necessary to deal with second ground of appeal. 
     
      
    116 ROTHMAN J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for Judgment and the orders proposed by McClellan AJA who sets out the facts which form the basis of the conviction and the matters agitated on appeal. I agree with the orders proposed by His Honour. 
     
      
    The Principles 
     
      
    117 I agree with the principles adumbrated by McClellan AJA at paragraphs [47] to [55]. As Gleeson CJ said in a wholly different context: 
     
      
       
        
        “Depending on the nature of the appeal provided by statute, courts of appeal act according to established principles by which their functions are constrained. Those principles reflect the primacy of the trial process and the practical limitations upon the capacity of a court which does not itself hear the evidence justly to disturb an outcome at first instance. Trial by jury carries with it significant limitations of that kind.” ( 
        Swain v Waverley Municipal Council 
         (2005) 79 ALJR 565 at 566) 
        
       
      
    118 In the context of a criminal trial the requirement for finality of factual assessment by a jury must be qualified by the importance of the liberty of the individual and the fundamental requirement of the criminal justice system to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It is reconciling those two issues which the judgments of the High Court in M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 and MFA v R (2002) 213 CLR 606 in part address. However, even in that context, in the joint judgment of McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ in MFA the High Court reminded us that “a ‘verdict of a jury’ particularly in serious criminal cases, is accepted, symbolically, as attracting to decisions concerning the liberty and reputations of accused persons a special authority and legitimacy and hence finality.” (MFA at 621 [48]) 
     
      
    119 Such finality is qualified by the existence of s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act only because of the intolerable prospect that if an unreasonable conviction, or one unsupported by the evidence, remains extant, it would be inconsistent with the legitimate exercise of lawful power which the community has come to expect from its legal system (see MFA at [59]). 
     
      
    120 The difficulty arises in reconciling the overall impact of the evidence and its reasonableness with the inability of an appeal court to see and hear the evidence as it is given. It is for the jury to determine which, if either, of two accounts is to be believed and in this case the jury has clearly found that the appellant was not to be believed in his account. 121 I therefore approach the task on appeal giving due weight to the fact that the jury below believed the complainant and did not believe the appellant, at least on relevant issues. Indeed, one of the major grounds of appeal, as made clear in the reasons of McClellan AJA, was the direction to the jury as to how it ought to have treated the admitted lies of the defendant and its relationship to consciousness of guilt.  
     
      
    122 The only other further matter of principle to which I should make reference is the passage from M cited in the Judgment of McClellan AJA at [54]. The Judgment in M v R at 494 insofar as it speaks of a “significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted” is referring, when speaking of an innocent person, to a person of whom it can be said there is not evidence that would satisfy the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. (See Chamberlain v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 495) 
     
      
    Factual Analysis  
     
      
    123 The appellant relies, inter alia, on certain detailed discrepancies and allegedly implausible aspects of the evidence. Some short comment on those is required: 
     
      
       
      (a) The reference, mentioned in the other judgments, to the complainant being grabbed by the appellant and positioned on his lap being a position which rendered impossible, on one suggestion, or implausible, on another, the removal of the complainant’s jeans and underpants: It seems to me that the criticism of this evidence by the appellant treats as far too literal the expression “sitting on someone’s lap”. It does not seem to me that the evidence is inconsistent with movement by the complainant and in some significant respects the evidence is consistent only with movement. 
       
       
      (b) The length of time that penile penetration occurred: It does not strike me that 10 to 15 minutes is a relatively long time. More importantly I have real doubt as to its relevance to any issue. On any analysis, penile penetration occurred. There is no reason that the estimate of the length of time is particularly relevant in this case to the presence or absence of consent or even as to credibility. It is far more likely to relate to different perceptions of time. 
       
      
    124 As already indicated, the jury has clearly determined that it did not consider the appellant a truthful witness. There were substantial grounds for that, even apart from those matters which were admitted as lies. The proposition that, on the appellant’s version, the complainant was sitting on a lounge next to him, had made advances towards him, then arose from the lounge, took off her boots, her jeans and her underpants and the appellant, who continued to sit at the lounge, did not notice her removing her jeans and underpants is, to say the least, improbable.  
     
      
    125 Something also ought be said about the issue of the complainant feeling guilty after the incident which guilt on the appellant’s submissions, may be taken as an indication of consensual sexual intercourse. Human experience suggests that it is not uncommon for victims of sexual assault or sexual abuse to feel guilt that some of their conduct may have engendered or encouraged criminal conduct. Such guilt feelings may be irrational, but they are nevertheless real. Likewise, attributing rationality to religious beliefs associated with participating in a sexual act, even when non-consensual, is not an appropriate basis to disbelieve a person who has given evidence about those beliefs and been cross examined appropriately in relation to them and/or the reason why guilt feelings may be manifested. There are religions in which even the victims of sexual assault are seen to have been dishonoured, or otherwise tainted, and which would cause adherents thereto to feel guilt associated with such victim status. Even when the religion does not, misguided views of religion are not uncommon even amongst devout adherents.  
     
      
    126 Likewise, notwithstanding the submission of the appellant, the offer and acceptance of a telephone number by the appellant and complainant respectively is, especially in light of the evidence in relation thereto, an unremarkable event. As are the words chosen in complaints to her friends by the complainant.  
     
      
    127 I turn then to the issue addressed by McClellan AJA and in particular the conclusion reached as to the capacity of the appellant to remove the complainants clothing. The conclusion as to great difficulty in that task is not obvious and especially so in circumstances where much would depend upon the position of the complainant on the appellant’s lap (i.e. how close to the appellant’s knees the complainant was sitting at the time that the clothes were removed) which position would also determine the extent to which the complainant’s knees would need to be apart.  
     
      
    128 However, having said that, it would be necessary for the complainant to have been moved significantly for the appellant both to have removed her clothing on the one hand and engaged in sexual intercourse on the other. The complainant does not give evidence of such a significant movement and the complainant’s evidence in relation to her position on the lap of the appellant is unfortunately vague. 
     
      
    129 This is most significantly illustrated by the questioning of the complainant in relation to the position of her knees and legs during the act of sexual intercourse. On one view, the view taken by McClellan AJA, the evidence of the complainant would render almost impossible the act of sexual intercourse. I do not share that view although the analysis is open. In other words, I take the view that the complainant’s evidence as to the position of her knees is equivocal. On one view of it, it would render impossible the act of sexual intercourse. On the other hand there are clearly positions available which would render possible penile penetration in circumstances where the complainant’s clothing was midway between her groin and her knee. The fundamental problem is that even though one may take a view that penile penetration may have been possible (even probable), the evidence of the complainant is, on these issues, so uncertain and lacking in detail that it could never be said, even taking the complainant’s evidence only, and a fortiori upon the whole of the evidence, that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty (per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M at 493)  
     
      
    130 Even if the complainant’s evidence was preferred and the jury did not believe the evidence of the appellant, the evidence here, as a whole, must give rise to a reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    131 For the reasons outlined, I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan AJA.

    3 LATHAM J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 6 August 2004. The applicant first pleaded guilty in the District Court to one count of break enter and steal, pursuant to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act. The offence carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. The applicant received a sentence of two years imprisonment to date from 6 August 2004 with a non parole period of fifteen months expiring on 5 November 2005. 
     
      
    4 The facts which were tendered as part of the Crown brief on sentence are as follows. At about 8:00pm on Thursday 14 March 2002, the young female victim was alone at her home address in Penshurst. There was a knock at her front door and, on enquiring who was there, the applicant replied “its me”.  
     
      
    5 The victim looked through a peep hole in the door and was unable to see any person. She then opened the door and saw the applicant in company with another male. 
     
      
    6 The victim immediately shut the door, after seeing the applicant and the other male, because she was fearful of her safety. There had been a previous encounter between the victim and the applicant which resulted in the victim excluding the applicant from her home. 
     
      
    7 Shortly thereafter, one of the two males kicked the front door open, breaking it at the frame. The applicant and the other male entered the unit. The applicant said, “where is your laptop”. The applicant then went to the victim’s bedroom whilst the other male stayed with the victim in the lounge room. The applicant proceeded to search the victim’s bedroom and the lounge room. On a number of occasions the applicant asked for the victim’s laptop. 
     
      
    8 The victim grabbed her mobile phone and ran from the unit on to Forest Road. She was able to flag down a passing motorist. As she was being driven by the motorist in the direction of Hurstville Police Station, the victim saw a green motor vehicle, at the side of Forest Road. At the time the applicant was standing at the rear of this vehicle placing something into it.  
     
      
    9 The victim also identified a co-offender by the name of Georgiadis, who was known to her, as the driver of the vehicle. At that time, the applicant was seated in the front passenger seat of the vehicle and the other male was in the rear of the vehicle. 
     
      
    10 The victim noted the registration number of the vehicle and reported the incident at Hurstville Police Station. On returning to her unit, she identified a quantity of property missing, namely one Sanyo brand stereo with speakers and her handbag containing a watch, personal cards and a quantity of cash. 
     
      
    11 On Thursday 16 March 2002, police attended the address of the co-offender, Georgiadis, and searched the green motor vehicle, registered to the co-offender’s father. The victim’s handbag was found in the rear of that vehicle.  
     
      
    12 The applicant was arrested on Friday 15 March 2002 and taken to Hurstville Police Station, where he participated in a record of interview. The applicant denied any knowledge of the incident and stated that he had never been to Penshurst. He also stated that he did not know the victim. He told police that he did not go out on the evening of 14 March 2002. The applicant was charged on that day with one count of aggravated break enter and steal carrying a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. 
     
      
    13 The history of the proceedings bears considerable relevance to this appeal. The co-offender, Pantelis Georgiadis, pleaded guilty at the Local Court to aggravated break enter and steal (that is being in company with the applicant) and was sentenced by His Honour Judge Woods QC on 20 December 2002. At that time, His Honour noted that the co-offender had “made full and extensive admissions to police” the morning after his arrest. Some further reference to the remarks on sentence of his Honour on that occasion appear below in the context of ground one of the applicant’s grounds of appeal.  
     
      
    14 The applicant pleaded guilty for the first time on 24 March 2003 at the District Court to an alternative count which was made available on indictment on that occasion. A pre-sentence report was requested and the matter was stood over to 23 May 2003. On 23 May a transcript of the sentence of Georgiadis was not available. The matter was then stood over to 10 July 2003. On that day the matter was adjourned by the applicant’s legal representative in order that they might obtain a psychologist’s report. The matter was next listed for 12 September 2003. 
     
      
    15 On 12 September the matter was again adjourned on the application of the applicant’s legal representative, ostensibly on the basis that the applicant was prepared to offer assistance. The matter was stood over to 17 October 2003.  
     
      
    16 Between 17 October 2003 and 4 June 2004 the matter was before the District Court on no fewer than six occasions. On each of those occasions, with the exception of 4 June 2004, the applicant’s legal representative sought adjournments on the basis that the foreshadowed assistance had not materialised. 
     
      
    17 On 4 June 2004 yet another application for an adjournment was made by the applicant’s legal representative. The Court was told that the applicant had conducted an interview with police on 3 June, that is the preceding day, and that the matter was to be adjourned to allow the transcript of that interview to be taken out.  
     
      
    18 On 23 July 2004 His Honour was informed by the applicant’s solicitor (who was present at the applicant’s interview of 3 June 2004, when the applicant was given a copy of the tape recording of the interview) that the transcript of the interview was still not available, and that a further adjournment was being sought on the applicant’s behalf. It was the submission of the applicant’s solicitor : 
     
      
       
        
        That the accused has given assistance to the police. Now the erisp is not before or has not been provided at this stage, although a tape of the erisp was given to the accused on the date that the erisp was taken, namely 3 June 2004. It is the defence’s submission that the erisp identifies a primary offender that was involved in respect of this particular matter. 
        
       
      
    19 The Crown was in possession of a summary of the interview of 3 June. The applicant’s legal representative objected to the summary of the interview being placed before the Court. It was, however, tendered in the proceedings on sentence on behalf of the applicant and became an exhibit in those proceedings. A perusal of that exhibit indicates why it was that the applicant’s solicitor was reluctant for His Honour to see the document on 23 July. The summary taken out by the detective in charge of the matter contains the following comment: 
     
      
       
        
        Nicopoulos (the applicant’s solicitor) has asked about an affidavit of assistance. Based on this version I’m not prepared to give him one. 
        
       
      
    20 In these circumstances, it is not surprising that his Honour expressed some frustration in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        This matter has been before the Court on repeated occasions and the Court’s processes are being trifled with. 
        
       
      
    21 The matter was then put over to 28 July for sentence, on which date the applicant’s Counsel was unavailable. 
     
      
    22 On 6 August 2004, the matter finally proceeded to sentence. The Crown brief was tendered containing a copy of the Indictment, a Statement of Facts, the applicant’s criminal history, three statements from the victim, a number of statements from police officers and the father of the co-offender Georgiadis, a transcript of the interview conducted with the applicant at the time of his arrest, and a pre-sentence report dated 30 April 2003. Also tendered were remarks on sentence delivered in respect of the co-offender, the facts presented to the Court in relation to that sentence, and the criminal history of the co-offender. 
     
      
    23 The bulk of the proceedings on 6 August 2004 consisted of evidence from the victim, who was cross-examined, and evidence from the applicant who was also cross-examined at length. It is not necessary for the purposes of this appeal to canvass that evidence at any length. It is sufficient to observe that the applicant’s account completely traversed the facts according to the Crown case. In short, the applicant claimed that he had gone to the front door of the premises with another male while Georgiadis remained in the car, that without warning the other male had kicked open the front door, that he (the applicant) had entered and enquired after the victim’s welfare and had remained standing in the living room in a state of shock, while the other male took items from the other rooms. He denied carrying any of those items to the car. 
     
      
    24 Not surprisingly in my view, His Honour found that “the version given by the [applicant] … [was] false at all points where it conflicts with the evidence of [the victim].” (R/S p 3). 
     
      
    25 His Honour went on to note that the applicant had agreed that the interview with police on 15 March 2002 was “a pack of lies”. Nonetheless His Honour was mindful of the possibility that an offender’s false account to police may be subsequently retracted in favour of an honest account to a court. Ultimately, His Honour was satisfied that the applicant had simply substituted a further false account for the lies told to the police. 
     
      
    26 Against this background, it is convenient to deal briefly with grounds 3 and 4 of the appeal. These grounds claim that the Judge’s findings of fact as to the applicant’s role in the offence and the degree of planning are not supported by the evidence. 
     
      
    27 Turning firstly to the degree of planning, His Honour found that “the offence was committed in the form of a joint criminal enterprise and although it was planned, …. It is unlikely that it was planned terribly long before the event” (R/S p 6). 
     
      
    28 The written submissions, filed on the applicant’s behalf include the following: 
     
      
       
        
        What is challenged is that there was in any way, no matter how short, a planning of the offence as charged, but rather what occurred was an unexpected break and enter for which the applicant accepts criminal responsibility by reason of his presence. (par 5). 
        
       
      
    29 At par 7 of the written submissions, the following appears under the heading “-Facts”:- 
     
      
       
        
        On 14 March 2002 there was discussions (sic) as between the three co-offenders of attending on the victim for the purpose of demanding repayment of money from her. Such discussions were not long before the actual attendance. Such discussions did not involve any discussion as to an actual break and enter and of actual stealing of any properties of the type in fact stolen. 
        
       
      
    30 The latter paragraph was, at its highest, a summary of the applicant’s version given in evidence before the sentencing judge. His Honour found that the applicant had lied to the court. Accordingly, His Honour was entitled and indeed bound by fact-finding principles to examine the evidence on sentence in order to determine whether he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of those features of the offence which the applicant disputed, bearing in mind that he did not accept the applicant as a witness of truth. 
     
      
    31 Contained within the Crown brief, which was tendered without objection, was a statement of facts which was before His Honour when he came to sentence Mr Georgiadis in December 2002. It should be noted that Mr Georgiadis provided two interviews to police, one on the evening of 14 March 2002 and another more revealing interview on 15 March 2002. 
     
      
    32 In the interview of 15 March 2002, Mr Georgiadis stated that after collecting the applicant and another male in his father’s car, there was a conversation among the three of them regarding stealing from the victim so that drugs could be purchased. Whilst that conversation may have centred on stealing money, it matters not for present purposes that the offenders ultimately came away with a small amount of cash and a stereo. Mr Georgiadis then drove to the victim’s premises and waited in the car while the applicant and the other male went up the stairs and forced their way into the victim’s flat.  
     
      
    33 These features of the interview on 15 March 2002 were set out in the statement of facts relating to Mr Georgiadis. In these circumstances, it cannot be maintained that His Honour’s finding on the issue of the degree of planning was not supported by the evidence. 
     
      
    34 The same rationale applies to the applicant’s complaint that His Honour erred in attributing to the applicant an active role in the commission of the offence. Specifically, His Honour rejected the applicant’s evidence “that he did not seek the laptop immediately he went in, and … that he did not start looking around the flat for various items of property which were, in fact, stolen.” (R/S p 3). Having rejected the applicant’s evidence, His Honour had proper regard to the victim’s evidence, which in every critical respect was entirely consistent with the statement of facts in respect of this applicant. 
     
      
    35 Some mileage was sought to be made on the hearing of the appeal from the brief period of time during which the victim was in the premises before fleeing down the stairs. In effect, the submission was that the victim could not have made the observations she said she made within the course of a minute, a time span estimated by her during cross-examination by the applicant’s counsel. That submission was made to His Honour below. Obviously, the victim’s reliability in assessing the passage of time almost two and a half years after the event did not trouble His Honour when he came to make the findings of fact at issue here. I can see no reason why it should have troubled His Honour.  
     
      
    36 There is no substance to grounds 3 and 4 of the appeal. 37 Ground 2 as filed, asserts error by His Honour in rejecting the tender of extracts of a record of interview with Mr Georgiadis. The written submissions filed in support of this ground claim that the extracts supported the applicant’s claim that he did not carry anything from the premises of the victim. In that regard, this ground is related to grounds 3 and 4, in that it is suggested that had His Honour accepted the tender, his findings of fact would not have been open to him. 
     
      
    38 On the hearing of the appeal, it emerged from the evidence of the applicant’s solicitor and from the oral submissions, that this ground required substantial amendment. There were, in fact, not one but two interviews by Mr Georgiadis, extracts of which were sought to be tendered before His Honour and which were rejected by His Honour. The recollection of the applicant’s solicitor was that His Honour rejected the tender on the basis that the whole of the records of interview ought to be in evidence. The applicant’s solicitor went further and asserted that the applicant’s counsel then sought to tender the whole of both records of interview, but that too was rejected by His Honour. 
     
      
    39 The transcript available to the Court on the hearing of the appeal contained no such exchange or ruling. Following the hearing of the appeal, the Court received a transcript of the submission on sentence at the close of the evidence. Both the Crown and the applicant’s counsel provided further written submissions in response to that further transcript.40 The additional transcript reveals a discussion between the applicant’s counsel and His Honour, wherein His Honour points out that the record of interview of Mr Georgiadis was not before him. The applicant’s counsel (who was also counsel on the appeal) indicated that he “might seek leave to re-open and tender p 16 of that transcript”. The Crown representative responded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “If my friend wishes to tender anything the Crown would ask him to tender the whole of the interview.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour then says:- 
       
       
        
        “If you want to tender it …. you’ll have to tender the lot.” 
        
       
       
      The applicant’s counsel then continued his submissions in relation to parity with Mr Georgiadis. A short time later, following another reference to the co-offender’s record of interview in the course of the applicant’s counsel’s submissions, His Honour said:- 
       
       
        
        “Do you want to put that before me in these proceedings or not?” 
        
       
       
      The applicant’s counsel responded:- 
       
       
        
        “My instructions are not to press the tender.” 
        
       
       
      There the matter rested. 
       
      
    41 Accordingly, there was no tender of any record of interview or any part thereof. At no stage was His Honour required to give a ruling on such a tender, whatever his preliminary view may have been. There is no basis for asserting an error of law on His Honour’s part. 
     
      
    42 Even assuming the admission of both records of interview, the additional material would not have assisted the applicant, given that it was never disputed that Mr Georgiadis remained in his vehicle at all relevant times. His account could not have detracted from the victim’s evidence of the applicant’s conduct inside the premises. Far from assisting the applicant, Mr Georgiadis confirmed the Crown case as noted in respect of grounds 3 and 4. This ground also fails. 
     
      
    43 Ground 5 asserts error in that His Honour was said to have found that the applicant was a person of prior bad character. More particularly, the applicant points to the last entry on the applicant’s criminal history relating to an offence committed in about September 2002, for which the applicant received a Community Service Order in July 2003. As I understand the applicant’s submission, His Honour was not entitled to have regard to that entry in reaching the conclusion that the applicant had “repeatedly been given the benefit by the courts of lenient sentences”. (R/S p 6) 
     
      
    44 The totality of what His Honour said on the subject of prior offences appears at pp 5 and 6 of the remarks on sentence:- 
     
      
       
        
        The offender does not have the advantage of prior good character or anything like it. There are a number of offences against his name, although he has not served a prison sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        …….. 
        
       
       
        
        There are a number of matters in the Crown brief on his record which indicate that he has repeatedly been given the benefit by the courts of lenient sentences. It cannot be said that he was a person of prior good character. 
        
       
      
    45 Regardless of whether the last entry on the applicant’s criminal history concerned an offence which post-dated the offence with which His Honour was dealing, the fact remains that His Honour’s observations in this regard were entirely accurate. The applicant had five previous summary convictions for driving offences, two for Contravene ADVO, one for Indecent Assault and one for Goods in Custody. He had not received any form of custodial sentence. 
     
      
    46 Given the extensive delay in sentencing the applicant on this offence, and the role which the applicant’s legal representative played in that delay, it is not surprising that a summary offence committed six months after the break enter and steal was the subject of conviction and sentence, approximately one year before these sentencing proceedings. His Honour did no more than refer to the applicant’s criminal history, at the time of sentence. This ground of appeal also fails. 
     
      
    47 Ground 6 was abandoned at the hearing of the appeal. 
     
      
    48 Ground 1 asserts that the sentence imposed on the applicant offends the parity principle. The submissions in support of this ground rest, in part, on the fact that Mr Georgiadis pleaded guilty to Aggravated Break, Enter and Steal, carrying a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment, yet `` received a sentence of eighteen months, with a Non Parole Period of fifteen months, to be served by way of periodic detention. The applicant’s counsel then drew a comparison between the number of days actually spent in custody over that 15 months of weekend detention, and the number of days of full time custody to be served by the applicant. The conclusion was reached that the applicant’s sentence was therefore three times more lengthy than the sentence imposed on the co-offender. 
     
      
    49 Whilst it is true to say that a sentence of periodic detention is significantly less onerous than one served in full-time custody, the former cannot be mathematically assessed against the latter : R v Pangallo (1991) 56 A Crim. R 441. 
     
      
    50 In the case of both Mr Georgiadis and the applicant, His Honour determined that nothing less than a custodial sentence was warranted in order to reflect the objective gravity of the offence. In Mr Georgiadis’ case, His Honour exercised his sentencing discretion by way of an order for periodic detention. The reasons why that step was not taken in the applicant’s case appear at p 5 of the remarks on sentence:- 
     
      
       
        
        That matter is distinguishable from this in the reverse direction to which the nature of the charges might point because of the significantly different roles that were played. Georgiadis was the cockatoo; he is relatively (sic) to this offender an “innocent abroad” and although a prison sentence in that instance was necessary, the form of it was appropriately modified in accordance with his role and his prior character. 
        
       
       
        
        In the present case, the offender does not have the advantage of prior good character or anything like it. 
        
       
      
    51 In addition to these factors, it is also apparent that His Honour had regard to the applicant’s lack of any real contrition or remorse beyond that reflected “in some degree” by the plea of guilty. Mr Georgiadis, on the other hand, had demonstrated real contrition beginning almost immediately after his arrest. 
     
      
    52 No error has been demonstrated in the exercise of the sentencing discretion on this ground. 
     
      
       
       
      
    53 Accordingly, I would make the following orders:- 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted 
       
      
     2. Appeal dismissed.

    1 HIS HONOUR: On 25 May 2005, after a trial presided over by me, a jury found the prisoner Jacques Louis Guy Hantis not guilty of the murder but guilty of the manslaughter of Andre de Groote on 28 September 2003 at Callala Bay, which is near Nowra. 
     
      
    2 On 2 July 2004 the prisoner had pleaded guilty to committing an offence under s 7(1) of the Firearms Act of possessing a firearm without being authorised to do so by a licence or permit. 
     
      
    3 A hearing of proceedings for the sentencing of the prisoner for both offences took place on 3 June 2005. 
     
      
    4 As the sentencing judge it is part of my function to determine the facts relevant to sentencing for each of the offences. I am mindful that facts adverse to the prisoner must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, whereas facts favourable to the prisoner need only be proved on the balance of probabilities (The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 281 (27)). I will first find facts relevant to the offence of manslaughter, which is obviously by far the more important offence.  
     
      
    5 The prisoner himself did not give evidence either in the trial or in the proceedings on sentence. The prisoner’s mother, Mrs Lily Hantis, who was Mr de Groote’s de facto wife and who was present, or at any rate close by, when Mr de Groote was killed, also did not give evidence in either the trial or the proceedings on sentence. However, notwithstanding the absence of evidence from either the prisoner or Mrs Lily Hantis, I consider that I am able to find, to the requisite standard, a number of facts relevant to the commission of the offence of manslaughter.  
     
      
    6 The prisoner was born on 25 May 1955 in Belgium. His parents were the late Mr Jean Hantis and his wife, Mrs Lily Hantis.  
     
      
    7 While she was still living in Belgium Mrs Lily Hantis formed a relationship with Andre de Groote. This relationship continued up until Mr de Groote’s death. During his lifetime Jean Hantis tolerated the relationship between his wife and Mr de Groote. 
     
      
    8 In about 1969 Mr Jean Hantis, Mrs Lily Hantis, Mr de Groote and the prisoner, who was then about fourteen years old, came to Australia.  
     
      
    9 The prisoner was married to his wife, Mrs Theresa Hantis, in about 1974. There have been two children of the marriage, a son Daniel now aged twenty-nine and a daughter Victoria now aged nineteen. 
     
      
    10 At some time after the prisoner’s marriage his father Jean Hantis died. Thereafter Mrs Lily Hantis and Andre de Groote continued living together. 
     
      
    11 Mr de Groote conducted a sewing machine business in Wollongong, that is a business of selling new and second-hand sewing machines and repairing sewing machines. Mr de Groote later opened a similar business in Nowra and the prisoner became the manager of the business in Nowra. Subsequently Mr de Groote disposed of the business in Wollongong and for a period he and the prisoner worked together in the business in Nowra. About ten to fifteen years ago Mr de Groote retired and sold the sewing machine business in Nowra to the prisoner. After the sale of the business Mr de Groote continued to own the premises in which the business was conducted and continued to do some of the repairing of sewing machines. 
     
      
    12 The prisoner, who had once been in the army, was interested in firearms and kept a number of firearms in a safe in an extension to the garage at the house in Nowra where he lived with his wife. 
     
      
    13 Over a period of several months leading up to 28 September 2003 Mrs Theresa Hantis noticed certain changes in the prisoner’s behaviour, including drinking alcohol more heavily than he had previously and not being in bed when his wife, who was a nurse, returned from work in the early hours of the morning. From time to time during this period the prisoner complained to his wife about Mr de Groote’s conduct in connection with the business, including what the prisoner regarded as excessive use by Mr de Groote of a petrol card. During this period Mrs Theresa Hantis described the prisoner to his face as being “like a bear with a sore toe”. 
     
      
    14 The prisoner’s wife has herself carried on the sewing machine business in Nowra since 28 September 2003. She had previously played no part in the carrying on of the business. On reviewing the affairs of the business after 28 September 2003, she found that the prisoner had seriously neglected the business in the months leading up to 28 September 2003. 
     
      
    15 On the evening of Friday 26 September 2003 the prisoner and his wife attended a farewell dinner for final year students at the school their daughter was attending. At the dinner the prisoner appeared “distant” to his wife. On the night of Saturday 27 September 2003 the prisoner and his wife held a dinner party at their home. The prisoner appeared to his wife not to be interested in the dinner party. 
     
      
    16 The early part of Sunday 28 September 2003 was unremarkable. The prisoner read the newspapers, he and his wife went to a nursery and in the early afternoon they visited their son and his wife. 
     
      
    17 Later in the afternoon the prisoner went alone to an ex-servicemen’s club at Nowra, which he often patronised. Images taken by security cameras at the Club show the prisoner entering the Club at 3.47 in the afternoon. No images were taken of persons leaving the Club but the last image showing the prisoner at the Club was taken at 5.24 and I find that he left the Club shortly afterwards. 
     
      
    18 While he was at the Club, the prisoner had a light beer and won $200 on a poker machine. He did not become even slightly intoxicated. An employee of the Club, who knew the prisoner, observed that, unusually for him, the prisoner was unshaven and that he was “a bit quieter than normal”. 
     
      
    19 Police who later investigated the death of Mr de Groote found a letter in the prisoner’s handwriting in a pocket of the shirt the prisoner had been wearing on 28 September 2003. The letter was addressed to “Theresa, Victoria, Daniel”, that is to the prisoner’s wife, daughter and son. In the top right-hand corner of the first page of the letter appear the words and figures “3.40 pm Sunday”. I find that the prisoner wrote the letter on Sunday 28 September 2003 and had completed writing the letter by the time he entered the Club at 3.47 pm. The letter was in the following terms:- 
     
      
     
     
     “3.40 pm Sunday 
     
     
      
       
        
        Therese, Victoria, Daniel 
        
       
       
        
        Why did I do it? 
        
       
       
        
        It is because I have failed all of you. With me gone you should be able to restart. Curse me if you must, as I curse myself. 
        
       
       
        
        Please bury me next to my father Jean in Mollymook. 
        
       
       
        
        Close the shop and ask Wally to find someone to finalise it all. No fire sale in Nowra. Return anything and everything to companies to pay bills. The outstanding one can wait for the matter to go through the courts. Take no shit from anyone. But forever stop the vultures. 
        
       
       
        
        $5,000 on bedroom table should see you for a while. Get Cole to organise a garage sale to sell all the crap in the garage. Tool to Daniel if he want them otherwise sell sell sell. 
        
       
       
        
        I had to get rid of him. Not only he was stealing from the shop but was quite blatant about it as he said I owed him – what I do not know. He has been waging a mini war with mum and yes I have seen the bruises from where he hits her. 
        
       
       
        
        I do love all of you. 
        
       
       
        
        Jacques/Dad”. 
        
       
       
      A note in the margin on the first page of the letter read:- 
       
       
        
        “Do not reopen the shop. Put it all in the solicitors hands”. 
        
       
      
    20 This letter clearly disclosed an intention on the part of the prisoner to kill himself. The person referred to in the second last paragraph of the letter as “he” or “him” was Mr de Groote, who the prisoner believed had been stealing from the business and mistreating his mother. The words “I had to get rid of him” disclosed an intention on the part of the prisoner at the time he wrote the letter of getting rid of Mr de Groote by killing him. 
     
      
    21 On the following day 29 September 2003 Mrs Theresa Hantis found the sum of $5,000 in cash in her house. 
     
      
    22 After he left the Club on 28 September 2003, the prisoner drove to the house at Callala Bay, where Mr de Groote and his mother lived. The journey would have taken him about twenty minutes. The prisoner took with him in his vehicle a rifle out of the collection of firearms he kept in the safe in the extension to the garage at his home and he also took ammunition consisting of four cartridges. The prisoner took as many as four cartridges, so as to be sure to have sufficient ammunition to kill not only himself but also Mr de Groote. 
     
      
    23 In the absence of evidence from the prisoner (apart from some history later given to a psychiatrist Dr Westmore, which is recorded in reports by Dr Westmore), Mrs Lillian Hantis and, of course, Mr de Groote, it is not possible to make detailed findings of fact about what happened at the house at Callala Bay, after the prisoner had arrived at the house. I am, however, satisfied that the following facts have been established to the requisite standard. 
     
      
    24 After arriving at the house the prisoner did not immediately shoot either Mr de Groote or himself. A cigarette butt found in an ashtray in the kitchen of the house and a cigarette butt found on the back veranda or porch of the house were, according to DNA evidence, smoked by the prisoner. 
     
      
    25 Not long after he arrived at the house the prisoner attempted to fire the rifle but the rifle misfired. It is unclear in what circumstances the prisoner made this unsuccessful attempt to fire the rifle. An ejected misfired cartridge was later found by police inside the house. 
     
      
    26 The prisoner fired the rifle again, this time successfully. The bullet which was discharged entered the palm of Mr de Groote’s left hand, fractured a bone in the hand, exited the back of the hand, entered Mr de Groote’s left anterior chest wall, passed through his lungs, aorta and all four chambers of his heart and exited from the right side of his back. After passing through Mr de Groote’s body, the bullet ricocheted off a number of objects in the lounge room of the house and was later found by police close to where Mr de Groote’s body was found, lying between the kitchen and the lounge room of the house. 
     
      
    27 After shooting Mr de Groote, the prisoner walked outside the house on to the back veranda or porch. The prisoner operated the bolt of the rifle, thereby ejecting the fired cartridge case, which was later found by police. The action of operating the bolt brought up another cartridge into the chamber of the rifle. The prisoner then shot himself in the mouth, while holding the rifle with the muzzle inside or close to his mouth. The prisoner fell, seriously injured, to the floor of the veranda. Police later found the fired cartridge case inside the rifle. 
     
      
    28 I am satisfied that the prisoner shot himself on the back veranda of the house, yet police found the rifle inside the house close to the body of Mr de Groote. I accept the submission made by the Crown prosecutor at the trial that Mrs Lillian Hantis, who had been outside the house and witnessed her son shooting himself, picked up the rifle and put it inside the house.  
     
      
    29 A number of neighbours heard the sound of gunshots and went to the house. They saw the prisoner lying on the back veranda of the house, Mr de Groote lying on the floor between the kitchen and the lounge room of the house and the rifle lying near Mr de Groote’s feet. Mrs Lily Hantis, understandably, was distressed to the point of being hysterical. 
     
      
    30 Mr de Groote died immediately from the gunshot wound to his body. The prisoner, on the other hand, did not succeed in killing himself. It may be that in the act of shooting himself he was distracted by cries from his mother. 
     
      
    31 At the trial manslaughter was left to the jury on two bases, namely:- 
     
      
       
      1. That the prisoner was otherwise guilty of murder but his liability was reduced to liability for manslaughter by reason of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind pursuant to s 23A of the  
      Crimes Act 
      . 
       
       
      2. That the prisoner was not guilty of murder but was guilty of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. 
       
      
    32 As regards the first basis Dr Westmore gave evidence at the trial that he had seen and assessed the prisoner on a number of occasions after the shooting and had formed the opinion that at the time of the shooting the prisoner had been depressed and suicidal and had been suffering from an abnormality of mind, namely depression, which had substantially impaired the prisoner’s capacity to understand events and to judge whether his actions were right or wrong and might have affected his capacity to control himself. 
     
      
    33 In accordance with the principles stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Isaacs (1997) 90 A Crim R 587, it is part of my function as the sentencing judge to determine on what basis the prisoner is to be regarded as guilty of manslaughter and I am to discharge that function by myself determining on what basis the prisoner is guilty of manslaughter and not by endeavouring to determine on what basis the jury found the prisoner guilty of manslaughter. 
     
      
    34 At the trial it was part of the defence case that the jury should not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner had had the intent required for murder. This part of the defence case was based on parts of the history given by the prisoner to Dr Westmore and on evidence that the bullet which killed Mr de Groote had first struck his hand fracturing a bone in his hand, and not his torso, and evidence from a ballistics expert that the bullet, in passing through Mr de Groote’s hand and striking the bone, had been caused to deviate from its original path, so that there might be some doubt whether the prisoner had aimed at Mr de Groote’s body. 
     
      
    35 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr de Groote’s hand was close, or fairly close, to his body, at the time it was struck by the bullet and that the deviation by the bullet from its original path, between passing through Mr de Groote’s hand and entering his chest, was not substantial. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner was experienced and competent in the use of firearms and that the expression in the letter written by the prisoner “I had to get rid of him” disclosed an intention on the part of the prisoner to get rid of Mr de Groote by killing him. I conclude that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of firing the bullet which struck Mr de Groote the prisoner had the intention of killing Mr de Groote. 
     
      
    36 I also consider that I should accept the evidence given by Dr Westmore at the trial that at the time of the shooting the prisoner’s capacity was substantially impaired within s 23A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    37 Accordingly, I am satisfied that the prisoner should be regarded as guilty of manslaughter on the first basis left to the jury, namely that he was otherwise guilty of murder but his liability was reduced to liability for manslaughter by reason of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind pursuant to s 23A of the Crimes Act. In the proceedings on sentence neither counsel made any submission to the contrary of this conclusion. 
     
      
    38 Some of the more salient facts of the offence of manslaughter can be summarised as follows. The prisoner killed the victim by shooting him, with the intention of killing the victim. The offence was premeditated, to the extent that the prisoner had formed the intention of killing the victim by 3.40 on the afternoon of 28 September 2003. The prisoner travelled to the victim’s home, taking a rifle and ammunition. The prisoner believed that the victim had been stealing from the prisoner’s business and had been mistreating the prisoner’s mother. The prisoner intended to commit suicide himself after he had killed the victim and the prisoner made a serious attempt to kill himself. At the time of killing the victim the prisoner’s capacity to understand events, his capacity to judge whether his actions were right or wrong and his capacity to control himself were all substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind, the impairment being so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 
     
      
    39 The facts of the offence under the Firearms Act can be briefly stated. Police who searched the prisoner’s home on the night of 28 September 2003 found eleven firearms, for one of which the prisoner did not hold a licence or a permit. He held a licence or a permit for all of the other firearms. There is no suggestion of any failure by the prisoner to keep safely the firearms in his possession. 
     
      
    40 I will now summarise some events taking place after the shooting. 
     
      
    41 On the evening of 28 September 2003 the prisoner was taken to the Shoalhaven Hospital. At the Shoalhaven Hospital a large flap of his cheek that had been separated from other facial tissues by the gunshot was sutured, he was intubated and ventilated, he was sedated and antibiotics were administered. 
     
      
    42 The prisoner was transferred by helicopter to the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney. X-rays and a CT scan performed at the Hospital showed multiple fractures to the left side of his face. On 29 September 2003 an operation was performed on the prisoner, involving a transverse tracheotomy, a repair of a full thickness laceration of his face and the debridement and closure of the left maxilla-facial gunshot wound. 
     
      
    43 The prisoner was managed in the intensive care unit at the Prince of Wales Hospital between 29 September and 3 October. He was transferred to a ward on 3 October. On 10 October 2003 a further operation was performed, involving open reduction and internal fixation of a fracture of the angle of the left mandible. The prisoner commenced mobilisation on 14 October. On 21 November he was discharged from the Prince of Wales Hospital and admitted to a ward in the hospital at the Long Bay Correctional Centre.  
     
      
    44 At present the prisoner, as a result of the gunshot injury, is unable to close his left eye. He is on a waiting list for a canthopexy, that is surgery which would enable him to close his eye. He has other continuing impairments, as a result of the gunshot injury, to his teeth, sinuses and tongue.  
     
      
    45 The prisoner is also on a waiting list for radiotherapy to a lesion on his head. It is unclear whether the lesion has any connection with the events of 28 September 2003. 
     
      
    46 Copies of the following reports by Dr Westmore were admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence:- 
     
      
       
      1. Report of 8 December 2003 (examination of the prisoner on 3 December 2003) 
       
       
      2. Report of 11 August 2004 (examination of the prisoner on 6 August 2004. 
       
       
      3. Report of 15 November 2004 (examination of the prisoner on 2 November 2004). 
       
       
      4. Report of 25 February 2005 (examination of the prisoner on 23 February 2005). 
       
       
      5. Report of 15 April 2005 (examination of the prisoner on 9 April 2005). 
       
       
      6. Report of 30 May 2005 (no further examination of the prisoner). 
       
      
    47 In his report of 11 August 2004 Dr Westmore said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In my report of 8 December 2003 I indicated that Mr Hantis suffered from a depressive illness. His history and current presentation confirmed that diagnosis and I note that he is receiving increasing doses of antidepressants. He has a major depressive illness and I also note the significant disturbances in his biological functions. These include poor sleep initiation, anergia, severe weight loss and ongoing suicidal thoughts”. 
        
       
       
       . . .  
       
       
        
        “In relation to the availability of psychiatric defence, his history is that he was depressed and suicidal at the time of the incident…. He would have available to him the defence of substantial impairment. He was suffering from an abnormality of mind, specifically depression, which would have substantially impacted on his capacity to understand events in a rational and reasonable way and his depression would have prevented him from being able to consider, again in a rational way, whether his actions were right or wrong. His ability to control himself may also have been affected by the severity and nature of the depression and the suicidal thoughts he describes he was suffering from at the time of the homicide. 
        
       
       
        
        He requires ongoing psychiatric support and supervision and continuing treatment with antidepressants. He remains a suicide risk”. 
        
       
      
    48 In subsequent reports Dr Westmore did not depart from these opinions. 
     
      
    49 In his report of 25 February 2005 Dr Westmore said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “On reflection this man probably suffers a degree of post traumatic stress disorder as a result of his actions. Perpetrators of violent acts, as well as victims, can experience this condition and that disorder, along with his depression, are the major psychiatric problems facing Mr Hantis at this time”. 
        
       
      
    50 In his report of 15 April 2005 Dr Westmore related an account given to him by the prisoner about neurological treatment the prisoner had received. In his report Dr Westmore added:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I saw a typed report dated 8 April 2005 from the Institute of Neurological Sciences. This document indicates that Mr Hantis has been diagnosed with an A-V (arterio-venous) malformation. This vascular abnormality is affecting the right posterioparietal region of the brain. His initial presenting complaint was that he had suffered a sudden onset of increasing left side weakness, slurred speech and parasthesia of the left side of his face. The differential diagnosis for the identified abnormality was that he may have a high grade malignant lesion. The treatment recommended was for Mr Hantis to undergo stereotactic radio-surgery, this to be completed as an outpatient”. 
        
       
      
    51 When he gave evidence in the trial Dr Westmore was asked to express an opinion about the level or degree of the prisoner’s depression at the time of the shooting and he replied:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, it’s a retrospective opinion, because I didn’t examine him at the time, I’m relying on the limited history he could give about it, but if one draws some link between a depressed mood and ultimately his self-harming behaviour, you would have to say it was a severe depression”. 
        
       
      
    52 In evidence given in cross-examination by the Crown at the trial Dr Westmore said that his conclusions that the prisoner was suffering from severe depression at the time of the shooting and that the prisoner’s depression had not arisen at some time after the shooting, were based on the history the prisoner had given him, which was corroborated to some extent by the prisoner’s wife, and by the prisoner’s own act of self-harm in shooting himself. The contents of the letter written by the prisoner on 28 September 2003, which Dr Westmore described as being “morbid”, supported the conclusion that the prisoner was severely depressed at the time of the shooting. When asked whether any depressive illness the prisoner was suffering from could have developed after the shooting, Dr Westmore said that that would be a possible view, but only if the history given by the prisoner was dismissed and there was some alternative explanation for the prisoner’s attempt to commit suicide. 
     
      
    53 Dr Westmore gave further evidence in cross-examination at the trial:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A. Well the principal diagnosis is that of a depressive illness. I think he has had a major depression. In the alternative we would describe it as being a severe adjustment disorder. Adjustment disorders are reactive depressions and they tend to be more functional or variable. But they can also be quite significant in terms of their impact on a person’s life and their psychology. Major depressions tend to be associated with disturbances in sleep patterns, appetite, weight and libido. Both conditions can be associated with self harm. Major depressions are probably more genetic in origin, but not necessarily so. I thought he had a major depression which probably had been in place for several weeks, possibly months prior to the homicide/suicide and that it extended after that, but because of a lot of other reasons. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Having regard to a number of things in particular the limited history, is it possible that you may in fact be wrong about that, that he didn’t have a depressive illness prior to the incidents? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Well anything else is possible, but the history would support the proposition, although it’s limited. And again I’m accepting this aspect of his history. If he was suicidal two or three weeks prior to – his wife described him as being ‘like a bear with a sore toe’. If we accept when he says, ‘I felt so hopeless I don’t know why. I couldn’t see an end to whatever was going on in my head’. And writes a note which says, ‘it’s because I have failed you all’. And ‘with me gone you should be able to restart. Curse me if you must as I’ve cursed myself’. That’s quite a morbid content really. And I think that, limited as it is, combined with the ultimate violent act is strongly supportive of depression”. 
        
       
       
       . . .  
       
       
        
        “Q. It does not mean because of that he wasn’t aware of the right or wrong of his actions? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I think when that’s being considered other things need to be considered as well. This man, as far as I’m aware, doesn’t have a history of behaviour in such a way before. This is an extreme uncharacteristic act on behalf of this man. And if you look at the reasons why he states he took a life, may be, or shot somebody else, it’s because he was stealing from a shop and perhaps an aggression towards his mother. Psychologically people react in other ways to those sorts of stressors, rather than shooting somebody dead. It would suggest to me that this man acted so out of character in such an extreme way, against what might be moderate provocation, that such extreme behaviour suggests to me his capacity to think about what he was doing was impaired”. 
        
       
      
    54 In his final report of 30 May 2005, which was prepared for the proceedings on sentence, Dr Westmore said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As you are aware I have examined Mr Hantis now on a number of occasions and have provided a number of reports about him. I expressed the opinion that Mr Hantis was psychiatrically unwell at the time of the incident and on each occasion I examined him following the incident he demonstrated evidence of extreme emotional lability and depression of mood. 
        
       
       
        
        As I understand it, Mr Hantis does not have a prior history of aggression and he does not have an antisocial personality disorder. Episodic alcohol abuse is identified in his background, that probably occurred in part as a result of him attempting to ‘self medicate’ and alleviate his mood disorder symptoms. 
        
       
       
        
        The matters leading up to the death of Mr Hantis’ mother’s partner occurred as a result of many factors. Mr Hantis was depressed, he had concerns about the way the victim was treating his mother and possibly concerns about the victim’s involvement in some financial matters. 
        
       
       
        
        You have asked me to consider the likelihood of Mr Hantis reoffending in a violent manner. 
        
       
       
        
        Because of the highly specific nature of the events leading up to the matters now before the court, it would be my view that Mr Hantis’ risks of acting violently towards another person are very low, if they exist at all. He is at far greater risk of self harming. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Hantis requires regular, consistent psychiatric care both at this time and on his release to the community. He has a depressive illness which requires treatment with antidepressants and psychotherapy. He may need periods of hospitalisation. 
        
       
       
        
        Regarding the intracranial lesion, my understanding of that is that he has an AV malformation. This is an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein. These abnormalities often occur congenitally. They may also result from trauma but the opinion of a neurosurgeon should be sought regarding this issue. 
        
       
       
        
        I understand from the oncology radiologist, Dr Smee, that these lesions have a five percent per year risk of haemorrhaging. Mr Hantis has already had such a haemorrhage. The lesion will need to be treated and that can occur surgically or by radiotherapy. 
        
       
       
        
        I understand that Mr Hantis has elected to have his AV malformation treated with radiotherapy, as surgery can result in some neurological deficits. This is a matter which should be treated with some urgency in my view. 
        
       
       
        
        As noted above, Mr Hantis is a suicide risk, he will need to be monitored carefully and considerately by psychiatric services on his release to the community. He is fortunate to have the ongoing support of his family and I presume friends as well. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Hantis is a man with a number of personality strengths and attributes and these in addition to his community based supports, will no doubt assist him in his long term rehabilitation”. 
        
       
      
    55 In evidence in the proceedings on sentence Dr Westmore said that the prisoner had not in the past received, and would be unlikely to receive while he was a prisoner, the kind of psychiatric treatment and supervision he should be receiving. 
     
      
    56 I accept the opinions expressed by Dr Westmore which I have quoted or summarised. No countervailing psychiatric evidence was adduced by the Crown in either the trial or the proceedings on sentence. I take into account inter alia that the prisoner at the time of the shooting suffered and continues to suffer from severe depression, that the chances of him acting violently towards another person are very low but there is a much greater risk of the prisoner harming himself, that the prisoner continues to suffer physical impairments from his shooting himself and, whether or not it is connected with the shooting, the prisoner suffers from an arterio-venous malformation which has required treatment and will require further treatment. 
     
      
    57 I will now note some further subjective circumstances of the prisoner. 
     
      
    58 The prisoner has no previous criminal history and I am satisfied that he is, in general, not a violent person. 
     
      
    59 Before the shooting the prisoner took part in community activities. He had been the president of a local pistol club and had been the president of the local Boy Scout Group. 
     
      
    60 I accept that the prisoner accepts responsibility for having killed Mr de Groote and is deeply remorseful. 
     
      
    61 The prisoner’s wife has visited him every week while he has been in custody and gave evidence both in the trial and in the proceedings on sentence. She is strongly supportive of the prisoner. The prisoner’s two children attended court during the trial and the proceedings on sentence. 
     
      
    62 The maximum sentence for the crime of manslaughter is imprisonment for twenty-five years.  
     
      
    63 In sentencing the prisoner I take into account the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, including s 3A and s 21A. Because of his mental state at the time of committing the offence the prisoner is a less appropriate vehicle for fulfilling the sentencing purpose of general deterrence. I also accept that that there is little need for personal deterrence.  
     
      
    64 The Crown accepted that the sentence I impose should commence on 28 September 2003, even though the prisoner was not arrested and did not pass into the custody of the Department of Correctional Services until some time later. From the evening of 28 September 2003 the prisoner was under police guard.  
     
      
    65 It was also accepted by the Crown that I should find special circumstances within s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. A sufficient reason for such a finding would be the prisoner’s need for psychiatric supervision and treatment of a kind and intensity which he is unlikely to be able to receive while he remains in custody. 
     
      
    66 I was referred by the Crown prosecutor to the well known passage in the judgment of Gleeson CJ in R v Blacklidge [NSWCCA 12 December 1995 unreported], which was a case of manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility, which was a predecessor of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. Gleeson CJ said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability. At the same time, the courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved in every case of manslaughter is the felonious taking of a human life. That is the starting point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case”. 
        
       
      
    67 Both the Crown prosecutor and counsel for the prisoner, while accepting that each case of manslaughter depends very much on its own facts, referred me to a number of sentencing decisions for offences of manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment or diminished responsibility. In the cases to which I was referred the total terms of the sentences imposed ranged from very low terms (and even a recognisance) to terms of about thirteen years (if the occasional case in which a much more severe sentence was imposed is disregarded). In all or virtually all of the sentences the minimum term or non-parole period was less than three quarters of the total term.  
     
      
    68 Taking into account all the objective facts and all the subjective circumstances and having regard to the purposes of sentencing, I have concluded that the following sentences should be imposed. 
     
      
    69 Jacques Louis Guy Hantis:- 
     
      
    70 For the offence of manslaughter I sentence you to a non-parole period of four years commencing on 28 September 2003 and expiring on 27 September 2007 with a balance of the term of four years commencing on 28 September 2007 and expiring on 27 September 2011. 
     
      
    71 For the offence of possessing a firearm without being authorised to do so I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of six months commencing on 28 September 2003 and expiring on 27 March 2004. 
     
      
    72 The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 27 September 2007.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 STUDDERT J: The Court is in a position to deliver judgment immediately and I will ask Justice James to deliver judgment. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: This is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act against a sentence imposed on the respondent Jade Ebony Wicks in the District Court at Armidale on 4 February 2005 by his Honour Judge Coorey. For an offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon committed on 6 May 2004, to which the respondent had pleaded guilty, Judge Coorey imposed a sentence of imprisonment totalling three years with a non parole period of eight months twenty eight days commencing on 6 May 2004 and expiring on 3 February 2005, that is on the day before his Honour passed sentence, and a balance of the term from 4 February 2005 to 5 May 2007. 
     
      
    3 The respondent had been arrested on 6 May 2004 soon after committing the offence and had remained in custody referable to this offence from 6 May 2004 to the date on which she was sentenced. 
     
      
    4 On 4 February 2005 his Honour made a parole order directing that the respondent be immediately released from custody. His Honour imposed as conditions of the parole order that the respondent report to the Probation and Parole Service at Tamworth, that she accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and that she undergo continuing psychiatric counselling and medication as advised by her medical practitioners and particularly a psychiatrist Dr Parmegiani.  
     
      
    5 The facts of the offence and of events immediately following commission of the offence were stated by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence in a way which closely followed a facts sheet admitted without objection in the proceedings on sentence and which has not been the subject of any criticism on the hearing of this appeal. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The prisoner, on 6 May 2004 at around 2.45pm, walked to a store and threatened the victim with a knife and demanded money from the cash register. The prisoner grabbed the wrist of the victim, causing bruising. The victim opened the cash register and the prisoner left with a total of $1340. The prisoner, ran from the store to her vehicle and she was arrested shortly thereafter when she was stoped by police highway officers who had recognised the vehicle from the description circulated of the robbery. The prisoner volunteered to the police that there was ‘weed’ in the vehicle and she also indicated some dried vegetable matter. This was identified by the prisoner as marijuana and then she was arrested. 
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner was taken to Glen Innes Police Station and, when spoken to, admitted that she was responsible for the robbery of the store referred to above. She took police officers to the site where she had indicated the place where she had concealed the stolen money from the store. All of the money was recovered and the prisoner was then returned to the Glen Innes Police Station. 
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner later showed police officers the whereabouts of the knife and the police were able to attend with a search warrant. The prisoner was then interviewed and made full admissions in relation to the offence. The prisoner told the police officers that she suffered from mental disabilities, including psychosis and depression. She told the police officers that she hears voices in her head all the time. The voices have told her to carry out the robbery or they would kill her. The prisoner expressed deep remorse to the police officers and regret for what she had done to the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner related, in relation to the cannabis leaf and hashish that had been found, that she kept that for her personal use only”. 
        
       
      
    6 Some of the subjective features of the respondent can be briefly stated. The respondent was born in Tamworth in March 1978 and is, accordingly, now 27 years old. At the time of being sentenced she had never met her father. Her mother had been violent and abusive to her while she was a child and she was raised by her maternal grandmother. She had accepted as her step-father a man with whom her mother had a relationship. At the age of eighteen the respondent commenced using cannabis and she was subsequently a heavy user of cannabis. The respondent has never married and has no children. 
     
      
    7 An important matter in the original sentencing of the respondent and on this appeal has been the respondent’s mental condition. I have already referred to the sentencing judge’s summary in his remarks on sentence of what the respondent had told police officers about her mental disabilities, including her hearing voices telling her to commit the robbery or she would be killed.  
     
      
    8 The respondent gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence and in his remarks on sentence his Honour summarised some of that evidence, including evidence by the respondent that she had suffered from auditory hallucinations. 
     
      
    9 In his remarks on sentence his Honour said he had closely studied reports by a forensic psychiatrist Dr Yvonne Skinner, which had been admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence.  
     
      
    10 In her first report dated 17 September 2004 Dr Skinner said she had seen the respondent in prison on 9 September 2004. The respondent had told Dr Skinner that she had had her first hallucination, a visual hallucination, at the age of sixteen, before she had ever used drugs or alcohol. After the respondent moved to Sydney and commenced to use cannabis she had had feelings of paranoia. A psychiatrist Dr Parmegiani made a provisional diagnosis of a delusional disorder or schizophrenia and prescribed medication. When the respondent took this medication, she suffered from gynaecological side effects. After being taken into custody the respondent had continued to experience auditory hallucinations. 
     
      
    11 In her report Dr Skinner noted, from medical records of the Tamworth Base Hospital, that in the year 2000 the respondent had been suffering from an acute psychosis and had been admitted to the Tamworth Base Hospital Psychiatric Unit for treatment. She had been placed on a continuing treatment order under the Mental Health Act for six months and this order had later been extended for another six months. During this period the respondent attended an out patients clinic, where she was seen by Dr Parmegiani. 
     
      
    12 In her report Dr Skinner stated the following opinions about the respondent:- 
     
      
       
        
        “She suffers from an underlying severe mental illness, schizophrenia. I note that on her admission to Tamworth Base Hospital in the year 2000 there was some uncertainty about diagnosis because she was taking drugs at the time and it was thought that she might have been suffering from a psychotic episode caused by substance abuse. However, she has not been using any illicit substances or alcohol since her arrest. It has been established and confirmed by a number of psychiatrists in the prison that she is in fact suffering from the chronic mental illness, schizophrenia. Her symptoms have been reduced with antipsychotic medication, although she continues to experience auditory hallucinations. 
        
       
       
        
        Based on the history given by her, her history of treatment for mental illness and my conversation with Dr Parmegiani, it is my opinion that Ms Wicks was suffering from a severe mental illness, chronic schizophrenia. I believe that she was suffering from this illness and experiencing auditory hallucinations at the time of the alleged offences and that her mental illness affected her judgment at the time. I believe that she did know the difference between right and wrong, but her ability to control her actions and her judgment were impaired by her mental illness. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Wicks comes from an unfortunate background of emotional and physical abuse. She has a vulnerable personality because of her background…” 
        
       
      
    13 Dr Skinner furnished a second report dated 26 November 2004. Dr Skinner had seen the respondent again in prison on 17 September 2004, when Dr Skinner, who happened to be at the prison for another reason, was asked to see a seriously ill prisoner who turned out to be the respondent. Dr Skinner had subsequently seen the respondent again on 19 November 2004. In her report of 26 November 2004 Dr Skinner stated that after she had seen the respondent on 9 September 2004 the respondent’s condition had deteriorated. When Dr Skinner saw the respondent in prison on 23 September 2004 the respondent was catatonic and mute. She was sitting in a hunched position with her arms held awkwardly by her sides. She was unable to swallow. On 22 September she had set her hair alight. Because of her catatonic state and the risk of dehydration, the respondent was taken to the Prince of Wales Hospital, where she was given electro-convulsive therapy. She was discharged from the Prince of Wales Hospital and returned to the Long Bay Prison Hospital.  
     
      
    14 In her report of 26 November 2004 Dr Skinner said that in her opinion the respondent was suffering from chronic schizophrenia and the respondent had suffered a severe exacerbation of her illness while in prison. 
     
      
    15 Dr Skinner furnished a further report dated 28 January 2005, having seen the respondent earlier that day. In this report Dr Skinner said she considered that the respondent’s mental state had shown definite improvement. In her report Dr Skinner stated:  
     
      
       
        
        “Jade Wicks suffers from mental illness, chronic schizophrenia. She has recovered from a severe exacerbation of illness and responded to treatment with ECT. Her condition has stabilised. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Wicks requires ongoing treatment with medication and psychiatric supervision. In the past she attended regular appointments with Dr Parmegiani at Tamworth and took medication. If she returns to live in the Tamworth area she should resume this contact with her treating psychiatrist and the community mental health centre. If she lives in another area she should contact the community mental health centre to arrange follow-up appointments. This should be done before her release from prison. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Wicks comes from a background of emotional deprivation and physical and sexual abuse. She is intelligent and capable of furthering her studies, but was disadvantaged by family problems and frequent changes of school during her childhood and adolescence”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    16 The sentencing judge clearly accepted the opinions expressed by Dr Skinner in her reports and it was clearly open to the sentencing judge to do so. No countervailing evidence had been adduced by the Crown. 
     
      
    17 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge, apart from referring to the evidence given in the proceedings on sentence by the respondent and to the reports of Dr Skinner, referred to evidence by the respondent’s step-father that he lived within an hour’s drive of Tamworth, that the respondent would be able to live with him and that he would assist the respondent to take her medication. 
     
      
    18 The sentencing judge also referred to evidence given by the respondent’s solicitor that he had spoken to Dr Parmegiani and Dr Parmegiani had told the solicitor he attended Tamworth twice a week and would be able to see the respondent. 
     
      
    19 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge found the objective seriousness of the offence had been aggravated by the circumstances that the victim of the offence had been vulnerable, that some harm including emotional harm had been caused to the victim by the commission of the offence and the offence had been committed while the respondent had been on conditional liberty. 
     
      
    20 On the other hand the sentencing judge found that the objective seriousness of the offence was mitigated by the respondent’s mental state at the time of commission of the offence and the respondent had not been fully aware of the consequences of her actions because of her mental disability. His Honour considered that the respondent’s mental state at the time of the commission of the offence differentiated the present case from the typical case of armed robbery described by the Chief Justice in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at 380 (162). 
     
      
    21 I have mentioned that the sentencing judge found that the offence had been committed while the respondent was on conditional liberty. 
     
      
    22 The respondent’s criminal history is quite brief. Apart from the present offence and a driving offence, she had been charged on 27 February 2004 with offences of supplying a prohibited drug, making a false instrument and using a false instrument and had been granted bail. She was on this bail at the time she committed the offence of armed robbery on 7 May 2004. On 7 May 2004 the respondent was charged with the offences committed on that day of possession of a prohibited drug and self-administering a prohibited drug. All of these five offences were dealt with in the Local Court on 21 July 2004 when the Magistrate directed that the respondent enter into a two year good behaviour bond. 
     
      
    23 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge found some favourable subjective features in that the respondent had entered an early plea of guilty and had demonstrated contrition. 
     
      
    24 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge referred to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 and, in particular, to the judgment of Sperling J at pars 33 to 36. 
     
      
    25 Judge Coorey, applying the principles stated by Sperling J in Hemsley, found that the punishment which should be imposed on the respondent should be moderated, because her mental illness had contributed to the commission of the offence in a material way, because her mental illness rendered the respondent a less appropriate vehicle for general deterrence and because a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily on the respondent than on a prisoner without her mental illness.  
     
      
    26 As regards the fourth matter referred to by Sperling J in par 36 of his judgment in Hemsley, that is, the level of danger which the offender presents to the community, which can be a factor requiring a more severe sentence, his Honour clearly accepted a submission made on behalf of the respondent that the respondent was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    27 His Honour found special circumstances within s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in the respondent’s need for lengthy and close supervision because of her severe mental illness and he found that there was a specific plan for rehabilitation of the respondent, involving her living near Tamworth and undertaking psychiatric treatment by Dr Parmegiani, who had treated her in the past. His Honour proceeded to pass the sentence and to make the parole order which I have set out earlier in this judgment. 
     
      
    28 Unfortunately the specific plan proposed in the proceedings on sentence which his Honour had attempted to facilitate by the orders he made, was not fulfilled. On 14 February 2005 the respondent asked her parole officer in Tamworth for permission to go to Glen Innes for a few days and permission was granted. Subsequently, contact between the respondent and her Probation and Parole Officer in Tamworth was limited. In a report dated 2 March 2005 the Probation and Parole Office recommended that the respondent’s parole be revoked. Part of the report was in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Wicks’ response to supervision has been poor, with contact over the past two weeks mainly by telephone. She appears to be living an itinerant lifestyle, in unstable accommodation and does not seem to be complying with the obligations to her Parole Order. As Ms Wicks has mental health problems, which have previously seen her in Long Bay Hospital in a catatonic state, it would appear imperative that she be in a stable environment and maintain regular sessions with the Community Mental Health Team. She would seem reluctant to conform to such. It would further appear she has been avoiding contact with Doctor Parmegiani and ongoing psychiatric counselling. In addition it is unclear whether she remains on prescribed medication.” 
        
       
      
    29 The respondent’s parole was revoked on 4 March 2005, with effect from 18 March 2005, and the respondent has been in custody since 18 March 2005. 
     
      
    30 At a meeting of the Parole Board on 26 April 2005 the Board adjourned consideration of the respondent’s parole to the 24 June 2005, to await the outcome of this appeal. 
     
      
    31 In this appeal the Court provisionally received an affidavit by the respondent and an affidavit by a solicitor acting for the respondent. In her affidavit the respondent admitted she had breached conditions of her parole. 
     
      
    32 I have set out these events occurring since the respondent was sentenced but on the hearing of this appeal neither the Crown Prosecutor nor counsel for the respondent suggested that these events occurring after the respondent was sentenced should be taken into account in determining whether the sentencing judge erred in passing the sentence he did on the respondent. 
     
      
    33 On this Crown appeal it was submitted by the Crown in written submissions that the offence was objectively serious and that the objective gravity of the offence was aggravated by a number of circumstances. It was submitted that the offence was more serious than the typical case described by the Chief Justice in his judgment in Henry. A matter particularly urged by the Crown in oral submissions was that the sentencing judge had failed to take into account the fourth matter referred to by Sperling J in his judgment in Hemsley, namely the level of dangerousness the respondent presented to the community. It was submitted by the Crown that, by giving undue weight to the respondent’s subjective circumstances, the sentencing judge had failed to impose a sentence, and particularly a non-parole period, which properly reflected the objective seriousness of the offence and had imposed a total sentence and a non-parole period which were manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    34 It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that the respondent’s offence, before allowing for her mental state, was similar to the typical case in Henry; that the uncontested evidence was that at the time of the offence the respondent had suffered and up to the time of sentencing the respondent had continued to suffer from the severe mental illness of chronic schizophrenia; that, because of her mental illness, a less severe sentence had properly been imposed for reasons identified by Sperling J in Hemsley; that a wide discretion should be allowed to a judge at first instance in sentencing an offender who has a serious mental illness; that this court, before it could allow the Crown appeal, would have to find the sentencing judge had made some error and that the respondent’s failure, after she had been sentenced, to comply with the conditions of her parole was not relevant to whether, at the time he sentenced the respondent, the sentencing judge had made some error. 
     
      
    35 The principles to be applied by this court in determining Crown appeals against sentence were stated by Wood CJ at CL in his judgment in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at (70). His Honour recently quoted this paragraph of his judgment in Wall in his judgment in R v Mills [2005] NSWCCA 175 at (75). At paragraph (70) of his judgment in Wall Wood CJ at CL said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown contends that not only was the sentence imposed inadequate on its face, but also that the sentencing judge made a number of errors of principle in determining that it was appropriate to proceed under s19B of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1914. Before considering these submissions it is important to note the principles which apply in relation to the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence: 
         
          
         
        (a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
        House v The King 
         (1936) 55 CLR 499, applies to Crown appeals against sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion, as to the appropriate sentence, for that of the sentencing judge:  
        Lowndes v The Queen 
         (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown;  
        R v Tait 
         (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para58 and para109. 
         
          
         
        (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
        Malvaso v The Queen 
         (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere:  
        R v Baker 
         [2000] NSWCCA 85. 
         
          
         
        (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle ‘for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons’: per Barwick CJ in  
        Griffiths v The Queen 
         (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
        Everett v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299;  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         (2000) 202 CLR 32, at para61 and para62, and  
        Wong & Leung v The Queen 
         at para109. 
         
          
         
        (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
        R v Allpass 
         (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
        R v Papazis 
         (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         at para110. 
         
          
         
        (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
        R v Holder and Johnston 
         (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         at par 62”. 
         
        
       
      
    36 In the present case the offence was objectively serious. However, a number of the factors relied upon by the Crown as aggravating the objective seriousness of the offence are in fact included in the description of the typical case in Henry for which the Chief Justice said that a total sentence of four to five years would generally be appropriate, including that the respondent had little criminal history, that the respondent was armed with a knife, that there was only a limited degree of planning, that the actual violence was limited and that the victim was in a vulnerable position as being a shop-keeper. It is true that the respondent was on conditional liberty at the time of committing the offence of armed robbery but for quite different and fairly minor offences. In favour of the respondent she had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, whereas the typical case in Henry postulates only a late plea of guilty. 
     
      
    37 In my opinion, it was open to his Honour to take the view that the respondent’s offence, even before allowing for her mental illness, was no worse than the typical case in Henry. It was then open to his Honour to accept, as he did, the uncontested evidence that at the time of committing the offence the respondent had been suffering, and at the time of being sentenced she was continuing to suffer, from a severe mental illness of chronic schizophrenia and to find that the respondent’s culpability had been reduced, because her mental illness had contributed to the commission of the offence in a material way, her mental illness rendered her a less appropriate vehicle for general deterrence and a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily on her, as it already had, than on a prisoner not having her mental illness. 
     
      
    38 His Honour’s finding, that despite her mental illness the respondent was unlikely to re-offend, was a finding open to his Honour and could not be challenged in this court and rebuts the submission made by the Crown on this appeal that the sentencing judge failed to take into account the possibility of future dangerousness.  
     
      
    39 There was clearly a need for the respondent to obtain psychiatric treatment and in the proceedings on sentence the Crown expressly accepted that the sentencing judge could make a finding of special circumstances. The sentencing judge accepted evidence given in the proceedings on sentence by the respondent’s step-father and, indirectly, by the psychiatrist Dr Parmegiani, who had treated the respondent in the past, that, if released from custody, the respondent could reside with her step-father and would be able to obtain regular psychiatric treatment from Dr Parmegiani.  
     
      
    40 In all the circumstances I do not consider his Honour should have been held to have erred in setting a total sentence of three years. It is more questionable whether it was within his Honour’s sentencing discretion to set a non-parole period as low as the non-parole period set by his Honour. However, having regard to the evidence before his Honour, which his Honour accepted, the respondent’s comparative lack of criminal history including a lack of any criminal history involving offences of violence, I have come to the conclusion that the non-parole period set by his Honour, low as it was, was not outside the permissible range for the exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. Even if this were not the case, now that the respondent has served more than a further three months in custody, so that the total time the respondent has spent in custody exceeds a year, I would consider that the court, in the exercise of the wide discretion it has in determining Crown appeals, should not intervene. 
     
      
    41 In my opinion the Crown appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    42 STUDDERT J: I agree that this court should not intervene. I agree with the orders proposed. 
     
      
    43 HOWIE J: I agree with the order proposed and the reasons given by Justice James. 
     
      
    44 STUDDERT J: Accordingly, the order of the court will be those proposed by Mr Justice James.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Hislop J. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour, for the reasons given by his Honour. 
     
      
    2 As his Honour indicates at pars 28 and 29 of his judgment and as was stated by Howie J in R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193, a sentencing judge should not in his remarks on sentence refer to a possible circumstance of aggravation or of mitigation, without proceeding to make a finding about whether the circumstance has or has not been established. 
     
      
    3 In the present case I consider that there was no basis on which the sentencing judge could have found that the offence committed by the applicant, which included punching the victim twice on the face causing the victim pain but no injury, involved gratuitous cruelty (s 21A(2)(f)) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) or that the injury caused by the offence was substantial (s 21A(2)(g)) or that the victim was vulnerable (s 21A(2)(l)). In regard to the last matter I note that the victim did not fall within any of the examples given in s 21A(2)(l), the offence was committed in the early evening and there were two witnesses within five metres of the applicant and the victim. 
     
      
    4 HISLOP J: The applicant pleaded guilty to the offence of assault with intent to rob in circumstances of aggravation contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 95(1). The maximum penalty for such an offence is 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    5 On 6 April 2004, the applicant was sentenced for that offence in the District Court to imprisonment for a total period of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 22 June 2003 with the balance of the sentence of 2 years to date from 22 June 2006 and expire on 21 June 2008. 
     
      
    6 The applicant has sought leave to appeal against that sentence on the ground that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    7 The facts of the offence, as stated by the sentencing judge in his Remarks on Sentence, were: 
     
      
       
        
        On 22 June 2003, Mr Hossain went to Granville railway station at or about 7.20pm. He was walking on platform number two when the offender approached him and asked him to, “give me two bucks”. When the victim did not give the offender the money, the offender then said, “I think you have a mobile, give me your mobile”. Thereafter there was some aggressive conversation between the two and a further request for the mobile was given to the victim by the offender. He then stepped closer to the victim who had refused to give him his mobile and the victim then put his hand on the offender’s chest to stop him coming closer. The offender then pushed his hands into the victim’s pocket to get the mobile phone. The victim took out his wallet, revealing a $20 note. The offender then allegedly said, “give me $10 or $20 or your mobile”. The victim replied that he could not, and the offender said that if he did not, he would strike him. Then he raised his right hand into the air, forming a fist, and punched the victim with his right hand to the left cheek. The offender then said, “Don’t waste my time, give me your mobile”. The victim shook his head, and the offender then punched him again in the left cheek… the offender walked up the stairs of the railway station…The police attended the scene…arrested (the applicant) and conveyed him to Parramatta police station where he appeared to be affected by alcohol, as he had slurred speech, red eyes and struggled to stand on his feet.  
        
       
      
    8 His Honour also noted evidence of an eyewitness that the victim was 5 ft 1 in. tall, skinny built and that the applicant was about 6 ft tall and of heavy build. The eyewitness saw a “strong punch” being made by the applicant with a closed fist to the left cheek or jaw area of the victim. He said it was a strong punch because he heard it connect with the victim’s face. His Honour also noted that the victim was 21 years old. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was born on 18 September 1982 of Samoan parents. He left school in year 9 and has engaged in various forms of employment since that date. He has a significant criminal history commencing in 1998 which includes, relevantly, offences of assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, assault with intent to rob, demand money with menaces, larceny, break and enter, resist police, and stalk/intimidate with intent to cause fear. His latest convictions prior to the present offence were for aggravated robbery and robbery. He was sentenced for these offences on 8 March 2002. On the robbery charge he received a sentence of 12 months imprisonment commencing on 31 March 2001 and expiring on 30 March 2002 and for the aggravated robbery offence a sentence of imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months commencing on 30 March 2002 with a non-parole period of 12 months. He was on a bond and on parole at the time of the subject offence. 
     
      
    10 The applicant has submitted that a lesser sentence would have been imposed by his Honour but for errors which occurred in the sentencing process. These errors have been particularised as follows:  
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The sentencing judge erred in having additional regard to an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
         which was an element of the offence. 
         
         
        2. The sentencing judge erred in finding additional aggravating factors which were not available to him on the facts of the case. 
         
         
        3. His Honour erred in failing to properly take into account the applicant’s intellectual deficits. 
         
         
        4. His Honour erred in failing to give the applicant the full benefit of his early plea of guilty. 
         
         
        5. His Honour failed to properly balance the serious objective circumstances of this offence with the subjective case for the offender.  
        
       
      
    11 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”) s 21A provides relevantly:  
     
      
       
        
        (1) In determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the court is to take into account the following matters: 
         
         
          
          (a) the aggravating factors referred to in subsection (2) that are relevant and known to the court, 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the mitigating factors referred to in subsection (3) that are relevant and known to the court, 
          
         
         
          
          (c) any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence. 
          
         
         
        The matters referred to in this subsection are in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under any Act or rule of law. 
         
         
        (2) The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are (relevantly for present purposes) as follows: 
         
          
          … 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the offence involved the actual or threatened use of violence… 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the offender has a record of previous convictions… 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) the offence involved gratuitous cruelty… 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial… 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (l) the victim was vulnerable, for example, because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability, or because of the victim’s occupation (such as a taxi driver, bank teller or service station attendant)… 
          
         
         
        The court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence. 
         
         
        (3) The mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are [relevantly for present purposes] as follows… 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (j) the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his or her actions because of the offender’s age or any disability… 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (4) The court is not to have regard to any such aggravating or mitigating factor in sentencing if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so. 
         
         
        (5) The fact that any such aggravating or mitigating factor is relevant and known to the court does not require the court to increase or reduce the sentence for the offence. 
        
       
      
    12 His Honour, in his Remarks on Sentence, said: 
     
      
       
        
        It is also necessary for the Court to take into account aggravating and mitigating factors under s 21A. 21A(2) provides aggravating factors to be taken into account. These are:… [relevantly for present purposes] (b) the offence involved the actual and threatened use of violence. This is indeed what occurred here.…(d) the offender has a record of previous convictions. The offender in this case has a lengthy history of convictions…(f) the offence involved gratuitous cruelty. One might reasonably argue that that is the case. (g) The injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial. It depends upon one’s interpretation of the word “substantial”. In this case, a person who was vulnerable on a railway station was subjected to a violent attack without consideration to his safety…(l) the victim was vulnerable.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
      Particular One – The sentencing judge erred in having additional regard to an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
       (“the Act”) which was an element of the offence. 
       
      
    13 The elements of the offence for which the applicant was sentenced were assault with intent to rob in circumstances of aggravation, namely, uses corporal violence on any person.14 The applicant submitted that his Honour infringed the requirement of the concluding words of s 21A(2) by taking into account as an aggravating factor the fact that the offence involved the actual or threatened use of violence (s 21A(2)(b)) when such were elements of the offence. 
     
      
    15 In R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193, Howie J, (with whom the other members of the court agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        [22] When a sentencing court is about to consider matters of aggravation or mitigation under s 21A it is important that it recognises the limits upon the use to be made of those factors. The first is that found in relation to factors of aggravation in s 21A(2) which, after listing a number of aggravating features, provides: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The effect and policy behind such a limitation is self-evident: there should be no double counting of aggravating features of an offence. 
        
       
      
    16 In R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, this Court held: 
     
      
       
        
        [106] As s 21A(2)(e) makes clear, the factors, which are elements integral to the offence, are not to be taken, of themselves, as aggravating factors. For example, the bare fact that an offence was committed in company where that is an element of the offence… cannot have an additional or cumulative effect.  
        
       
       
        
        [107] That is not to say, however, that the nature and extent of the company, and the manner in which their presence and behaviour add to the menace of the occasion, cannot be regarded as circumstances relevant to the seriousness of the actual offence which is charged. Clearly the presence of a large number of overbearing and powerful companions can dramatically increase the objective seriousness, and moral culpability, of those who engage in a sexual assault of a lone victim, and s 21A(2)(e) should not be regarded as excluding a reference to any such consideration. 
        
       
      
    17 The sentencing judge’s reference to aggravating factor (2)(b) followed the comment: 
     
      
       
        
        It is also necessary for the court to take into account aggravating…factors under s 21A. Section 21A(2) provides aggravating factors to be taken into account. These are….  
        
       
       
      In these circumstances it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that his Honour infringed the requirement of the concluding words of s 21A(2) and I conclude error has been demonstrated in this regard. However, the Remarks on Sentence otherwise do not suggest his Honour gave any additional or cumulative effect to this factor and the infringement, in my opinion, is of little practical significance.  
       
       
      Particular Two – The sentencing Judge erred in finding additional aggravating factors which were not available to him on the facts of the case. 
      
    18 The applicant submits his Honour erred in his findings as to aggravating factors (2)(d), (f), (g) and (l). 
     
      
       
      Section 21A(2)(d) 
       
      
    19 His Honour correctly stated the applicant had a lengthy history of convictions. The applicant however, relied upon the comments of Howie J in R v Wickham to demonstrate error. 
     
      
    20 In R v Wickham, Howie J held: 
     
      
       
        
        [23] The second limitation is that found in s 21A(4), which provides: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The court is not to have regard to any such aggravating or mitigating factor in sentencing if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The effect of this provision is to ensure that a factor is not taken into account in a way inconsistent with general sentencing principles and policy. It was the intention of Parliament to replicate the common law. 
        
       
       
        
        [24] This provision can operate in one of two ways. Firstly, it can impose a limitation on the use to be made of a particular factor not otherwise apparent in the provisions of s 21A(2) or (3). For example, s 21A(2)(d) provides that an aggravating feature is that, “the offender has a record of previous convictions”. On its face, that provision would indicate that a prior criminal record is a matter of aggravation by making the offence more serious. Yet the common law rule is that a prior record does not have the effect of aggravating an offence, but it may either deprive the offender of leniency or indicate that more weight is to be given to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community;  
        R v Shankley 
         [2003] NSWCCA 253 at [31]. It has been held that s 21A(2)(d) should be read according to that common law principle;  
        R v Johnson 
         [2004] NSWCCA 76.  
        
       
      
    21 The context in which his Honour made reference to factor (2)(d) suggests error has occurred. However, the Remarks on Sentence, considered as a whole, do not indicate this had any material impact on the ultimate sentence.  
     
      
      Section 21A(2)(f), (g) 
       
      
    22 The applicant submitted his Honour found as an aggravating factor that the offence involved “gratuitous cruelty” (subsection (2)(f)) and that, on the facts before the court, this finding was “simply wrong”. The applicant submitted gratuitous cruelty involved actions significantly more serious that two punches to the face, punches that caused pain but no noticeable or lasting damage or injury.  
     
      
    23 The Macquarie Dictionary defines gratuitous, inter alia, as “being without reason, cause or justification”. The same dictionary defines cruelty, inter alia, as “causing, or marked by, great pain or distress.” Clearly, the application of (2)(f) depends upon matters of fact and degree. 
     
      
    24 However his Honour did not determine the issue. He merely said, “One might reasonably argue that was the case”.  
     
      
    25 The applicant also submitted his Honour found as an aggravating factor that there was substantial injury (subsection (2)(g)) caused by the offence, and in making this finding his Honour was “simply wrong”. It was submitted that an assault such as this, although serious because it must have caused the victim considerable anxiety and in its potential for greater physical harm, could never be regarded as causing “substantial injury”. 
     
      
    26 The Macquarie Dictionary defines “substantial” as, “of ample or considerable amount, quantity, size”. The application of (2)(g) clearly raises questions of fact and degree as to which minds may differ.  
     
      
    27 His Honour did not find the injury was substantial. He merely said, “It depends upon one’s interpretation of the word ‘substantial’”.  
     
      
    28 In Wickham, Howie J held: 
     
      
       
        
        [31] It is also, in my view, unsatisfactory for a court to refer to a factor of aggravation or mitigation without making a finding as to whether it existed or not, or without indicating that no finding was being made as to the presence or absence of that particular factor.  
        
       
      
    29 The sentencing judge’s comments as to factors (2)(f) and (2)(g) are open to the criticism made by Howie J in Wickham. However, in my opinion, it would be unproductive to pursue the issue. His Honour was well aware of the nature of the punches and their effect as disclosed by the evidence. Section 21A(1)(c) of the Act directs the court, in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, to take into account, “Any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence”. In my opinion, the nature and extent of the physical violence was an objective factor relevant to the seriousness of the offence, which factor his Honour was entitled to take into account in determining the appropriate sentence, whether it be an aggravating factor within a category specified in s 21A(2) or simply taken into account pursuant to s 21A(1)(c).  
     
      
      Section 21A(2)(l) 
       
      
    30 His Honour expressly found aggravating factor (2)(l) (“The victim was vulnerable”) established. He explained what he meant in the context of this case as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        As I said, the victim was on a railway station. It is common for the Courts to see a modus operandi involving railway stations and persons on railway stations. The fact that that is a common matter is not something that I have taken into account in either aggravation or mitigation of the offence here but merely note the fact of what is regularly observed in these Courts. The fact that somebody is on a railway station, that they are on the railway station in circumstances where it is difficult for them to escape, with the drop onto the railway tracks on each side, is well known. 
        
       
      
    31 The applicant did not assert in his written submissions, or initially, orally, that his Honour had erred in finding that the victim was vulnerable. However in the course of argument such an assertion was made, the submission being that such a categorisation was confined to victims of the type referred in the examples given in subsection (2)(l) – see R v Williams [2005] NSWCCA 99 per Buddin J at [41].  
     
      
    32 The matters which caused his Honour to categorise the victim as vulnerable were objective factors which affected the relative seriousness of the offence, and which his Honour was entitled to take into account pursuant to s 21A(1)(c) if those matters were not appropriately categorised as within s 21A(2)(l). Accordingly, it is unnecessary and unproductive to seek to determine the precise meaning and extent of the word “vulnerable” in s 21A(2)(l).  
     
      
       
      Particular Three – his Honour failed to properly take into account the applicant’s intellectual deficits. 
       
      
    33 The applicant submitted that, “When his Honour came to consider matters in mitigation, he did not have any regard to s 21A(3)(j) (‘the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his or her actions because of the offender’s age or any disability’)”. 
     
      
    34 The applicant relied upon a report of a psychologist who had seen the applicant on one occasion. He had administered various psychological tests to the applicant and had reported, 
     
      
       
        
        This man tested out in the bottom 1 per cent of the population on measures of intelligence. His composite IQ score of 67 places him into the Mild Mental Retardation range, which includes scores from 50 - 55 to about 70. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV describes this group as “capable of achieving social and vocational skills adequate for minimal self-support but may need supervision, guidance and assistance, especially when under unusual social or economic stress”. With appropriate supports, individuals with Mild Mental Retardation can usually live successfully in the community, either independently or in supervised settings.  
        
       
      
    35 His Honour referred at length to the psychiatric report in his Remarks on Sentence and set out the material quoted above. It is clear his Honour had this material in mind at the time of sentencing the applicant.36 As Wood CJ at CL said in R v Matthews (2004) 145 A Crim R 445: 
     
      
       
        
        Each case will depend upon the nature and degree of the impairment, the extent of its contribution to the offence, and whether or not the sentence can be seen, in the particular circumstances, of that case to have a deterrent value, either specifically or generally. An individual assessment is necessary, and a bare invocation of the presence, in an offender, of a low level of intellectual functioning, or mental disorder, as a circumstance requiring moderation in sentence, is likely to be both misleading and unhelpful. 
        
       
      
    37 In the present circumstances, though it may be the psychologist was correct in attributing a low level of intellectual functioning to the applicant, the evidence does not establish the applicant was not fully aware of the nature and consequences of his actions and there was no basis to reduce the sentence in this regard. 
     
      
       
      Particular Four – his Honour erred in failing to give the applicant the full benefit of his early plea of guilty. 
       
      
    38 His Honour said in his Remarks on Sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        The offender was arrested on 22 June 2003. He entered a plea of guilty before the Parramatta Local Court on 6 November 2003. He is entitled to some discount for his plea of guilty and for its utilitarian value. In this regard, however, it is to be observed that he was arrested at the scene. He was charged and entered into custody on that day… 
         
         
        So far as the question of remorse is concerned, the letter to which I have referred tendered on behalf of the offender and the evidence which he gave indicate perhaps some change, slow though it has been, in his approach to acknowledging the serious nature of his offences and the fact that he should accept that his actions were contrary to any reasonable community expectations… 
         
         
        This is not a case in which it is easy to indicate the degree to which I propose to take into account the plea of guilty, but I consider that something of about 15 to 20 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea, and the fact of the plea should be taken into account. 
        
       
      
    39 The applicant submitted, in effect that: 
     
      
       
      a) His Honour in his Remarks on Sentence spoke of a “discount for his plea of guilty and for its utilitarian value”. This indicated that something less than 15-20% was allowed by his Honour for the utilitarian value of the plea and demonstrated error;  
       
       
      b) His Honour’s reference to the fact that the applicant was arrested at the scene and was charged and entered into custody on that day indicated that his Honour had erroneously taken into account the strength of the Crown case in determining the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea; 
       
       
      c) As the plea was entered at the first opportunity and prior to committal for sentence or trial, his Honour’s failure to give the applicant the full value of his plea (i.e. a discount of 25% for its utilitarian value) indicated error.  
       
      
    40 The relevant principles in respect of the discount for a plea of guilty are to be found in R v Thomson (1999-2000) 49 NSWLR 383, a guideline judgment of a five member Bench of this Court. The Court there held inter alia: 
     
      
     
     
      
       
      1.  
       
        
        It has long been the practice of this Court that a plea of guilty should attract a lower sentence than would otherwise be imposed. Three reasons are usually advanced to justify this practice. First, the plea is a manifestation of remorse or contrition. Secondly, the plea has a utilitarian value to the efficiency of the criminal justice system. Thirdly, in particular cases – especially sexual assault cases, crimes involving children and, often, elderly victims – there is a particular value in avoiding the need to call witnesses, especially victims, to give evidence [3] …. 
        
       
       
      2.  
       
        
        (a) The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 per cent discount on sentence [152] and [160 (iii)] 
         
         
        (b) The determination of where, within such a range, the discount should fall in a particular case is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge [153]. 
         
         
        (c) There are two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case [154]. 
         
         
          
          (i) the time at which a plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial. 
          
         
         
          
          (ii) the complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea. 
          
         
        
       
       
      3.  
       
        
        (a) The bare fact of a plea is, of itself, a very simple expression of remorse. Much greater weight may be accorded to the conduct and statements of an accused over a period of time, which confirm a position of genuine and deeply felt contrition. When such contrition is taken into account by a sentencing judge, then the diminution of sentence is given for contrition, not for the plea of guilty. The plea in such a case is, at most, evidence of remorse or contrition, and, often, not the best such evidence. It is not desirable to separate out the factor of a plea as an indication of remorse from other manifestations of remorse [118]. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) Furthermore, the plea is, of itself, equivocal with respect to remorse. A plea may be entered as an acceptance of the inevitable or in order to obtain such advantage as may be afforded in the circumstances. In such a case a plea does not indicate genuine remorse or contrition [117]. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) To similar effect, in  
        R v Bishop 
        , Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Smart J and McInerney J agreed) said (at 5-6): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “The degree of contrition evidenced by a plea of guilty depends to a large degree upon whether or not it resulted from a recognition of the inevitable…Where guilt would inevitably be discovered and established whatever attitude is adopted by the prisoner, a plea of guilty does not evidence any particular degree of contrition, so that leniency will be extended for the plea of guilty only so far as there is a utilitarian benefit in the savings of the time and cost of a trial…None of this is to say that contrition cannot still be taken into account. All that is said is that the plea of guilty does not evidence such contrition. ( 
          Thomson 
           at [139]) 
          
         
        
       
       
      4. It is: 
       
        
        …correct to link the question of the strength of the Crown case only to the issue of contrition or remorse. A “recognition of the inevitable” may qualify the extent of genuine contrition. It does not qualify the utilitarian value of a plea [137]. 
        
       
      
    41 His Honour’s reference to the “discount for his plea of guilty and for its utilitarian value” does suggest some element additional to the utilitarian value of the plea may have been included in the discount of 15-20%. However, this was not a case where there was a particular value in avoiding the need to call witnesses and the only factor additional to the utilitarian value of the plea was contrition. However his Honour did not consider there was evidence of early contrition and the plea was made in circumstances where the applicant’s conviction was inevitable. Any allowance for contrition by reason of the plea, would have been de minimis.  
     
      
    42 If his Honour’s reference to the fact that the applicant was arrested at the scene and was charged and entered into custody on that day indicated that he had taken the strength of the Crown case into account in assessing the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea, this would have demonstrated error – See Thomson at [137], R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 235 at [12]. However, if such had been taken into account, a discount much less than 15 – 20% for the utilitarian value of the plea would have resulted. I would not infer his Honour made such an error. It is far more likely that the early arrest was referred to by his Honour as a factor relevant to contrition by reason of the inevitability of conviction or the lack of complexity of the issues about which evidence would have to be gathered and adduced.  
     
      
    43 The guidelines in R v Thomson create no presumption of, or entitlement to, a particular discount – R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 286 at [28]. The submission that a plea of guilty coming at the earliest opportunity should automatically result in a 25% discount, seeks to convert the upper limit of a guideline range into a rule. A discount of 10 - 25% is within the guideline range. The determination where the discount should fall in a particular case is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge. The fact that the discount given is less than 25% does not bespeak error. 
     
      
    44 In my opinion no error has been demonstrated in respect of the discount allowed by his Honour by reason of the plea of guilty.  
     
      
       
      Particular Five – his Honour failed to properly balance the serious objective circumstance of this offence with the subjective case for the offender. 
       
      
    45 His Honour held: 
     
      
       
        
        The problems in this case are simply that the offender is not of good character. Indeed, without a significant change of his life he is likely to re-offend. His prospects of rehabilitation, whilst they have improved since he has been in prison, are nevertheless matters of conjecture… 
         
        
       
       
        
        I consider that the nature of the crime, the violence involved in it, the vulnerability of the victim and the criminal history of the offender all lead the court to the view that this was an extremely serious offence requiring significant general and specific deterrence. In my opinion there is no other option than imprisonment …. The prisoner’s background and the objective seriousness of this offence and his criminal history demand that be so.  
        
       
       
      His Honour expressly stated he had regard to the subjective matters relating to the applicant which he set out at considerable length in his Remarks on Sentence. He also had regard to mitigating factors, namely there was no evidence of any permanent damage to the victim; while there was some planning there was not an organised criminal activity and that, according to the offender, it was something that he did relatively on the spur of the moment affected by alcohol and, his Honour suspected, drugs.  
      
    46 His Honour had regard to the fact that the evidence did not disclose the extent of the harm caused by the punch, despite the severity of it as indicated by the eyewitness account. He found special circumstances on the basis: 
     
      
       
        
        Where an offender is of an age of this offender, where he has been on drugs, where he has consumed alcohol, where he has many previous convictions at a very young age, it is clear that when he is released from prison he will need the support of the community to be able to be rehabilitated. In that regard I am of the view that there should be, to take into account such matters, a finding of special circumstances. 
        
       
      
    47 The serious objective circumstances and the applicant’s criminal antecedents heavily outweighed the subjective case for the applicant. In my opinion, it has not been demonstrated that his Honour failed to properly balance those matters.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    48 “The decision of the primary judge must….be regarded as prima facie correct…” – Whittaker v The King (1928) 41 CLR 230 at 249, R v Holder (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 253 B-E. An appellate court does not interfere with a sentence imposed merely because it is of the view that that sentence is insufficient or excessive. It interferes only if it be shown that the sentencing judge was in error – R v Tait (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388, and then only if it forms the positive opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed – R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79]. 
     
      
    49 It must be remembered that, “Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision” – Pearce v The Queen  (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 [46].  
     
      
    50 As earlier recorded, I have concluded errors arose in the application of s 21A in this case. However, such errors, in my opinion, did not impact in any significant manner upon the sentence determined by his Honour. 
     
      
    51 That sentence represents the conclusion of an experienced District Court Judge reached after reserving judgment on sentence, and with the benefit of hearing the applicant give evidence before him. The sentence, whilst high, is not such, when regard is had to all the circumstances and in particular the applicant’s criminal antecedents, as to cause me to conclude that some other sentence, less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed. Accordingly, whilst I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    52 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Leave to appeal granted. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Appeal dismissed.

     REGINA v Simon (Eid) TAOUK 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: Simon Taouk appealed against his conviction, after a trial in the Supreme Court before Barr J and a jury, on two charges of murder, that on 29 September 2002 he murdered Tony Taouk and that on the same date he murdered Salam Taouk. Salam Taouk was the appellant’s wife. Tony Taouk was the appellant’s brother-in-law, being a brother of Salam Taouk. 
     
      
    2 The appellant and Salam Taouk had been married for about thirty years. In 1972 they had migrated to Australia from Lebanon with their infant daughter Hala. In Australia five further children of the marriage were born: Maroun, a son, who was born in April 1974; Myrna, a daughter, who was born in July 1978; Madeline, a daughter, who at the time of the trial in May 2004 was twenty-four years old; Helen, a daughter, who was born in November 1980; and Mark, a son, who was born in March 1982. 
     
      
    3 For some years down to 29 September 2002 the appellant, his wife Salam and their five children Maroun, Myrna, Madeline, Helen and Mark lived in a two storey house in Redmyre Road, Strathfield. There were a number of bedrooms in the second storey of the house. The appellant and his wife shared a bedroom, which on plans of the second storey of the house which were admitted into evidence at the trial was described as being bedroom 1. As at 29 September 2002 Maroun and Mark were sharing a bedroom (bedroom 3); Myrna and Madeline were sharing a bedroom (bedroom 5); and Helen had her own bedroom (bedroom 2). All of the bedrooms opened on to a common hallway. 
     
      
    4 As at 29 September 2002 Tony Taouk had been living in Australian for about one and a half years. While in Australia he had stayed either at the appellant’s house or at the house at Guildford of Mrs Zakie (Nahla) Estaphan, a sister of Tony Taouk and Salam Taouk. When staying at the appellant’s house Tony Taouk occupied a bedroom on the second storey described as bedroom 4 in plans of the second storey of the house admitted into evidence at the trial. Bedroom 4 also opened on to the common hallway. 
     
      
    5 At the trial each of the five children who lived in the house gave evidence about his or her movements on Saturday 28 September 2002 and in the early hours of Sunday 29 September 2002 and about what happened, so far as the witness knew, in the early hours of Sunday 29 September 2002. I will now briefly summarise the evidence of these witnesses, in the order in which they gave evidence at the trial. 
     
      
       
      1. Madeline Taouk 
       
      
    6 Madeline Taouk gave evidence that on the evening of Saturday 28 September 2002 she had returned home with her sister Myrna, whom she had met in the city. Later on the evening of 28 September 2002 Madeline Taouk went out with her mother (Helen Taouk gave evidence that she accompanied Madeline and their mother). Madeline Taouk dropped her mother off at her mother’s sister’s, Mrs Estaphan’s, house at Guildford. Madeline Taouk picked up a friend and proceeded to her own sister Hala’s house at Guildford. She spent about three hours at her sister’s house or the house of a friend. 
     
      
    7 Subsequently Madeline proceeded to Mrs Estaphan’s house, arriving there at about 1 o’clock. At some time before 2 o’clock Madeline, her mother and her sister Helen left Mrs Estaphan’s house and travelled home.  
     
      
    8 Madeline Taouk saw her father outside the house near the front door. She, her mother and Helen entered the house. Inside the house she heard her father “lecturing” her mother “about getting the girls home before 2 o’clock”. While Madeline Taouk was still in the downstairs part of the house, her brother Maroun arrived home. Tony Taouk came into the house “not more than fifteen minutes” after Maroun came in. 
     
      
    9 When Madeline Taouk went upstairs, her sister Myrna was asleep in the bedroom they shared. Madeline made preparations to go to bed but before she actually went to bed she heard “loud bangs” and Tony Taouk’s voice. She could not hear what Tony Taouk was saying. Madeline Taouk came out of the bedroom and saw her mother lying on the floor in a corner of the hallway. She saw some of her brothers and sisters coming out into the hallway. She did not see either her father or her uncle.  
     
      
    10 One of her brothers and sisters telephoned for an ambulance using a mobile telephone and one of them telephoned for an ambulance using a landline. Ambulance officers and then police officers arrived at the house. After the police had arrived at the house, the body of Tony Taouk was discovered lying in the backyard of the house. 
     
      
       
      2. Helen Taouk 
       
      
    11 Helen Taouk gave evidence that on the evening of Saturday 28 September 2002 she and her sister Madeline dropped her mother off at her mother’s sister’s, Mrs Estaphan’s house, and Madeline and Helen proceeded to a friend’s house. 
     
      
    12 Between about 1 o’clock and 1.30 in the morning of 29 September Madeline and Helen arrived at Mrs Estaphan’s house to pick up their mother. They remained at Mrs Estaphan’s house for a while. Mrs Taouk, Madeline and Helen left Mrs Estaphan’s house, dropped off a friend who had been with them and returned to the house at Strathfield, arriving there after 2 o’clock. 
     
      
    13 Mrs Taouk, Madeline and Helen entered the house. The appellant, who was in the living room on the ground floor of the house, asked “why you late?” and gave Mrs Taouk, Madeline and Helen “a lecture”. 
     
      
    14 While Helen was still in the downstairs part of the house, her brother Maroun arrived home. Maroun said to the appellant, “what’s wrong? Why you arguing at this time?” The appellant “nudged” Maroun on the shoulder. Maroun then went upstairs. 
     
      
    15 Helen went upstairs, entered her bedroom and prepared to go to bed. About ten minutes after Helen had gone upstairs and entered her room, she heard “loud shots”. She heard her brothers and sisters shouting. She went out into the hallway and saw her mother lying on the floor, with one of her sisters attempting to resuscitate her. Helen telephoned for an ambulance, using her mobile telephone. She did not see the appellant or her uncle anywhere in the house. Ambulance officers and then police officers arrived at the house. After the police officers had arrived, the body of her uncle was discovered in the backyard of the house. 
     
      
       
      3. Mark Taouk 
       
      
    16 Mark Taouk gave evidence that during the day on Saturday 28 September 2002 he had been working. In the evening he left the house at Strathfield and spent some time with a girlfriend. He returned to the house at Strathfield between about 11.30 and midnight.  
     
      
    17 When Mark Taouk arrived home, the appellant was watching television in the living room on the ground floor. Mark Taouk went into the front room on the ground floor of the house, where there was another television set, and himself watched television. He went to sleep on a mattress in the front room.  
     
      
    18 At about 2.40 he “was woken up by some loud kind of snapping noises, which I later figured out were gunshots”. He heard his sister screaming. He got up and went up the stairs to the first floor landing, where he saw his mother lying on the floor. While he was still in the downstairs part of the house he did not see anybody. 
     
      
       
      4. Myrna Taouk 
       
      
    19 Myrna Taouk gave evidence that during the day on Saturday 28 September 2002 she had worked in the city in her occupation as a tax consultant. At about 6.30 in the evening she returned home with her sister Madeline, whom she had met in the city. 
     
      
    20 Madeline Taouk and Salam Taouk left the house together at a time which Myrna Taouk estimated as being 8 or 8.30. Tony Taouk and Joseph Taouk (a relative) arrived at the house at about 9 or 9.30. Tony Taouk, Joseph Taouk and Maroun Taouk left the house together. At about 11 o’clock Myrna Taouk, who had remained at home, went upstairs and went to sleep in her bedroom.  
     
      
    21 Myrna Taouk was woken by a noise which she described as “a bang”. In the hallway she saw her brothers and sisters in a “disoriented” state and she saw her mother slumped on the floor in a foetal position with blood surrounding her. Myrna Taouk attempted to administer cardio-pulmonary resuscitation to her mother. She did not see either her father or her uncle Tony Taouk in the upstairs part of the house. 
     
      
       
      5. Maroun Taouk 
       
      
    22 Maroun Taouk gave evidence that during the day on Saturday 28 September 2002 he had been working. In the evening he was dozing on a couch at the home at Strathfield when Tony Taouk and Joseph Taouk arrived at the house. At about 10.30pm Maroun Taouk, Tony Taouk and Joseph Taouk left the house at Strathfield and went to the Coogee Bay Hotel, where they had some drinks. After leaving the Hotel they went to a nightclub and then a sports club. Joseph Taouk drove Maroun Taouk and Tony Taouk back to the house at Strathfield. Maroun Taouk got out of the vehicle and walked into the house through the rear door. He was intoxicated. 
     
      
    23 Inside the house the appellant was arguing with Maroun Taouk’s sisters Madeline and Helen. The appellant touched Maroun on the shoulder. Maroun said, “look, can you stop screaming. You’ll wake someone up”. Maroun Taouk then walked up to his bedroom and “crashed out” on his bed, without taking his clothes off.  
     
      
    24 The next thing Maroun Taouk heard or saw was the sound of “fire crackers, they were gunshots”. He also heard screaming. He opened the door of his bedroom and saw his mother lying on the floor on her back in the hallway outside her bedroom. He noticed blood coming from behind her right shoulder. He saw his sisters in the hallway but did not see either his father or Tony Taouk in the upstairs area of the house. 
     
      
    25 Maroun Taouk made an emergency telephone call and asked for an ambulance. Ambulance officers and police entered the house. At some time after the police arrived a police officer told members of the family that another body, the body of Tony Taouk, had been discovered lying outside the house. 
     
      
    26 I will now briefly refer to some other parts of the evidence given at the trial. 
     
      
    27 A police officer Constable Munro gave evidence that in the early morning of 29 September 2002, while Constable Munro was on duty at Burwood Police Station, the appellant entered the police station and had a conversation with Constable Munro, in which, according to Constable Munro, the appellant said a number of things incriminating him in the shooting of the victims. I will refer more fully to this evidence, when I deal with the appellant’s grounds of appeal against his conviction. 
     
      
    28 After Constable Munro’s initial conversation with the appellant Constable Munro consulted a more senior officer at the police station and other police officers had conversations with the appellant. 
     
      
    29 The appellant was interviewed by police in an electronically recorded interview commencing at 11.58am on 29 September 2002. I will refer more fully to this interview in dealing with the appellant’s grounds of appeal against his conviction. 
     
      
    30 At the trial there was evidence that six projectiles had been fired inside the house from a firearm, which had never been found. 
     
      
    31 One fired bullet was recovered from the body of Tony Taouk, when a post mortem examination was performed on his body. Another fired bullet was recovered from the body of Salam Taouk, when a post mortem examination was performed on her body. 
     
      
    32 Part of a fired bullet was found embedded in the lintel above the door to bedroom 2. In the opinion of a ballistics expert, the position of the bullet and associated damage observed by the expert were consistent with a bullet having been discharged from a firearm in the vicinity of the first floor hallway. 
     
      
    33 A fired bullet was recovered from the floor of bedroom 2. In the opinion of the ballistics expert the position of the bullet and associated damage observed by the expert were consistent with a bullet having been discharged from a firearm in the vicinity of the first floor hallway. 
     
      
    34 A fired bullet was found on the bed in bedroom 4. In the opinion of the ballistics expert, the position of the bullet and associated damage observed by the expert were consistent with the bullet having been discharged either from inside bedroom 4 or in the vicinity of the first floor hallway. 
     
      
    35 Further damage observed by the expert indicated, in the expert’s opinion, that a further bullet had been fired, which had passed through bedroom 4 and gone out through the window of bedroom 4. This bullet was never recovered. 
     
      
    36 As will be apparent from my brief summaries of the evidence of the appellant’s children, none of the children witnessed the shooting of either Salam Taouk or Tony Taouk. In the absence of any direct evidence from a witness that it was the appellant who had shot either Salam Taouk or Tony Taouk, the Crown’s case on both charges was, to a large extent, a circumstantial one, although the Crown also relied on admissions which the Crown said the appellant had made to Constable Munro and in the recorded interview. I will consider the evidence relied on by the Crown in dealing with the ground of appeal against conviction that the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable, having regard to the evidence. 
     
      
    37 The appellant did not give evidence at the trial and did not call any evidence. The principal submission made by counsel for the appellant at the trial was that the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who had fired the fatal shots. It was submitted that the jury should conclude that it was Tony Taouk who had produced the gun and that it was at least reasonably possible that it was Tony Taouk who had fired both of the fatal shots. 
     
      
    38 I will now turn to the grounds of appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      1. The trial judge erred in admitting disputed evidence of admissions which were not electronically recorded but which were said to have been made by the appellant to Constable Munro at Burwood Police Station on the morning of Sunday 29 September 2002 
       
      
    39 I have already mentioned that a police officer Constable Munro gave evidence at the trial of a conversation he said he had had with the appellant in the early morning of 29 September 2002. Constable Munro gave evidence that at 3.15 in the morning, while Constable Munro was on duty as a station officer at Burwood Police Station, a male person, who he subsequently came to know was the appellant, had come into the police station. Constable Munro’s evidence continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I approached the counter and the defendant (that is, the accused) said to me ‘I want to report a disturbance at my house’ I said: ‘what’s happened?’ He said: ‘I have just shot someone at my house. I had an argument with my brother and he had a gun. I took it off him and I fired a few shots’. I said: ‘Is anyone hurt?’ He said: ‘I don’t know’. I said: ‘What’s the address’? He said: ‘61 Redmyre Road Strathfield.’ I said: ‘Just a moment’”. 
        
       
       
      Constable Munro gave further evidence that he then spoke to a more senior officer, that he saw other police officers speak with the appellant in a conversation which he did not hear and that he saw the appellant being escorted towards the custody area of the police station. 
       
      
    40 The evidence Constable Munro gave at the trial which I have summarised or quoted was contained in pars 1-7, 9 and 10 of a statement Constable Munro had made. The evidence of the conversation which I have quoted was contained in par 4 of the statement. In par 8 of his statement Constable Munro gave an account of a further conversation he said he had had with the appellant later on 29 September 2002. 
     
      
    41 About ten minutes after the first conversation occurred Constable Munro made entries in his police note book about the conversation. These entries made in Constable Munro’s note book were not shown to the appellant. 
     
      
    42 Other police officers who were at the Burwood Police Station on the morning of 29 September 2002 made statements in which they gave accounts of conversations which they said they had had with the appellant or which they said they had heard other police officers have with the appellant, after the appellant had had the first conversation with Constable Munro. None of these conversations had been electronically recorded. 
     
      
    43 As I have already mentioned earlier in this judgement, the appellant was interviewed by police in an electronically recorded interview, which commenced at 11.58am on 29 September 2002. The interview was conducted through an Arabic interpreter. A recording of the interview was admitted into evidence at the trial. 
     
      
    44 In the interview the appellant agreed that he had attended Burwood Police Station that morning. He agreed that he had said “I want to report a disturbance at my house” and that a police officer had asked “what’s happened?” However, the appellant denied that he had said “I have just shot someone at my house”. He asserted that he had said, “Tony shot somebody in my house and I tried to stop him”. The appellant denied that he had used the word “brother” and asserted that he had used the word “brother-in-law”. The appellant asserted:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I said I mentioned my brother-in-law, my brother-in-law, I said he came last night to my place and he was carrying a, carrying a gun and he was shooting at the peoples, and he tried, and he tried to shoot me and I tried to help him and then he kept shooting at a lot of others who got shot”. 
        
       
       
      In the interview the appellant said that he had told the police officer (Constable Munro) that he had taken the gun from his brother-in-law.  
       
      
    45 At the trial counsel then appearing for the appellant objected to evidence being admitted of the conversations the police officers said in their statements they had had with the appellant or had heard other police officers have with the appellant on the morning of 29 September 2002. The objection was primarily based on s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 
     
      
    46 Section 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act is in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “281 Admissions by suspects 
         
        (1) This section applies to an admission:  
         
        (a) that was made by an accused person who, at the time when the admission was made, was or could reasonably have been suspected by an investigating official of having committed an offence, and 
         
        (b) that was made in the course of official questioning, and 
         
        (c) that relates to an indictable offence, other than an indictable offence that can be dealt with summarily without the consent of the accused person. 
         
        (2) Evidence of an admission to which this section applies is not admissible unless:  
         
        (a) there is available to the court:  
         
        (i) a tape recording made by an investigating official of the interview in the course of which the admission was made, or 
         
        (ii) if the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in subparagraph (i) could not be made, a tape recording of an interview with the person who made the admission, being an interview about the making and terms of the admission in the course of which the person states that he or she made an admission in those terms, or 
         
        (b) the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in paragraph (a) could not be made. 
         
        (3) The hearsay rule and the opinion rule (within the meaning of the  
        Evidence Act 1995 
        ) do not prevent a tape recording from being admitted and used in proceedings before the court as mentioned in subsection (2). 
         
        (4) In this section:  
         
        investigating official 
         means:  
         
        (a) a police officer (other than a police officer who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior), or 
         
        (b) a person appointed by or under an Act (other than a person who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior) whose functions include functions in respect of the prevention or investigation of offences prescribed by the regulations. 
         
        official questioning 
         means questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence. 
         
        reasonable excuse 
         includes:  
         
        (a) a mechanical failure, or 
         
        (b) the refusal of a person being questioned to have the questioning electronically recorded, or 
         
        (c) the lack of availability of recording equipment within a period in which it would be reasonable to detain the person being questioned. 
         
        tape recording 
         includes:  
         
        (a) audio recording, or 
         
        (b) video recording, or 
         
        (c) a video recording accompanied by a separately but contemporaneously recorded audio recording”. 
         
        
       
      
    47 At the trial counsel then appearing for the appellant initially included, in the evidence he was objecting to, any evidence from Constable Munro of his first conversation with the appellant, after the point where Constable Munro asked “what’s happened?” (trial transcript page 11 lines 7-15). However, soon afterwards counsel for the appellant at the trial changed his position. The following exchange occurred between the trial judge and counsel for the appellant at the trial (trial transcript page 12 line 5 – line 53):- 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: I asked about paragraph (a) (of s 281(1)): How do you come within paragraph (a)? You have to show that at the time Mr Taouk said these words, he was or could reasonably have been suspected of having committed an offence. 
        
       
       
        
        SPENCER: ‘I have just shot someone’. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOR: They’re the words you’re objecting to? 
        
       
       
        
        SPENCER: Your Honour is right but once that is said, he must then become a suspect. Once those words are used. ‘I’ve just shot someone at my house. I had an argument with my brother and he had a gun. I took it off him and I fired a few shots’. 
        
       
       
        
        Once that is said, clearly Mr Taouk is a suspect. Anything following that must be recorded, unless reasonable excuse is tendered for it not being done. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Is it appropriate, then, to distinguish between the words in which the accused said what had happened and the continuation of the conversation?. 
        
       
       
        
        SPENCER: Yes, your Honour. There is little doubt the officer couldn’t have know anything about it at that time. But once those words were used, he must have a real suspicion of a crime and then he goes on to further questioning. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: So you say that when Constable Munro was told that the accused had shot someone, the accused could reasonably have been suspected, by him, of having committed an offence? 
        
       
       
        
        SPENCER: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, I follow that. That would leave the words untouched by the section, though, wouldn’t it, up until those words were said? 
        
       
       
        
        SPENCER: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: ‘I have just shot someone at my house. I had an argument. He had a gun and I took it off him and fired a few shots’. 
        
       
       
        
        SPENCER: Constable Munro couldn’t know anything about that until after he was told. The rest of it is objected to for those reasons”. 
        
       
      
    48 Accordingly, counsel for the appellant at the trial did not ultimately object to evidence being given of the appellant’s first conversation with Constable Munro on the ground that the evidence was rendered inadmissible by s 281. 
     
      
    49 However, it was submitted by counsel for the appellant at the trial that the evidence which the Crown proposed to adduce of other conversations with the appellant was evidence of admissions to which s 281 applied, being admissions made by an accused person who, at the time the admissions were made, was or could reasonably have been suspected by an investigating officer of having committed an offence and as being admissions otherwise falling within s 281(1); that there was no tape recording of the admissions within par (a) of s 281(2); that the prosecution could not establish that there was a reasonable excuse within par (b) of s 281(2) as to why a tape recording within par (a) could not have been made; and consequently, evidence of the other conversations should not be admitted. 
     
      
    50 After hearing argument on the admissibility of evidence of the other conversations Barr J delivered a judgment. In this judgment his Honour said that s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act did not apply to the first conversation Constable Munro said he had had with the appellant. His Honour said in par 3 of his judgment:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Constable Munro did not know the accused and did not know, until the accused told him, that there had been a shooting at his house. It seems to me that Constable Munro did not suspect and had no reason to suspect that the accused had committed any offence. Section 281 of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
         therefore has no application to the first conversation that he and the accused had. In my opinion the whole of the contents of paragraph 4 of Constable Munro’s statement is admissible and subject to any objection on any different ground ought to be admitted into evidence”. 
        
       
      
    51 However, his Honour proceeded to hold that s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act did apply to the second conversation Constable Munro had had with the appellant, as set out in par 8 of Constable Munro’s statement, and to all the conversations the other police officers had had with the appellant. His Honour found that the police officers who had been informed, directly or indirectly, by Constable Munro of what the appellant had told Constable Munro in his first conversation with Constable Munro must have suspected that the appellant had committed an offence. There had been no tape recording of any of these conversations and the prosecution had not established that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording could not have been made. 
     
      
    52 Accordingly, Barr J ruled that evidence of the first conversation with Constable Munro was admissible but that evidence of all of the other conversations was rendered inadmissible by s 281. 
     
      
    53 On this appeal counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge had erred in admitting evidence by Constable Munro of the first conversation Constable Munro said he had had with the appellant. It was submitted that, as soon as the appellant said to Constable Munro “I want to report a disturbance at my house” the appellant became a person who could reasonably have been suspected by Constable Munro of having committed an offence. 
     
      
    54 It was pointed out by counsel for the appellant that the word “could” in the expression “could reasonably have been suspected” in s 281(1)(a) was different from the word “ought” in the corresponding part of s 424A of the Crimes Act, a predecessor of s 281, and it was submitted that the expression “could reasonably have been suspected of having committed an offence” was wider than the expression “ought reasonably to have been suspected of having committed an offence”. Counsel for the appellant referred to an unreported judgment of Bell J in R v Crowther-Wilkinson NSWSC 70096/01 8 May 2002, in which her Honour said at par 31 with reference to s 424A of the Crimes Act and the then s 108 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which was in the same terms as the present s 281:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It may be that the class of persons who “could reasonably have been suspected by an investigating official of having committed an offence” is broader than the class of persons who “ought reasonably to have been suspected by an investigating official of having committed an offence”. 
        
       
      
    55 Counsel for appellant referred to the recent decisions of the High Court in Kelly v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 538 and Nicholls v The Queen; Coates v The Queen (2005) 213 ALR 1. In Kelly the appellant, who had been arrested on a charge of murder, was interviewed by police at a police station in an interview which was electronically recorded. During the interview the appellant said that a statement made by him in an earlier conversation with police, in which he had implicated himself in the murder, had been made as a result of threats by a police officer. About half an hour to an hour after the electronically recorded interview had finished, while the appellant was still at the police station, the appellant, according to police officers, admitted that the allegation that he had made against the police officer during the interview was false. The appellant’s admission was not made in response to any questioning by police. 
     
      
    56 In Kelly the majority of the High Court (Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ) held that evidence of the admission was not excluded by s 8 of the Criminal Law (Detention and Interrogation) Act 1995 (Tas), a provision in similar but not identical terms to s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act, because the admission had not been made “in the course of official questioning”. The other members of the Court (McHugh J and Kirby J) dissented. 
     
      
    57 In Nicholls v The Queen; Coates v The Queen the only ground of appeal relevant to the present appeal was Coates’ first ground of appeal. 
     
      
    58 Coates had been interviewed by police at a police station in an interview which was videotaped. During a break in the videotaped interview, which police asserted had been initiated by Coates, and while filming was suspended, Coates, according to police officers, made a number of admissions. When the videotaped interview was resumed the admissions were not put to Coates or confirmed by Coates. 
     
      
    59 It was held by the trial judge and by the Western Australian Court of Criminal Appeal that evidence of the admissions was not excluded by s 570D of the Criminal Code (Western Australia), a provision in similar but not identical terms to s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act, for the reason that the prosecution had established that there was a reasonable excuse for there not being a recording of the admissions. The majority of the High Court (McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Callinan JJ) held that there had not been any reasonable excuse for there not being a recording of the admissions and that evidence of the admissions had been wrongly admitted. The other members of the Court (Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ) dissented.  
     
      
    60 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant in the present appeal that the judges forming the majority in Coates, which was the later of the two decisions, had held that a statutory provision of the nature of s 570D of the Criminal Code (Western Australia) should be given a purposive construction (McHugh J at 28-30 (98-108), Gummow and Callinan JJ at 42-44 (149-157) and Kirby J at 57-59 (212-221) 
     
      
    61 In Coates McHugh J at 28 (98) and Gummow and Callinan JJ at 42-43 (150) referred to what Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ had said in their joint judgment in Kelly at 548 (420), that the purpose of legislation of this nature is to overcome problems with so called “verbals”, that is disputed evidence of alleged oral admissions made to police officers, including “the possibility of police fabrication and the ease with which experienced police officers can effectuate it, frequent lack of reliable corroboration of the making of the statement and the practical burden on an accused person seeking to create a reasonable doubt about the police evidence”. 
     
      
    62 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant in the present appeal that s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act is a legislative provision of the same nature as s 8 of the Criminal Law (Detention and Interrogation) Act 1995 (Tas) and s 570D of the Criminal Code (Western Australia), that its purpose is the same as the purpose of those legislative provisions and that, in accordance with the judgments of the majority in Coates, s 281 should be given a purposive interpretation so as to effectuate its purpose. 
     
      
    63 Counsel for the appellant contended that, if proper regard was had to the use of the word “could” in s 281(1)(a) and if s 281(1)(a) was given a purposive interpretation, then this Court should hold that the trial judge had erred in not finding that, as soon as the appellant said “I want to report a disturbance at my house”, the appellant became a person whom Constable Munro could reasonably have suspected of having committed an offence. 
     
      
    64 It was contended that such a conclusion would be supported by the time of the night at which the appellant had presented himself at the police station and by the fact that the appellant’s subsequent disclosures to Constable Munro were not spontaneous but were made in response to a question asked by Constable Munro (“what’s happened?”) 
     
      
    65 It was submitted by the Crown on this appeal that Constable Munro could not reasonably have suspected the appellant of having committed an offence, at the stage where the appellant had merely said “I want to report a disturbance at my house”. 
     
      
    66 As has already been shown, counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial did not ultimately object to Constable Munro giving evidence of his first conversation with the appellant. Consequently, the leave of this Court under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules is required in order for the appellant to rely on this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    67 However, although evidence of the first conversation was not ultimately objected to by counsel for the appellant at the trial, that evidence was closely linked to evidence which was objected to and the trial judge in his judgment gave consideration to whether evidence by Constable Munro of his first conversation with the appellant was admissible and made an explicit ruling that the evidence was admissible. In these circumstances, I do not consider that this Court should dispose of this ground of appeal, by refusing leave under r 4. 
     
      
    68 In his judgment the trial judge found that at the time of his first conversation with the appellant Constable Munro “did not suspect and had no reason to suspect that the accused had committed any offence”.  
     
      
    69 It was submitted, rather faintly, by counsel for the appellant that in making the finding that Constable Munro “had no reason to suspect that the accused had committed any offence”, the trial judge had not properly applied the terms of s 281(1)(a), that the person “could reasonably have been suspected of having committed an offence”. However, the trial judge had stated the full terms of s 281 earlier in his judgment and I do not consider that it should be held that the trial judge failed to apply the terms of s 281. 
     
      
    70 If, as I have held, the trial judge properly applied the terms of s 281, the trial judge should, in my opinion, be regarded as having made a finding, albeit a negative finding, that it was not the case that, at the time when the first conversation occurred, the appellant was a person who either was or could reasonably have been suspected by Constable Munro of having committed an offence. Error by the trial judge in making such a finding would be established, only if there was no evidence to support such a finding (R v O’Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397, R v Khouzame [2000] NSWCCA 505). In my opinion, there was evidence to support such a finding and the first ground of appeal in the present appeal could be disposed of, simply on the basis that it has not been established that the trial judge was in error in making such a finding. I will, however, proceed to consider whether, if the matter was at large in this Court, it should be held that the admissions made in the first conversation with Constable Munro were made at a time when the appellant could reasonably have been suspected by Constable Munro of having committed an offence. 
     
      
    71 I accept, as was submitted by counsel for the appellant, that s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act is in different terms from the former s 424A of the Crimes Act and is also in different terms from the interstate legislation considered by the High Court in Kelly and Coates. I also accept that there could be cases in which a person “could” reasonably have been suspected by a police officer of having committed an offence, even though it could not be said that he “ought” reasonably to have been suspected by the police officer of having committed an offence. 
     
      
    72 I also accept that s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act is legislation of the same nature as that considered by the High Court in Kelly and Coates, has the same purpose as that legislation and should, in accordance with the views of the majority in Coates, be given a purposive interpretation. 
     
      
    73 However, in my opinion, even accepting that a purposive interpretation should be given to s 281, it is necessary that some regard be had to the actual language of s 281 and some effect be given to the word “reasonably” in the expression “could reasonably have been suspected”. A person could not reasonably have been suspected by a police officer of having committed an offence, unless something has been said or done which would provide some grounds for a police officer reasonably suspecting that the person has committed an offence. 
     
      
    74 In my opinion, the attendance by the appellant at a police station, even in the early hours of the morning, and the saying by the appellant to a police officer of words to the effect that the appellant wished to report some untoward occurrence which had happened at his house did not provide any grounds on which the police officer could reasonably have suspected that the person had committed an offence. The police officer could reasonably have formed the view that the appellant was seeking to report an occurrence at his house of which he had been the victim or which he had witnessed but not an occurrence involving the commission by the appellant himself of some offence. It is common for members of the public to report to police crimes of which they have been the victims. It is much less common for members of the public to report to police crimes which they have themselves committed. 
     
      
    75 After the appellant had told Constable Munro that he wished to report a disturbance, Constable Munro asked the appellant a completely non-leading question “what’s happened?” and the appellant in a few, very brief sentences, uninterrupted by any further question from Constable Munro, told Constable Munro what had happened. Like the trial judge and like counsel for the appellant at the trial, I consider that the appellant could not reasonably have been suspected by Constable Munro of having committed an offence, until after the appellant had completed giving his brief account of what had happened at his house. 
     
      
    76 As has been shown earlier in this judgment, the issues in the High Court cases of Kelly and Coates were different from the issue in the present ground of appeal. In both Kelly and Coates the accused was clearly an actual suspect at the time when the alleged admissions were made and there was no need for the courts to consider whether, at the time the alleged admissions were made, the accused “ought” reasonably to have been suspected by a police officer of having committed an offence (Kelly) or whether there were reasonable grounds for a police officer to suspect that the accused had committed an offence (Coates). 
     
      
    77 In both Kelly and Coates the accused was an actual suspect who had been or was being interviewed at a police station in an interview which was being electronically recorded. In both cases there was a much greater potential than in the present case for the police to falsely allege that the suspect had made oral admissions which were not recorded in the recorded interview or of the suspect falsely alleging that oral admissions he had in fact made had been fabricated by the police.  
     
      
    78 In my opinion, this part of the appellant’s first ground of appeal against conviction should be rejected. 
     
      
    79 An alternative submission was made by counsel for the appellant that this Court should hold that evidence by Constable Munro of his first conversation with the appellant, after the appellant said “I want to report a disturbance at my house”, had been erroneously admitted, because the trial judge should have excluded the evidence in the exercise of his discretion. The principal discretion which, it was submitted, the trial judge should have exercised was the discretion conferred by s 90 of the Evidence Act, under which a court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, if the evidence is adduced by the prosecution and, “having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to the defendant to use the evidence”. However, reference was also made by counsel for the appellant to the discretion conferred by s 138 of the Evidence Act to exclude improperly or illegally obtained evidence. 
     
      
    80 Counsel referred to The Queen v Swaffield (1997) 192 CLR 159, in which the discretion at common law to exclude evidence on the ground that it would be unfair to the accused to admit the evidence was discussed (for example per Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ passim at 189 - 202 (53 - 92)). It was submitted that the judgments in Swaffield provide useful guidance for the application of the statutory discretion under s 90 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    81 Counsel for the appellant submitted that the circumstances which would render it unfair to the appellant to admit the disputed evidence included the following (I have to some extent re-arranged counsel’s list):- 
     
      
       
      1. The appellant was a person from a non-English speaking background, whose ability to communicate in English was less than that of a native English speaker. 
       
       
      2. It should be found that Constable Munro had misunderstood at least one part of what the appellant had said to him. Constable Munro asserted that the appellant had said that he had had an argument with his “brother”, whereas, it should be found, the appellant had spoken of his “brother-in-law”.  
       
       
      3. Constable Munro’s evidence was incorrect in asserting that the appellant had entered the police station at 3.15 in the morning. Records at the police station showed that the appellant was already in the custody area of the police station by 3.10. 
       
       
      4. It should be found that after the conversation with Constable Munro the appellant was not immediately arrested or cautioned or searched. 
       
       
      5. The statement allegedly made by the appellant in the conversation “I want to report a disturbance at my house”, which the appellant is recorded in the interview as agreeing that he had made, might not have been accurately translated by the Arabic interpreter at the interview. 
       
       
      6. When the appellant was interviewed in the electronically recorded interview the appellant, while agreeing that certain things alleged by Constable Munro to have been said had been said, denied that he had told Constable Munro that he had shot someone and did not make any admission that he had himself fired the gun. 
       
      
    82 Counsel for the appellant referred to par 108 of McHugh J’s judgment in Coates, where his Honour said that, even if evidence of the unrecorded admissions should not be excluded under s 570D of the Criminal Code, there was, in the circumstances, “an overpowering case” for the trial judge to exclude the evidence in the exercise of his discretion. 
     
      
    83 As stated earlier in this judgment, the primary ground on which counsel for the appellant at the trial submitted that evidence of conversations by the appellant with police officers should be excluded was based on s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act. However, counsel at the trial made an alternative submission that evidence of conversations between the appellant and police officers, after the first conversation with Constable Munro, should be excluded by the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion under s 138 of the Evidence Act to exclude evidence that was obtained improperly (trial transcript p 39). As the trial judge held that evidence of conversations between the appellant and police officers, after the first conversation with Constable Munro, should be excluded under s 281, it was unnecessary for the trial judge to deal with the alternative submission that the evidence should be excluded in the exercise of his discretion under s 138.  
     
      
    84 At the trial counsel for the appellant expressly disavowed making any submission that any of Constable Munro’s evidence had been improperly obtained. No submission was made by counsel for the appellant at the trial that any of the evidence of conversations with police officers should be excluded by the trial judge in the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 90 of the Evidence Act. Accordingly, at the trial the trial judge was not asked to exercise any discretionary power to exclude evidence by Constable Munro of his first conversation with the appellant. 
     
      
    85 The trial judge not having been asked to exercise the discretion conferred by s 90 of the Evidence Act so as to exclude evidence of the first conversation, it is necessary, in order for the appellant to succeed on this part of this ground of appeal, for the appellant to show that, if the trial judge had been asked to exercise his discretion, the only proper exercise of his discretion would have been to exclude the evidence R v Nelson [2004] NSWCCA 231. 
     
      
    86 I am not persuaded that, if the trial judge had been asked to exercise his discretion under s 90, the only proper exercise of his discretion would have been to exclude Constable Munro’s evidence of the first conversation. A number of the circumstances relied on by counsel for the appellant appear to me to have little weight. The circumstances which could be regarded as having greater weight are that the appellant was a person from a non-English speaking background, whose ability to communicate in English was less than that of a native English speaker, and that the appellant, when interviewed in the recorded interview, denied that he had told Constable Munro that he had shot anyone and, when asked whether he had himself fired the gun, did not make any admission that he had himself fired the gun. 
     
      
    87 Much of Constable Munro’s account was not disputed by the appellant in the interview. The appellant did not dispute that he had gone to the police station, that he had had a conversation with a police officer, that in the conversation he had told the police officer that he wanted to report an event which had happened at his house, that the police officer had asked him what had happened, that he had told the police officer that there had been an argument (“a fighting”) between him and a male relative (although he said that the argument was with his brother-in-law and not his brother), that the other man had had a gun and that the appellant had taken the gun away from the other man. 
     
      
    88 The parts of the conversation as narrated by Constable Munro, which the appellant disputed (“I have just shot someone at my house…I fired a few shots”) were expressed in very simple English and would not have been beyond the capacity of a person with a quite limited knowledge of English. 
     
      
    89 In the interview the appellant gave little additional information about what had happened at the house. He asserted that, after he took the gun from his brother-in-law, “I lost control” and “I don’t remember what happened after that”. The present case was not a case in which the accused person had given a detailed account in a recorded interview of what he said had happened. 
     
      
    90 In the present case the interview commenced eight or nine hours after the conversation took place and the appellant would have had an opportunity, after the conversation and before the interview commenced, to give further consideration to his position and possibly change his account. This was not a case in which a disputed conversation was alleged to have taken place during a break in an electronically recorded interview or shortly after an electronically recorded interview had been completed. 
     
      
    91 I am also not persuaded that, if the trial judge had been asked to exercise his discretion under s 138 of the Evidence Act, the only proper exercise of his discretion would have been to exclude Constable Munro’s evidence of the first conversation. The present case is quite different from the situation in Coates, as described by McHugh J in par 108 of his judgment, where the accused was an actual suspect, the accused was being formally interviewed in an electronically recorded interview, the police officers encouraged the making of off-camera admissions, despite the presence of recording equipment, and the police officers failed to refer to the alleged admissions when the recorded interview resumed. 
     
      
    92 In my opinion, the first ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      2. The directions given by the trial judge on the manner in which the jury might approach the evidence relating to finding of gunshot residue on the hands of both the appellant and the deceased Tony Taouk were erroneous and inadequate 
       
      
    93 At the trial Ivan Sarvas, an expert in the examination of gunshot discharge residues, gave evidence in the Crown case. 
     
      
    94 Mr Sarvas gave evidence that on 30 October 2002 he received eight sealed and labelled bags containing samples from:- 
     
      
       
      1. The hands of the appellant (the back of the right hand, the palm of the right hand, the back of the left hand and palm of the left hand). 
       
       
      2. A jumper worn by the appellant on 29 September 2002 (the right front and the left front). 
       
       
      3. The inside waistband and the pockets of track suit pants worn by the appellant on 29 September 2002. 
       
       
      4. The hands of Tony Taouk (the back of the right hand, the palm of the right hand, the back of the left hand and the palm of the left hand). 
       
       
      5. The body of Tony Taouk (the wound in his chest, elsewhere on the chest and the inside of his left arm). 
       
       
      6. The inside waistband and the pockets of the jeans worn by Tony Taouk on 29 September 2002. 
       
       
      7. The hands of Salam Taouk. 
       
       
      8. The cavity in the roof of the garage at the house at Strathfield. 
       
      
    95 Mr Sarvas examined the samples he had received for particles of gunshot residues. The method used by Mr Sarvas was to determine whether there were particles in the samples which contained the elements or “components” lead, barium and antimomy. If a particle detected in a sample was found on examination to contain all three of the components, the presence of the three components in the particle would be characteristic of gunshot residue and would be definitive that the particle was a particle of gunshot residue. If a particle detected in a sample was found on examination to contain only two of those components, the presence of those two components in the particle would be indicative, but indicative only, of the particle being a particle of gunshot residue. Mr Sarvas totalled the number of three component particles and the number of two component particles he found in each of the samples. 
     
      
    96 Mr Sarvas gave oral evidence of the results of his examination of the samples and the results he obtained were also summarised in a table, which was admitted into evidence as exhibit T. For the purposes of this ground of appeal and the appeal generally, it is sufficient to set out certain parts only of exhibit T, arranging the sites from which samples were taken in the order which I have already given in this judgment.

    97 It is immediately apparent from the parts of exhibit T I have reproduced that a greater number of gunshot discharge residue particles were found on the hands of Tony Taouk than on the hands of the appellant; that a much greater number of gunshot discharge residue particles were found on the left hand of Tony Taouk than were found on his right hand; that no gunshot discharge residue particles were found in the inside waistband and pockets of the track suit pants worn by the appellant; but that some gunshot discharge residue particles were found in the inside waistband and pockets of the jeans worn by Tony Taouk. 
     
      
    98 In examination in chief by the Crown Prosecutor Mr Sarvas gave inter alia the following evidence. 
     
      
    99 Mr Sarvas could not determine, from the material he had been given, who as between the appellant and Tony Taouk was more likely to have been the shooter, that is the person who had discharged the weapon. 
     
      
    100 How much gunshot residue would be found on a sample would depend on many factors. These factors would include how much time had elapsed since the gun was fired (the life span of particles of gunshot residue on human skin is about three hours) and whether the subject from whom the sample had been taken had been moving around after the gun was fired or had not been moving and whether a number of shots, and not a single shot, had been fired. 
     
      
    101 The gunshot residue found on the hands and jumper of the appellant suggested that the appellant had either discharged a firearm or had been in close proximity to a firearm when it was discharged. In cross-examination Mr Sarvas said that a third possibility, that the appellant had merely handled a gun, although it could not be excluded, was less likely. 
     
      
    102 The gunshot residue found on the hands of Tony Taouk suggested the same conclusion, that is that he had either discharged a firearm or had been in close proximity to a firearm when it was discharged. 
     
      
    103 Mr Sarvas was asked about the gunshot residue found on Tony Taouk’s left hand. Mr Sarvas gave the following evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Based on the number of particles detected on the left hand of Tony Taouk it provides an inference that Tony may have discharged a weapon, based on the number of particles. However, I am also cautious of that inference in the sense that I do not know the certain circumstance that has occurred during the shooting. Counsel has brought it to attention of close proximity shooting. Now, whether a struggle had taken place, a gun had been discharged by some person, it is also possible that Tony Taouk may have had these particles deposited on him because he was at close proximity. However, it still does not deny the fact on the number of particles that still invites that inference that Tony Taouk may have fired a weapon. But it’s a caution”. 
        
       
      
    104 Mr Sarvas gave evidence that the gunshot residue found in the waistband and pockets of Tony Taouk’s jeans “may indicate perhaps that that person has transported or held a weapon against the waistband”. A gun placed in the waistband of the jeans could transfer gunshot residue on to the waistband, depending on how clean or dirty the gun was. 
     
      
    105 In cross-examination Mr Sarvas was asked about a passage in a report he had made, that the presence of gunshot residue on Tony Taouk’s left hand invited an inference, not merely that Tony Taouk “may” have discharged a weapon but that Tony Taouk “had discharged the weapon with his left hand”. 
     
      
    106 With respect to the gunshot residue in the inside waistband and pockets of the jeans worn by Tony Taouk, Mr Sarvas said that he did not know whether the particles came from the waistband or from the pockets of the jeans or from both the waistband and the pockets. 
     
      
    107 When referred to a statement in his report that the gunshot residue in the waistband and the pockets of the jeans suggested “that a firearm/revolver may have been concealed and transported within the waistband and pockets of the jeans at some time prior to shooting” he said “yes, I stand by that”. 
     
      
    108 Evidence was given at the trial by Mrs Estaphan that her brother Tony Taouk was right-handed. 
     
      
    109 In the Crown Prosecutor’s final address at the trial she made a submission to the effect that the jury would not consider it reasonably possible that Tony Taouk had shot himself, because, if Tony Taouk had been holding the gun, he would, as a right-handed person, have been holding the gun in his right hand and it would have been anatomically difficult for him to shoot himself so as to cause the gunshot wound, which was to the right side of his chest. 
     
      
    110 In his final address counsel for the appellant at the trial identified as an issue to be determined by the jury whether the Crown could prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had fired the gun. Counsel for the appellant referred in his address to much of the evidence by Mr Sarvas which I have already quoted or summarised, including his evidence that the gunshot residue on Tony Taouk’s left hand invited an inference that Tony Taouk “may have” fired the weapon with his left hand (Mr Sarvas’ oral evidence) or that Tony Taouk “had” discharged the weapon with his left hand (Mr Sarvas’ report) and his evidence that he “stood by” the opinion expressed in his report that a firearm might have been transported within the waistband and pockets of the jeans worn by Tony Taouk at some time prior to the shooting. 
     
      
    111 In his address counsel for the appellant submitted that the jury should conclude that Tony Taouk had brought the gun and that Tony Taouk had fired the gun. The following passage occurred in counsel for the appellant’s final address:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There was some suggestion by the learned Crown, as I understood her address to you and I could be corrected about this, there would be some difficulty in Tony shooting himself in the way he did. 
        
       
       
        
        But of course she was saying that in the context, as I understood it, if Tony used his right hand. And if indeed as the evidence would suggest because of the amount of residue the firing was done with the left hand, then, as I understand it, there would be no difficulty for that wound to be inflicted during the struggle – common sense, you have seen a – fighting with the gun hand could be tested (semble twisted) around et cetera. As I understood my friend and she will correct me if I am wrong, she was only submitting it wouldn’t be easy if, as I understand it, if he used his right hand. But the evidence is more probably than not, it was the left hand that fired the weapon. Because there is abundant additional residue on that hand”. 
        
       
      
    112 The part of the summing-up by the trial judge on which the present ground of appeal is based was as follows (summing-up pp 79-80):- 
     
      
       
        
        “Tony Taouk’s left hand was heavily impregnated, it had a heavy amount of gunshot residue on it, much more than on his right and much more than on either of the accused’s hands.  
        However, Tony Taouk was right handed as you know. So he would not have held the gun in his left hand. Mr Spencer says that is a sign not that he fired, but that that hand was in close proximity to the gun when it was fired, which suggests a loss of control 
        . You would not willingly, a right-handed person, lift up a gun and fire it in such a way as to cover your other hand with gunshot residue. The argument is that this was a struggle, it was out of control. How else does such a large amount of gunshot residue get onto the left hand, the non-dominant hand of the person?  
        
       
       
        
        They were the two arguments. The Crown says to you that it would not have been possible for Tony Taouk to shoot himself. The arguments both ways are simple enough, ladies and gentlemen. It is a question, in a struggle, and Tony Taouk was holding the gun, whether his right hand can be turned round to such a degree that the muzzle of the gun could be in the position it must have been, touching his singlet, and to give him a wound where you see the wound. 
        
       
       
        
        I think the contrary submissions are simple enough. The Crown says it would be unlikely that you would get such a wound if he were holding the gun and there was a struggle. Much more likely, the Crown says, that the accused was holding the gun right up against Tony’s chest and firing with the intention of killing of course, because you would infer no lesser intent than to kill if somebody held a gun against somebody’s chest and pulled the trigger”. 
        
       
      
    113 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant on this appeal that in this passage in the summing-up, and particularly in the part which has been emphasised, the trial judge wrongly attributed to counsel for the appellant at the trial an argument which counsel had not put and failed to put to the jury the argument which counsel had in fact put. It was submitted that in this passage the trial judge had wrongly attributed to trial counsel an argument that the gunshot residue on Tony Taouk’s left hand suggested, not that Tony Taouk had fired the gun with his left hand, but that Tony Taouk’s left hand had been in close proximity to the gun at the time it was fired and the circumstance that Tony Taouk’s left hand had been in close proximity to the gun at the time it was fired suggested that there had been a struggle between Tony Taouk and the appellant. On the other hand, the argument which counsel for the appellant had put, but which had not been put to the jury by the trial judge, was that the gunshot residue on Tony Taouk’s left hand suggested that Tony Taouk had fired the gun with his left hand. 
     
      
    114 It seems to me to be correct that in this part of the summing-up the trial judge attributed to counsel for the appellant at the trial an argument which was different from, and inconsistent with, an argument counsel had in fact put and did not put to the jury the argument which counsel had in fact put. However, before this ground of appeal could be upheld, there are a number of further matters which have to be taken into account. 
     
      
    115 Counsel for the appellant at the trial, who is a very experienced criminal counsel, did not object to this part of the trial judge’s summing-up and did not request any further direction. Even apart from the question of whether leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should be granted to rely on this ground of appeal, the fact that no objection was raised by counsel at the trial would suggest that it did not appear to counsel at the trial that there was any need to raise an objection. I have taken into account that trial counsel in an affidavit filed in this appeal said that he did not recall hearing the passage in the summing-up which has been emphasised and said that, if he had heard those words spoken by the trial judge, he would have sought to have them corrected. Nevertheless, I consider it significant that no objection was raised by counsel. 
     
      
    116 The passage in the summing-up which is relied on by the appellant occurred in a part of the summing-up in which his Honour was dealing with the element of the crime of murder, of an intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm (summing-up pp 77-82). Earlier in the summing-up the trial judge had dealt with the element of the crime of murder, that the accused did an act causing the death of the victim. In dealing with this element at pp 61-68 of the summing-up the trial judge referred to a number of arguments which had been made by counsel, including arguments for the accused based on the evidence of Mr Sarvas. The trial judge noted that counsel for the accused had submitted that the jury should find that the gun was produced by Tony Taouk. The trial judge proceeded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Now if that is right that has important consequences on this question whether the accused fired the gun which killed either Tony Taouk or Salam Taouk. There was one criticism that Mr Spencer made of Mr Sarvas. He said in his report that the presence of gunshot residue on the hand of Tony Taouk gave rise to an inference that he had fired the weapon. When he gave evidence before you – that is what he said in his report. When he gave evidence before you he said it gave rise to an inference that he may have fired the weapon. Now Mr Spencer made something of that. You heard him cross-examining Mr Sarvas about that and he made a submission to you about it at the end of the case. It is a matter for you whether there is any difference in those two expressions, an inference that he did or an inference that he may have. But if there is a difference Mr Spencer says, well Mr Sarvas is leaning the Crown way a bit”. 
        
       
      
    117 Accordingly, an argument that the presence of gunshot residue on Tony Taouk’s hand gave rise to an inference that he had fired the gun was put to the jury in the summing-up. 
     
      
    118 I would refuse leave under r 4 to rely on this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      3. The verdicts of the jury are unreasonable having regard to the evidence 
       
      
    119 The principles to be applied by a Court of Criminal Appeal in deciding whether verdicts of guilty are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence have been stated in such cases as M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 and MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 622-624 (52-59). The test to be applied is whether the Court of Criminal Appeal, after making its own independent assessment of the evidence, considers it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the accused’s guilt, applying the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, acting as a reasonable jury and reaching their verdict upon the whole of the evidence. “But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations” (M v The Queen per Mason CJ, Deane J, Dawson J and Toohey J at 493). 
     
      
    120 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that the present case was a case in which the Crown relied on circumstantial evidence to prove that it was the appellant who fired the shots which killed the two victims and, in order to determine whether the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence, the test should, in accordance with the decision of the High Court in Knight v The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 495 especially at 503 per Mason CJ, Dawson J and Toohey J, be rephrased as requiring this Court to determine whether the jury, acting reasonably, could have rejected as a rational inference the possibility that it was not the appellant, but Tony Taouk, who fired the shots which killed the two victims. 
     
      
    121 In his summing-up the trial judge listed the seven “circumstances” on which the Crown relied to prove that it was the appellant who had fired the shots which killed the two victims. The circumstances listed by the trial judge were:- 
     
      
       
        
        “First, the things said by the accused to Constable Munro, the effect of which was that he had shot somebody. Secondly, the accused was not injured. Thirdly, the accused had hidden the gun. Fourthly, the accused had a motive, whereas the only other candidate, Tony Taouk, had no motive to be firing shots. Five, Salam Taouk’s blood was found on the accused’s tracksuit pants. Six, there was gunshot residue on the accused’s hands. And, seven, some further admissions the Crown says the accused made during the recorded interview to the effect that he had earlier told the police that he had got the gun off Tony, meaning the deceased Tony Taouk, and that he had lost control”. 
        
       
      
    122 At pp 18-52 of the summing-up the trial judge discussed these seven circumstances in some detail and he returned to some of them in later parts of the summing-up. 
     
      
    123 On this appeal counsel for the appellant submitted that there were a number of “features of the evidence” which, taken in combination, would require this Court to conclude that it was not open to the jury, acting reasonably, to reject as a rational inference the possibility that it was not the appellant but Tony Taouk who fired the shots which killed the two victims. These features of the evidence included the following:- 
     
      
       
      (i) There was no evidence of a motive or of a sufficient motive for the appellant to kill either of the victims. There was much evidence at the trial that there had been a loving relationship between the appellant and his wife and a good relationship between the appellant and his brother-in-law. 
       
       
      (ii) The appellant had reported the incident at his home to the police and had co-operated with the police in their investigation of the shootings. 
       
       
      (iii) Although it was true that the gun had not been found, it would have been inconsistent for the appellant to report the shootings and yet dispose of the gun and there was a possibility that the gun had been disposed of by one of the adult children. 
       
       
      (iv) A theory advanced by the Crown at the trial that the gun had been obtained from the cavity in the roof of the garage was not supported by any evidence. For example, no gunshot residues had been found in the cavity. 
       
       
      (v) A police dog specially trained to detect firearms and gunshot residue had picked up a scent only in the bedroom occupied by Maroun Taouk. 
       
       
      (vi) The fact that as many as six shots had been fired and the evidence about the four shots which had not struck either victim, including the evidence about the places where those bullets had been found, was consistent with there having been a struggle in which the gun had been discharged without having been aimed in any particular direction. 
       
       
      (vii) In the recorded interview the appellant demonstrated how he said Tony Taouk had produced the gun, this demonstration being consistent with Tony Taouk having pulled the gun out of the waistband of his jeans. 
       
       
      (viii) The bullet which caused the death of Salam Taouk was fired from a distance variously described by the expert witnesses as “indeterminate” and “distant” and this was consistent with the bullet having been fired during the course of a struggle between the appellant and Tony Taouk. 
       
       
      (ix) In the recorded interview the appellant denied that he had told Constable Munro that he had shot someone and the appellant said that it was Tony Taouk who had fired the gun. 
       
       
      (x) Tony Taouk had bruising on the knuckles of his right hand and this was consistent with the appellant’s assertion in the recorded interview that he and Tony Taouk had been fighting and that Tony Taouk had “slapped” the appellant. 
       
       
      (xi) Tony Taouk had some experience of handling and firing guns (he had been a member of a militia in Lebanon). A number of witnesses at the trial gave evidence that they had not seen the appellant with a gun. 
       
       
      (xii) Mrs Lunn, a neighbour, had seen a man, who it was submitted would have been the appellant, go down the side passageway of the appellant’s home and out the gate in the direction of the police station, immediately after the shots were fired. 
       
       
      (xiii) Mrs Estaphan gave evidence which, if accepted, would have been favourable to the Crown, that she could hear the appellant’s voice in the background of a recorded emergency call made by one of the children after the shootings. However, this evidence was contradicted by Mrs Lunn’s evidence of seeing a man leave the house immediately after the shootings, by evidence of all five of the adult children who said that they had not seen the appellant after the shootings and by the evidence of Mrs Estaphan’s husband, who said that he could not hear the appellant’s voice in the recording. 
       
       
      (xiv) The number of particles of gunshot residue found on the hands of Tony Taouk and particularly on the left hand of Tony Taouk and in the inside waistband and pockets of the jeans worn by Tony Taouk, and the fewer number of particles of gunshot residue found on the hands of the appellant and the absence of any particles of gunshot residue in the inside waistband and pockets of the tracksuit pants worn by the appellant suggested that it was Tony Taouk who had been carrying the gun inside his jeans and that it was at least reasonably possible that it was Tony Taouk who had fired the gun. 
       
      
    124 Although the trial judge in his summing-up described as “circumstances” the seven matters on which the Crown relied to prove that it was the appellant who had fired the shots which killed the victims, it is questionable whether all of these matters should be classified as being circumstantial evidence. In particular, the first and seventh matters were evidence of admissions made by the appellant. The things said by the appellant to Constable Munro, according to Constable Munro’s evidence, included admissions by the appellant that he had shot someone at his house and that he had fired a few shots with a gun. Nevertheless, although the Crown case was not a wholly circumstantial case, I am prepared to accept that I should apply the test of an unreasonable verdict stated by the High Court in Knight, which, in any event, appears to me to be merely an adaptation to a circumstantial case of the general test of whether a verdict is unreasonable. 
     
      
    125 In my opinion, as was submitted by counsel for the appellant, the jury should have found or should have found that it was at least reasonably possible, that it was Tony Taouk, and not the appellant, who had been carrying the gun prior to the shootings. Such a finding would be supported by Constable Munro’s evidence of what the appellant told him (“…he had a gun. I took it off him”), by evidence of what the appellant said in the interview (“he was carrying a gun”), by evidence of the appellant’s demonstration during the interview of how Tony Taouk had produced the gun, by the evidence of gunshot residue in the inside waistband and pockets of the jeans worn by Tony Taouk and by evidence of the absence of gunshot residue in the inside waistband and pockets of the tracksuit pants worn by the appellant. In my opinion, the jury ought to have had at least a reasonable doubt that the gun had been obtained from the cavity in the roof of the garage of the house. 
     
      
    126 I am further of the opinion that the jury should have found, or should have found that it was at least reasonably possible, that there was a struggle in the hallway of the first floor of the house between the appellant and Tony Taouk, who at the beginning of the struggle was armed with the gun. Such a finding would be supported by Constable Munro’s evidence of what the appellant told him, by answers given by the appellant in the recorded interview and by evidence of the number of shots fired and of the places where a number of the bullets were found. 
     
      
    127 I consider that it was open to the jury to be satisfied that in the struggle between the appellant and Tony Taouk the appellant took the gun away from Tony Taouk. Such a finding would be supported by Constable Munro’s evidence of what the appellant told him (“I took it (the gun) off him”) and by answers given by the appellant in the recorded interview, including the answer that he had indeed told Constable Munro that he had taken the gun from Tony Taouk (answer to question 23). 
     
      
    128 The jury having found that the appellant had disarmed Tony Taouk and himself taken possession of the gun, it would have been open to the jury to accept Constable Munro’s evidence that the appellant told him that, having taken the gun, he fired a few shots with it. The jury, of course, had the advantage, denied to this Court, of seeing and hearing Constable Munro give his evidence. 
     
      
    129 The circumstance relied on by the Crown, that the gun, notwithstanding a thorough police search of the house and the adjoining area, had not been found, was a circumstance which the jury could properly have regarded as significant as demonstrating a consciousness of guilt on the part of the appellant. Neither of the victims could have disposed of the gun. All of the adult children of the appellant gave evidence to the effect that they had not disposed of the gun and there would not appear to be any ground for not accepting their evidence. According to the evidence, all of the children remained inside the house until the police arrived and then subsequently remained inside the house. By a process of elimination it could be found that the only person who could have disposed of the gun was the appellant and it could be inferred that he had disposed of the gun at some distance away from the house. 
     
      
    130 A further circumstance relied on by the Crown was that, according to the evidence of an analyst, there was a match between Salam Taouk’s DNA and that extracted from a place on the tracksuit pants worn by the appellant, where a small reddish brown stain was detected. The stain had tested positively to a presumptive test for blood but had not been subjected to any definitive test for blood. 
     
      
    131 Mr Sarvas was of the opinion that the gunshot residue on the hands of each of the appellant and Tony Taouk could have been caused by firing a gun held in the hand or by the hand having been in close proximity to a gun when it was fired. 
     
      
    132 A much greater number of particles of gunshot residue were found on the hands of Tony Taouk than on the hands of the appellant. However, this could be explained by Tony Taouk having been shot and by his body lying immobile in the yard of the house from soon after he was shot, with the consequence that comparatively few particles of gunshot residue were dislodged from his skin; whereas the appellant had travelled from his home at Strathfield to the police station at Burwood and would have lost particles of gunshot residue from his skin on the journey. 
     
      
    133 Notwithstanding the large number of gunshot residue particles found on the left hand of Tony Taouk and the argument put by trial counsel which was the subject of the second ground of appeal, it seems to me to be highly improbable that Tony Taouk would have discharged the gun with his left hand. As a right hand dominant person he would surely have used his right hand in producing the gun. Although I have concluded that it would have been open to the jury to find that in a struggle between the appellant and Tony Taouk the appellant had taken the gun away from Tony Taouk, it seems to me highly improbable that in any struggle the gun would have been transferred from Tony Taouk’s right hand to his left hand. In my opinion, it was open to the jury to find that the large number of particles of gunshot residue on Tony Taouk’s left hand had been caused, not by Tony Taouk firing the gun while holding it in his left hand, but by his left hand being in close proximity to the gun when it was discharged by the appellant. As the Crown prosecutor submitted, it would have been physically difficult for Tony Taouk, if holding the gun in his right hand, to have shot himself on the right side of his chest. 
     
      
    134 It would have been open to the jury to regard some of the answers given by the appellant in the recorded interview as assisting the Crown case. Furthermore, the appellant asserted in the interview that he did not remember what had happened after he had lost control and such account as he did give, even allowing for the fact that the interview was being conducted through an interpreter, was disjointed and inconsistent. It would have been open to the jury to have formed an unfavourable view of the appellant’s credibility in some parts of the interview. For example, it would seem hardly credible that the appellant, as he asserted, was unaware until told by police that his wife had been shot and was lying in the hallway of the first floor of the house. 
     
      
    135 I have taken into account that there was very little evidence of motive. There was, indeed, evidence of the appellant having a good relationship with both his wife and his brother-in-law. What the Crown described as evidence of motive was, at its highest, evidence by Madeline Taouk, Helen Taouk and Maroun Taouk tending to show that the appellant had become angry because his wife and two of his daughters had returned home late and because he thought, erroneously, that his wife had been out with Tony Taouk (recorded interview questions and answers 121 and 122). 
     
      
    136 In conducting my independent examination of the evidence I have endeavoured to take into account the circumstances relied on by the Crown, the features of the evidence relied on by the appellant and the whole of the rest of the evidence. I have concluded that it was open to the jury, acting reasonably, to reject as a rational inference the possibility that it was Tony Taouk who had fired the shots which killed the two victims. I have concluded, applying the test stated in M, that it was open to the jury, applying the criminal standard of proof, acting reasonably and having regard to the whole of the evidence, to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt. I would reject the third ground of appeal. 
     
      
    137 As I am of the opinion that all three of the grounds of appeal relied on by the appellant should be rejected, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    138 HISLOP J: I agree with James J. 
     
      
    139 HALL, J: The appellant was charged with two counts that on 29 September 2002, he murdered his wife, Salem Taouk, by fatally shooting her and additionally murdering his brother-in-law, Tony Taouk (his wife’s brother) by fatally shooting him. The trial was conducted in the Supreme Court before Barr, J. and a jury. On 22 June 2004, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty to both counts. 
     
      
    140 In the early hours of Sunday 29 September 2002, the appellant presented himself at Burwood Police Station and there reported a disturbance to a Constable Munro. The evidence as to what was said by the appellant was admitted into evidence over objection. The evidence contained certain admissions said to have been made by the appellant. The relevant conversation was in the following terms;- 
     
      
       
        
        “Appellant: I want to report a disturbance at my house. 
        
       
       
        
        Munro: What’s happened? 
        
       
       
        
        Appellant: I’ve just shot someone at my house. I had an argument with my brother and he had a gun. I took it off him and fired a few shots. 
        
       
       
        
        Munro: Is anyone hurt? 
        
       
       
        
        Appellant: I don’t know. 
        
       
       
        
        Munro: What’s the address? 
        
       
       
        
        Appellant: 61 Redmyre Road, Strathfield. 
        
       
       
        
        Munro: Just a moment.” 
        
       
      
    141 There was further conversation with Constable Munro which was excluded from evidence, as were subsequent conversations with other officers. 
     
      
    142 The conversation between the appellant and Constable Munro set out above was not recorded at the time it took place either electronically or by any other means. 
     
      
    143 It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the provisions of s.281 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) applied so as to exclude evidence of the conversation. It was contended on behalf of the appellant that by virtue of s.281(2) the conversation was not admissible as there had been no tape recording made and it had not been established that a failure in that respect was by reason of a reasonable excuse within the meaning of s.281(2) of the Act. Ground one of the appeal accordingly turns on a consideration of the provisions of that section. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Admitting disputed evidence of admissions which were not electronically recorded 
       
       
      Confessions and admissions in the course of official questioning 
      
    144 Legislation has been enacted in the Australian States and at the Commonwealth level requiring official questioning to be electronically recorded, subject to specified exceptions. 
     
      
    145 In Nicholls v. R; Coates v. R (2005) 213 ALR 1, the High Court (Hayne and Heydon, JJ.) observed (at 85) that an examination of legislation in other jurisdictions (together with that in Western Australia) revealed that nowhere has any legislature adopted an absolute stand against the reception of non-video taped admissions and different legislatures had made different selections of language and, to some extent, different policy choices. 
     
      
    146 In Kelly v. The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 538, the High Court (Gleeson, CJ., Hayne and Heydon, JJ.) stated that the object or purpose of s.8 of the Criminal Law (Detention and Interrogation) Act 1995 (Tas) was to overcome the “perceived problems” identified in many earlier cases and that the range of legislative responses shows that those problems can be overcome in different ways and to different degrees. Their Honours observed that the “purpose or object” identified does not compel any particular construction of the quite detailed language of that section:- 
     
      
       
        
        “What the correct construction is must depend on the particular words used.” (548) 
        
       
      
    147 In Kelly (supra), it was also observed that the legislation did not in terms require that the statement by way of admission be made “in response to a question put” as s.86 of the Evidence Act 2001 (Tas) does. Section 8 employs the phrase, “in the course of official questioning” as does s.281(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). This will include a confession which is entirely non-responsive to any question or is uttered during a pause in the flow of questions without being stimulated by any question (at p.549A-B). 
     
      
    148 The mischief behind legislation of this kind has been identified as the countering of an attack on the administration of justice by force of unreliable confessions or admissions allegedly made by suspects “during a police investigation of a serious criminal offence”: McHugh, J. in Kelly  at 560. 
     
      
    149 The provisions of s.281 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) contain the following elements:- 
     
      
       
      (a) It applies to  
      “an admission” 
      . 
      
     
     
      
      (b) Made by an accused person in specified circumstances, namely:- 
      
     
     
      
       (i) who at the time the admission was made was or could reasonably have been suspected by an investigating official to have committed an offence; 
       
       
       (ii) was made in the course of official questioning (defined as meaning questioning by an investigating official  
      in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence 
      ); and 
       
       
       (ii) That relates to an indictable offence, other than the indictable offence that can be dealt with summarily without the consent of the accused person. 
       
      
    150 Section 281(2) then provides that evidence of an admission is not admissible unless there is available to the court a tape recording as specified or if the prosecution establishes that there was a “reasonable excuse” as to why a tape recording … could not be made. 
     
      
    151 It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the trial judge had misdirected himself in interpreting the provisions of s.281(1) and misapplied the provisions of the section. In the judgment on the objection to the tender of the evidence of admissions by the appellant, the trial judge (Barr, J.) stated (paragraph 3):- 
     
      
       
        
        “Constable Munroe did not know the accused and did not know, until the accused told him, that there had been a shooting at his house. It seems to me that Constable Munroe did not suspect and had no reason to suspect that the accused had committed any offence. Section 281 of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
         therefore has no application to the first conversation that he and the accused had. In my opinion the whole of the contents of paragraph 4 of Constable Munroe’s statement is admissible and subject to any objection on any different ground, ought to be admitted into evidence.” 
        
       
      
    152 The appellant relies in support of his argument on the interpretation of s.281(1) upon the difference in the phrase ”could reasonably have been suspected” as distinct from the equivalent provision considered in Kelly v. The Queen, namely “who ought reasonably to have been suspected”. The distinction between s.281 and s.250D of the Criminal Code (WA) considered in Nicholls & Coates was also relied upon to support the construction contended for in this case. 
     
      
    153 It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the phrase “could reasonably have been suspected” should be construed to mean “could have been suspected as a reasonable possibility”. The appellant argued for a different interpretation to that which has been applied in relation to statutory powers of arrest or for the issue of search warrants contending that the purpose or object of the legislative provisions in question required a different and broader construction. 
     
      
    154 For the appellant’s argument to succeed it must be possible, on the facts of the case, to demonstrate:- 
     
      
       
      • That the facts established by evidence revealed that the appellant  
      “could reasonably have been suspected” 
       by an investigating official of having committed an offence; and 
       
       
      • That the admission in question was made  
      “in the course of official questioning” 
      , an expression defined in the section: s.281(4). 
       
      
    155 As to the first of these two matters, the appellant contended that the circumstances which could reasonably have raised the suspicion included the appellant’s attendance at the police station, the hour of his attendance and his statement “I want to report a disturbance at my house”. Whilst, on one view, the word “report” may be said to indicate an official notification of a disturbance, it is hard to see in the use of that word in its context any implication that the appellant was reporting or about to report on his own commission of an indictable offence or that he was about to report circumstances that could constitute such an offence. The following facts in combination, in my opinion, point against the proposition that the appellant could reasonably have been suspected of having committed an offence:- 
     
      
       
      • He had not been taken to the police station by police but had travelled there and voluntarily entered it. 
       
       
      • He was at no time in official custody or subject to police detention. 
       
       
      • The appellant was the one who initiated the oral exchange. 
       
       
      • There had been no attempt by the police officer to adduce evidence of a confession or an admission. The officer’s question was a responsive one to the appellant’s opening statement. 
       
       
      • The question raised by the police office  
      “what’s happened?” 
       following upon the appellant’s initial statement, was not a question raised at the commencement or during a then current or ongoing investigation. Nor arguably could the question be seen at the time it was raised as the initial step in a later or subsequent investigation. 
       
      
    156 In Nicholls, Kirby, J. observed that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… circumstances will arise where the provisions of the Code (WA) are inapplicable (eg., admissions blurted out before the accused is a suspect …” (at 58). 
        
       
      
    157 The circumstances disclosed by the evidence in the present proceedings would seem to conform to those described by Kirby, J. 
     
      
    158 The “trigger” for the application of the protections afforded by s.281 is the moment when a police officer to whom a confession or admission has been made, suspected or could reasonably have suspected the appellant to have committed an offence. Accordingly the legislation excludes from protection confessional statements made before that level of suspicion is reached. In Kelly, Kirby, J. stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… whilst it is true that this ‘trigger’ would exclude from protection confessional statements made before that level of suspicion was reached (and hence would not protect a statement blurted out by a person at a crime scene or on the telephone before suspicion attached), the initiation of the obligation is significant …” 
        
       
      
    159 The meaning and content of the phrase in s.281(1) “could reasonably have been suspected” may be considered in light of authorities in other fields where “reasonable suspicion” or the expression “reasonably suspects” as concepts have been examined. Whilst those authorities have arisen in different legislative contexts, some guidance may be obtained although due caution must be made having regard to the particular terms of s.281 and its evident legislative purpose. 
     
      
       
      (i) As to the word  
      suspected” 
       in s.281(1)(a), a  
      “suspicion” 
       that something exists is more than a mere idle wondering whether it exists or not; it is a positive feeling of actual apprehension or mistrust amounting to  
      “a slight opinion, but without sufficient evidence” 
      :  
      Queensland Bacon Pty. Limited v. Rees  
      (1965-1966) 115 CLR 266, 303 per Kitto, J. 
       
       
      (ii) As to the word  
      “reasonably” 
       in s.281(1)(a), it has been observed that a reason to suspect that a fact exists is more than a reason to consider or look into the possibility of its existence:  
      Queensland Bacon 
       (supra) at 303. In the context of the legislation there in question (s.95(4) of the Bankruptcy Act 1924-1960 (Cth))  
      “reason to suspect” 
       was taken as referring to something which, in all the circumstances,  
      would 
       create in the mind of the reasonable person in the person in the position of the payee in that case an actual apprehension or fear that the situation of the payer is the actual fact which the provision described (a mistrust of the payer’s ability to pay his debts). (I note here the possible significance in this formulation of the word  
      “would” 
       as distinct from  
      “could” 
       in s.281(1)(a). 
       
       
      (iii) As to the statutory provision for the issue of a search warrant under s.679(b) of the Criminal Code (Q) – in particular the phrase  
      “there are  
      reasonable grounds 
       for suspecting that there is in any house …” 
       etc. 
       
       
        
        •  
        “Suspicion” 
         in its ordinary meaning is a state of conjecture or surmise where proof is lacking. 
        
       
       
        
        • Some factual basis or foundation must exist under the provision to ground the suspicion:  
        Walsh v. Loughnan 
         [1991] 2 VR 351. 
        
       
      
    160 It is also necessary to identify the subject matter of suspicion. The basis of the suspicion referred to in s.281(1)(a) is the state of mind of an investigating official. That state of mind is more than mere surmise. Applying a similar approach as has been applied with respect to search warrant legislation, it is one arrived at on the basis of material that is capable of supporting the formation of an opinion, even if only a slight opinion, that the person in question (the accused) could have committed an offence. As to this approach generally, see George v. Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 104, 115-116. See also Regina v. Rondo (2001) 126 A. Crim. R. 562, 576. 
     
      
    161 In summary, the suspicion must be one which could reasonably have been held by an investigating officer at the relevant point in time, namely, the time when the admission was made. Whether the suspicion satisfies the specified requirement as to reasonableness, is to be determined by the existence of grounds for the suspicion, which grounds must be based on or sourced in facts that do or tend to implicate the accused in possible criminal conduct of the relevant kind, an indictable offence, and that therefore are capable of giving rise to or supporting the requisite state of mind. It follows that a mere possibility that a person referred to in s.281(1)(a) could have committed an offence is insufficient. 
     
      
    162 The questions arising from the appellant’s submissions on ground one of the appeal ultimately are:- 
     
      
       
      (a) Whether the evidence establishes that, at the time the admission was made, the appellant  
      was or could reasonably have been suspected … 
       of having committed an offence. 
       
       
      (b) Whether the police officer at the Burwood Police Station to whom the appellant spoke, Constable Munro, was an investigating official for the purposes of s.281(1)(a). 
       
       
      (c) Even assuming that the police officer was an investigating official within the meaning of the section, whether the admission was made  
      in the course of official questioning 
      , a concept which is connected by the definition of that expression with  
      the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence 
      . 
       
      
    163 As to the concept “… in the course of official questioning”, the following points potentially arise:- 
     
      
       
      • Whether the applicant, at the material time, was in attendance at the police station  
      “in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence” 
       (the phrase appearing in the definition of  
      “official questioning” 
      ). 
        
       
       
      • Whether such questioning as did occur (the officer’s question) could be said, at the relevant point in time, to have been official questioning, that is questioning by an investigating official  
      in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence 
      . 
       
      
    164 At the time of the admission, an investigation clearly had not commenced, unless the police officer’s initial question can be taken as the commencement point of an investigation. That is one interpretation that is open. A competing interpretation is that it was a question in the initial exchange that preceded any investigation. I am prepared to accept that the former is the case on the established facts.  
     
      
    165 I have concluded that it is difficult to see how the appellant’s statement “I want to report a disturbance at my house” could in itself, along with surrounding circumstances (which would include the attendance at the police station at the early hours of the morning) reasonably make the appellant a suspect within the meaning of s.281(1)(a). As to the alternative submission made, namely, that the trial judge should have exercised the discretion conferred by s.90 of the Evidence Act to refuse to admit the evidence of the conversation with Constable Munro or alternatively by virtue of the discretion under s.138 of the Evidence Act, I, with respect, agree with the reasons expressed by James, J. in his judgment which has been circulated in draft. I accordingly would reject these alternative bases in relation to Ground 1. 
     
      
    166 I am accordingly of the opinion that the first ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    167 The second ground of appeal is framed in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
      The directions given by the trial judge on the manner in which the jury might approach the evidence relating to finding of gunshot residue on the hands of both the appellant and the deceased, Tony Taouk, were erroneous and inadequate 
       
      
    168 This ground of appeal can be seen, in my opinion, as raising two separate, but nonetheless, related points. The first concerns the question as to whether the trial judge sufficiently or accurately conveyed to the jury the potential significance of the expert evidence on gunshot residue, namely that it was consistent with Tony Taouk firing the gun. The second concerns the possible significance of the expert evidence on the gunshot residue findings in a circumstantial evidence case and whether the directions in that context sufficiently complied with accepted principles. 
     
      
    169 This second question, more specifically goes to the question as to whether the evidence on gunshot residue found on Tony Taouk’s hand supported a hypothesis consistent with innocence or that it meant that the jury must have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant. On either basis, a question arises as to the adequacy of the trial judge’s directions.170 Before dealing with these issues, it is necessary to put the evidence as to gunshot residue in its proper context. Whilst the Crown’s case depended significantly on circumstantial evidence, it was not entirely so dependent. In particular:- 
     
      
       
      • If the statement by way of admissions by the appellant to Constable Munro was properly admitted, then the case was not entirely a circumstantial evidence case.  
      
     
     
      
      • In addition, the appellant made further admissions in the record of interview as to taking the gun off Tony Taouk and having lost control (see the discussion on  
      admissions  
      below). 
       
      
    171 However, notwithstanding those admissions, there still remains a question as to whether the jury was properly instructed on the relevant principles in a case in which the Crown relied, to a significant extent, on circumstantial evidence.  
     
      
    172 It is in that context, I believe, that the issue raised by the appellant in the second ground of appeal should be considered.  
     
      
    173 I should observe here that the issue raised by the evidence as to gunshot residue in the second ground of appeal also appears as a discrete aspect of the third ground of appeal (paragraph 37) which states:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In the appellant’s case, it was not open to the jury to exclude as a reasonable possibility based on the evidence that the appellant was not responsible for the deaths of his wife and brother in law. There is a reasonable inference available from the evidence, and not excluded by the evidence, that Tony Taouk not only produced the gun which caused his own death and that of Salem Taouk, but also that he was the person who fired the gun. On the evidence, it was not open to exclude this conclusion beyond reasonable doubt.” 
          
        
       
      
    174 Accordingly, in what follows consideration is given to both the second ground of appeal and to that particular aspect of the third ground. 
     
      
       
      Circumstantial evidence principles 
       
      
    175 I set out below, in summary form, formulations of the circumstantial evidence principles:- 
     
      
       
      (i) A single circumstance inconsistent with a conclusion of guilt in a circumstantial evidence case in itself may be sufficient to destroy the hypothesis of guilt:  
      Peacock v. The King 
       (1911) 13 CLR 619, 614 per Griffith, CJ. 
       
       
      (ii) In a circumstantial evidence case, to prove guilt it is necessary, not only that guilt should be a rational inference, but the only rational inference that the circumstances will enable a jury to draw:  
      Plomp v. The Queen 
       (1963) 110 CLR 234, 252 per Menzies, J. 
       
       
      (iii) If an issue is to be proved by circumstantial evidence, facts subsidiary to or connected with the main fact must be established from which the conclusion follows as a rational inference. In the inculpation of an accused person, the evidentiary circumstances must bear no other reasonable explanation. This means that, according to the common course of human affairs, the degree of probability that the occurrence of facts proved would be accompanied by the occurrence of the fact to be proved is so high that the contrary cannot reasonably be supposed:  
      Martin v. Osborne  
      (1936) 55 CLR 367, 375 per Dixon, J. 
       
       
      (iv) In  
      Plomp 
       (ante), Dixon, CJ. cited his own observations in  
      Martin 
       (ante) and acknowledged the difficulty found in stating the rule and attempted clarification by citing his further words in  
      Martin 
       (ante):- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “This means that, according to the common course of human affairs, the degree of probability that the occurrence of the facts proved would be accompanied by the occurrence of the fact to be proved is so high that the contrary cannot reasonably be supposed.” 
           (at p.375) 
          
         
        
       
       
      (v) To enable a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused it is necessary not only that his guilt should be a rational inference, but that it should be  
      “the only rational inference that the circumstances would enable them to draw” 
      :

       (ante) at 252. See also  
      Thomas v. The Queen 
       (1960) 102 CLR 584, 605-606;  
      Barca v. The Queen 
       (1975) 133 CLR 82, 104. 
       
       
      (vi) The customary direction in a circumstantial evidence case is that guilt should not only be a rational inference but should be the only rational inference that could be drawn from the circumstances:  
      Hodge’s case 
       (1838) 2 Lewin 227 (168 ER 1136);  
      Peacock 
       (ante);  
      Plomp 
       (ante);  
      Shepherd v. The Queen 
       (1990) 170 CLR 573. 
       
       
      (vii) The jury must be told that a reasonable doubt arises where any other inference consistent with innocence is reasonably open on the evidence:  
      Shepherd 
       (ante) at 579. 
       
       
      (vii) In essence, if a reasonable jury ought to have found that an inference or hypothesis consistent with innocence was open on the evidence, then the jury should give the accused the benefit of the doubt necessarily created by that circumstance:  
      Knight v. The Queen  
      (1992) 175 CLR 495, 503 per Mason, CJ., Dawson and Toohey, JJ. 
       
      
    176 The second ground of appeal essentially raises two factual issues which, in combination, are stated as constituting a version of events as to a reasonable possibility that is not consistent with the guilt of the appellant. The two issues of fact are:- 
     
      
       
      (a) That the expert evidence on gunshot residue establishes that the deceased Tony Taouk had carried the gun and introduced it into the confrontation that clearly took place (the evidence relating to the presence of residue particles found on the waist band of the trousers and in the pockets of Tony Taouk). 
       
       
      (b) That the deceased, Tony Taouk, had in fact used the gun (in this respect it being contended that the accumulation of gun residue found on Tony Taouk’s left hand is consistent with him having fired the weapon). 
       
      
    177 The expert evidence of Mr. Ivan Sarvas, forensic scientist, is relied upon as supporting a conclusion favourable to the appellant on both these factual issues. 
     
      
    178 The evidence of Mr. Sarvas is to be found at transcript pages 585 to 615. The following points of significance arise from that evidence:- 
     
      
       
      • Gunshot residue found was found on the waist band and pockets of the jeans taken from the person of Tony Taouk: t.597, line 20-27. [The exhibit tag as to the former stated  
      “inside waist band” 
      .] 
       
       
      • The presence of gun shot residue particles on the inside waist band and pockets of the jeans invites the inference that the person wearing the clothing (Tony Taouk) had transported or held a weapon against the waist band: t.601, line 55-58. However, it may well be possible that material found on the waist band may have resulted out of a close proximity shot: t.602, line 1-5. (Mr. Sarvas added that he did not know whether the particles had come from the waist band or indeed from the pockets or from both, thus giving rise to some lack of specificity on this issue. See in this regard also the evidence of Senior Constable Gane at t.381-454, especially at t.424, 445-447.) 
       
       
      • Depending upon how dirty the weapon is, it is possible that gunshot residue could be transferred to the pockets or waist band of the trousers prior to it being discharged: t.602, line 44-55. 
       
       
      • The gunshot residue found on the hands of the appellant suggested either that he had discharged the firearm  
      or 
       the firearm was discharged in close proximity to him: t.607, line 39-44. 
       
       
      • It follows from that fact that one cannot say whether the appellant had in fact discharged the firearm or was in close proximity when it was discharged: t.607, line 44-47. 
       
       
      • Based on the number of particles detected on the left hand of Tony Taouk, there was an inference that he may have discharged a weapon: t.601, line 25-30. 
       
       
      • In his report, Mr. Sarvas had said that the gunshot residue evidence invited the inference that Tony Taouk  
      had discharged the gun 
      . His oral evidence modified the position to say  
      may have 
       discharged the firearm with his left hand. 
       
       
      • In his report he wrote that the evidence indicated either that Simon Taouk could have discharged the firearm  
      or 
       was in close proximity: t.609, line 50-60. 
       
       
      • It is true to say that the gunshot residue particles were not found on the inside waist band or inside pockets of the track pants of the appellant: t.613, line 15-20. 
       
      
    179 Accordingly, Mr. Sarvas adhered to his opinion that the gunshot residue particles on the left hand of Tony Taouk invited the inference that he may have discharged the weapon with his left hand (Tony Taouk having been a right handed person). 
     
      
    180 The central point of this ground of appeal is directed at the inadequacy of the direction given by the trial judge in relation to the evidence which left it open to the jury to conclude:- 
     
      
       
      (a) that the gun was carried by Tony Taouk; 
       
       
      (b) the absence of gunshot residue on the appellant’s trousers supported the conclusion that it was Tony Taouk who introduced the gun; 
       
       
      (c) on the basis of the expert evidence of the forensic scientist, Mr. Sarvas, the number of particles detected on the left hand of Tony Taouk provides an inference that Tony may have discharged the weapon; 
       
       
      (d) Mr. Sarvas confirmed that what he was saying was that Simon Taouk (the appellant) could have discharged the firearm, or, was in close proximity and the same thing applies to Tony (t.609, lines 50-55); 
       
       
      (e) there were a significantly larger number of gunshot particles on Tony Taouk’s hands than on Simon Taouk’s hands. (There is, however, more than one explanation as to why this was the case). 
       
      
    181 The trial judge’s summing up in relation to the significance of the expert evidence can be seen, in particular, at pp.50-51 and pp.79-80 of the summing up. Referring to the evidence of Mr. Sarvas in relation to the significant number of detectable pieces of gunshot residue, the trial judge stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “What he could not say was that the accused must have fired the firearm, because it was  
        equally consistent 
        , and he’s in no position to judge, with the hands on which the deposit was found being in close proximity to a firearm fired by somebody else.” 
         (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    182 The trial judge’s summing up (at p.51) referred to question 23 of the interview with the appellant in which he conceded that he said that he had taken the gun off his brother in law. In answer to question 24, he said “I lost, I lost control and I went to the police”. On the question of whether the evidence indicated that Tony Taouk had been the shooter, there was some reference by the trial judge to the evidence of Mr. Sarvas in cross-examination and what he had written in his original report (trial judge’s summing up, p.68). This segment, however, does not refer expressly to the possibility of Tony Taouk shooting with his left hand. The reference at p.68 is simply to the question as to whether Tony Taouk had fired the gun, not whether he could have done so using his left hand, which was specifically raised with Mr. Sarvas in cross-examination. 
     
      
    183 At pp.79-80, the trial judge, in his summing up, referred to the fact that Tony Taouk’s left hand was heavily impregnated, it having a heavy amount of gunshot residue on it, much more than on his right and much than on either of the accused’s hands. 
     
      
    184 The summing up goes on, however, to refer to Tony Taouk being right handed followed by the statement “so he would not have held the gun in his left hand”. That appears to be an unequivocal statement which tends to negate the possibility, conceded in the evidence of Mr. Sarvas, that he could, however, in fact have fired the gun using his left hand. If he had done so, then of course, the injuries to his right upper chest would be more explicable or consistent as having occurred during a struggle with the appellant. 
     
      
    185 The argument put by the appellant’s counsel, as referred to by the trial judge towards the end of p.79 of the summing up, still does not address the issue of the possibility that Tony Taouk had used his left hand to shoot. Again, at the top of p.80, the summing up refers to a struggle, suggesting that there is a question as to whether the right hand of Tony Taouk could be turned around to such a degree that the muzzle of the gun could be said to be in a position that it must have been to given him a wound in the right chest. 
     
      
       
      Analysis: expert evidence in (in large part) a circumstantial evidence case 
       
      
    186 The evidence that supports an inference that the gun was introduced by Tony Taouk, is significant. A person would not normally be expected to carry and obtain a gun unless there was a real prospect that the person intended to use it for one reason or another (either as a threat or an act of aggression or in self-defence). However, as the Crown emphasised at the trial, it was not a question of who introduced the gun. The question was who used it. 
     
      
    187 The evidence of the presence of gun residue on Tony Taouk’s left hand is, as previously noted, potentially significant. 
     
      
    188 However, the Crown having the onus of proof in this largely circumstantial evidence case, and the fact that there had not been a clear direction as to the possibility that Tony Taouk fired the gun with his left hand as established by the evidence, raises the possibility that an important issue of fact may not have been properly put to the jury. 
     
      
    189 It is, in this context, that the principles in Knight v. The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 495 are relied upon. 
     
      
    190 There is the further factual matter also to be brought into account. The appellant gave evidence that Tony Taouk slapped him in the face with his right hand (which may be consistent with him holding the gun in his left hand). It was at that moment that the appellant said that he lost control. 
     
      
    191 In the present case, senior counsel for the appellant, Mr. Byrne, SC. stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, in the circumstances of this appellant’s case, the question can be re-phrased to ask whether the jury, acting reasonably, could have rejected as a rational inference the possibility that it was Tony Taouk who had fired the gun which killed both himself and the wife of the appellant. On the whole of the material before the Court, that could not be excluded, in our submission, as a rational inference from the whole of the evidence.” (t.19, 22 March 2005)  
        
       
      
    192 The most favourable possible view overall of the evidence from the appellant’s view is:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The evidence establishes that a struggle occurred between him and Tony Taouk; 
       
       
      (b) The expert evidence, standing alone, establishes as a reasonable possibility that Tony Taouk both initially carried or transported the gun and fired it with his left hand and perhaps having first struck the appellant with his right hand. 
       
       
      (c) The events in (b) would reconcile the fact that Tony Taouk was shot (the appellant says accidentally in the struggle) in the right side of the chest. 
       
       
      (d) The evidence is consistent with, at least, some gunshots (out of a total of six gunshots) being fired in a somewhat random fashion consistent with their discharge during a struggle. 
       
       
      (e) The appellant’s attendance at Burwood Police Station is inconsistent with guilt. 
       
       
      (f) The possibility of a random shot accidentally hitting Salem Taouk in the back of the shoulder at a distance of at least 50 centimetres or more from the muzzle of the gun. 
       
      
    193 Had the Crown’s case been a wholly circumstantial evidence case, the expert evidence that established that Tony Taouk may have fired the gun with his left hand could be sufficient to establish that the appellant’s guilt was not the only rational inference that could be drawn from the circumstances proved in evidence. 
     
      
    194 In Barca v. The Queen (1975) 133 CLR 82 at 104, Gibbs, Stephen and Mason, JJ., following Plomp v. The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 252:- 
     
      
       
        
        “To enable a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, it is necessary not only that his guilt should be a rational inference, but that it should be the only rational inference that the circumstances would enable them to draw.” 
        
       
      
    195 See also Cutter v. The Queen (1997) 143 ALR 498 at 502. 
     
      
    196 The evidence on the gunshot residue, consistent with the fact that Tony Taouk had been the shooter (using his left hand), taken alone might well establish either:- 
     
      
       
      • that the jury, acting reasonably, could or should have entertained a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt; or 
       
       
      • an inference or hypothesis consistent with innocence was open on the evidence. 
       
      
    197 However, the evidence on gunshot residue found on Tony Taouk’s left hand is not evidence that stands alone or in isolation uncontradicted by other evidence. If that other evidence is brought into account and accepted, then it could be said to be cogent enough to negative the conclusion of the possible shooting by Tony Taouk using the left hand. I will return to consider the cogency of that other evidence: see Admissions below. 
     
      
    198 As the circumstantial evidence does not stand alone, the question is whether the possible inference of innocence that may otherwise have been reasonably open on the expert evidence could be said to be sufficiently rebutted by:- 
     
      
       
      • The admissions made by the appellant. See discussion entitled  
      “admissions” 
       below. 
       
       
      • The evidence as to the appellant’s anger which led to him engaging in a verbal confrontation with his wife and the absence of motive in Tony Taouk. 
       
       
      • The evidence of gunshot residue on both of the appellant’s hands and on the front portion and sleeves of his sloppy joe 
        
      On the right front green jumper, Mr. Sarvas found eight characteristics or three compound particles and 20, two component or indicative particles. On the left front of the jumper, 10, three component or characteristic particles and 13, two component or indicative particles. This, however, is equivocal evidence in the sense that it was consistent with either the appellant discharging a firearm or had been in close proximity to a firearm when it was discharged. 
      . 
       
       
      • The evidence of blood matched from his wife on his trouser leg which is inconsistent with his answer in the ERISP (that he was unaware that his wife had been shot 
        
      (Q. & A. 117-118, 130-132). 
      ). 
       
       
      • The evidence that supported an inference that the appellant had concealed or disposed of the weapon. 
       
       
      • The admissions in the course of the interview at 11.58 am on Sunday 29 September 2002 at Burwood Police Station in which the appellant agreed that in answer to a question by police  
      “that you took the gun off your brother in law” 
      , he replied,  
      “yes, I did. I say that, yeah” 
      . (Exhibit E – ERISP Q. & A. 24-26) 
       
       
      • In the same interview:- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q24. And what happened when you took the gun off your brother in law? A. I … I lost control and I went to the police, and he was upstairs on the second floor, so he went down to the first floor … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q25. Yes. A. (Interpreter) … As I said, I don’t remember what happened after that, but I was lost. I don’t know if I carried the gun or I still got the gun at that time or he, or he throw the gun on the floor, what I remember I, I run to the police and tell them what happened. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q26. Okay. Did you shoot the gun as well? A. (Interpreter) I grabbed him just he stop, stopping him of shooting, and we were fighting, we were fighting between me and him and just, I used to see the, the shots and Oh God went everywhere, the shot went everywhere.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Admissions 
       
      
    199 The evidence of admissions made by the appellant plainly played an important indeed central role in his trial. It is therefore important to assess their cogency, weight and significance. 
     
      
    200 Analysis of the appellant’s statement to Constable Munro establishes admissions and assertions of fact as to seven discrete facts:- 
     
      
       
      (i) he shot someone at his house; 
       
       
      (ii) he had an argument with his  
      “brother” 
      ; 
       
       
      (iii) Tony Taouk, had a gun; 
       
       
      (iv) the appellant took the gun off Tony Taouk; 
       
       
      (v) the appellant fired the gun; 
       
       
      (vi) the appellant fired a few shots with the gun; 
       
       
      (vii) he did not know if anyone was hurt (inconsistent with (i)). 
       
      
    201 Firstly, it is noteworthy (and perhaps strange, given the appellant’s admission that he had in fact shot someone), that there was no mention by the appellant of his wife having been shot. Salem Taouk is not mentioned at all. Whilst, as noted earlier, this is consistent with his statement recorded in the record of interview that he did not know that his wife had been shot, it is difficult to accept that statement in light of the fact that blood on his trouser leg was matched to that of his wife. 
     
      
    202 The admission that he fired the gun may be strictly seen as an admission only as to the count related to Tony Taouk and not to the count related to Salem Taouk. However, there is evidence that there was one series of six shots heard and other evidence of two series of shots separated by an interval (on Helen Taouk’s account, an interval of about 30 seconds) (see the evidence of Neville Lunn, t.367, line 55 to t.368 and Lesley Lunn, t.373, lines 15-20 and t.374 , lines 1-10. See also Helen Taouk, t.190, lines 5-30). The shooting of Tony and Salem Taouk obviously occurred within seconds of each other. 
     
      
    203 On the basis that the appellant took the gun off Tony Taouk (point (iv) above), it was open to the jury to conclude that the series of six shots (whether separated by a short interval or not) occurred whilst the appellant was holding the gun, having taken it from Tony Taouk. The Crown pointed to the fact that one of the first shots must have hit Tony Taouk as he managed to go down the stairs into the backyard and was not seen upstairs by any member of the family following the gunshots. Just when, how and why Salem Taouk was shot in the back of the shoulder and whether it was through an intentional or reckless act is unclear. Accordingly, although the admission made to Constable Munro is strictly an admission only as to having shot Tony Taouk, taken in conjunction with the fact that, by the appellant’s own admission, he apparently overpowered Tony Taouk, took the gun from him and shots were then fired, that admission would be available, along with other evidence, to support an inference or conclusion that the appellant was also the shooter of the gun when Salem Taouk was hit. 
     
      
    204 I have set out in paragraph 198 extracts of the record of interview (Q. & A. 24-26). The appellant’s answers establish that the appellant obtained possession of the gun and lost control following a struggle between the two men and that at about that time shots were discharged. 
     
      
       
      The trial judge’s direction 
       
      
    205 I return to the question as to whether, notwithstanding the failure by the trial judge to give a specific direction on the possible significance of the gunshot residue on Tony Taouk’s left hand, the evidence as to what I have termed admissions, is sufficiently cogent to warrant the conclusion that there has not been, through lack of any specific direction, a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    206 I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of James, J., which, as earlier mentioned, was circulated in draft. In paragraph 116, his Honour sets out what was said by the trial judge on Mr. Sarvas’ evidence about the gunshot residue giving rise to an inference that Tony Taouk had fired the gun and the point as to him having said Tony “had” as distinct from “may have” fired the weapon. 
     
      
    207 James, J. states, in effect, (paragraph 117) that on this basis an argument (by counsel) that the presence of gunshot residue on Tony Taouk’s hand gave rise to an inference that he had fired the gun, was put to the jury in the summing up. However, with respect, it would seem to me that it was necessary for the trial judge to have gone further than to refer to the argument as to the gunshot residue. Given the potential for the expert evidence of Mr. Sarvas to raise a hypothesis inconsistent with guilt, there is much to be said, in my opinion, in favour of the proposition that a specific circumstantial evidence direction should have been given related to that segment of expert evidence. The trial judge did earlier inform the jury that the Crown case on each count was a circumstantial evidence case (summing up p.13). He then provided the general circumstantial evidence direction recorded at that same page. The expert evidence to which I have just referred, however, was not addressed until much later (at p.68) in the summing up and the defence argument based on it did not arise until p.79. The issue therefore arose in the summing up a considerable time after the general circumstantial evidence direction had been given. It is true that no further direction was sought by defence counsel at the trial which raises the question of leave under s.4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules and whether leave should be granted to rely on this further ground of appeal. 
     
      
    208 There is a question as to whether the general circumstantial evidence direction was sufficient. In many cases such a direction will suffice, especially if there is some form of cross-referencing made. In some circumstances, trial judges have gone further by specifically raising with the jury possible explanations of the circumstantial evidence that fell for consideration, specifically with respect to a particular factual issue relevant to the count in question: see, for example, Regina v. Bunting & Wagner [2005] SASC 45 [123]-[125]. The question in this case is whether the trial judge should have given a direction that one hypothesis consistent with innocence was that Tony Taouk could have, in a struggle with the appellant, used his left hand to shoot, having struck the appellant with his right hand, and that there was evidence to support the hypothesis that he did or may have done so in the evidence of Mr. Sarvas. 
     
      
    209 On consideration, I do not believe, however, that leave should be given under Rule 4. The circumstantial evidence case was supported by strong evidence of admissions to which I have referred and it is upon that basis that I do not consider a miscarriage resulted from the absence of any specific direction on the expert evidence and its possible implication in terms of a hypothesis inconsistent with guilt. 
     
      
    210 I accordingly have formed the opinion that the second gound of appeal should be rejected (and accordingly that part of the third ground in paragraph 37). 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The verdicts of the jury are unreasonable, having regard to the evidence 
       
      
    211 I have, as earlier stated, had the benefit of reading the judgment of James, J. in draft and I have considered his Honour’s close analysis of ground three and the conclusion his Honour has expressed in relation to that ground. I agree with his Honour’s conclusion in relation thereto and the reasons his Honour has expressed in his judgment. 
     
      
    212 I am accordingly of the opinion that all three of the grounds of appeal relied upon should be rejected. I would accordingly dismiss the appeal against conviction.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 STUDDERT J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant, a juvenile, was sentenced in the District Court for an offence contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act. That is an offence of aggravated sexual assault for which the maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 20 years. Judge Ainslie-Wallace (the Judge) imposed a sentence upon the applicant made up of a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months with a parole period of 1 year 9 months. The Judge directed that the sentence be served in a juvenile detention centre. The applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 7 September 2006. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was committed for trial to the District Court on a charge of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act. Section 61J provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (1) Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and in circumstances of aggravation and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse is liable to imprisonment for 20 years. 
         
          
         
         (2) In this section, circumstances of aggravation means circumstances in which: 
         
          
         
        (a) at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, the alleged offender maliciously inflicts actual bodily harm on the alleged victim or any other person who is present or nearby, or  
         
          
         
        (b) at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, the alleged offender threatens to inflict actual bodily harm on the alleged victim or any other person who is present or nearby by means of an offensive weapon or instrument, or  
         
          
         
        (c) the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons, or  
         
         
        (d) the alleged victim is under the age of 16 years, or  
         
          
         
        (e) the alleged victim is (whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) under the authority of the alleged offender, or  
         
          
         
        (f) the alleged victim has a serious physical disability, or  
         
          
         
        (g) the alleged victim has a serious intellectual disability. 
         
        
       
      
    4 The committal charge identified the circumstance of aggravation as an allegation that at the time of the sexual assault the applicant was in company of another person: see s 61J(2)(c). As charged the offence was a “serious children’s indictable offence” for the purposes of the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act (the Act). By s 3 of the Act a “serious children’s indictable offence” means (amongst other things): 
     
      
       
        
         
        (c) an offence arising under section 61J (otherwise than in circumstances referred to in subsection (2) (d) of that section) …..of the Crimes Act 1900…….,  
         
        
       
       
      The consequence of the fact that the offence charged was a “serious children’s indictable offence” was that, by reason of s 17 of the Act, the applicant was to be dealt with according to law and not according to the provisions in Division 4 of Part 3 of the Act and within the limited range of penalties provided by that Division. 
       
      
    5 However, on 8 March 2004 the applicant was arraigned before Blanch CJ on a reformulated charge alleging that the circumstance of aggravation relied upon by the Crown was that the complainant was under the age of 16 years: see s 61J(2)(d). The applicant then pleaded guilty to that charge. The new charge did not fall within the definition of a “serious children’s indictable offence” so that there was no longer any statutory requirement that the applicant be dealt with at law. Section 18 of the Act applied and the Court had a discretion as to whether to deal with the applicant at law or in accordance with Division 4 of Part 3, that discretion being exercised taking into account the matters mentioned in s 18(1A) of the Act. 
     
      
    6 It should be clear by the sentence that her Honour imposed upon the applicant that she dealt with him at law and not under Division 4 of Part 3 of the Act. Had the Judge dealt with the applicant under the latter provisions, the most serious sentence that could have been imposed upon the applicant was a control order of not more than 2 years under s 33(1)(g) of the Act. It is a ground of appeal that her Honour misunderstood the discretion that she had in dealing with the applicant by reason of the change to the nature of the charge and the provisions of the Act. It is also asserted that the sentence was manifestly excessive, that her Honour failed to take into account s 6 of the Act and that she erred in the way that she dealt with the applicant’s plea of guilty. 
     
      
    7 In sentencing the applicant for the offence to which he pleaded guilty, the Judge was also asked to take into account a further matter under the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. This was an offence of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M of the Crimes Act. That charge involved the same complainant and arose from the facts and circumstances surrounding the offence charged in the indictment. 
     
      
    8 The facts were placed before the Judge by way of an agreed statement. They can be summarised as follows. The applicant and the complainant had been in a relationship of boyfriend and girlfriend for a period of approximately three months at the time of the offence. There is no suggestion that there had been any sexual contact between them other than kissing and minor petting. The offence took place on 16 June 2003. Both the applicant and the complainant were then aged 15. The complainant had invited the applicant to her house after school. The applicant came accompanied by a friend, named Mohammed, whom the victim had not known previously. Mohammed was aged 22. 
     
      
    9 The three were sitting in the complainant’s bedroom when Mohammed offered the complainant $100 to have sex with him. She refused. After the applicant urged her to accept the offer, the complainant asked Mohammed to leave the room so she could speak to the applicant. After he did so, the applicant pulled the complainant on to the bed and kissed her. The complainant did not object to this but asked the applicant why he urged her to have sex with Mohammed. 
     
      
    10 Mohammed then returned to the room. The applicant stood beside the complainant exposed himself and asked her to suck his penis. The complainant refused, pushing the applicant away, and then left the room. The complainant went outside and smoked a cigarette and the applicant joined her. They both then returned to the bedroom where Mohammed was lying on the bed. The applicant kissed the complainant and fondled her breasts without her objecting. Mohammed also fondled her breast under her bra. She gave him a “dirty look” indicating her displeasure with his behaviour. 
     
      
    11 The applicant and Mohammed urged the complainant to take off her clothes but she refused. The applicant pulled off her jumper and unclipped her bra exposing her breasts. The applicant and Mohammed commented about her breasts and the complainant felt embarrassed and uncomfortable. The applicant then undid the complainant’s slacks although she objected and struggled to stop him. He also pulled down her underpants although she tried to keep them up. The applicant kissed her neck and, although she did not object to this, she felt embarrassed because of the presence of Mohammed. The applicant then put his hands inside the complainant’s panties and inserted his finger into her vagina. The complainant said, “No” and pulled his hand away. She then left the bedroom. This was the act of intercourse relied upon for the charge on the indictment. 
     
      
    12 The complainant went into the bathroom and was followed by the applicant. He commenced to kiss her neck and lips and rubbed his genital area against her. The complainant was crying and pushed the applicant away. He asked her what was wrong, but she refused to answer and he left the room. This conduct gave rise to the offence taken into account on the Form 1. Mohammed came into the bathroom and asked the complainant what was wrong but she refused to answer. After he left, she locked the bathroom door and waited for the applicant and Mohammed to leave. The complainant immediately spoke to a number of her friends about the conduct of the applicant and the next day complained to her mother. 
     
      
    13 In an interview with police on 24 July 2003 the applicant denied that any sexual conduct occurred on that day and denied that he had a relationship with the complainant. He told police that the person he called Mohammed had left for Lebanon the next day and he could give no other information identifying him. 
     
      
    14 The applicant gave evidence before the Judge on 10 June 2004 identifying the person with him during the incident as his cousin and indicated that he was prepared to give evidence against him. He gave an account that was substantially the same as that given by the complainant and he admitted having sexually assaulted her by inserting his finger into her vagina at the same time as Mohammed was touching her breasts. He made a statement to the police on 24 June 2004, during an adjournment of the sentencing proceedings, in accordance with his evidence and implicating his cousin. He also gave an undertaking to give evidence against his cousin. 
     
      
    15 The applicant was aged 16 at the time of sentence and had no prior criminal record. He had been charged with other offences, one in relation to damaging the victim’s home and had indicated an intention to plead guilty to that charge. 
     
      
    16 There was in evidence a report from a Juvenile Justice officer, Ms Edwards. That report indicated that the applicant had been involved in a sex offender’s programme while in custody. However, it also alleged that the applicant had spoken of the complainant in what her Honour described as “demeaning and offensive terms”. Ms Edwards formed the view that the applicant held “extreme and disrespectful views” of women, particularly non-Moslem women. She believed that the applicant’s attitude was reinforced by attitudes held by his parents. In light of these matters Ms Edwards thought the likelihood of re-offending was relatively high. 
     
      
    17 The Judge accepted the evidence and assessments of Ms Edwards who gave oral evidence. She found that on the basis of the evidence before the court, including that of the applicant himself, that he had no insight into his conduct nor did he have any real remorse or contrition. That was a finding that was well open to her Honour and was not challenged on the hearing of the appeal. 
     
      
    18 There was evidence from a psychologist to the effect that so far as his IQ was concerned, the applicant was at the bottom of the normal range just above the point where a diagnosis would be made of developmental disability. The applicant had deficits in his verbal and other skills. However, there was no submission made to her Honour that on the basis of this material the applicant should be found to be less culpable for his conduct or treated in some way other than was required by the seriousness of the conduct before the court.  
     
      
    19 As to the offence itself her Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        This is an offence of considerable objective seriousness. There was a measure of planning and it was committed in company. I have regard to the statement of the victim as to how the assaults have affected her and it is clear that they have had a significant effect on her and continue to do so. I take into account that the offender is young and was only 15 at the time of the offence.  
        
       
      
    20 The Judge recognised, in accordance with the decision of R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, that the standard non-parole period of 10 years did not apply because of the plea of guilty but that, although the offence was not one that in any event fell within the middle range of objective seriousness, “the length of the standard non-parole period provides some guidance in terms of gravity with which this type of offence is regarded by the legislators”. 
     
      
    21 Her Honour found that there were special circumstances justifying a greater ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence by reason of the applicant’s youth, his need for supervision and rehabilitation, and the fact that it was his first time in custody. The ratio between the non-parole period and the total term is about 58 per cent. 
     
      
    22 It is appropriate to deal with the third ground of appeal first. It contends that the Judge erred in her characterisation of the offence as being a “serious children’s indictable offence” and thereby limiting the exercise of the discretion available to her. As I have already indicated the charge to which the applicant pleaded guilty did not fall within the definition of the term as set out in s 3 of the Act and it was not obligatory for her Honour to deal with the applicant at law. To some extent the change to the wording of the charge was a formal although not insignificant matter. The facts made it clear, as did the evidence of the applicant, that the applicant was in the company of his cousin Mohammed at the time of the commission of the offence. Although the only circumstance of aggravation alleged in the charge was that the complainant was under the age of 15 years, the Judge was entitled, if not required, to take into account any other matter of aggravation present. This was made clear by the decision of this Court in R v Li (NSWCCA, unreported 9/7/97). There is only one offence provided under s 61J and the Crown has only to allege and prove one circumstance of aggravation in order to make out the offence. There is no infringement of the De Simoni principle in the court taking into account other matters of aggravation because the offender is not being sentenced for a more serious offence than that charged. 
     
      
    23 It is not difficult to understand why the draftsperson excluded a charge relying upon the circumstance of aggravation found in s 61J(2)(d) from the definition of a “serious children’s indictable offence” from s 3. In a case involving a juvenile offender, the fact that the complainant is under 15 does not carry with it the same sense of opprobrium, as that fact would do in the case of an adult. The legislature did not believe that it was such an aggravating factor that it should result in the offender being deprived of the advantages of being sentenced under the provisions of Division 4 if that were otherwise an appropriate way of dealing with the offence and the offender. But that policy is not inconsistent with the sentencing judge, when dealing with the offender either at law or under Division 4, taking into account other aggravating factors, which had they been alleged in the charge, would have had the consequence that the offender could have only been dealt with at law. 
     
      
    24 It seems clear that her Honour was aware of the consequence of the change from that for which the applicant was committed for trial. Both the defence and the Crown addressed the Judge at length on the issue of whether the applicant should be dealt with at law or under Division 4. However, her Honour’s remarks contain the following statement:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “Although counsel for the offender applied for this matter to be referred to the Children’s court pursuant to s 20 of the  
        Children (Crimes) Sentencing Procedure Act 
         (sic), it is excluded from being remitted, it being a “serious children’s indictable offence” and it is a matter that is appropriate to be dealt with in this court”. 
        
       
       
      Yet later in the remarks, the Judge stated: 
       
        
         
        A submission was made on behalf of the offender that the most appropriate way to sentence him was as a juvenile rather than at law, the benefit for him being then the maximum sentence to be imposed is one or two years. The Crown opposed that course and argued that the seriousness of the offence was such that it would not be appropriate to sentence the offender other than at law. I accept that submission. 
         
         
        A total sentence of two years or less would not recognise the objective seriousness of the crime now nor would it allow for the rehabilitation and strict supervision of the offender which he so clearly needs. 
        
       
      
    25 Although the first passage quoted above seems to indicate that her Honour was at least confused about the applicability of the provisions of the Act, it is clear that any confusion that was present did not affect the exercise of her discretion. The second passage quoted accurately reflects the situation and there can be no criticism, and there is none, of her Honour’s determination to deal with the applicant at law. Quite the contrary, the written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant eschews any submission that her Honour erred in dealing with the applicant at law. There was no reasonable prospect of her Honour transferring the matter to the Children’s Court even if she had believed that she had the power to do so. It is impossible to see how any confusion or misapprehension her Honour might have had about the applicability of the provisions of the Act affected the sentence imposed upon the applicant. The third ground is not made out. 
     
      
    26 The second ground contends that her Honour failed to take into account s 6 of the Act. That section is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction 
          
         
        A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles:  
         
        (a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them,  
         
        (b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance,  
         
        (c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption,  
         
        (d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home,  
         
        (e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind.  
         
        
       
      
    27 There is no reference to the section or its terms in the sentencing remarks but such a failure does not itself amount to an error of law: R v MHH [2001] NSWCCA 161. The section contains a statement of principles that before the enactment of the provision were to be found generally in decided cases and under the common law when sentencing young offenders: R v SDM [2001] NSWCCA 158. Without seeking to detract from their importance, they are hardly controversial nor did they have such peculiar or particular relevance to the sentencing exercise before her Honour that the failure to refer to them might have made a significant difference to the ultimate sentence to be imposed upon the applicant. Counsel who appeared for the applicant before her Honour recognised that the most favourable disposition was a control order under s 33(2)(g) and so it was taken for granted in the proceedings before her Honour that the applicant was going to spend some period in custody. This may perhaps account for the fact that there was no reference made to s 6 during the course of the addresses. There was never any suggestion by her Honour that the applicant was not going to require assistance and guidance, quite the contrary. Even if it is assumed that her Honour did not specifically turn her mind to the terms of s 6 because neither she nor counsel referred to them, I cannot see how that failure could have affected her Honour’s determination of the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    28 In any event the application of s 6 depends upon the nature of the offence charged as well as upon the age and circumstances of the offender: R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182. Less effect can be given to the principles in the section where the offence is one of substantial seriousness and where the offender acted as an adult. In my opinion the principles in s 6 had less of a role to play in the determination of the sentence, notwithstanding the age of the applicant, by reason of the seriousness of the offence and his attitude to the offending. 
     
      
    29 It was submitted under this ground that the Judge failed to adequately take into account the applicant’s “immaturity and his intellectual deficits”. Such a failure, if it occurred, would have as much to do with a failure to apply normal sentencing principles as with a failure to take into account the principles in s 6. The argument is really embraced in the assertion in ground one that the sentence was manifestly excessive because the argument is really that her Honour must not have given sufficient weight to this particular matter because of the length of the sentence imposed. However, I can see little significance in the present case that the applicant was as a result of psychological testing found to have marked deficiencies in his intellectual or verbal skills. 
     
      
    30 The simple fact is that the applicant determined to sexually assault the complainant even though he knew she was not consenting and at a time when she was being sexually molested by his companion. The difficulty in the task that confronted the sentencing judge was that, although the applicant was a child, he had committed a serious offence, he had shown no genuine remorse and, because of his attitude to women, he was at real risk of re-offending. I do not understand how the applicant’s intellectual deficits could have been given much significance in the determination of the appropriate sentence in this particular case. There was no suggestion that the applicant did not have a full appreciation of what he had done because of his poor intellectual functioning. His apparent failure to appreciate the moral and criminal significance of his conduct had nothing at all to do with any defect in his intellectual abilities. His intellectual disabilities did not otherwise appear to affect adversely his ability to function appropriately in the community. Of more relevance was the fact that his intellectual deficits may have made effective counselling more difficult because of his trouble in understanding what is put to him and expressing his thoughts on complex issues. The psychologist reported that his impulse control was poor, but this was hardly a finding that gave confidence to his prospects of successful rehabilitation. 
     
      
    31 Although counsel for the applicant relied heavily upon his immaturity arising from his age and otherwise, this was not in my view an offence arising from the applicant’s immaturity generally or in particular in respect of his attitude to women. This is notwithstanding that the Juvenile Justice officer acknowledged that the applicant might have been immature in many of his attitudes and beliefs about the needs and rights of others. But his attitude to women, and non-Moslem women in particular, does not appear to me to be a symptom of his immaturity. The immaturity of the applicant had little relevance, in my view, to an assessment of the proper punishment for the offence or his rehabilitation in respect of his attitude to women and the risk of re-offending that arose from that attitude. 
     
      
    32 It is asserted that the applicant’s rehabilitation would have been best conducted in the community. Reliance was placed upon references before the Judge as to the applicant’s general conduct and his efforts at obtaining and maintaining employment. But the applicant’s rehabilitation was more concerned with his attitude to women than his general attitude to the community. This aspect of his functioning was to be addressed by professional help through sex offender courses, anger management and general counselling. Of course I do not intend not to suggest that he had to receive a longer sentence in order to address his rehabilitation and there is no suggestion in her Honour’s remarks that she approached the sentencing task in this way. 
     
      
    33 Again these complaints really have little to do with whether the Judge failed to take into account the principles in s 6 but rather assert that the sentence imposed was so excessive that it indicates that her Honour was in error in the way she sought to address the various purposes of sentencing in this particular case taking into account the seriousness of the offence committed, the likelihood of re-offending and the fact that the applicant was aged 15 at the time of the offending. 
     
      
    34 Counsel for the applicant raised during oral submissions, although not in the written submissions filed, a complaint that her Honour erred in failing to take into account that, having regard to the offence as amended and to which the applicant pleaded guilty, the applicant would have been dealt with in the Children’s Court and not committed to trial in the District Court because of his age. The submission was that in the experience of counsel an offence falling under s 61J(d) would inevitably have been dealt with in the Children’s Court regardless of the seriousness of the actual facts of the offending having regard to the fact that the applicant was aged 15 at the time of offending. If this be correct, then it seems to me with respect, that those who would be responsible for making that decision are failing to take into account the provisions of s 18(1A) of the Act. 
     
      
    35 That section requires a court, when determining whether to proceed with the offender at law or under Division 4 of Part 3, to take into account, amongst other things, both “the seriousness of the indictable offence” and “the nature of the indictable offence” as well as “the age and maturity of the person at the time of the offence and at the time of sentencing”. A decision that any particular indictable offence, “not being a serious children’s indictable offence’’ is to be dealt with in the Children’s Court simply because of the age of the offender would be a breach of the mandatory requirement imposed by the Act to consider all the matters set out in the section when determining how the offender is to be dealt for the offence. 
     
      
    36 In my view this particular offence was so objectively serious that a proper application of s 18(1A) would have led to only one possible outcome: despite the applicant’s age, he was to be dealt with at law. As there was no proper basis for the applicant to have been dealt with in the Children’s Court, there was no basis for her Honour to take into account what sentence might have been imposed in the Children’s Court had he been dealt with in that jurisdiction. 
     
      
    37 Before dealing with the general complaint that the sentence was manifestly excessive, I should address the fourth ground of appeal that asserts that her Honour failed to give the applicant sufficient credit for his plea of guilty and offer of assistance. Her Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In determining sentence I take into account the plea of guilty which, although could not be considered as being entered at the earliest possible time, has utilitarian value, not the least of which was sparing the victim [ ] the ordeal of giving evidence and being cross-examined on her complaint. 
         
         
        I propose to discount the sentence which I would otherwise have imposed and I also take into account the assistance which the offender is willing to give in the prosecution of his co-offender and propose to discount his sentence to reflect those matters by 40 per cent. Any greater discount would result in a sentence which is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence. 
        
       
      
    38 It is argued on behalf of the applicant that her Honour should have found that the plea of guilty was made at the first reasonable opportunity in light of the change of the charge by the Crown after the applicant had been committed for trial. Clearly the applicant withheld his plea of guilty until the Crown was prepared to amend the charge so that it was not caught by s 3 of the Act. That was a legitimate tactic and the plea came immediately the Crown reindicted him with the amended charge. Arguably, in those circumstances, the plea came at the first reasonable opportunity but it did not follow that the discount for the plea of guilty should have been at the highest rate. But whether the plea came at the first reasonable opportunity or not is of little significance in this case. Her Honour gave a discount of 40 per cent for both the plea of guilty and the offer of assistance. In my opinion that was a finding that was well open to her. There was no evidence that the offer of assistance would have any implication for the applicant’s custodial situation or that it put him or his family in any degree of threat. This ground of appeal also fails. 
     
      
    39 Her Honour indicated that before the application of the discount the appropriate starting sentence was one of 7 years imprisonment. The Judge came to this view taking into account, as she was required to do, that the standard non-parole period for the offence was one of 10 years. The 7 years, of course, represented the undiscounted head sentence and not the undiscounted non-parole period. As I have already indicated the offence was a serious one. Although it is relevant that the intercourse was digital penetration, that fact alone does not mean that the offence did not deserve a substantial period of imprisonment. 
     
      
    40 It seems to me that in the submissions filed for the applicant there is an undue emphasis on the nature of the intercourse and the prior relationship between the applicant and the complainant as matters reducing the seriousness of the applicant’s conduct. The fact is that the penetration of the complainant did not occur as a result of some over exuberant response by an immature youth in hot ardour. It was in reality an intentional act designed to humiliate and degrade the complainant in the presence of the applicant’s cousin in circumstances where the applicant had earlier urged her to have intercourse with the cousin notwithstanding her objections. Immediately before the act of intercourse the applicant had forcefully removed the complainant’s clothing against her will and in the presence of her cousin probably in order to arouse himself and his cousin and clearly in disregard of her feelings. It was a sexual assault in the true meaning of the term. 
     
      
    41 Reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in R v Slack [2004] NSWCCA 128 as indicating that the starting sentence of 7 years would have been excessive even had the applicant been an adult having regard the nature of the offending and that encompassed within s 61J. That was a case where a friend of the complainant’s father entered her bedroom on two occasions and both times touched her in the area of the vagina penetrating her with two fingers. The complainant was aged 11 years. The offender was an adult with no prior offences and who had been a volunteer fireman. He was serving his sentence in protective custody. It was accepted that the degree of penetration was slight and both offences should be treated as part of a single act. The offence was committed in breach of trust. 
     
      
    42 This Court held that a sentence of 5 years was manifestly excessive having regard to the nature of the criminal conduct and the subjective circumstances of the offender. Grove J, who with Simpson J formed the majority of the Court, held that an appropriate sentence of three years imprisonment should be substituted. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Whilst the crimes were far from trivial, I cannot conceive that on the facts, and having regard to the matters required to be taken into account in favour of the appellant, a head sentence of one quarter of the maximum (available for far more serious instances of sexual misconduct) could be appropriately proportionate in this case. 
         
        
       
      
    43 Two comments can be made about this decision. The first is that I believe the objective facts of the present matter are worst than those before the Court in Slack and the subjective features of that offender were probably more mitigating than are the applicant’s. The second is that the offence in Slack did not attract a consideration of the standard non-parole period provisions. As I have already indicated, the Judge in the present matter was obliged to have regard to the standard non-parole period of 10 years even though it was not applicable to the applicant’s case. In R v Pellew [2004] NSWCCA 434 it was made clear that the effect of the standard non-parole period will generally be to increase the level of sentencing for offences to which it applies. If the provisions prescribe a standard non-parole period of 10 years as against a maximum penalty of 20 years, as is the case with an offence under s 61J, it follows that the head sentence must exceed half the maximum penalty for the offence notwithstanding that the offence is one of only mid-range seriousness. 
     
      
    44 While I acknowledge that the starting sentence was a severe one, especially having regard to the applicant’s age, I am ultimately unpersuaded that it was not open to her Honour to determine that the undiscounted sentence should be 7 years. The nature of the offending was such that little objective mitigation arose from the fact that the applicant was only aged 15 and was the same age as the complainant. It was in a most serious category of an offence consisting of digital penetration. There was also some effect to be given to the matter on the Form 1, even though considered by itself it was not a particularly serious offence. The sentence to be imposed had to reflect specific as well as general deterrence given the applicant’s attitude and notwithstanding his lack of prior convictions. However, I do believe that the sentence was toward the top of the available range for an offence of its nature. 
     
      
    45 In my opinion the application for leave should be granted but the appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HOWIE J: The applicant was convicted by a jury of a charge of supplying methylamphetamine contrary to s 25 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act. That offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years. The applicant was sentenced by Judge Sorby (the Judge) to a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 8 months made up of a non-parole period of 20 months with the balance of the term being 12 months. The sentence commenced on 11 May 2004 and the applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 11 January 2006. The applicant contends that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    2 The applicant was also before the Judge on a charge of possessing a small quantity of cannabis leaf. In respect of that offence the applicant was sentenced to the rising of the court and there is no appeal against that sentence. 
     
      
    3 The offence for which the applicant was convicted was based upon an allegation that he had in his possession a quantity of methylamphetamine greater than the trafficable quantity specified for that drug. The facts upon which the Judge sentenced the applicant can be briefly stated. On 18 June 2003 the applicant checked into a room at a hotel at the Quay. He was later joined by other persons and they held a party during which drugs were consumed. The activity of the other persons over the next 24 hours led to a complaint being made to police who as a result obtained a search warrant for the hotel room. The Crown case was that, as the police entered the room, the applicant threw on the floor a sum of money and a plastic bag containing a white substance. The contents of the plastic bag were later analysed and found to be 27.9 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity rate of just under 80 per cent. The issue before the jury was whether the applicant was in possession of that drug. The applicant maintained that he was not a user of methylamphetamine and denied having had possession of the plastic bag containing the drug.  
     
      
    4 The jury’s verdict of guilty meant that the applicant had to be sentenced on the basis that he was in possession of that drug for the purposes of supplying it. During the course of his sentencing remarks, the Judge stated the following: 
     
      
       
        
        The facts revealed the amount of methylamphetamine was 27.9 grams with a purity of 79.5 percent. Its street value was $13,950. These facts strongly indicate the drug was not in possession of the prisoner for his use and the use of his friends at a party in room 1309. Resealable plastic bags commonly used in supply of drugs were located in a jacket belonging to the accused. Although no other paraphernalia of drugs for sale, such as scales were found. 
        
       
       
        
        There is no suggestion the prisoner was some sort of small cog in a big operation or any operation at all of drug dealing, that (sic) he operated alone. 
        
       
      
    5 The applicant was aged 21 years at the date that sentence was imposed in June 2004. He has a criminal record but no prior offences involving prohibited drugs. The previous convictions of the applicant are concerned mainly with traffic matters of varying degrees of seriousness and minor offences of dishonesty. In December 2003 he was sentenced in the Local Court to a fixed term of 6 months for offences of driving under the influence and using a false instrument. At the time of the commission of the offence for which he was sentenced the applicant was subject to a good behaviour bond for dishonesty offences. He had also served a period of one month in custody on remand for the supply offence. 
     
      
    6 There was before the Judge a pre-sentence report. It disclosed that the applicant was born in Australia and had a happy childhood with his adopted parents until they separated in 1994. The applicant went to live with his mother. He travelled to Lebanon on a number of occasions with her so that his mother could seek medical treatment. On one of these occasions, when the applicant was aged 16, his mother died. The death of his mother had a very significant impact upon the applicant and he told the probation officer that he commenced using cannabis as a means of coping with it. A psychological assessment of the applicant conducted in April 2002 found that he suffered from depression. The applicant has had suicidal thoughts from time to time and on one occasion inflicted injuries to himself. The applicant’s father gave evidence before the sentencing judge during which he indicated that the period that the applicant had served in custody appeared to have had an impact upon him. There were references tendered on the applicant’s behalf as to his general good character in the community. 
     
      
    7 The applicant’s submissions in this Court concede that a sentence of imprisonment was required in light of the authoritative statements of this Court in relation to sentencing for offences of supplying drugs: see for example R v Clarke NSWCCA 15 March 1990 unreported. However, it is argued that the sentence was excessive due, in part at least, to his Honour’s finding that the applicant was not in possession of the drug for gratuitous supply to his friends. It was submitted that it was not open to his Honour to find, as he did, that the applicant was not intending to supply the drugs to his associates at the party. 
     
      
    8 As I have already indicated, the Judge was required to sentence the applicant on the basis that he had the drugs in his possession for the purposes of supply. The nature of that supply, if known, might have been relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. Clearly the applicant had the onus of establishing on the balance of probabilities that the intended supply was gratuitous; that is, it was for the use of those persons at the party. The applicant did not give evidence on sentence and had always maintained that he was not in possession of the methylamphetamine. His stance was that the only drug he used was cannabis. In those circumstances he started from a somewhat disadvantageous position in satisfying the judge that the offence was mitigated by the gratuitous nature of the intended supply. 
     
      
    9 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that it was not open for the Judge to conclude that the drug was not for the use of the applicant and the persons who had been in the hotel room relying upon simply the quantity and quality of the drug and the finding of small plastic bags in the possession of the applicant. It was argued that the plastic bags were as capable of being used for holding cannabis as for holding amphetamine and that the high purity of the drug did not mean that it could not be used without being further broken down. Reliance was placed upon the fact that there were no other indicia of supply found such as scales, telephone records or cutting agents. 
     
      
    10 But the applicant’s submissions are based upon an unjustified assumption that the drugs were in the possession of the applicant for supply at that time or to the persons at the hotel. The only conclusion that the Judge came to was that the drug was not going to be used by the applicant and the persons who were with him in the hotel room. He made no other finding about the nature of the intended supply. In light of the high purity of the drug, its value at nearly $14,000, the presence of the plastic bags and the fact that the applicant was not a user of the drug, it was clearly open to his Honour to reject a submission that the drug was in the applicant’s possession merely for the benefit of those who were present with him. That was simply a finding that a potentially mitigating factor was not present, or to put it more precisely, that his Honour was not satisfied of the presence of that mitigating factor. 
     
      
    11 In any event the applicant was in possession of almost ten times the trafficable quantity of high purity amphetamine. There was the potential for the dissemination of a not insignificant amount of a dangerous drug to other persons in the community. The criminality of the offence was substantial regardless of the purpose or nature of the intended supply of that drug. As the trial judge noted, the applicant had pleaded not guilty and, therefore, was not entitled to any discount of the sentence for contrition or remorse. The offence was objectively serious and general deterrence was an important, if not the most important, consideration in determining the appropriate sentence. There was the aggravating factor that the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time of offending. 
     
      
    12 Apart from the applicant’s age there was little by way of significant subjective mitigation and it would have been difficult for the Judge to have had any confidence in the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation in the absence of any acceptance of criminal responsibility and remorse for his criminal conduct. His criminal record did nothing to encourage a merciful approach. Although the applicant wrote a letter to the Court indicating his intention to change his ways, he blamed his offence on the “crowd that I was with”. His expressions of contrition could have been given little weight. The applicant had the benefit of a finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    13 In my view the sentence imposed was well within the discretion of the Judge. I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    14 STUDDERT J: I agree. 
     
      
    15 LATHAM J: I also agree. 
     
      
    16 STUDDERT J: The orders of the Court then will be those proposed by Howie J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant, George Leslie Hovan, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of concurring in the making of a false instrument to obtain a benefit, an offence under s178BB(1) of the Crimes Act which carries maximum sentence of five years imprisonment, and charges of making and using a false instrument, offences under s300(1) and (2) of the Act, each of which carries a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment. On the first charge he was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months to date from the date on which sentence was passed, 26 February 2004. On each of the other two charges he was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for three and a half years, to date from 26 February 2005, but in respect of those sentences his Honour fixed a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from 26 February 2004. In discussion with counsel after the sentences were pronounced, his Honour explained that it was his intention that the applicant serve a period of two and a half years in custody before being eligible for release on parole on 25 August 2006.  
     
      
    3 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 
     
      
       
      Facts of first charge 
       
      
    4 The offence the subject of the first charge was committed late in October 1999, when the applicant was in practice as a solicitor. He needed money for the running of the practice, including wages for his staff and the rent for his office premises. To this end he entered into an arrangement with Mr Tony Denigris, the proprietor of a business supplying computer equipment, whereby Mr Denigris applied on his behalf to the Australian Guarantee Corporation (AGC) for finance, ostensibly for the purchase of such equipment. In so far as the application was stated to be for that purpose, it was false. In addition, accompanying documentation concerning the financial position of the practice and of the applicant personally contained information which was false in material respects. AGC approved the loan in amount of almost $102,000. That sum was paid to Mr Denigris’s company, and from it a little over $89,000 was paid to the applicant. 
     
      
    5 In the same year, 1999, the applicant repaid to AGC amounts totalling about $5,180. In November 2001, at a time when the loan application was under investigation by AGC, he paid a further $40,000. At the time of sentence the company was still owed about $58,500. However, the applicant had entered into a contract to sell a property on the south coast of New South Wales for $97,000, and he gave evidence that he intended to make full restitution to AGC on settlement of that sale. Indeed, his evidence was that he had always intended to repay the loan. 
     
      
    6 Upon his arrest, the applicant declined to be interviewed about this matter.  
     
      
       
      Facts of second and third charges 
       
      
    7 Over a period of years from 1984, the applicant acted for a family company known as Sakatik Pty Ltd in relation to a commercial dispute with another company, Liberty Investments Pty Ltd. Sakatik commenced proceedings against Liberty Investments in the District Court, and in December 1992 it obtained judgment in its favour. Liberty Investments appealed unsuccessfully. In the result, Liberty Investments was liable to Sakatik for the costs of the proceedings at first instance and on appeal. 
     
      
    8 In 2002 negotiations between the applicant and the solicitor for Liberty Investments achieved an agreement whereby those costs were assessed at $20,000, to be paid in three instalments between October and December of that year. On the applicant’s part these negotiations were conducted without reference to his clients, the husband and wife who were the directors of Sakatik. The applicant’s evidence, which the sentencing judge accepted, was that they owed him about $52,000 in solicitor/client costs and had agreed that he could retain whatever he could recover from Liberty Investments.  
     
      
    9 Liberty Investments’ solicitor prepared a deed of release and forwarded it to the applicant. On 7 November 2002 he forged the signatures of the two directors of Sakatik on that document and applied what purported to be, but in fact was not, the common seal of that company. On the faith of the document, the solicitor for Liberty Investments provided the applicant with a cheque for the first instalment, $10,000.  
     
      
    10 At the time the deed was executed and that payment was made, the applicant’s practice was under the control of a receiver appointed by the Supreme Court on 29 November 2001 in proceedings brought against him by the Law Society of New South Wales. The applicant had deposited the cheque for $10,000 into an account controlled by his wife. However, the situation came to the attention of the receiver when she intercepted the second instalment paid by the solicitor for Liberty Investments. The applicant then paid the first instalment of $10,000 to the receiver.  
     
      
    11 He was charged with these offences after he presented himself to police on 10 June 2003 and took part in an electronically recorded interview, during which he made relevant admissions. Significantly, at the time of these offences he was on bail in respect of the first charge.  
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    12 The applicant is now forty-nine years old. He has no previous convictions. He had been in practice as a solicitor for about twenty years before he was struck off in September 2003. There was evidence in the form of testimonials of his general good character, including his preparedness to provide legal services free or at a minimum cost to people of limited means. 
     
      
    13 His background was sketched in reports by the Probation and Parole Service, a psychologist and a psychiatrist. He had a rather difficult upbringing. It is not necessary to recite it except to observe that he appears to have emerged from it as a man who, despite his intellectual capacity, was insecure, emotionally dependent and burdened by a need to prove himself. He married twice, and there are three young children of his second marriage. The relationship had been under strain for some time prior to his separation from his second wife in October 2002. However, she appears to have remained supportive of him and at the time of sentence, although they were still estranged, they were again living under the same roof. He was unemployed and caring for the children, while she was working.  
     
      
    14 It emerges from the psychological and psychiatric reports that he has long been disorganised in the conduct of his affairs and has been a poor financial manager. It seems that, over the period of years during which the offences were committed, his practice was in financial difficulty and he was struggling to maintain it and to pay his staff. He became depressed and was drinking to excess. The psychiatrist, Dr Robert Hampshire, concluded that he was suffering from a number of conditions. Significantly for present purposes, these included a longstanding and previously undiagnosed Attention Deficit Hyper Activity Disorder. For several months prior to sentence he had been counselled by Mr W John Taylor, psychologist, who wrote of him in his report:  
     
      
       
        
        As counselling has proceeded he is beginning to gain some insight with regard to the effect of his feelings of insecurity, and feelings of inadequacy particularly concerning his lack of skill in financial management. It is clear that for a number of years he has been suffering from a dysthymic disorder. That is, he has had feelings of dejection and sadness, and is likely to have experienced difficulties in his functioning. He had experienced a loss of efficiency and had difficulties in maintaining his focus on his work. As he perceived his situation becoming more desperate, his dysthmia progressed to a depressive disorder.  
        
       
      
    15 In evidence he expressed his remorse for his offending. He entered his pleas of guilty early in the proceedings and his Honour found that he was entitled to their “full benefit”, both for the utilitarian value and as further evidence of his remorse. In addition, there was evidence that he had provided valuable assistance to the authorities of a nature which need not be set out for the purpose of this application.  
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    16 Mr Odgers SC, for the applicant, argued that the sentencing judge fell into error in a number of respects in his remarks and that, in any event, the sentences are manifestly excessive. I consider that one of the matters raised about his Honour’s approach to sentence is sufficient to move this Court to intervene and to determine for itself the appropriate sentences. That being so, I find it unnecessary to decide the other matters raised by Mr Odgers.  
     
      
    17 As I have said, his Honour expressly referred to the applicant’s pleas of guilty. He also said that he had “taken into consideration on his behalf” the assistance to the authorities. However, his Honour did not quantify the reduction of sentence which those factors had earned the applicant, either individually or in combination.  
     
      
    18 In recent years, this Court has recognised the desirability, as a matter of policy, of specifying the discount of sentence an offender earns by assistance to the authorities: see the observations of Buddin J in R v Halls (2002) 127 ACrimR 209 at [13], and the authorities to which his Honour there refers. On the other hand, it has also been recognised that where, as is commonly the case, that offender has also pleaded guilty, it “will often be appropriate” to specify a combined discount: R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, per Spigelman CJ at [160].  
     
      
    19 Given that the applicant’s pleas were entitled to recognition both for their utilitarian value and as an expression of remorse, and that his assistance to the authorities was valuable, I would have thought that a reduction of sentence of the order of forty percent was appropriate. The aggregate sentence imposed upon the applicant was four and a half years imprisonment. If that were the result after a forty percent deduction, the starting point would have been seven and a half years: a term which would be excessive for these offences, viewed purely objectively. The case is yet another demonstration of the desirability of transparency in the sentencing process in cases where there have been pleas of guilty and assistance to the authorities, at least by the specification of a notional starting point: cf. R v Waqa (No 2) [2005] NSWCCA 33, per Dunford J at [13].  
     
      
       
      Re-sentence 
       
      
    20 In the applicant’s favour, I am mindful that it was always his intention to repay the loan the subject of the first charge and that, in respect of the second and third charges, his clients would have had no objection to his retaining the amount which he received. Nevertheless, the three offences involved dishonesty on the part of a man pursuing a profession which, in the public interest, demands a high degree of probity. The second and third offences also involved his dealing with money in such a way as to conceal its receipt from the receiver appointed by the Law Society. Further, those offences were committed while he was on bail in respect of the first offence. 
     
      
    21 We received further evidence by way of affidavit for the purpose of re-sentence. It is unnecessary to go to the detail of it. As one would expect, the applicant’s situation has strained his relationship with his family and his current placement has compromised his contact with his children. The sale of the south coast property had run into difficulties, but it seems that they have been resolved and payment of the amount outstanding to AGC can be made. He has experienced particular difficulties in prison, partly due to the fact that a significant part of his practice as a solicitor was in the field of criminal law.  
     
      
    22 Leaving out of account the applicant’s pleas of guilty and his assistance, I consider that the global sentence appropriate to represent the totality of his criminality is imprisonment for five years. Because of the pleas of guilty and the assistance, I would reduce that term by forty percent to three years. At the time of sentence the applicant had expressed his willingness to provide further assistance to the authorities, although he had not entered into a formal undertaking to do so. It seems, in any event, that that further assistance is not likely to be required. That being so, for the purpose of s5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act, I would not assign any part of that reduction of sentence to future assistance. 
     
      
    23 In determining the global sentence and the discount to be applied to it, I am not unmindful of the need to fix sentences appropriate for each of the charges in accordance with the principles in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. I would adopt the sentencing judge’s approach of accumulating the sentences in respect of the second and third charges upon that in respect of the first, recognising that they represent discrete episodes of criminality. Like his Honour, I also find special circumstances.  
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    24 I would propose that leave to appeal be granted, the appeal be allowed and the sentences passed in the District Court be quashed. In lieu, I would sentence the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        On the first charge, a fixed term of imprisonment for six  
         
        months, to date from 26 February 2004; 
        
       
       
        
        On each of the second and third charges, imprisonment for two and a half years, with a non-parole period of twelve months, to date from 26 August 2004. 
        
       
       
        
        I would direct the release of the applicant on parole on 25 August 2005.

      NOT TO BE PUBLISHED OTHER THAN TO THE PARTIES AND THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES UNTIL FURTHER ORDER BY THE COURT – ORDER SINCE REVOKED 
       
       
      JUDGMENT – On application by ABC to revoke non-publication order 
       
      
    1 HIDDEN J: There are in force orders prohibiting publication of the names of the three accused in this case, together with the name of the complainant and two young female witnesses. In addition, I made an order that there be no publication of any of the evidence in this trial until further order of the Court. That order was made in anticipation of two further trials involving some of these accused, which are to proceed immediately after this one. The order is of its nature a temporary one, and it is likely that it would be lifted at the end of this series of trials about six weeks hence. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation applies for the revocation of that last order.  
     
      
    2 Mr Dawson of counsel, who has argued the application, took me to the important decision of the Court of Appeal in John Fairfax Publications v The District Court [2004] NSWCA 324. There are some similarities between that case and these, although there are obvious differences. In that case the order appealed against was one suppressing publication of the verdict in a trial which otherwise had been the subject of publicity, that order having been made in anticipation of a further trial to be held some months later. Mr Dawson did not suggest that there was any precise analogy between that case and the present cases but he relied upon the judgment of the Chief Justice for a number of principles which must guide my decision in the present matter.  3 He referred to what the Chief Justice had to say about the importance of open justice, and the value to the community of fair and accurate media reporting of court proceedings. The importance of those considerations is beyond argument. 4 Nevertheless, the law recognises that there are cases from time to time where the publication of evidence must be suppressed, at least temporarily. Indeed, the order I made relies upon the statutory power conferred by s292 of the Criminal Procedure Act. A provision of that kind has been in force in relation to proceedings of this kind for many years. Its predecessor was s578 of the Crimes Act. The section is in broad terms, and it would seem that it is proper to invoke it to protect the interests of an accused: see Nationwide News v The District Court (1996) 40 NSWLR 486, per Meagher JA, with whom Priestley JA agreed, at 498.  5 Mr Dawson did not cavil with the power of this Court to make an order of the kind I have made. What he questioned was the necessity to make it. As to that, he took me to some passages of the judgment of the Chief Justice in the John Fairfax case which emphasise the importance of that consideration. At [51] of the judgment, the Chief Justice spoke of the need to determine that the objective of ensuring the fairness of a subsequent trial cannot be achieved in any way other than prohibition of publication of the evidence. At [94] – [96] he spoke of the high degree of certainty required to meet that test of necessity.  
     
      
    6 At [55] the Chief Justice observed that adjournments and stays are ordinarily sufficient to ensure a fair trial of the accused. At [63] his Honour touched on the very situation which we are concerned, and I should set out here what his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        There are situations in which back-to-back trials are desirable. The issue would arise most acutely in such a case. However, those situations encompass considerations such as the convenience of witnesses, the efficient deployment of prosecutorial resources, the effective management of a court's caseload. Considerations of convenience and efficiency are a wholly inadequate basis to justify the implication of a power to prohibit publication of a verdict. If such considerations are to operate as a qualification of the principle of open justice, express statutory authority is required. 
        
       
      
    7 His Honour was talking about the power of a District Court judge to make such an order. As I have said, the power to make the present order is not in question, but the Chief Justice's observations are apposite to its exercise.  8 Mr Dawson submitted that in the present case the fairness of the trials of the accused yet to be heard would be protected by the orders which are already in place, that is, orders suppressing the publication of names of the accused and of the complainant. He submitted that appropriate directions would be given to the juries in those cases to disregard any publicity they might have seen or read, and to decide each case on the evidence before them. He referred to what the Chief Justice had to say in the John Fairfax case at [103] ff about the confidence trial judges are entitled to have in the capacity and willingness of juries to obey judicial directions. He submitted that, in any event, fairness could be achieved, if necessary, by the adjournment of the subsequent trials, and that that course would be preferable to a prohibition on publication of the evidence in the present case.  9 The Crown prosecutor and counsel for the three accused all opposed the application and submitted that the non-publication order should remain in place. It is convenient to assess that submission by reference to the Crown case statements in relation to each of the trials, which I will have marked MFI 3 in due course so as to be identified for the purpose of this judgment. 10 What concerns the Crown prosecutor and defence counsel are the obvious similarities between this case and the trials yet to be heard. The three accused are brothers. Each of the complainants is a young girl in her early-to-mid teens. All the offences are said to have taken place at the same location, that is, the home where they were living at Ashfield. There is a similarity in relation to the allegations of sexual conduct and in relation to the surrounding circumstances.  
     
      
    11 Indeed, it is such that the Crown prosecutor has foreshadowed the tender of evidence in this trial in the other trials as tendency or coincidence evidence. That is certainly his intention in relation to the second trial although, as I recall it, he is considering his position in relation to that as to the third trial. I make no comment about the availability of that course because I have not yet heard argument about it, and I have no doubt there will be argument about it, but it is certainly true that there are marked similarities in the overall circumstances between this case and the next trial involving two of the present accused, as there are between this case and the third trial involving only one of them.  
     
      
    12 I have given this matter anxious consideration. In my view, if the trials were to proceed back-to-back, there is very real danger, indeed a virtual inevitability, that at least one of the jurors in each of the subsequent trials would note the similarities between the published evidence in this case and the allegations in those trials, and would make the very connection which the non-publication order is designed to prevent. The difficulty is the constellation of similarities, and I do not believe that it can be averted by the suppression of parts of the evidence, for example, a suppression of the location where the offences occurred. That course was proposed by Mr Dawson, but I just do not think it would work.  
     
      
    13 Assuming the trials were to run back-to-back, in my view the test of necessity propounded by the Chief Justice in the John Fairfax case is met. I believe that it could be said that there is a high level of certainly that prejudice would ensue in the subsequent trials: see the judgment at [101].  
     
      
    14 True it is the juries in the subsequent trials could be directed to disregard any publicity they had read and to decide each case only on the evidence related to it. The view I have reached is not intended as a reflection upon potential jurors, or as an insinuation that they are exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice: see the judgment of the Chief Justice at [103]. Notwithstanding the confidence that trial judges ought to have in the respect of juries for their directions, the courts have long recognised there are situations of prejudice which strain that confidence to the limit, and which need to be remedied by some means other than simply directions.  
     
      
    15 So much is inherent in the judgment of Simpson J, in relation to these very cases, in R v M S K and Ors [2004] NSWSC 1009. It is also inherent in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Re K [2002] NSWCCA 374. In both those decisions temporary stays were granted because of publicity likely to prejudice the accused in an upcoming trial.  
     
      
    16 The question remains whether a further adjournment of the outstanding trials in this case might meet the situation, and might safely allow publicity of the previous trial. My fear is that only a lengthy adjournment of the subsequent trials would guard against that danger but, in any event, that is simply not an acceptable option.  
     
      
    17 I shall also have marked MFI 4 the most recent chronology provided by the Crown prosecutor of the history of these trials. It is a sorry history. They have been waiting far too long to come to hearing, and they must proceed to hearing promptly. Trials of this nature inevitably take a heavy emotional toll upon all concerned, especially, in the present cases, the young complainants. Delay only worsens that emotional toll, and carries with it the risk of miscarriage of justice.  18 The passage from the judgment of the Chief Justice in the John Fairfax case at [63], which I have quoted, refers to no more than considerations of convenience and administrative efficiency. Far more important considerations are involved here: those to which I have just referred. For those reasons I would not consider a further adjournment of the subsequent trials so as to enable publicity of the present one.  
     
      
    19 Accordingly, the application is refused and the non-publication order will remain in force.

    3 HIDDEN J: Early in 2003 the appellants, Konstantinos Georgiou and Bruce Malcolm Harrison, were tried before Greg James J and a jury on three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. The jury were directed to acquit them of the count of attempted murder but they were found guilty of the three counts of murder. Both of them were later sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment. They have appealed against conviction only.  
     
      
       
      Crown case 
       
      
    4 The three deceased, Michael Kulakowski, Sasha Milenkovic and Rick De Stoop, were all members of the “Bandidos” Motorcycle Club, as was a fourth man, Robin David, who was the subject of the charge of attempted murder. The appellants were members of the “Rebels” Motorcycle Club. It was alleged that they shot the three deceased in the basement of the Blackmarket Café, a twenty-four hour operating night club in Sydney, in the early afternoon of Sunday, 9 November 1997. The killings had the appearance of planned executions, although the motive for them was unclear.  
     
      
    5 There was no eyewitness to the shootings. However, there was a body of circumstantial evidence against the appellants, including ballistics and forensic biological evidence, most of which it is unnecessary to recite for the purpose of these appeals. 
     
      
    6 An important Crown witness was Ms Angela Konz, who was the girlfriend of the deceased, Michael Kulakowski. She was with her boyfriend and the other three Bandidos members when they arrived at the nightclub late in the morning of the day of the shooting. The group went to a bar on the ground floor. Later, the three deceased left her at the bar and walked towards a door leading to the basement. Some minutes later she heard the sound of gunshots coming from the basement. She said that shortly thereafter she saw the appellants, whom she knew, hurriedly leave the club by the front door. She saw that Harrison, who was behind Georgiou, was holding a gun. It will be necessary to examine some of Ms Konz’s evidence in greater detail when dealing with two of Georgiou’s grounds of appeal. Robin David also gave evidence but, again, it is unnecessary to refer to it for present purposes.  
     
      
    7 Outside the nightclub the appellants got into a car, which was driven away by Georgiou. Harrison had a gunshot wound to his left wrist. Two police officers, who happened to be in the area in a police vehicle, pursued them. During the pursuit witnesses saw a pistol thrown from Georgiou’s car, and another pistol was found by a pedestrian along the route which the car had taken. These weapons were later linked by ballistic evidence to the shootings. The car stopped in the Surry Hills area and the appellants ran from it. Georgiou got away but Harrison was apprehended. He sought to explain the wound to his wrist otherwise than as a gunshot wound. Georgiou was arrested about two months later, attempting to leave Australia on a ship bound for Japan.  
     
      
       
      Defence case 
       
      
    8 Both appellants gave evidence which, generally speaking, was consistent. It was their case that they had gone to the nightclub in the early afternoon of the day in question at the request of one Reid Kingston, who was also a member of the Rebels Motorcycle Club. Kingston had been at the nightclub when the group of Bandidos had arrived and, for reasons which need not be examined, he feared that they might cause trouble. He wanted to speak to them but felt that he needed “backup.” Accordingly, he went to Georgiou’s home and they returned to the nightclub in Georgiou’s car, picking up Harrison on the way. 
     
      
    9 Having arrived, Kingston directed Georgiou to wait outside and keep watch. According to Harrison, they were joined by another member of the Rebels, whose identity he was afraid to reveal because he was “still around.” Those three men entered the nightclub, leaving Georgiou outside. Kingston directed Harrison to keep watch at the door leading to the basement. Kingston and the other Rebel went downstairs to the basement with the three deceased and the door was closed behind them. Robin David remained upstairs near the door, not far from Harrison.  
     
      
    10 Shortly thereafter there was the sound of gunshots. David was pulling at the door when it suddenly burst open. There were further shots and Harrison sustained the wound to his wrist. Kingston came through the basement door, “panicking”, thrust a pistol into Harrison’s hand and told him to get rid of it. They ran out of the nightclub, Harrison joined Georgiou outside, and the two of them fled from the scene in Georgiou’s car. During the journey Harrison threw the pistol which Kingston had given him out of the car. Georgiou denied knowledge of any other pistol having been thrown from the car or, indeed, of any pistol having been taken to the nightclub when they had travelled there earlier. He acknowledged that the two pistols which were later found and linked to the shootings were his, but said that he had given them to Kingston and understood that at that time they were kept at the Rebels clubhouse. 
     
      
    11 It will be necessary to return to the appellants’ evidence, in the light of the history of the proceedings, when considering the ground of appeal which is pursued by both of them. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    12 In this Court the appellant Georgiou was represented by Mr Wendler, who had also appeared for him at the trial, and the appellant Harrison by Ms Fullerton SC, who did not appear at the trial. Both appellants pursued a ground of appeal that the trial judge misdirected the jury on the issue of lies said to have been told by them. Georgiou relied on two further grounds of appeal arising from the evidence of Angela Konz. It is convenient to deal firstly with the ground concerning lies. For the most part, Mr Wendler adopted the submissions on this ground of Ms Fullerton.  
     
      
       
      Lies 
       
      
    13 To understand this ground of appeal it is necessary to sketch some background. This was the third trial of the matter. In 1999 the appellants had been tried before Dowd J, and had been found guilty of the three counts of murder and the count of attempted murder. Their appeals against those convictions were allowed and a new trial was ordered: R v Harrison and Georgiou [2001] NSWCCA 464. A further trial before Howie J was aborted because of adverse publicity, but nothing which occurred in that trial is material for present purposes. What is significant is that in the first trial the appellants mounted defence cases which differed from each other, and which were inconsistent with the case which they presented at the third trial.  
     
      
    14 Georgiou had raised an alibi, claiming in evidence that he had been at home when the shooting occurred. Harrison had adhered in evidence to an account he had given to police the day after the shooting. The effect of that account was that he and Georgiou had gone to the nightclub on the morning in question, for no particular reason. He denied any involvement in the shooting or any knowledge of the circumstances giving rise to it. He said that he just happened to be near the door leading to the basement when the incident occurred, and he was shot in the wrist. He ran out of the club, along with others. Georgiou, seeing that he was injured, took him to his car and they set off, intending to drive to a hospital. He denied having held a gun inside the nightclub or having thrown anything out of the car window. 
     
      
    15 Indeed, his counsel at the third trial delivered an opening address to the jury after the Crown prosecutor’s opening, in which he asserted that his client “denies that he held the gun at any time inside the Black Market Café.” In evidence, Harrison acknowledged that that was not correct and said that he had given his counsel instructions to the contrary in the middle of the trial. He admitted, generally, that his account to police and in his evidence at the first trial was false.  
     
      
    16 Georgiou also admitted in evidence that the alibi he had raised at the first trial was false. He said that he had then been afraid to reveal what he knew of the incident, particularly the involvement of Reid Kingston, for fear of reprisals against his family and himself. However, Kingston later died and, when he heard this, he felt able to reveal the true position. He did so to his solicitors at the commencement of the third trial, although he had known of Kingston’s death for some considerable time by then.  
     
      
    17 The effect of Harrison’s evidence was that he also felt able to reveal his knowledge of the incident only after he heard of Kingston’s death. However, even though he too knew of that death for a considerable time before the third trial, he delayed changing his instructions to his legal representatives because he had felt “locked in” to the defence which he had advanced in the first trial. 
     
      
    18 Georgiou gave evidence first, and it was not until Harrison gave his evidence that it became apparent that both their accounts were different from those which they had previously advanced and were now consistent with each other. The Crown prosecutor at the trial (who also did not appear in this Court) put it to Harrison that he had fashioned his evidence so that it “dovetails with Mr Georgiou’s account”. This he denied. In the course of the Crown prosecutor’s final address, the learned trial judge raised with defence counsel whether it was open to her to submit that the appellants had “put their heads together to tell a mutual false account”. Both counsel accepted that it was, and Mr Wendler did not consider it necessary for Georgiou to be recalled for cross-examination about it. The Crown prosecutor addressed the jury accordingly, submitting that the new accounts of both appellants should be rejected. In particular, she argued that they had seized an opportunity to concoct a joint story or, at least, that Harrison had tailored his evidence so that it would broadly accord with that of Georgiou.  
     
      
    19 His Honour dealt with the question of lies at various stages of the summing-up. The admitted lies by Georgiou about his alibi, and by Harrison about his possession of a gun in the night club, were left to the jury as part of the Crown’s circumstantial case. However, in the context of directions about the need for separate consideration of the case against each of the appellants, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        Each of the accused has admitted telling lies on a prior occasion or occasions, including Mr Harrison in the record of interview to the police and Mr Georgiou in respect of the false alibi and the accounts they had given in previous proceedings the fact that they had done that, is material that would only be capable of being used against the person who had done it or told the lie. 
        
       
       
        
        It is the Crown case here, however, that they have abandoned their previous lying accounts in order to tell here another lie, for the first time raising this concept that it was not them who did it but Reid Kingston and the unknown other Rebel or someone else. So that they have in this trial put their heads together to give this account and to support each other in a lie which, if you are satisfied is a lie, you can take into account not only against the maker but if you are satisfied they put their heads together to produce that account, against not only the maker but also his co-accused. 
        
       
      
    20 In relation to lies generally, his Honour gave directions in accordance with Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193. Within those directions his Honour also dealt with evidence of flight, that is, the appellants’ hasty departure from the nightclub and Georgiou’s later attempt to leave Australia.  
     
      
    21 In the course of further directions about the separate consideration of the case against each appellant, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        I have already directed you to evidence that is admissible against one but not against the other, … principally the lies; unless you say that what is said here was a lie that they had both put their heads together to tell in recognition that their previous accounts were not such as would divert from the truth. 
        
       
       
        
        Now it’s in that circumstance and only in that circumstance that you can use the finding that you might make, that one has told you a lie in the witness box concerning who committed the crime, against the other. 
        
       
      
    22 Finally, in the course of directions about the fact that each of the accused had chosen to give evidence, his Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        …if you decide to reject the evidence of the accused, that of itself does not establish the Crown case. You have to look at the other evidence to see if you are, notwithstanding the objective evidence of the accused, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. But if you conclude that the accused has deliberately lied here before you, in order to deceive you, as to his involvement, that is a matter which you can consider in conjunction with the whole of the other proved circumstances, to decide whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged. Further, if you conclude still further that he and the other accused have put their heads together to tell a mutual false story told to deceive you, you can take that lie into account against both of them. 
        
       
       
      Although these directions were given in the middle of his Honour’s summary of Mr Harrison’s evidence, it appears that they were meant to apply to both appellants.  
       
      
    23 No complaint was made about any of these directions by counsel for either appellant at the trial, and no further direction was sought. However, in this Court it was submitted that his Honour had fallen into error in two respects.  
     
      
    24 Firstly, it was argued that his Honour should not have suggested to the jury that, if they concluded that the account of each of the appellants in evidence at the trial was a concoction, they could treat that evidence as a lie demonstrating a consciousness of guilt. Ms Fullerton noted that his Honour had put the admitted lies by Georgiou about his alibi and by Harrison about his possession of a gun in the nightclub as part of the Crown’s circumstantial case, and she accepted that they were properly left as evidence of consciousness of guilt. She noted, however, that the Crown prosecutor at the trial did not put her suggestion that the appellants had concocted the new account on that basis. Rather, she relied on it only as a matter going to their credibility. Yet his Honour’s Edwards directions were expressed to relate to lies generally and, in the passages from the summing up quoted above, were applied to that new account.  
     
      
    25 This case, however, is very different from Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234, in which the majority of the High Court held that an Edwards direction was inappropriate. That appellant was on trial for a number of charges of a fraudulent nature and in cross examination of him the Crown prosecutor put to him that he had lied, not only in his dealings with the alleged victims but also in a number of the answers he had given in evidence. It seems, however, that the cross examination was directed only to his credibility and it was not put that he had lied out of a consciousness of guilt. Because the appellant had been unrepresented at the trial, the prosecutor did not address the jury. Their Honours held that the trial judge should have done no more than direct the jury that it was for them to decide whether he had lied, and warn them that they should not conclude guilt simply from the fact that he had: see the joint judgment at [23].  
     
      
    26 In the present case it is accepted that the admitted lies of both appellants were properly left as evidence of consciousness of guilt. To direct the jury in such a way as to distinguish between those lies and other alleged lies said to bear only upon their credibility has an air of unreality about it. Lies, admitted or alleged, came to loom large in the case. If the jury found that the appellants had concocted their evidence, they would almost inevitably have concluded that they did so because they were guilty. That process of reasoning was open to them but, before embarking upon it, they needed to be instructed as to the care with which it should be undertaken.  
     
      
    27 It should not be forgotten that the purpose of the Edwards directions is to achieve fairness to an accused who is said to have lied about any material matter. They are designed to ensure that a jury does not leap from the finding of a lie to the conclusion of guilt before considering other factors which, in the experience of the courts, could provide an innocent explanation for the lie. In the joint judgment in Zoneff, their Honours said at [16]: 
     
      
       
        
        There may be cases in which the risk of misunderstanding on the part of a jury as to the use to which they may put lies might be such that a judge should give an 
         Edwards 
        -type direction notwithstanding that the prosecutor has not put that a lie has been told out of consciousness of guilt. 
        
       
       
      In my view, this was such a case. 
       
      
    28 The second complaint was that his Honour directed the jury that, if they were satisfied that the appellants had jointly concocted their evidence, they could use the lies of each of them against the other. Ms Fullerton submitted that this led to a “confusing intermingling” of the two cases. Mr Wendler expressed it as “treating the case as a sort of amalgam”, thereby derogating from the requirement that the case against each accused be considered separately. While accepting that it had been open to the Crown prosecutor to put joint concoction to the jury, it was argued that the lies of each appellant should have been considered only in relation to his case.  
     
      
    29 I do not believe that I have encountered a direction such as his Honour gave, and counsel were not able to take us to any authority on the point. This may well be because the situation with which his Honour was dealing was quite unusual. That said, this argument also has an air of unreality about it. One might question whether it was appropriate to give such a direction but, if the jury were satisfied that the appellants had collaborated to give a false account in their evidence, it is difficult to see how it could have caused any unfairness. Of course, it remained necessary for the jury to consider separately in relation to each appellant whether that lie was the product of a consciousness of guilt of the crime charged. Read as a whole, his Honour’s directions on lies and separate consideration of the case against each accused would have made that clear. 
     
      
    30 Ms Fullerton referred us to another passage of the summing up in which, she argued, his Honour had again intermingled the two cases. It is unnecessary to set that passage out. It is sufficient to say that, read in its context, it relates only to the case against Georgiou.  
     
      
    31 In my view, nothing in his Honour’s directions on lies could have misled the jury from their task and have given rise to a miscarriage of justice. This ground is not made out. Let me turn, then, to the two grounds of appeal argued on behalf of Georgiou.  
     
      
       
      Evidence of Angela Konz 
       
      
    32 The first of these grounds relates to Ms Konz’s evidence of something she heard said by the deceased, Sasha Milenkovic. She said that, when she and the group of Bandidos arrived at the nightclub, Justin Culshaw was “on the door.” He was a member of the Rebels who was employed as a security officer at the nightclub, although it seems that he was not on duty that morning. She knew Culshaw, and she said that he and Georgiou were friends.  
     
      
    33 Her evidence was that, after she and her companions had sat down in the bar area, Milenkovic left that area and went towards the front door. He returned, and made to Michael Kulakowski the statement which is the subject of this ground. According to Ms Konz, he “told Mick that Justin and Kon wanted to have a word with him – with them”. Kulakowski replied, “Yeah, fine.” He told Ms Konz that he would be five minutes and asked her to wait at the bar for him. He said something to Rick De Stoop which she did not hear, and it was then that the three men walked towards the door leading to the basement.  
     
      
    34 It was the Crown case that, in the statement attributed to Milenkovic, “Justin” was a reference to Culshaw and “Kon” to Georgiou. At the trial Mr Wendler objected to the evidence on the basis that it was hearsay which did not fall into any exception under the Evidence Act and that, in any event, the Crown had not given the notice required by s67 of the Act of its intention to adduce hearsay evidence. Further, in the alternative, he argued that the balancing exercise required by s137 of the Act required the rejection of the evidence.  
     
      
    35 Dowd J had rejected the evidence on that last basis in the first trial, and Mr Wendler relied upon Rogers v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 251 to mount a submission that the Crown prosecutor in the third trial should not have been allowed to re-litigate the admissibility of the evidence. Greg James J allowed the evidence, and in this Court Mr Wendler pressed the same arguments he had mounted at the trial. (Ms Konz gave the evidence in a form slightly different from that which was anticipated at the time his Honour made his ruling, but nothing turns on this.) 
     
      
    36 Greg James J held that the evidence was not hearsay, from which it followed that there was no need to meet the requirement of notice in s67. I should set out the relevant part of his Honour’s reasons, which commenced by reference to the general exclusion of hearsay evidence in s59 of the Act: 
     
      
       
        
        Section 59 provides for a general bar on admissibility of evidence of a previous representation made by a person for the purpose of proving the existence of a fact the person intended to assert by the representation. 
        
       
       
        
        Where, however, what is occurring is a verbal transaction sometimes referred to, as in  
        The Queen v Ratten  
        (1972) AC 378, as a “verbal act”, the material is not hearsay at common law; nor is it, in my view, hearsay and caught by the hearsay rule under the  
        Evidence Act… 
        
       
       
        
        Here what we have is an invitation. That invitation was communicated through Mr Milenkovic. It is the Crown case that at least Mr Georgiou and Mr Culshaw were present in the premises at the time Mr Milenkovic left the group and returned asserting an invitation to a meeting extended by those persons to those Mr Milenkovic was addressing. 
        
       
       
        
        The group, or at least the relevant members of the group, thereupon left where they were and went (sic). The evidence is tendered, as the Crown points out, to explain what was happening at that time, to explain their intent as to where they were going and to explain what caused them to go there. In my view, it is admissible as an invitation verbal act. In that circumstance, it is not barred as hearsay… 
        
       
      
    37 It is convenient to deal at this stage with the argument based upon Rogers v The Queen. We were supplied with a copy of Dowd J’s reasons for rejecting the evidence in the first trial. Like Greg James J, his Honour concluded that the evidence was not hearsay, albeit by a somewhat different path of reasoning. However, after referring to s60 of the Evidence Act and to Lee v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 594, he concluded that the evidence carried a risk of unfair prejudice which could not be cured by any limitation of the use of the evidence under s136 of the Act. As I understand it, his Honour’s fear was that the jury would use it impermissibly as evidence that Georgiou had a hand in luring the three deceased to the basement.  
     
      
    38 It was on this point that their Honours parted company. Greg James J concluded his reasons for admitting the evidence in this way:  
     
      
       
        
        I come back then to the argument asserting s137 should be applied and what is submitted to be the prejudicial effect. What is the prejudice in this case? The probative effect of the evidence is no different really to that which might tend to show that Mr Subramaniam had been threatened by the terrorists [a reference to  
        Subramaniam v 
          
        Public Prosecutor (Malaya)  
        [1956] 1 WLR 965.] The content of the invitation is as much part of the transaction as the communication of the thing itself. It happens in this case that it is the communication of an oral transaction. It is submitted that if this material goes into evidence as an invitation to a meeting, the jury might use it to suggest that the persons named in the invitation were the persons that extended the invitation. 
        
       
       
        
        To state the issue in this way is to make it clear that that is the probative value substantially of this evidence, not just that there was a meeting, but that it was a meeting called by those who were named in the statement through the emissary, Mr Milenkovic, who was, of course, the contact point from whoever extended the invitation to whoever received it.  
        
       
       
        
        In those circumstances, I do not see that the jury could misuse the evidence in the sense of use it for a purpose other that that for which it is legitimately available. I am unable to see, therefore, that there is a danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant by admitting the evidence and allowing the jury to reason in that way since that is, as I see it, the probative value of the evidence. 
        
       
      
    39 In this Court, Mr Wendler acknowledged that Greg James J was not bound by the ruling of Dowd J because, the verdicts in the first trial having been set aside on appeal, that ruling was not final as between the Crown and the appellant: Rogers, per Deane and Gaudron JJ at 278 – 9; R v GK (2001) 53 NSWLR 317, per Sully J at 335 - 6. Mr Wendler relied upon the more flexible approach in Rogers of Mason CJ, based upon notions of abuse of process and public confidence in the administration of justice. That was not the approach of the other members of the Court. Nevertheless, Greg James J referred to the judgment of the Chief Justice in considering the reasons of Dowd J but, having concluded that Dowd J’s decision was “plainly wrong”, determined that public confidence in the administration of justice would not be served by adhering to it. His Honour referred to the review of relevant authority to be found in the judgment of Buddin J, sitting as a trial judge, in R v Pettersen (unrep, 6 June 2002) at [7] - [14]. It was clearly open to his Honour to examine the matter afresh, and no error has been shown in his doing so. 
     
      
    40 That said, the Crown prosecutor in this Court fairly expressed a misgiving about his Honour’s reasoning in the last passage from the judgment quoted above. The jury might well have inferred from the words attributed to Milenkovic that Georgiou (and Culshaw) had personally asked him to convey a message that they wished to speak to the deceased. However, there was no direct evidence of this and the possibility remained that the message passed on by Milenkovic was, as it were, second hand. In that event, a problem could have arisen akin to that dealt with by the High Court in Lee v The Queen (supra).  
     
      
    41 Indeed, the Crown prosecutor at the trial conceded as much in her final address to the jury. She acknowledged that Ms Konz would not have been able to say that the message she heard conveyed by Milenkovic “in fact came from” Georgiou and that she would not know “the origins of that message…” This led his Honour in summing up to direct the jury as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        As to that message, bear this in mind: it is conceded by the Crown that Angela Konz could not say that Kon Georgiou had actually sent the message. What is material, however, is the reference in the message to the meeting and the message being delivered inside the Blackmarket Café and Sasha Milenkovic, Mick Kulakowski and Rick De Stoop going away in to or toward the direction where the cellar door might be found. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (By the “cellar door” his Honour meant the door which I have referred to as the door leading to the basement.) 
       
      
    42 There can be no doubt that the evidence was admissible to explain why the deceased left the bar and headed towards the basement and that, for that purpose, it was not hearsay. Any risk that the jury might have used it impermissibly against Georgiou was averted by the Crown prosecutor’s concession and his Honour’s direction. It seems to me that, in the light of the other evidence in the Crown case, it was open to the jury to infer that Georgiou had himself asked Milenkovic to pass a message to the deceased, and I understand this to be the effect of that last passage from his Honour’s reasons for admitting the evidence. However, even if his Honour were in error in that passage, no miscarriage of justice could in fact have arisen and I would apply the proviso. This ground also fails.  
     
      
       
      Summing-up of Ms Konz’s evidence 
       
      
    43 The second of the grounds of appeal relating to Georgiou only arises from an observation his Honour made towards the end of the summing–up, in response to a question by the jury about the drawing of inferences. In the course of dealing with that question, his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        Now there is one witness here who gives evidence of seeing facts which are said to be close to the time at which the accused are said to have committed the crime, that is Angela Konz, and that leads to the question of identification. 
        
       
       
        
        You will recall that I have directed you in relation to that, because the accused Georgiou says he was outside. Angela Konz says he was inside and leaving from the direction of the cellar door in company with Mr Harrison. 
        
       
      
    44 Mr Wendler’s complaint, which he made at the time, was that the last sentence in that passage does not fairly represent Ms Konz’s evidence. He noted that this was an important part of the evidence against his client. Ms Konz had described hearing the shots and seeing “like a big influx of people …by the doorway to the basement.” She went on: 
     
      
       
        
        …the next thing I saw Kon and Harry [Harrison] run out of the basement door- not out of the basement door, sorry. I saw them run past the archway where I was sitting – I was standing at that point … 
        
       
      
    45 A person moving from the entrance area of the nightclub into the bar would pass through the archway to which Ms Konz referred. It is unnecessary to examine the evidence of the layout of the premises. It is sufficient to say that the direction in which Ms Konz described the appellants running was consistent with their having come from the basement. In the passage from the summing-up of which Mr Wendler complained his Honour was doing no more than expressing in a very summary form the effect of Ms Konz’s evidence for the purpose of answering the jury’s question. He had earlier dealt with her evidence in detail, including her evidence on this very point. Moreover, the jury requested and were supplied with a copy of the transcript of her evidence. There is no substance in this ground. 
     
      
    46 Accordingly, I would propose that the appeals be dismissed.

    1 JAMES, J: I agree with Hall, J. 
     
      
    2 HISLOP, J: I agree with Hall, J. 
     
      
    3 HALL, J: On 24 March 2004, the applicant entered a plea of guilty to one count of ongoing supply of a prohibited drug, being an offence pursuant to s.25A of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985. 
     
      
    4 The three individual supplies involved one of methadone (18.6 grams) (16 ml) and two supplies of heroin in quantities of 0.05 grams and 0.029 grams respectively. The supplies all occurred on 22 July 2003. 
     
      
    5 The maximum penalty attracted by the offence is 3,500 penalty units or imprisonment for 20 years, or both. 
     
      
    6 On 2 July 2004, Maguire, DCJ. in the District Court of New South Wales, Campbelltown, sentenced the applicant to a total sentence of 30 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 months to commence on 2 July 2004. The non-parole period is to expire on 1 October 2005. 
     
      
       
       
      Factual matters 
       
      
    7 The plaintiff was born on 6 February 1972, he therefore being 31 years of age at the date of the offence. 
     
      
    8 On 31 July 2003, the applicant was arrested. He had had prior convictions for possessing prohibited drugs. 
     
      
    9 The sentencing proceedings were conducted by the sentencing judge on 28 May 2004 when the applicant gave evidence, as did his wife. A plea of guilty had been entered on arraignment before his Honour Judge Sides on 26 March 2004. An agreed statement of facts was tendered before his Honour and this was relied upon in the sentencing proceedings. Extracts from the statement of facts were set out in the remarks on sentence. I reproduce the facts as contained within those extracted paragraphs:- 
     
      
       
        
        “First supply – At about 9.30 am on Tuesday 22 July 2003, a male undercover operative David Low, approached the co-accused Michael Fulcher in the vicinity of The Crescent Park, Fairfield and asked if he knew anyone who could (sic) he could get some ‘done’ from. Fulcher yelled out to a person Ben from across the park and asked if he had any, however he did not. Fulcher then took the operative over to the offender Adam Sama who was seated in the driver’s seat of a Hyundai Excel parked near the railway station car park. Conversation took place between the three and Sama agreed to supply the operative a bottle of methadone. Sama produced a paper bag from within the car and pulled out two dark coloured bottles. He selected one of the bottles, tore the white label off it and then handed it to the operative. The operative handed Sama $100. The liquid from the bottle was later analysed and contained 16 millilitres of methadone. 
        
       
       
        
        Supply 2 – At about 12.45 pm on the same day, a female operative Michelle Jones went to Crescent Park, Fairfield. The operative approached the offender who was with a female. She inquired about ‘done’ but was told the guy who was selling methadone was gone and was asked by the female, why don’t you get some gear instead. Conversation then took place as to the price and quality of the heroin. Both Sama and the operative walked down into a car park and sat on the kerb between two cars. Sama then removed a foil from his pants pocket and unwrapped it. Sama asked the operative for some packaging for the heroin. The operative handed Sama a chewing gum packet and Sama removed two pieces of chewing gum, placed one in his mouth, the other he held in his hand. He placed a small package on top of the remaining pieces of chewing gum and placed the final piece of chewing gum on top of the package, before closing it tightly and he said, ‘This is what you do so the coppers don’t find out. When they come and try and search you, you just show them the chewy packet and they won’t find the gear’. The operative handed Sama $70 in exchange for the drug. The substance was analysed and found to be heroin, 0.05 grams. 
        
       
       
        
        Supply 3 – At about 1.25 pm the same day, the same female operative and another female operative Lee attended the vicinity of the Crescent Park at Fairfield. Operative Michelle got the offender Adam Sama’s attention and introduce (sic) operative Lee and indicated to him that she was after gear. Operative Lee handed Sama $70 and followed him to a fence adjacent to the car park that the first operative had been in earlier. Sama had a conversation with some workmen and walked back to Lee and sat on a brick wall. Sama asked the operative if she had something to wrap it in. Sama told the operative to move down so no-one could see what they were doing. The operative crouched down. Sama placed a small piece of foil in the operative’s hand. He unwrapped another piece of foil which had broken bits of white rock in it. He then tipped some of the white rock substance into the piece of foil being held by the operative. The operative folded up the bit of foil, Sama told her keep it open as he was giving her more. Sama tipped another piece of white rock substance into the foil. The operative folded it and placed it in his pocket. The substance was analysed and found to be 0.02 grams of heroin.” 
        
       
      
    10 The applicant relied upon three grounds and I will deal with each in turn:- 
     
      
       
      Ground one: his Honour erred in only giving the applicant a limited discount for his plea of guilty because of the strength of the Crown case 
       
      
    11 In the written submissions on behalf of the applicant, attention was given to the following statement in the remarks on sentence (p.6):- 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender’s guilty plea is to be taken into account in his favour but only to a limited extent, having regard to the strength of the Crown case.” 
        
       
      
    12 Mr. John Stratton, SC., on behalf of the applicant, submitted that in only taking the applicant’s plea into account to a limited extent, because of the strength of the Crown case, his Honour fell into error. In particular, it was contended, based upon well-known authorities, that the strength of the Crown case is an irrelevant factor in determining the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. The strength of the Crown case is relevant only to the evaluation of contrition or remorse and what weight should be given to that factor in determining the appropriate sentence: Regina v. Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 386, 416 per Spigelman, CJ.;  Regina v. Carter [2001] NSWCCA 245 (per Howie, J., with whom Barr, J. agreed) (at [13]); Regina v. Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 (per Howie, J., with whom the other members of this Court agreed) at [12]) and Regina v. Tran [2004] NSWCCA 366 (per Buddin, J. with whom the other members of this court agreed) (at [13]-[15]). 
     
      
    13 In his oral submissions, Mr. Stratton, SC. contended that the sentencing judge was not limiting the effect of the Crown case upon contrition and that he was discounting it in relation to the plea generally. In this respect, he observed that the sentencing judge dealt with the issue of contrition at the foot of p.5 of the sentence remarks and that he had dealt with the contrition aspect when he moved on to deal with the guilty plea and the fact that it would only be taken into account in favour of the applicant to a limited extent, having regard to the strength of the Crown case. In other words, it was argued that if the sentencing judge had, at this point, moved onto dealing with the utilitarian value of the plea, it was clear that he had fallen into what was contended to be the familiar error of discounting the utilitarian benefit based on the strength of the Crown case. 
     
      
    14 The sentencing judge did not specify precisely what he meant by his statement that he would only take into account the guilty plea to a limited extent. It certainly left open the interpretation contended for by senior counsel for the applicant. 
     
      
    15 In oral submissions for the Crown, it was contended that there is not necessarily a “cut off point” between the sentencing judge’s discussion of contrition and the claimed erroneous statement. The point at issue is, of course, not assisted by the fact that his Honour did not quantify what the discount was that he was applying to the sentence, nor did he quantify what portion was going to the issue of contrition and remorse and what portion was going to the utilitarian effect of the plea. As the Crown correctly observes in its written submissions (p.2) this is not indicative of error. However, nonetheless it is helpful for these to be stated, and would have been helpful in this matter, had his Honour done so. The Crown has submitted that the remarks on sentence do not support a conclusion that his Honour contravened the principles stated in the abovementioned authorities. 
     
      
    16 The sentencing judge did not state that he was taking the guilty plea to a limited extent only on the question of contrition. The disputed statement occurs in a portion of the remarks on sentence, as the applicant has contended, in what appears to be a general consideration of the guilty plea without limitation. I have formed the view that his Honour’s statement, made without limitation, did reflect that his Honour considered that the strength of the Crown case was relevant in determining the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. In that respect, his Honour’s statement was clearly an erroneous one. 
     
      
    17 I will return to consider the significance of this error in the total context of the other grounds for the application. 
     
      
       
      Ground two: the learned sentencing judge did not take into account as a mitigating factor that it was a reasonable possibility that had the police not approached the applicant the offence might not have been committed 
       
      
    18 Before turning to the facts of this matter, it is helpful to refer to the general approach to be taken as observed by King, CJ. in Regina v. Mandica (1980) 4 A. Crim. R. 34 at 43. There, it was observed:- 
     
      
       
      • Any background information which might justify the setting of a trap by undercover police will generally not be available to a sentencing court. 
       
       
      • The court must do the best it can with the facts proved before it by admissible evidence. In deciding whether to extend leniency by reason of entrapment, the sentencing judge should take a common-sense view of the evidence for the purpose of deciding whether there is a reasonable possibility that the convicted person would not have committed the offence but for the encouragement involved in the setting of the trap. 
       
      
    19 The sentencing judge rejected the applicant’s evidence that he did not sell drugs and that he had sold the methadone to fund the purchase of heroin for his own use. His Honour pointed to the fact that within hours he was selling heroin. I observe, incidentally, that, as noted in the Crown’s written submissions, when the person Fulcher was approached by police and asked whether he knew anybody from whom methadone could be purchased, he took the police immediately to the applicant. The applicant then provided police with the methadone. It is said that this was not merely coincidental. I agree. 
     
      
    20 Whilst the evidence did not establish that the offender was conducting what was described as an established retail operation the sentencing judge referred to the fact that handing out his telephone number indicated that he was prepared to engage in future retail activity. 
     
      
    21 Three and a quarter hours after the first transaction, the applicant was still in the area of The Crescent Park, Fairfield and was then approached by an undercover officer for methadone. The applicant’s female companion suggested to the former that the man who was selling methadone had gone but that they might want some heroin instead. The applicant then provided a small packet containing heroin which he put into a chewing gum packet provided by the police officer. He covered it with a piece of chewing gum, explaining at the same time that was done to fool any police who may search her. These facts do support the inference that the applicant was a person prepared to supply heroin, as indeed his female companion had indicated. 
     
      
    22 An hour and a half later, the same undercover police officer, with another female undercover police officer, approached the applicant and purchased more heroin from the applicant. Whilst it is true, as has been submitted on behalf of the applicant, that he was not carrying the paraphernalia as is typical of a supplier of prohibited drugs, I accept, as the Crown has submitted, that the ease with which the police officers obtained prohibited drugs from the applicant contradicts him as to his assertions that he was in the area to purchase prohibited drugs and not to sell them. Taking a common-sense view of the evidence, I do not believe there was a reasonable possibility that the applicant would not have committed the offence but for the encouragement by officers involved in the setting of the trap. I accordingly reject the second ground of the application. 
     
      
       
      Ground three: the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    23 This ground, as senior counsel for the applicant indicated, was the chief ground which was relied upon by the applicant. The submission was that the offence appears to have been an opportunistic crime and not one involving an offence where the applicant appears to have gone to the location ready to deal. In particular, reliance was placed upon the lack of the accoutrements for paraphernalia of a drug dealer. A further factor said to be a significant feature is the very small amount of drug supplied, particularly in relation to heroin. 
     
      
    24 Senior counsel for the applicant also relied upon what he contended was a powerful subjective case, observing that the sentencing judge had made a specific finding that the applicant had made a significant effort to rehabilitate himself. It was contended that his Honour may have been misled by sentencing statistics that were supplied at the sentencing hearing. 
     
      
    25 The Crown, in relation to ground three, observed that it is not unusual for street sellers not to have with them the accoutrements of a drug dealer. It is also pointed out by the Crown that there was no evidence relating to what quantity of heroin was in the possession of the application on 22 July 2003. 
     
      
    26 The Crown contends that the offence was aggravated by the fact that it was committed whilst the applicant was on bail for possessing a prohibited drug at the time he committed the offence in question. 
     
      
    27 As to the quantity of drugs involved, the Crown relied upon observations made by Hulme, J. (with whom Sheller, JA. and Dowd, J.) agreed in Regina v. Smiroldo (2000) 112 A. Crim. R. 47 (at [15]). 
     
      
    28 In Regina v. CBK (2002) 135 A. Crim. R. 260, Bell, J., at 264 (with whom Wood, CJ. at CL. and Dowd, J. agreed) stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “While, as  
        Smiroldo 
         makes clear, a consideration of the quantity of drug supplied for the purposes of a s.25A of the DMT Act offence will always have relevance to the exercise of the sentencing discretion, the gravamen of the offence is the fact of ongoing supply of prohibited drugs. The seriousness of the offence is to be gauged by the circumstances that it carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.” 
        
       
      
    29 The Crown contends in the present matter that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was well within the sentencing discretion and that the third ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
    30 Senior counsel for the applicant emphasised the extremely small quantity of drug involved in each sale (in particular the heroin supplied was in one case, 0.05 grams and in the other case, 0.02 grams). 
     
      
    31 On the questioning of sentence statistics, the applicant relies upon Judicial Commission statistics for 2004 in relation to the DMT Act, penalty type, offenders aged 31 to 40 years. It is observed that 12% of that age group received a sentence, which was not a full-time custodial sentence. 
     
      
       
      Determination 
       
      
    32 The evidence to my mind established that the applicant was engaged in the supply of prohibited drugs and did so as a part of a planned activity rather than through opportunistic circumstances. It will be recalled that the three supplies all occurred on 22 July 2003 at 9.30 am, 12.45 pm and at approximately 1.25 pm in the vicinity of The Crescent Park at Fairfield. The offence with which the applicant was charged is a serious one and although the quantities of the drug were small, the essence or gravamen of the offence is the fact of ongoing supply of prohibited drugs. The seriousness with which the legislature regards such offence is marked out or gauged by the fact that it carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment as observed by Bell, J. in CBK (ante). 
     
      
    33 The quantity of the drugs supplied is, of course, a relevant fact and the subjective factors must be given due weight. Taking into account all relevant factual matters, I do not consider that the trial judge’s erroneous statement (ground one) nor the total sentence imposed of 30 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 15 months, warrants this Court’s intervention to disturb the sentence. 
     
      
    34 Accordingly, I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted, but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BRYSON JA: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him on 11 March 2004 by his Honour Acting Judge Andrew in the District Court at Sydney. The applicant was convicted on his plea of guilty to a charge under s233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) that between about 1 March 2001 and 5 December 2001 he was knowingly concerned in the importation of a commercial quantity of MDMA, an amphetamine compound referred to as ecstasy and chemically named 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence, relating to a commercial quantity of MDMA is a fine not exceeding $750,000 or imprisonment for life or both; see s235(2)(c) of the Customs Act 1901. The quantity imported was 34.4 kilograms of pure MDMA compounded in about 480,000 tablets. The applicant was arrested on 5 December 2001 and has remained in custody since then. He was sentenced to eighteen years imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve years, and the sentence was backdated to commence on 5 December 2001.  
     
      
    2 The Grounds of Appeal were these: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1 
         
        His Honour erred in finding that the role of the applicant was that of a co-principal in partner [sic] with his brother Joseph Sukkar. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Ground 2 
         
        His Honour failed to give an adequate discount for the utilitarian value of the plea and contrition. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 3 
         
        His Honour failed to give an adequate discount for the offer of assistance by the applicant. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 4 
         
        The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    3 In opening his oral submissions Mr A. J. Bellanto Q.C. for the applicant contended that the sentencing discretion miscarried in six respects:  
     
      
    1. A failure to evaluate the evidence of the applicant and to exercise a judgment on his credibility and reliability.  
     
      
    2. A failure to evaluate in any meaningful way submissions on behalf of the applicant. 
     
      
       
      It was said that these two failures resulted in the applicant’s role in the importation being unduly elevated, with the applicant having been given the appellation “principal” along with his elder brother Joseph Sukkar. 
      
    3. A failure adequately to discount the applicant’s sentence in respect of his plea of guilty. 
     
      
    4. A failure adequately to discount the applicant’s sentence in respect of his offer of assistance to prosecuting authorities. 
     
      
       
      It was said that these two failures were productive of an excessive sentence. 
       
      
    5. General manifest excessiveness of the sentence. 
     
      
    6. Excessiveness of the sentence on parity principles with co-accused. 
     
      
    4 Immediately after imposing the sentence under appeal the Sentencing Judge imposed on the applicant a further sentence of imprisonment for six years to date from 5 December 2001 and expire 4 December 2007, with a non-parole period of three years, for an offence under subs. 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). This sentence relates to an offence that between 23 November 2001 and 6 December 2001 the applicant offered for supply to Fred Nassif a large commercial quantity of MDMA. The application for leave to appeal does not relate to this sentence.  
     
      
    5 The Crown tendered a Statement of Facts which became Exhibit B. Some paragraphs in the Statement of Facts were not agreed, and were not put in evidence when the Statement was admitted as an Exhibit. However after argument and with minor modifications these paragraphs were admitted on terms which made them evidence of the facts, and it was left open to the applicant to dispute them by evidence. The paragraphs admitted on this limited basis were paragraph numbers 26, 27, 33, 37, 43 and 45; and several expressions in paragraph 43 as first tendered were modified. The Sentencing Judge set out the whole of the statement in his Remarks on Sentence, showing that he made findings accepting all the facts in the Statement including those which were disputed. The Statement is extremely detailed and it does not appear to me to be necessary to set it all out.  
     
      
    6 I will give a short summary of the facts in the following paragraphs. Hyeon Joon Choi (hereinafter Choi) formed a company called C J Trade Consultants Pty Limited (hereinafter the company) in 1999; the applicant, his brother Steven Sukkar and Choi were directors from 4 May 1999 until 28 January 2000. In 2001, Choi persuaded Simon Sunal Prasad (hereinafter Prasad) to assist him in an importation of MDMA tablets; Prasad engaged Morris Charles Shepherd (hereinafter Shepherd) to assist; and Choi proposed to pay Prasad and Shepherd $25,000 each for their assistance. Choi arranged for purchase and shipment of a pre-fabricated cool room from Belgium to Brisbane in the name of the company. Joseph Sukkar, also a brother of the applicant, travelled to Ukraine and arranged with persons in the Netherlands, who are not identified, for a quantity of MDMA tablets to be concealed within the cool room. The cool room has forty-eight modular plastic columns which were components of the cool room and approximately 480,000 MDMA tablets were concealed within tubes in the centres of the columns. The tablets weighed 123.6 kilograms and contained 34.4 kilograms of pure MDMA. The wholesale value in Australia has been estimated at $M7.2 to $M12 and retail at $M9.6 to $M33.6.  
     
      
    7 A shipping container containing the components of the cool room was consigned by sea from Antwerp to the company at Brisbane. Prasad and Shepherd took steps to obtain delivery of the importation, handle shipping documents, pay freight and charges, and arrange for payment of duties, clearance and delivery to Shepherd’s warehouse in Brisbane. Choi arranged for Prasad to inform Shepherd that a person referred to as Tom would assist Shepherd with unloading the shipping container on delivery at the warehouse, and that Tom would then take possession of the goods. (The person referred to as Tom is identified, but I do not give his name as he was acquitted at trial).  
     
      
    8 On 19 November 2001 at Petersham the applicant hired a Toyota van in a fictitious name for the purpose of collecting the MDMA tablets in Brisbane; on 20 November 2001 he exchanged the van for a larger truck and travelled to Brisbane. On the same day Customs officers in Brisbane examined the container, discovered the MDMA tablets, removed and replaced them mainly with substitute coloured tablets, but with about 13,000 of the genuine MDMA tablets mixed in. On 21 November 2001 Choi hired a car in Brisbane. The shipping container was delivered to Shepherd’s warehouse on 23 November 2001. Shortly afterwards Tom drove the truck which the applicant had hired to a place near the warehouse, met Shepherd and helped unload the container. The forty-eight columns and some other parts were loaded into the truck and Tom drove it away. The applicant and Choi observed these events from a distance in Choi’s hired car. The truck driven by Tom and the car driven by Choi, with the applicant as a passenger, travelled in convoy south, eventually to Sydney, and throughout the journey the applicant maintained intermittent telephone contact with Tom. Communications were made using a mobile phone, subscribed for in a fictitious name, which the applicant had provided to Tom. These communications were intercepted by police, and in the course of these communications the applicant demonstrated a precise knowledge of the contents of the shipping container and the manner in which the MDMA tablets had been concealed. The applicant spoke to Tom to confirm that Tom would open the correct crate, and also to confirm that it contained the correct number of columns, and the apparent absence of police interest.  
     
      
    9 The applicant was equipped with a forged driver’s licence which appeared to identify him by a name different to his own: he used this when stopped by police conducting random breath testing. The applicant exchanged vehicles with Tom near Kempsey and drove the truck from there to a house at Concord West (hereinafter the Concord house); he arrived there with the truck on 24 November 2001. This house was owned by the applicant’s brother Steven Sukkar and had been purchased several weeks earlier. The applicant’s brother Joseph Sukkar travelled from Vienna to Sydney and arrived on 23 November 2001. On 24 November 2001 the applicant and Joseph Sukkar were observed by police reversing the truck into the driveway of the house. Movements of the applicant, Steven Sukkar and Joseph Sukkar at the house were observed. The three brothers unloaded the columns from the truck and carried them into the garage, and then to a garden shed behind the garage. They opened one or more of the columns and discovered that most of the tablets were not MDMA. The applicant ate three of the substitute tablets to confirm that they did not contain narcotic substance. After discovery the applicant was observed meeting with Choi and then returning to the house; then movements of Steven Sukkar and Joseph Sukkar to and from the house were observed.  
     
      
    10 On 26 November 2001 the applicant and Joseph Sukkar returned the truck to the hiring company. Telephone intercepts on 26 November 2001 recorded the applicant speaking to persons about the missing MDMA tablets. In one conversation he said that he believed that the MDMA tablets had been stolen by someone in Belgium or Holland, and that he had lost $M7 worth of stock. In a telephone conversation with Choi, the applicant said that he wanted all the paperwork related to the movements of the container and the importation, which he described as “that work we were doing.” Further telephone conversations in which the applicant spoke to Choi were intercepted. Among other things the applicant said that he required documentary proof as to the time at which the container was delivered to Shepherd’s warehouse. He also expressed doubt and concern to Choi, and said that he and Joseph Sukkar were under a lot of pressure as a result of the loss, and that he had lost a fortune as $M10 worth of MDMA tablets had gone missing. Further telephone intercepts showed interest and concern of the applicant about assembling all paperwork related to the importation.  
     
      
    11 The applicant in conversation with Joseph Sukkar said that he was convinced that Choi was innocent, that it was impossible for the goods to be interfered with in Australia, and that he doubted that the police were responsible. The applicant and Steven Sukkar later spoke to Choi in the same telephone call. In an intercepted telephone conversation between the applicant and Steven Sukkar, Steven Sukkar said that he suspected that Choi was involved in the theft of the missing MDMA tablets and the applicant replied that he would kill Choi if that were true. Later the applicant said that the more he thought about it the more convinced he was that Choi was responsible for the loss of the MDMA tablets. 
     
      
    12 About 12.15pm on 2 December 2001 the applicant, with his brother Paul Sukkar as passenger, drove another hired truck to a warehouse in Granville, and stored the empty columns and other parts of the cool room. The applicant and Paul Sukkar returned to the Concord house with the empty truck; and set about separating the real MDMA tablets from the substitutes with Joseph Sukkar and Steven Sukkar. The applicant and Steven Sukkar then returned the hired truck, went back to the Concord house and resumed sorting and sifting the tablets. The applicant with his brothers discussed matters connected with the importation, including inflicting physical harm on Choi on his return from overseas. 
     
      
    13 On 3 December 2001 the applicant told Joseph Sukkar in an intercepted telephone call that he intended to ring Choi soon. In another telephone conversation that day Steven Sukkar told the applicant by telephone that he had spoken to a person who was prepared to recover $M5 from Choi at a cost of $500,000. In another telephone conversation that day the applicant told Steven Sukkar that he had recently been in contact with Choi and that Choi intended to return to Australia on 9 December 2001. 
     
      
    14 On 4 December 2001 the applicant met Joseph Sukkar and Anton El Hani (hereinafter El Hani), an associate of the unidentified persons in Europe, at the Concord house. The applicant was recorded stating that Choi had said that he was returning to Australia. Joseph Sukkar showed El Hani the substitute tablets, and said in the presence of the applicant that he did not have the heart to throw them away, and that the whole importation had been a disaster. In an intercepted telephone conversation on the same day the applicant spoke with Choi; Choi complained that the people he had hired for the importation were demanding payments and had been difficult to deal with; he asked the applicant what he should tell them; the applicant replied in terms which meant that the people he had hired should be told that they would probably not be paid until next week. 
     
      
    15 On 5 December 2001 the applicant again met with Joseph Sukkar and El Hani at the Concord house. That afternoon the applicant left the Concord house and was arrested. He was present when police forced access to the shed. When asked about the plastic bags containing substitute tablets with a few MDMA tablets the applicant said that he did not know how the bags came to be in the shed or what they contained. Most of the MDMA tablets which had been mixed with the substitute tablets were not located by police at the Concord house. The police on search found articles connected with the importation including small numbers of MDMA tablets and paperwork which the applicant obtained from Choi relating to the importation. 
     
      
    16 The paragraphs of Exhibit B which were not admitted, but which the Sentencing Judge must be taken to have found to be correct, were to the effect of the following six paragraphs:  
     
      
       
        
        26. [On the evening of 24 November 2001] the [applicant] was intercepted speaking by telephone to a person identified as Shane, in the course of which he spoke about the lost narcotics, indicating that he believed the narcotics had been stolen. There were supposed to have been about 500,000 tablets and “so basically we’ve had fourteen million worth of things go missing.” 
         
         
        27. On 25 November 2001, the [applicant] was intercepted speaking by telephone to Joseph Sukkar. Joseph Sukkar told him that he had spoken to persons in Europe concerning the missing narcotics, and that two or three persons were going to travel to Australia to investigate the matter. Joseph Sukkar indicated that the important thing [for] them to do now was to prepare for another importation. 
         
         
        33. About 10.30am [on 30 November 2001], the [applicant] and Joseph Sukkar continued their telephone conversation. The [applicant] said that he had spoken to Choi, and that the documents were available for collection at Choi’s office. He then asked in a coded fashion whether the Europeans proposed to send another shipment of narcotics. Joseph Sukkar replied that the next importation he proposed to be there and to do it personally with his own hands and eyes. The two men then again discussed the possibility that the police might be responsible for the substitution. However, the [applicant] discounted this because of the time that had elapsed since the delivery without any of them having been arrested. Finished, “…I could have moved it all ten times by now.”  
         
         
        37. On 2 December 2001, the [applicant], in company with Joseph Sukkar, hired another Toyota truck from Balmain Rentals which he then drove to his home at 84 Consett Street, Concord West. At about 10.40am, Steven Sukkar met with the [applicant] and Joseph Sukkar at Consett Street. Between about 11am and approximately 12.10pm, the offender and his three brothers removed forty-eight columns from the garden shed, then loaded all the empty columns and the four cool room doors into the back of the hire truck. During this process, the [applicant] was recorded as stating that, in his opinion, Choi had overstepped the mark this time, however the real MDMA tablets which the police had mixed with were still worth in excess of $200,000. 
         
         
        43. On 4 December 2001, the [applicant] was observed to drive to Choi’s office at 34/17-21 Henderson Street, Turrella, for the purpose of collecting additional importation documents and cash which Choi had promised the [applicant]. At 10.35am, the [applicant] was intercepted speaking by telephone to Choi. Choi complained that he had been unable to pay [Tom] and others to whom he owed money for their work in the importation. Choi asked “So what do I tell these people?” The [applicant] replied that Joseph Sukkar had no money, that “We all done our arse here, mate, you know we’re in the shit” and that Choi should tell them they will have to wait for their money. The [applicant] complained “I’m stilling trying to get the paperwork two weeks later. I tolf you two weeks ago, as soon as it happened, I said get all the paperwork together and I’m still trying to get it [from] you.”  
         
         
        45. At about 12.15pm [on 4 December 2001], the [applicant] was intercepted on a telephone speaking to Choi. The offender said that the people in Belgium were no longer coming to Australia and that he still wanted all the importation documents so as to satisfy them. Choi asked whether it was permissible to tell [Tom] and the others the true reason for the delay in payment. The offender stated “Yeah, I – we can’t pay them at the moment, you know. I’ll try and get some money. We haven’t got money, mate. What am I going to pay them with, paper? You know I haven’t got the money so, you know, now that they’re not coming, we’re going to sell all this shit out now and try to sell some of that stuff and we’ll have the money by the weekend, Monday, you know.” The reference to the “stuff” is a reference to the MDMA recovered from amongst the substitute tablets.  
        
       
      
    17 Much of the information in the Statement of Facts was based on the contents and interpretations of a large body of transcripts of intercepted telephone and other conversations; some overheard with listening devices. A large number of these transcripts was put in evidence.18 After referring to and setting out the terms of the Statement of Facts, in a way which makes it clear that his Honour found that this statement was correct, the Sentencing Judge commented that the offence was particularly serious as indicated by the prescribed penalty. His Honour also commented on the size of the importation, 123.6 kilograms in bulk containing 34.4 kilograms of MDMA; whereas the commercial quantity of MGMA is 500 grams. His Honour also noted that the estimate of the wholesale value was between $M7.2 and $M12, and that there were approximately 480,000 tablets of MDMA.  
     
      
    19 His Honour then referred to the role of the applicant and mentioned convictions, sentences and prosecutions of others concerned or allegedly concerned in the importation. The passages in the Remarks on Sentence which dealt with this subject are as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        The role of the offender. Several co-accused have been convicted and sentenced for this offence. They include Mr Simon Prasad, Steven Sukkar, Mr Antoun El Mr Choi and Mr Joseph Sukkar are awaiting trial. Mr Paul Sukkar has been convicted as Hani an accessory after the fact shall return to the issue of parity in sentence, but first, in relation to the roles played by each, it has been noted already that, in sentencing for offences of this nature, the Courts have often been at pains to identify the position of the person and the hierarchy that exists, or is presumed to exist, of those persons involved in the importation. But what is important is an assessment of what the offender has done in carrying out his role in the importation, rather than in trying to identify precisely the position of the offender in the hierarchy and endeavouring to achieve an exactitude in determining the appropriate sentence to accord with that position, see The Crown v [Olbrich] (1999) 199 CLR 270. 
         
         
        As to the specific role and conduct of the offender, the Crown relies upon the following facts and matters as indicative of the degree of criminality involved. I am satisfied that those matters are established on all of the objective evidence. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (1) On 20 November 2001, the offender hired a truck at Petersham which he made available to [Tom] for the purpose of transporting the narcotics from Brisbane to Sydney. 
         
         
        (2) The offender, Choi and [Tom] travelled to Brisbane where on 23 November 2001 he and Choi supervised, at a distance, the delivery of the shipping container and its unloading at Mr Shepherd's warehouse. The offender had precise knowledge of the contents of the container and the manner in which the drugs were concealed. 
         
         
        (3) The offender supervised the transport of the columns from Brisbane to Kempsey and thereafter exchanged vehicles with [Tom] and completed the transport of the goods to his home at 84 Consett Street, Concord West. 
         
         
        (4) On 24 November 2001, the offender, with the assistance of Steven Sukkar and Joseph Sukkar, unloaded the columns at Consett Street, opened one or more of the columns and tested three of the substitute tablets. Later, after the substitution was discovered, the offender met with Choi at a distance from his house and escorted him back to Consett Street. 
         
         
        (5) Between 25 November 2001 and 22 December 2001, the offender made available his premises at Consett Street for the continuing safe storage of the columns and substitute tablets and the real MDMA tablets which had been separated from the substitutes. 
         
         
        (6) On 2 December 2001, the offender, with the assistance of Joseph Sukkar, Steven Sukkar and Paul Sukkar emptied the remaining columns stored at Consett Street, and thereafter he and his brother separated approximately 14,000 genuine MDMA tablets from the substitute tablets. In the course of this process, the offender, with the assistance of Paul Sukkar, transported the empty columns to a secure location away from his house. 
         
         
        (7) Between 2 December 2001 and 5 December 2001, the offender continued to provide safe storage at Consett Street for the substitute tablets and the genuine narcotic tablets that had been successfully sorted and removed from the substitutes. 
         
         
        (8) Between 24 November 2001 and 5 December 2001, the offender, in concert with Joseph Sukkar and Steven Sukkar, made efforts to recover the lost narcotics, in particular by liaising with Choi in connection with obtaining all documents relating to the purchase of the cool room and the movement of the container in Australia, with a view to identifying where and how the supposed theft of the MDMA tablets had occurred. 
         
         
        I am satisfied that the offender was a co-principal, in [and] partner with his brother Joseph Sukkar, in the importation of the MDMA from Belgium. I agree with the Crown’s assertion as disclosed in the evidence, and not only from the telephone intercept and listening device material but on all of the objective facts, that he had special responsibility for (a) dealing with Choi, an accomplice and notional consignee of the shipment, (b) supervising the safe collection and delivery of the narcotics, and (c) providing safe storage of the narcotics prior to their sale and distribution. I do not accept that the offender was somehow answerable to John Choi or acting under his direction, and that he thereby played a lesser role, but rather, in my view, he was a principal offender and joint owner of the imported narcotics with his brother Joseph and others, and they acted in combination to carry out the importation and to share in the sale and distribution of the narcotics. The only distinguishing factor between himself and his brother Joseph is that it is clear that it was Joseph who had the connections with overseas suppliers, one being Mr El Hani, and it was he, Joseph Sukkar, who was able to source the drugs in Europe. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (I have read the expression “in partner” in the second sentence of the last passage as “and partner” as I regard this as an obvious correction).  
      
    20 The principal attack upon the sentencing decision related to views and findings expressed by the Sentencing Judge about the role of the applicant in the importation overall. It was contended by the applicant’s counsel, seemingly correctly, that paragraphs numbered 1 to 8 and some passages of findings were drawn exactly or almost exactly from a submission made on behalf of the Crown. I do not regard it as a ground of criticism that a Judge should, in giving judgment, adopt in terms some parts of a submission before him without rephrasing them. 
     
      
    21 Criticism was particularly levelled at findings relating to the part taken by the applicant in events in comparison with parts taken by other persons, especially Joseph Sukkar and Choi. In my opinion, the Sentencing Judge’s conclusion that the applicant was a co-principal and partner with Joseph Sukkar in the importation, with the distinguishing factor that it was Joseph Sukkar who had the connection with the overseas suppliers and was able to source the drugs in Europe, was well justified. Indeed it was a compelling conclusion on a whole view of the undisputed parts of the Statement of Facts, which in a number of places show the applicant to have been highly informed about matters of detail relating to the source, transportation, nature, size and packaging of the MDMA tablets, and to have spoken and behaved as if he personally had a proprietorial interest in the venture and stood to gain or to lose very large sums with its success or failure. The Statement of Facts depicts the applicant acting as a principal and acting as if he were an owner of the MDMA tablets imported. He was highly active, and his concern in the importation occupied him practically full-time for over fourteen days. 
     
      
    22 In the Sentencing Judge’s Remarks on Sentence, his Honour made a finding on and disposed of a factual issue which arose out of the Statement of Facts and the oral evidence given by the applicant about the relative positions of the applicant and Choi in the importation venture. It is not reasonably open to contention that the applicant had special responsibility for dealing with Choi, for supervising safe collection and delivery, and for providing safe storage at Concord prior to sale and distribution; nor is it reasonably open to debate that he acted as if he were the joint owner of the MDMA tablets, taking control of them, taking the most prominent part in unpacking them, sorting the genuine from the substitutes, testing substitutes by ingestion and delivering the genuine tablets for Choi to keep them. The applicant always had the intention that he would go on to a later stage to participate in disposing of the MDMA tablets dealt with in a different offence, and that he would receive part of the price, and be paid other money for his participation.23 The relative positions of the applicant and Choi and whether or not the applicant was in some way answerable to Choi or acted under his direction are not on a correct view of high importance when assessing an appropriate sentence; as is shown by the discussion in R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 in the leading judgment (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ) in the passage headed “The distinction between couriers and principals’” at 279-280, especially by paragraph 21: 
     
      
       
        
        Whether others stood to gain from the respondent’s conduct does not, it seems to us, affect what sentence should have been passed on him. That depended on what he had done and who he was, not on what others may have hoped to gain from his activity. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Much more important than positions in any hierarchy which might have existed is an assessment of what the applicant himself did.  
      
    24 In approaching the Sentencing Judge’s findings it is important to note his Honour’s reference to R v Olbrich and his Honour’s observations to the effect that what was important was an assessment of what the applicant did rather than identifying precisely his position in a hierarchy. In my view the Sentencing Judge’s observations show that he understood and correctly applied the passage in R v Olbrich.  
     
      
    25 Although the relevant positions of the applicant and Choi, to which much time and attention were given, both before the Sentencing Judge and on appeal, do not have the importance attributed to them, it is quite clear that the Sentencing Judge did not accept as a matter of fact that the applicant was in some way answerable to Choi or acted under his direction. It can be clearly understood, and is altogether clear from observations in the Remarks on Sentence, that the Sentencing Judge did not find the applicant’s evidence on this subject persuasive and hence did not accept it. The remainder of the findings in the passage I set out is fully justified by passages in the Statement of Facts which the applicant did not dispute.  
     
      
    26 On behalf of the applicant it was contended that the Sentencing Judge failed to address evidence of the applicant in relation to the extent of his knowledge. It was said that lengthy submissions were made to his Honour regarding the applicant’s role in the offences, that the applicant gave lengthy evidence, and that his Honour failed to address in any meaningful way those submissions or to evaluate the evidence of the applicant. It was said that the Sentencing Judge appeared to adopt the submissions advanced on behalf of the Crown without exercising a judgment that should normally be exercised where issues of credibility and reliability are before the Court. It was said that in this respect the sentencing discretion miscarried, and was open to re-exercise on appeal.  
     
      
    27 The applicant in his evidence was at pains to depict himself as taking a less prominent or subordinate role, in comparison with the roles of Choi, of Joseph Sukkar; and perhaps of others. It is correct, as his counsel submitted, that evidence relating to the applicant’s involvement does not show him participating any earlier than October 2001 by which time the importation was already on the water; there is no evidence that the applicant participated in negotiations with the suppliers in Europe, and the Trial Judge distinguished his position from that of Joseph Sukkar. In his evidence in chief (Appeal Book p116) the applicant stated: “Well [Choi] had to come and explain everything because I knew nothing about the importation. All I did was go to Brisbane and bring the drugs back to Sydney. I did not know the ins and outs of everything …” The transcript of a telephone conversation between the applicant and another participant on 24 November 2001 recorded among other things the applicant saying: “Yeah, so basically we’ve had $14,000,000 worth of things go missing” and “I’m the smallest player.” Other intercept transcripts between the applicant and Joseph Sukkar also show that dealings with and the identities of the European suppliers were within Joseph Sukkar’s knowledge and not within the applicant’s knowledge. In several respects Joseph Sukkar gave the applicant instructions about how to deal with aspects of the events; and the evidence shows the applicant conforming with such instructions.  
     
      
    28 In the course of his evidence the applicant affirmed that in his view he was the smallest player and gave his reasons, identifying whom he saw as the main players, and said that he did not have as much knowledge of the operation as Joseph Sukkar – “No, I hardly had any knowledge really” (Appeal Book 112). He stated that his participation in collecting paperwork relating to shipping arose from a request from Joseph Sukkar. The applicant’s Senior Counsel pointed to a number of aspects of the evidence which he contended supported the view that the role taken by Joseph Sukkar in the importation was at a higher level than that taken by the applicant. Counsel performed a similar review of evidence relating to the respective role of Choi in relation to that of the applicant; there were a number of respects in which Choi knew of or attended to aspects of the importation for which it was claimed that the applicant had no knowledge or no responsibility. It was to Choi and to arrangements with Choi that the applicant looked for any money to come to him out of his involvement, including payments specifically relating to his participation in collection and transport of the tablets when imported, and also arrangements for the applicant to sell what he understood was part of Choi’s share of twenty percent of the importation, and to receive part of the proceeds of sale, which he foresaw could be up to $100,000.  
     
      
    29 To my mind there is a marked contrast between the position of the applicant in the venture as depicted by his evidence, which shows him to be a person of small ability, bewildered and subordinate, and his position as it appears from the intercepted conversations. The transcripts show that he took an active and informed part in the importation as revealed by his participation in significant activities, including hiring vehicles, transportation of the tablets, his use of means of concealment of identity, his participation in unloading the tablets from the cool room columns, storage, disposition of the cool room columns, and telephone and other communications with persons involved. The transcripts also depict the applicant’s extensive knowledge of important aspects of the importation, particularly financial aspects, revealed by his conversations; his pursuit of paperwork relating to shipping and his professed interest in their contents, and the intensity of his interest in the size of the loss and in the prospects of vengeance against Choi. What the applicant said in evidence about his role has no inherent probability. His own depiction of his position is entirely irreconcilable with things which are objectively certain on other evidence.  
     
      
    30 Cross-examination of the applicant by counsel for the Crown was extensive, but not, on the face of the court transcript, altogether productive. In the context of what the applicant asserted in his evidence, I do not find it surprising that the Sentencing Judge rejected the applicant’s evidence out of hand. His evidence is so improbable that it had, in my opinion, little claim on the Sentencing Judge’s attention. The reasons which the Sentencing Judge gave make it plain that the applicant’s evidence was not accepted, and in the context including the nature of what had been asserted, a mass of other evidence including telephone intercept transcripts, and the course of the hearing and the challenges made in cross-examination, this should not reasonably have caused any surprise or sense of grievance. A close analysis of a body of material so markedly anomalous with agreed facts was not called for in the course of just disposition of the issues.  
     
      
    31 In a further submission Senior Counsel complained that the Sentencing Judge had not given reasons for rejecting the evidence of the applicant which tended to indicate that the applicant had a relatively minor role in the importation, and that the exercise of sentencing discretion was vitiated because the basis on which the evidence was not accepted had not been stated.  
     
      
    32 With respect to a sentencing decision, as for other decisions, fair disposition of proceedings usually requires that reasons be given for findings on facts significant for the outcome. The evidence of the applicant took some hours on three sitting days, and there were many challenges by counsel for the Crown cross-examining the applicant which it seems fair to say that the applicant withstood, without making much in the way of concession, in cross-examination. A contention that there was an error on the part of the Sentencing Judge in not stating reasons for not accepting the applicant’s assertions in evidence about his relative position attributes importance and centrality to those assertions which they do not have. The subject was incidental to the sentencing process and no more. Exposition is required of reasoning process on “…real and relevant issues of fact which are necessarily posed for judicial decision…” see Pettitt v. Dunkley [1971] 1 NSWLR 376 at 382 (Asprey JA); and see also Soulemezis v. Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247, Beale v Government Insurance Office of New South Wales (1997) 48 NSWLR 430. It is in my opinion necessary to guard against attribution of importance to an issue for the reason only that it is not mentioned in the judgment.  
     
      
    33 In my opinion the applicant’s many assertions in the course of his evidence to the effect that his part in the importation was relatively small did not have the importance which his counsel’s submissions attributed to them. Participation of the applicant in the importation, detailed in the findings of the Sentencing Judge was, on any view, quite important for the overall accomplishment of the importation, and it is to this rather than any apposition of the culpability of the applicant with that of Joseph Sukkar or of Choi that his Honour gave most of his attention. The statement in his Honour’s findings that the applicant was a co-principal and partner of Joseph Sukkar should not be elevated to some meaning which this statement does not bear; it is not a statement of overall equivalence of criminality, and it is really beyond question that the applicant was a principal, and a partner with Joseph Sukkar, no less so because, on the evidence before the Sentencing Judge, it should have been found, if those facts were relevant, that Joseph Sukkar took the more prominent position, and notwithstanding that (as was found) Joseph Sukkar managed parts of the importation which were not managed by the applicant. The same view applies to the supposed apposition between the participation of the applicant and Choi. 
     
      
    34 In my opinion there is no failure of procedural justice in respect of the degree of exposition of the reasons for findings on facts which were made by the Sentencing Judge. 
     
      
    35 In the course of his Remarks on Sentences the Sentencing Judge reviewed and dealt with matters set out in s.16A(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and referred to the considerations of general deterrence, severity appropriate in all the circumstance of the offence, and the absence of prior conviction; and also referred to the applicant’s expression of remorse, and to his contrition which the Trial Judge found was genuine. While dealing with contrition the Sentencing Judge found (Appeal Book 328) “True it is that there was an overwhelming prosecution case, but I do not think that that detracts from his obvious expression of remorse and of his contrition.” 
     
      
    36 The Sentencing Judge also took account into a Probation and Parole Service Pre-sentence Report prepared by Ms C A Perry, Probation and Parole Officer, which dealt with family and social factors affecting the applicant, including his employment history, gambling habit and drug usage. In relation to his attitude to offences it was reported: (at Appeal book 350)  
     
      
       
        
        Attitude to offences: Mr Sukkar stated that he pleaded guilty to the charges, saying that he was asked to pick up the drugs from Brisbane and store them in his garage. He said he did not know the quantity but that he just did it without asking questions. Mr Sukkar stated that he was promised $8,000 and needed the money to live on and pay gambling debts. He admitted that he did not consider the consequences and further stated that it is the worst thing he has done in his life and that it has ruined his life. 
        
       
      
    37 Under Summary and Sentencing Options Ms Perry reported:  
     
      
       
        
        Mr Sukkar presents as an unassuming and frank person whose life appears to have been de-stabilised by his separation/divorce. It is worth noting that whilst family members were convicted of cultivating marijuana when he was growing up, Mr Sukkar himself did not take up smoking marijuana until he was twenty. In addition, his current relationship is more conducive to his marijuana use and gambling and this does not augur well for him addressing these issues. During his incarceration he should seek help with his gambling and drug addictions. Upon release he may benefit from supervision and guidance of this Service. 
        
       
       
      The report then reviewed possible alternatives to a full-time custodial sentence.  
       
      
    38 When determining the sentence, the Sentencing Judge also took into account a further offence, possession of not less than the trafficable quantity of MDMA that may reasonably be suspected of being imported contrary to s 233B(1)(ca) of the Customs Act 1901; this is an offence pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914, and was related to the quantity of 52.1 grams of MDMA.39 The Sentencing Judge then went on to deal with the significance of the plea of guilty (Appeal Book 329): 
     
      
       
        
        Plea of guilty. The Crown contends that the offender's plea of guilty was entered on 28 March 2003, being in excess of fifteen months after his arrest and charge and only three days before his trial, which at that stage of proceedings was due to commence on 31 March 2003. The Crown contends that the offender's plea was not entered at the earliest reasonable opportunity and, moreover, was only entered after a trial date had been set, thus necessitating considerable preparation and expenditure of resources on the part of the prosecution. 
         
         
        Following his arrest on 5 December 2001, the accused was not initially cooperative and denied the charge. Amongst other charges, there was a charge of conspiracy. This was withdrawn on 26 June 2002. It would appear that he could not have pleaded guilty, certainly to that charge, prior to that date. It appears that thereafter his then legal advisers were negotiating a plea of guilty. I do not think the offender should be penalised for that. It appears that when he was represented by his current advisers he then entered a plea of guilty. I am satisfied that he had expressed a desire to plead guilty and he expressed a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. The question is when it could have first been reasonable for a plea to be entered. I am not satisfied that it was at the earliest opportunity, but in the circumstances I would assess the plea of guilty as warranting a discount in sentence of fifteen per cent. 
        
       
      
    40 Senior Counsel for the applicant contended that the discount for the plea of guilty of fifteen percent was too low having regard to the utilitarian value of the plea and the contrition expressed. 
     
      
    41 Evidence shows that the applicant through the solicitor then acting for him gave an indication on 17 February 2002 that he was prepared to plead guilty to the principal offence, subject to conditions. Then there were some communications between prosecuting authorities and the solicitor then representing the applicant, followed by some advice by his then solicitor, of which the applicant’s evidence was that but for that advice he would have pleaded guilty. Some months later the applicant changed his solicitor, and there seems to have been a long delay before he was seen by the new solicitor Mrs Evans, who represented the applicant by the time of the hearing. Mrs Evans was retained on 16 December 2002, and there was some difficulty in getting the files from the previous solicitor. After being advised by Senior Counsel, Mrs Evans opened discussions about providing assistance. The Chief Judge of the District Court made an appointment for the trial of the applicant and four other persons charged with offences relating to the importation to commence on 31 March 2003 and set aside three months. Communications proceeded of which the applicant’s Senior Counsel observed that the prosecuting authorities were on notice that there probably would be a plea of guilty; yet it was not until a very late stage, it would seem the trial date or some date very close to it, before there was an unqualified indication that there would be a plea of guilty. Counsel for the Crown observed that preparations for trial and marshalling of witnesses were required for the trial of the other persons, which proceeded. 
     
      
    42 In light of the evidence I see the Sentencing Judge’s consideration as quite adequate and his conclusion as giving no indication of any error. The plea of guilty could not be regarded as an early plea, and earlier indications that there might be a plea of guilty did not have any real significance as they were qualified, conditional or part of a continued and unresolved chain of communication. There is ample room for full and appropriate recognition of the applicant’s contrition, and of the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, in the discount of fifteen percent which the Sentencing Judge gave. 
     
      
    43 The Sentencing Judge dealt with the contention that an offer of assistance to the prosecuting authorities made by the applicant should lead to a reduction in sentence. In dealing with this subject the Sentencing Judge said: (Appeal Book 329-330)  
     
      
       
        
        Assistance. The question of assistance is in dispute. There is no dispute that the offender did make an offer of assistance. Overall it was assessed as being of no value. It was said that the information disclosed by Mr Sukkar has not resulted in the arrest of any person, nor have any other police inquiries been advanced as a result of the information provided. It appears that any discussions in relation to assistance broke down at an early stage due to the difference of opinion as to the role that he had played and over questions of veracity, but I would not dismiss the question of assistance entirely. There was in fact a practical benefit when a co-accused to the supply charge, that is, Mr Fred Nassif, pleaded guilty upon his learning the fact that the offender was prepared to give evidence against him. That is confirmed by Mr Nassif as one of the factors in his decision to plead guilty. Any trial of Mr Nassif was likely to have lasted for at least two weeks. 
         
         
        I do not assess the offer of assistance at a high level. Nevertheless, I do not think it is negligible, and there was a willingness in my view to assist the authorities. I think it answers the description of assistance, and some entitlement to discount is warranted. I would assess the combined effect of the plea of guilty and offer of assistance as warranting a reduction in sentence of twenty-five per cent. 
        
       
      
    44 The Sentencing Judge had earlier assessed the plea of guilty as warranting a discount in sentence of fifteen percent, suggesting that there was a further allowance of ten percent for assistance. It would be a mistake to infuse precision into the sentencing process; the process does not admit of precise expression in numbers and his Honour’s reasons mean that, taking the plea of guilty and the offer of assistance together, a reduction of twenty-five percent was warranted. The Sentencing Judge also made a discount of one-third under s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914. Section 16G had been repealed, and it was conceded by the Crown that because Shepherd a co-accused had been sentenced while s 16G was still in force the applicant should on a discretionary basis receive an equivalent benefit; and this was allowed. The Judge’s expressed reasoning was that the appropriate starting point was thirty-six years imprisonment; this was discounted by one-third or twelve years having regard to s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914; and the resulting period of twenty-four years was discounted by a further twenty-five percent for the plea of guilty and the offer of assistance. This produced a sentence of eighteen years imprisonment. 
     
      
    45 Senior Counsel for the applicant contended to the effect that the Sentencing Judge had not taken the correct view of the significance of the applicant’s offer of assistance because, on the correct view of the facts, the prosecuting authorities had not taken appropriate advantage of the offer of assistance because they took a wrong view about the value of the assistance which the applicant was in a position to give. After arrest the applicant declined to be formally interviewed and denied any knowledge of important facts relating to the offence. On 21 March 2003 solicitors representing the applicant wrote to an officer of the National Crime Authority referring to oral advice that the applicant would be prepared to give assistance to the Authority, and asked for arrangements for an interview “… in which our client would outline the material that he is prepared to provide assistance on, and then we can discuss the question of indemnity.” This led to an interview on 25 August 2003 at the Australian Crime Commission between the applicant and Detective Inspector Michael Birley (who was attached to the Commission). The applicant, in the presence of his solicitor and a Federal agent, spoke of the scope of evidence that he was prepared to give, principally in relation to a prosecution under State law against the applicant and Fred Nassif, and also relating to offences under Federal law.  
     
      
    46 Detective Inspector Birley formed the view that the information provided by the applicant was inconsistent with evidence that had been gathered throughout the investigation. After discussion police including Detective Inspector Birley decided not to take an induced statement at that point. On 18 February 2004 a letter from the Australian Crime Commission to the applicant’s solicitors confirmed that the offer of assistance was declined, and stated reasons. Part of the basis on which it was declined was a view to the formation of which Detective Inspector Birley was a party about the lack of value of any such assistance. In the account of events given by the applicant, particularly in evidence in the sentencing proceedings, all the MDMA tablets were removed from the columns on 24 November 2001 and were counted. The applicant, Steven Sukkar and Joseph Sukkar opened the columns on 24 November 2001; but Paul Sukkar was not present. The interpretation made by Detective Inspector Birley of investigation including intercepts available to him was that there was a further event on 2 December 2001 in which the applicant, Steven Sukkar, Joseph Sukkar and Paul Sukkar were present while columns were removed from the shed of the Concord house, and a number of columns which had not previously been opened were broken open, and tablets were removed from them.  
     
      
    47 When giving evidence in the sentencing proceedings the applicant said to the effect (Appeal Book 109) that on 24 November 2001 he unloaded quite a few columns and emptied them into plastic bags before Steven Sukkar arrived; and that the applicant got suspicious as the tablets did not look like real MDMA tablets to him. After he had unloaded about twelve of the forty-eight columns he rang Choi and Joseph Sukkar and told them there was something wrong. After Choi and Joseph Sukkar arrived the applicant continued unpacking and completed the process late that night . On about 29 November 2001 the applicant took the genuine MDMA tablets, separated out from the substitute tablets, to Choi’s office at Turella and left the tablets there. He also said (Appeal Book 122) to the effect that on 4 December 2001 Steven Sukkar wanted all the columns out of the Concord house; a truck was then hired, and the columns were taken out of the house, loaded on the truck and taken to a warehouse in Granville by Joseph Sukkar, Paul Sukkar and the applicant. The applicant said (Appeal Book 122) “So we did all that and then later on we sorted through it again to see if there was any other tablets and stuff.” The applicant’s evidence was to the effect that no more tablets were removed from the columns on 2 December 2001; although a few hundred tablets were found in the bags of substituted tablets which had been separated from the real MDMA tablets.  
     
      
    48 The applicant’s position was that the view that his information was unreliable and the rejection of his offer of assistance were based on a wrong view of what in fact had happened about removing the tablets from the columns, and on a wrong view about the applicant’s veracity. It was contended that the Sentencing Judge had not given appropriately detailed consideration to the question of assistance, and had not properly assessed the evidence relevant to assistance. The applicant contended that accordingly the sentencing discretion miscarried, resulting in an inadequate discount for the offer of assistance. 
     
      
    49 The Sentencing Judge did not express any conclusion about the applicant’s veracity in the information about the events of removing the tablets from the columns, or about whether Detective Inspector Birley’s view on the usefulness of the offer of assistance was soundly based. The Sentencing Judge identified a practical benefit which arose from the fact that the applicant was prepared to give evidence against Fred Nassif, and found that there was a willingness to assist the authorities, and that there were some entitlements to a discount. The Sentencing Judge decided in effect that a discount was warranted.50 In R v Wai Thung Chu (NSWCCA, 16 October 1998, unreported) Spigelman CJ observed that the Court of Criminal Appeal has often emphasised that there is no fixed tariff for the provision of assistance to prosecuting authorities and that customarily in New South Wales, discounts range from twenty to fifty percent. The Chief Justice reviewed several then recent decisions in which a discount had been made for assistance, and of R v. Lawson (NSWCCA, 12 December 1997, unreported) in which a discount of fifty percent for assistance had been made. The Chief Justice then observed “It is common ground that the significance of the assistance was very high in the case of Rozic and also it appears that, but for the assistance that the applicant gave in the controlled delivery, the apprehension of Rozic may not have occurred.”  
     
      
    51 In Gallagher v R (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 226-230 Gleeson CJ gave extended consideration to elements in the sentencing process referred to as discount including (at 228E and following) discounts which give credit for assistance to authorities. Gleeson CJ showed, with supporting references, that discounts are discretionary, and that there is no binding tariff. Gleeson CJ concluded his observations by saying at 230C-D: 
     
      
       
        
        Even in cases where, as a matter of legitimate discretionary decision, a judge decides to give a specified discount it is essential to bear in mind that what is involved is not a rigid or mathematical exercise, to be governed by ""tariffs"" derived from 
         
        other and different cases but, rather, one of a number of matters to be taken into account in a discretionary exercise that must display due sensitivity towards all the considerations of policy which govern sentencing as an aspect of the administration of justice. 
        
       
      
    52 To my mind there is a distinction of some significance between assistance actually given to prosecuting authorities, and assistance which an offender was willing to give to prosecuting authorities, but did not give because the authorities did not regard it as useful, or because some other reason or circumstances defeated the giving of assistance. The cases of which Spigelman CJ spoke, in which discounts in the range of twenty to fifty percent have been given, are cases where assistance actually was given. Assistance which an offender wishes to give, but the prosecuting authorities do not feel that they should accept, does not have the same claim for discretionary allowance of a discount. It was, in my view, relevant and appropriate for the applicant to give evidence of circumstances which defeated his readiness to give assistance, but no examination by the Court of those circumstances can elevate the assistance which in his concept he was ready to give to the same claim for discount as assistance which was actually rendered, perhaps in the form of participating in entrapment of other offenders, perhaps in the form of giving evidence in Court and standing challenge on it, or in other ways. An offer which actually goes through the fire of a trial has a far stronger claim than assistance which an offender was prepared to but was not called upon to give. 
     
      
    53 A claim for a discount for an offer of assistance necessarily requires an assessment to be made of the practical value of the assistance; if it had no practical value, or relatively little practical value, that must have an impact on its significance, although it leaves the offer of assistance under consideration as an indication of contrition. Overall it appears to me that the applicant’s offer of assistance potentially had some practical value, although the prosecution did not take advantage of it. The Sentencing Judge was aware of this, and said: “I do not assess the offer of assistance at a high level” which I regard as a reasonable appraisal of its practical significance. His Honour took the offer of assistance into account so as to give it significant value in the reasoning process, leading to a discount of ten percent on the sentence, which was quite a high discount in the circumstances. In my opinion no error has been shown in the Sentencing Judge’s treatment of the discount for assistance to prosecuting authorities. 
     
      
    54 In connection with the contention that the sentence imposed was excessive counsel referred to questions of parity, and to sentences imposed on other persons concerned in the same importation. When the applicant’s sentence was passed Joseph Sukkar was awaiting trial; we were informed that at the time of the appeal hearing Joseph Sukkar had pleaded guilty and that his sentencing hearing was to take place in July 2005. We were not told to what offence exactly Joseph Sukkar pleaded guilty but it would seem to be the same offence as that to which the applicant pleaded guilty. Neither before the Sentencing Judge nor before us did any decision relating to Joseph Sukkar come under consideration on a question of parity. The Sentencing Judge did not engage in an exercise of comparison with any sentence imposed upon Choi or Joseph Sukkar, neither of whom had then been sentenced; for this reason appraisal of the applicant’s culpability relative to theirs is not of prominent importance. The Trial Judge’s findings, in the last part of the passages I set out, do not indicate that his Honour decided that the applicant should receive punishment appropriate to Joseph Sukkar or to Choi. 
     
      
    55 Shepherd’s participation in the offence was that he cleared the container through Customs, took delivery to his warehouse and handed over possession for the goods to be trucked to Sydney; Shepherd was sentenced to imprisonment for eleven and one half years with a non-parole period of seven years and four months. El Hani, who was found to be a senior person in the organisation and played an important managerial role when the MDMA tablets had been substituted, was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment with a non-parole period of ten years. Prasad who participated in obtaining Customs clearance, delivery and recruitment of Shepherd was sentenced to fourteen years with a non-parole period of eight years and eight months. Steven Sukkar was sentenced to imprisonment for fourteen years with a non-parole period of nine years; at the time of argument of the present application Steven Sukkar’s appeal against that sentence was under reserved judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal; the sentence was affirmed on appeal by majority on 16 March 2005. Having regard to the part taken by the applicant in the importation I do not think that any question of parity should have much influence on the outcome. 
     
      
    56 I recognise that the sentence imposed on the applicant, who had no prior convictions, was a very severe one. The considerations of pressing importance in appraising whether this Court should intervene are the enormous size of the importation and the intensity of the applicant’s activities in transporting the tablets and unpacking them, the large financial advantage which he expected to gain and the intensity and continuance, in all for about two weeks, of his activities directed to turning the importation to the best account possible; in the course of which he was very active and took the leading part in counting, testing, storing and handling the tablets. His involvement was intense, whether or not it can be said of other persons that their involvement was equally or more intense, or equally or more efficacious. In the circumstances I am of the view that the Court of Criminal Appeal should not disturb the sentence imposed, but should order: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
        
       
       (2) Appeal dismissed.

      Facts 
      
     
     
      
      The Appellant was erratically driving a stolen car at excessive speed when he collided head on with a car driven by a woman who was 38 weeks pregnant. She was taken to hospital, an emergency caesarean was performed and a male infant in poor condition was delivered. The infant was pale and limp, but had a heartbeat. The infant maintained a heartbeat and continued to breathe, with the assistance of mechanical ventilation, for approximately two hours after delivery. Approximately an hour after delivery brain tests showed that there was little or no electrical activity in the baby’s brain. Approximately two hours after the baby was delivered it was pronounced dead when a heartbeat could not be detected. The Appellant submitted that the baby was not born alive, and therefore was not capable of being the subject of a manslaughter charge.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: On 4 April 2002 the Appellant was driving a stolen vehicle in Fairfield, Sydney, at excessive speed and in an erratic manner. After colliding with a car travelling in the same direction the Appellant’s vehicle crossed the double white lines and collided head-on with a car driven by Mrs My Nghi Vongratsavai, who was 38 weeks pregnant. Following her arrival at Liverpool Hospital, an emergency caesarean was performed on Mrs Vongratsavai and a male infant in poor condition was delivered, subsequently named Mathew Joseph Vongratsavai. The delivery occurred at 11.48am. Mathew was pronounced dead exactly two hours later at 13.48pm. 
     
      
    2 The Appellant was charged with a number of offences including, manslaughter and an alternative count of driving in a manner dangerous causing death, both in the aggravated and non-aggravated form. He pleaded not guilty to these charges. He elected for a trial by judge alone, pursuant to s132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Ellis DCJ found the Appellant guilty of manslaughter.  
     
      
    3 Where an offence involving killing or death of a newly born child arises as an element of a criminal offence, there is a long-established common law rule that the element cannot be established unless the baby was “born alive”. The issue that arises in this case is what is meant by the words “born alive”? 
     
      
    4 It was the Crown case, both at first instance and in this Court, that Mathew was fully issued forth from his mother and lived independently of her for two hours before he died, albeit supported by mechanical respiration. The baby was, it was submitted, a person within the law. 
     
      
    5 The Appellant’s case was that the baby was not born alive and did not live independently. The primary basis of the submission was the lack of, or paucity of, evidence that the baby breathed independently. The Appellant submitted that the presence of a heartbeat, which did exist, was not enough for the baby to have been born alive for purposes of the common law rule. Alternatively, in this Court, the Appellant relied on the absence of or paucity of evidence of the baby’s brain function. Accordingly, it was submitted, the Appellant did not cause the death of another person. 
     
      
    6 I will set out below the objective medical evidence of what was detected or observed with respect to the baby during the two hours after the caesarean section. I will also set out the medical opinion evidence given at the trial. 
     
      
    7 The issues on appeal are stated by the Appellant to be: whether Ellis DCJ correctly directed himself upon the matter of whether the deceased was ever “alive”; whether the possibility that the deceased was already dead upon delivery could be excluded and the sufficiency of evidence relating to this matter. 
     
      
    8 The Appellant was convicted both of manslaughter of Mathew and of the offence of aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm to the mother. If the appeal on manslaughter were to be allowed, the Crown seeks to appeal from the alleged inadequacy of the sentence on the dangerous driving charge. It has indicated that it would abandon that appeal if the manslaughter appeal were rejected. It is, as will appear, unnecessary to deal with the Crown appeal, which the Court will record as having been abandoned. 
     
      
       
      The Decision of the Trial Judge 
       
      
    9 The crucial factual finding of Ellis DCJ, on the basis of the medical evidence, was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I find that Mathew did breathe, albeit with the assistance of a respirator, and that his lungs functioned in that they oxygenated his blood. I find that Mathew had a heartbeat for almost two hours after delivery.” 
        
       
      
    10 On the basis of this finding the issue in the case is a legal one: i.e. for purposes of the “born alive” rule is it necessary that an infant must live independently in a sense other than that which his Honour held to be sufficient? 
     
      
    11 His Honour determined the issue of law adversely to the Appellant.  
     
      
    12 He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[51] … a newborn baby is born alive or lives when it is fully extruded from its mother and is living by virtue of the functioning of its own organs with or without medical stimulus or assistance. 
        
       
       
        
        [52] The Court further finds that a newborn is living by virtue of the functioning of its own organs when it breathes with or without assistance or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscle whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached and regardless of whether such function has been achieved by medical assistance or stimulus.” 
        
       
      
    13 His Honour’s finding on the facts, set out above, was that there was both heartbeat and respiration, albeit that the respiration was assisted. On his Honour’s legal analysis, either of these matters would lead to the conclusion that the baby was born alive. 
     
      
    14 His Honour concluded that Mathew Vongratsavai lived independently of his mother for a period of approximately two hours. He died from injuries suffered in utero, arising from the partial abruption of the placenta suffered by his mother. 
     
      
    15 The objective medical evidence before his Honour indicated the following: 
     
      
    · Immediately after Mathew’s birth a heartbeat was audible by stethoscope at an estimated heart rate of 60. 
     
      
    · Manual cardiac massage commenced at less than one minute after birth and continued until 10 minutes. A heart rate was detected at one minute, but no heart rate was detected at five minutes or seven minutes. 
     
      
    · 10 minutes after birth, and again at 12 and 20 minutes, a heart rate of 100 was detected. Later a heartbeat of 112 was detected. 
     
      
    · Blood pressure was low but recordable, indicating blood circulation. 
     
      
    · Immediately after birth the baby was intubated and artificial respiration commenced. 
     
      
    · 12 minutes after birth the baby was transferred to a humidity crib and to a machine ventilator. 
     
      
    · There was no pause between manual and machine ventilation and the baby never breathed unassisted. 
     
      
    · Approximately an hour after birth an electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to measure electrical activity in the baby’s brain. An isoelectric or flat trace was indicated. 
     
      
    16 The trial judge had a conflict of medical evidence before him between Dr Jacqueline Stack, a neonatologist and paediatrician, who took over care of Mathew immediately after delivery and Professor John Hilton, an Associate Professor of Pathology at the University of Sydney, who gave evidence for the accused.  
     
      
    17 His Honour summarised the medical evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Dr Stack held strongly to the view that Mathew lived after delivery and until shortly before she pronounced life extinct at 1.48pm. In her view it is not necessary for all organs to be functioning in order for a child to be alive. She gave examples of children born with congenital malformation, including missing organs and in some cases even a missing cortex. Anencephalic babies (those born without a cortex) have, in her personal experience, survived for up to five days without a functioning cortex. In her medical opinion these babies are born alive and live for a short period. 
        
       
       
        
        Dr Stack opined that life existed whenever there was a heart rate and circulation. It was in her opinion that unassisted breathing was not a pre-requisite to the existence of life. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Associate Professor Hilton gave evidence that the medical profession is divided on the issue of what is necessary to establish that life exists in a foetus/new born. He indicated that there was one school of thought that required a child to physiologically fend for itself without artificial support such as a respirator. That there was no evidence of spontaneous breathing led the Professor to opine that that cast doubt in his mind that Mathew was born in a living state. 
        
       
       
        
        I suggested to Associate Professor Hilton that if spontaneous breathing was required before a new born could be regarded as alive then no new born who had been placed on a ventilator, as part of good medical management, would be alive until the ventilator was turned off and they breathed unassisted. His response was ‘That is a view. And it is a view which I’ve expressed. I’m not necessarily saying that I very firmly adhere to this view but it is a legitimate view that is worthy of consideration’.” 
        
       
      
    18 The thrust of Professor Hilton’s evidence was that the existence of a heartbeat was not a sufficient test of whether a person was alive. He proposed a test of “independent existence” which he explained as “the child being able to … physiologically fend for itself without artificial support such as being on a respirator”. In the context of this case the test required “independently functioning breathing”, which was not established. The presence of a heartbeat was insufficient. 
     
      
    19 His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept and adopt the opinion Dr Stack that Mathew Vongratsavai lived independently of his mother for a period of approximately two hours.” 
        
       
       
      Submissions on Appeal 
       
      
    20 The primary thrust of the Appellant’s written submissions was to repeat the submissions made to Ellis DCJ to the effect that beating of the heart was insufficient and that unassisted breathing was also required to be present. The Appellant challenged his Honour’s test, which accepted that any sign of life was sufficient and submitted that his Honour misdirected himself or, alternatively, that the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported. I will deal with these submissions below under the heading “The Born Alive Rule”. 
     
      
    21 In oral submissions, the Appellant placed primary emphasis on the proposition that a person cannot, in the eyes of the law, be both “alive” and “dead” at the same time and relied on the statutory definition of death in s33 of the Human Tissue Act 1983, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “33 For the purposes of the law of New South Wales, a person has died when there has occurred: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) irreversible cessation of all function of the person’s brain; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) irreversible cessation of circulation of blood in the person’s body.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    22 In this Court, but not before the trial judge, the Appellant relied on the absence of adequate evidence of brain activity. As noted above the EEG taken an hour after birth indicated a flat line. However, the EEG did not measure subcortical structures underneath the cortex or in the brain stem. Dr Stack expressed the opinion, albeit in a tentative manner, that the presence of a heartbeat and of blood circulation indicated that some part of the brain stem was functioning. There was also evidence that 22 percent of children survived after an EEG that indicated a flat line. 
     
      
    23 Although there was some evidence of brain function after birth, it was not of so definitive a character as to overcome the possibility that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. If brain activity had to be established, which I do not believe to be the case, the outcome of this appeal could have been different. 
     
      
    24 The Appellant submits that the definition of death in the Human Tissue Act should be adapted to the born alive rule with the result that evidence of brain functioning is an essential part of the Crown case. I will deal with these submissions below under the heading “The Proposed Brain Death Rule”. 
     
      
       
      The Born Alive Rule 
       
      
    25 The “born alive” rule can relevantly be traced back to the 17th century. (See Regina v Sims (1601) Goulds 174, 75 ER 1075; Sir Edward Coke, 3 Institutes, (1797) at 50; Blackstone’s Commentaries, (13th ed) (1809) at 197-198; Forsythe, “Homicide of the Unborn Child: The Born Alive Rule and Other Legal Anachronisms”, (1987) 21 Valparaiso Uni L Rev; Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed) Vol II (1) par 427; Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law (7th ed) (1992) at 328-330. There is a small but significant body of case law, related texts and articles which I will discuss below. 
     
      
    26 The born alive rule was applied in a number of distinct areas of the common law, including, relevantly, the law of homicide, where it had considerable practical significance in distinguishing the misdemeanour of procuring an abortion from the felony of homicide. (See, e.g. Stephen A History of the Criminal Law of England Macmillan, London, (1883) Vol III p2.) 
     
      
    27 The rule consists of two distinct components. First, that the foetus must have completely left its mother’s body (although the umbilical cord did not have to be cut, see R v Trilloe (1842) Car & M 650, 175 ER 674). Secondly, the child must be alive at or after birth, in that sense, had occurred. The case law does not always clearly distinguish between the two elements. This appeal is concerned with the second limb of the rule.  
     
      
    28 In Australia, the rule was stated by Barry J in his Honour’s charge to the jury in R v Hutty [1953] VLR 338 at 339 (to which Ellis DCJ referred): 
     
      
       
        
        “Murder can only be committed on a person who is in being, and legally a person is not in being, until he or she is fully born in a living state. A baby is fully and completely born when it is completely delivered from the body of its mother and it has a separate and independent existence in the sense that it does not derive its power of living from its mother. It is not material that the child may still be attached to its mother by the umbilical cord: that does not prevent it from having a separate existence. But it is required, before the child can be the victim of murder or manslaughter or infanticide, that the child should have an existence separate from and independent of its mother, and that occurs when the child is fully extruded from the mother’s body and is living by virtue of the functioning of its own organs.” 
        
       
      
    29 The rule remains the law in Australia and has been applied in this Court. (See R v F (1996) 40 NSWLR 245 esp at 247-248 per Grove J.) 
     
      
    30 There is a body of commentary on the born alive rule upon which I have drawn to identify the relevant case law and to understand the development, scope and purpose of the rule. (In addition to the references set out above, I have had regard to Taylor, Medical Jurisprudence (7th ed) John Churchill, London 1861; Atkinson, “Life, Birth and Live Birth” (1904) 20 LQR 159; Davies, “Child Killing in English Law” (1937) 1 Mod L Rev 203; Barry, “The Child en Ventre sa Mère” (1941) 14 ALJ 351; Winfield, “The Unborn Child” (1942-1944) 8 Cambridge LJ 76; Glanville Williams, The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law Forbes, London 1958 pp 19-23; Louise Westerfield, “The Born Alive Doctrine: a Legal Anachronism” (1976) 2 Southern Uni L Rev 149.) 
     
      
    31 The law presumed that all children were born dead and the fact of live birth had to be established by evidence. (See Taylor (1861) at 411; Atkinson (1904) at 134; Forsythe (1987) at 590.) Usually such proof was not difficult, but problems arose when a child died soon after birth and there was no, or little, direct evidence of what had happened at or immediately after birth. 
     
      
    32 The born alive rule is based on two anachronistic, indeed antiquated, factors. First, the primitive state of medical knowledge at the time that it was adopted. Second, the related fact that birth was a process fraught with risk until comparatively recently and, accordingly, there was a high probability that a stillbirth had natural causes.  
     
      
    33 At the time the rule was adopted, there were considerable difficulties in establishing that the foetus was alive at the time of the allegedly criminal act, and that the child would have lived but for the act. (See Commonwealth v Cass, 467 N.E 2d 1324 (Mass, 1984) at 1328; Taylor supra at 411; Winfield supra at 78 referring to a 1348 case and to Staunford’s Plees del Coron published in 1557; Forsythe supra at 575-576 and fn 58.) 
     
      
    34 The rudimentary state of medical knowledge is reflected in observations made in 1904 (Atkinson (1904) at 142), in the most thorough review of the authorities until that time: 
     
      
       
        
        “To establish the existence of a legal personality ‘occular demonstration’ of a physiological token of vitality, however curtailed must be exhibited, after a child is born into the world … Should the child soon die, someone (often it is not a medical man) must be present and observe both the birth and a subsequent clear vital act,  
        otherwise there can be no reliable evidence of live birth, for an expert can here certify few opinions 
        .” [Emphasis added.] 
        
       
      
    35 And at 149: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … indirect proof of live birth precedent to speedy death is  
        of a nature practically impossible to medical science  
        …” [Emphasis added.] 
        
       
      
    36 The position is now totally transformed. Information about the vitality of the foetus is now readily available. 
     
      
    37 The second basis for the born alive rule was the prevalence of stillbirths. It is for this reason that the common law developed a presumption that a baby was born dead and evidence was required to prove live birth. 
     
      
    38 Statistics on this matter are not available until well after the born alive rule was adopted. However, the anecdotal evidence is overwhelming and is supported by such quantitative information as is available. Authoritative 19th century texts in medical jurisprudence reported studies that indicated stillbirths comprised some 4-5 percent of all births. (J Chitty, A Practical Treatise on Medical Jurisprudence Vol 1 (1834) p412; Taylor supra at 480-481.) 
     
      
    39 Until this century, statistics did not distinguish stillbirths from infant mortality. In England these figures were first separated in the late 1920’s. At that time about 4 percent of all births were stillbirths. This began to decline in the 1940’s so that in recent decades stillbirths have been only 0.5 percent of total births. (See www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/ xsdataset.asp?More=Y&vlnk=7981&All=Y&B2.x=84&B2.y=10. ) 
     
      
       
      
    40 The case law does not suggest that there is a common law definition of what constitutes ‘life’ for the purposes of the born alive rule. The issue is one of fact for the tribunal of fact, relevantly, in the case of serious crime, the jury. Medical evidence has usually been of central significance. Such evidence has often included evidence of direct observation, as well as inferences drawn from post mortem examination. 
     
      
    41 The evidentiary basis of the born alive rule was indicated as early as 1537 when a court pronounced “crying is but a proof of life”. (See Atkinson supra at 154.) In the earliest modern authority (R v Sims supra at 1076, in which Sir Edward Coke appeared as Attorney General) the court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… for if it be dead born it is no murder for  
        non constat  
        (it does not necessarily follow)  
        whether the child were living at the time of the batterie or not; or if the batterie was the cause of the death,  
        but when it is born living, and the wounds appeare in his body, and then he dye, the batteror shall be arraigned of murder,  
        for now it may be proved whether these wounds were the cause of the death or not 
        , and for that if it be found, he shall be condemned.” [Emphasis added, translation inserted.] 
        
       
      
    42 Similarly, in R v Boulton (1833) 5 Car & P 537, 172 ER 1088, the judge directed the jury at 998: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whether the child was born alive or not depends mainly on the evidence of the medical men.” 
        
       
      
    43 The analysis of the evidentiary basis of the rule by Forsythe (1987) supra is compelling. (See esp at 564-565, 575-577, 590, 586, 589, 590, 605-507. See also Atkinson supra at 134, 146-150.) 
     
      
    44 As in other cases, the medical evidence in R v Hutty supra at 339 and 342, to the effect that the child lived after being fully extruded, was left to the jury as an issue of fact without a direction of law as to what constituted life. 
     
      
    45 The evidentiary basis of the born alive rule must be kept in mind in order to understand the case law. In each reported case there is a particular constellation of evidence which was relied upon to establish whether or not the particular child was alive at or after birth. The observations made by judges, including directions to the jury, in each case must be understood in the context of the particular evidence in the case. For that reason, the observations and directions are not necessarily reconcilable. 46 As an issue of fact, live birth can be proven by many different overt acts including crying, breathing, heartbeat, etc. The case law does not support the Appellant’s contention that unassisted breathing must exist before a baby can be said to have been born alive.  
     
      
    47 Evidence of breathing independently of the mother will be evidence that a child was born alive. (See R v Handley (1875) 13 Cox CC 79 where there was evidence of “the inflated condition of the lungs”. See also Rance v Mid Downs Health Authority (1991) 1 QB 587 at 621, construing the words “born alive” in a specific statutory context.) 
     
      
    48 In R v Handley, Brett J in a direction to the jury identified a test of “born alive” in terms of “whether it existed as a live child, breathing and living by reason of breathing through its own lungs alone, without deriving any of its living or power of living by reason of its connection with the mother”. However, in that case the medical evidence was directed only to the question of breathing: “the medical opinion came to this, that the child was full born, was born alive, and from the inflated condition of the lungs had lived for an hour or more” (at 80).  
     
      
    49 When Brooke J applied the test in Rance at 621, he drew on the observations of Sir John Donaldson MR in C v S (1988) QB 135 where his Lordship said at 151, with respect to the statutory formulation “capable of being born alive”: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … the foetus … would be incapable of ever breathing either naturally or with the aid of a ventilator. It is not a case of a foetus requiring a stimulus or assistance. It cannot and will never be able to breathe.” 
        
       
       
      In the case before this Court, breathing did occur with assistance.  
       
      
    50 I agree with the observations of Girvan J who, referring to Handley and Rance, said in R v McDonald (unreported, 4 March 1999, Crown Court of Northern Ireland, appeal on other grounds dismissed): 
     
      
       
        
        “For my own part I read both Brett J and Brooke J references to breathing through the lungs alone as pointing to a distinction between the case of a foetus still connected to its mother (who breathes for the child) and the case of a baby whose breathing, whether assisted or not, is through its lungs, being the anatomical mechanism through which oxygen passes into the body. Support for this view can be found in the judgment of Sir John Donaldson MR in C v S [1987] 1 All ER 1230 at 1242 where he pointed out in that case that the foetus would be incapable ever of breathing either naturally or with the aid of a ventilator. Many premature babies survive into normal life after a period of assisted breathing and it would nonsensical to suggest that while breathing in this assisted form the child is not alive. Accordingly I reject the arguments that to prove that if a child is capable of being born alive it must be proved that it is able to breath unassisted through its lungs.” 
        
       
      
    51 Similarly, the Supreme Court of New York rejected a submission that a baby who had collapsed lungs and had immediately been placed on a respirator was not born alive. The Court said in People v Hall 158 A.D.2d 69, 557 N.Y.S.2d 879 (1990): 
     
      
       
        
        “Defendant, additionally, appears to advance the novel proposition that someone who requires the assistance of modern medical technology to survive, even temporarily, is not really alive. However, it is unclear whether this theory is to be applied only to the newborn or to all people irrespective of age. Perhaps defendant is suggesting that only those persons who have first been the beneficiaries of good health can be considered alive if they subsequently develop medical problems necessitating technological intervention but that sick babies are not fully alive until they recover or their condition improves both significantly and permanently (Atallia did get better before she developed Hyaline Membrane Disease). In short, defendant seems to claim that although Atallia may not have been completely dead at birth, she was not sufficiently alive to be deemed a ‘person’ under  
        Penal Law 125.00 
         et seq. This position in untenable. Illness is not equivalent to the absence of life, and the fact that Atallia was very sick at birth scarcely means that she was not alive. Notwithstanding defendant’s concerted attempt to depict her as the victim of a feticide, resulting in a miscarriage or stillbirth, she was, by any reasonable measure, born alive.” [Footnotes omitted.] 
        
       
      
    52 Post-mortem evidence that a dead child must have breathed is not accepted as determinative. Sometimes the evidence was that a child may have breathed before it was fully born. (See, e.g. R v Poulton (1832) 5 Car & P 329, 172 ER 997; R v Enoch (1933) 5 Car & P 539, 172 ER 1089; Atkinson supra at 140-141; Davies supra at 207.) In other cases the evidence was that children may not breathe for a time after being born alive. (See R v Brain (1834) 6 Car & P 349, 172 ER 1272; Taylor (1861) supra 420-424.) Glanville Williams accepted that proof of breathing was not essential (Williams (1958) supra at pp 21-22). 
     
      
    53 In New South Wales s20 of the Crimes Act 1900 provides that a child is taken to have been born alive if “it has breathed and has been wholly born into the world”. This is a specific provision confined in its application to a trial for murder of the child. There is no warrant for applying this modification of the common law to other crimes. 
     
      
    54 The born alive rule has never encompassed a requirement of viability in the sense of the physiological ability of a newly born child to survive as a functioning being. The case usually cited as authority for this proposition is R v West (1848) 2 Car & P 784, 2 Cox CC 500, 175 ER 329, where the trial judge directed the jury that it could convict of murder where an attempt at abortion had led to a premature birth and the baby died because it was too weak to survive. (See Taylor supra at 413-414, Atkinson supra at 135; Barry supra at 356; Forsythe supra at 569-570. 
     
      
    55 A number of older cases turned on the proposition that a child must have an “independent circulation”. (See, e.g. R v Enoch supra; Atkinson supra 143-144.) This may have been a test referable to first limb of the born alive rule, i.e. whether the child had completely left its mother’s body. See e.g. “before it was fully born, so as to have an independent circulation” (R v Wright (1841) 9 Car & P 754, 173 ER 1039; Davies supra at 208) and independent circulation was described as “the test of separate existence” (R v Pritchard (1901) 17 TLR 310 at 311.) The case law referring to independent circulation also reflected the deficiency of contemporary medical knowledge. The evidence on which it was based derived from the incorrect assumption, no doubt reflected in the medical evidence in each such case, that the mother’s blood flowed through the foetus. (See Atkinson supra at 144-145; Davies supra at 207; Williams (1958) supra at p 20; Forsyth supra at 597-599, esp fn 165, 602-603.) However, insofar as the circulation test was a test of life, these cases suggest that circulation of the blood was sufficient. (See Winfield supra at 79.) 
     
      
    56 Authority is clearly in favour of a conclusion that the common law “born alive” rule is satisfied by any indicia of independent life. There is no single test of what constitutes ‘life’. The position is well stated by one author: 
     
      
       
        
        “A child is live–born in the legal sense, when, after entire birth, it exhibits a clear sign of independent vitality; in practice, at least the evanescently persistent activity of the heart.”  
        
       
       
      (Atkinson supra at 135. Note also the references in Atkinson at 142, quoted in par [33] above, to “a physiological token of vitality, however curtailed” and “a subsequent clear vital act” and see also at 152, 155.) 
       
      
    57 This test of functioning of the heart is also accepted by Glanville Williams Textbook of the Criminal Law (2nd ed) Stevens & Sons London, (1983) at 240 and, in Australia, by Barry supra at 36. 
     
      
    58 The clearest authoritative statement that the born alive rule can be satisfied by any indication of life is the judgment of Vice Chancellor Stuart in a civil case, Brock v Kellock (1861) LJ 30 Ch 498 (also reported in (1861) 3 Giff. 58). His Lordship referred to the evidence of the doctor who attended at the birth. He had felt the birth cord pulsating but could not give evidence that the child had taken a breath. His Lordship rejected the contrary medical evidence that asserted, as a matter of opinion, that in the absence of evidence of breathing after the baby had exited the mother’s body it could not be said that the child was born alive. His Lordship accepted the evidence of the doctor present at the birth and said at 504: 
     
      
       
        
        “… In order to prove the existence of animal life, I think that proof of the performance of one clear vital function is enough. I think it is enough to prove pulsation in order to prove the existence of life …” 
        
       
      
    59 An appeal was dismissed by Knight Bruce and Turner LJJ, who also accepted the evidence of the doctor who attended the birth as conclusive on the issue (supra LJ Ch at 504-505). 
     
      
    60 This is clear authority for the proposition that the beating of the heart is sufficient evidence to establish ‘life’ for the purposes of the born alive rule. It was immediately recognised as authority for that proposition (Taylor supra at 588-590, 929-930). It is also clear authority for the proposition that evidence of respiration is not necessary to establish life after birth.  
     
      
    61 An authoritative contemporary text said that Brock v Kellock affirmed an earlier decision of 1806, i.e. Fisher v Palmer, which I have not been able to locate. In that case, medical evidence that there was a tremulous motion of the lips of the child after birth was accepted as sufficient evidence of life. (See the analysis in Taylor supra at 588-590, 929-930. See also T. R. Beck & J. B. Beck, Elements of Medical Jurisprudence (11th ed) (1860) at 410-411.)  
     
      
    62 This review of the authorities indicates that his Honour was correct to hold that the evidence of heartbeat was sufficient to satisfy the common law born alive rule. His Honour was also correct to reject the Appellant’s submission that a person cannot be born alive unless the person had manifested an ability to breathe without assistance. 
     
      
    63 The born alive rule is, as I have indicated above, a product of primitive medical knowledge and technology and of the high rate of infant mortality characteristic of a long past era. There is a strong case for abandoning the born alive rule completely, as has occurred by statute in many states of the United States and by judicial decision in Massachusetts, South Carolina and Oklahoma. (Commonwealth v Cass 467 N.E.2d 1324 (Mass, 1984); State v Horne 319 S.E.2d 703 (S.C. 1984); Hughes v State 868 P.2d 730 (1994). See Forsythe supra at p683, 605ff.) It has also been modified in some states by removing the requirement of complete separation from the mother’s body. (People v Chavez 77 Cal.App.2d 62 (1947); Singleton v State So.2d 375 (Ala, 1948).) The rule has also been widely criticised in other states, although regarded by some courts as too well entrenched to overrule. (Keeler v Supreme Court of Amador County 2 Cal.3d 629 (1970); People v Guthrie 273 N.W.2d 775 (Mich, 1980); People v Greer 402 NE.2d 203 (Ill, 1980).) 
     
      
    64 The context in which the rule arises for present consideration is a context in which the Appellant wishes to avoid criminal responsibility for manslaughter of a baby which was injured as a late term foetus, indeed was fully developed in perfect condition and within a week or two of actual birth. In the current state of medical technology and with the extremely low rate of stillbirths in the Australian community, the born alive rule, if it is to survive at all, should continue to be applied, as Ellis DCJ did, so that any sign of life after birth is sufficient. This happens to be consistent with the authorities.  
     
      
    65 It is also the approach which conforms best with contemporary conditions. It is now virtually certain that a newborn baby which shows any sign of life would have lived but for the conduct, said to constitute manslaughter or dangerous driving, inflicted on the baby late in the mother’s pregnancy. The viability of a foetus can now be both established and ensured in a manner which was beyond the realms of contemplation when the born alive rule was adopted. That rule should now be applied consistently with contemporary conditions by affirming that any sign of life after delivery is sufficient. 
     
      
    66 I should note that in reaching this conclusion I have not drawn on the definition of life adopted by the World Health Organisation (“WHO”) upon which the Crown relied: That definition is: 
     
      
       
        
        “Live birth is the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached; each product of such a birth is considered live born.” 
        
       
      
    67 The definition appears in different places, but can be traced back to a report in 1950 of the WHO Subcommittee on the Definition of Stillbirth and Abortion of the Expert Committee on Health Statistics. The definition is based on the need to have internationally comparable statistics. This is not a context capable of giving any assistance for the explication of the common law. 
     
      
       
      The Proposed Brain Death Rule 
       
      
    68 The Appellant’s submissions appear to rely on two alternative arguments with respect to the implications of s33 of the Human Tissues Act 1983, set out above. First, it was suggested that the Act operated of its own force to change the common law by reason of the fact that it introduced a definition of death “for the purposes of the law of New South Wales”. The second argument appears to be that the common law should be adapted, so that the definition of life coincides with the new statutory definition of death.  
     
      
    69 In Ansett Australia v Dale (2001) NSWCA 314 at [31] the Court of Appeal described the introductory words of s33 as meaning that the definition of death was one “of general application”. 
     
      
    70 The thrust of the Appellant’s submissions was that it would be anomalous if a person could be classified as “dead” for virtually all purposes of the law of New South Wales, but also be classified as “alive” for some of those purposes, specifically with respect to the application of the common law born alive rule to criminal offences. I cannot myself identify any relevant anomaly, other than perhaps a semantic one, which should not be determinative.  
     
      
    71 It is important in this, as in so many contexts, to bear in mind Fullagar J’s warning in Attorney General (NSW) v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited (1951-1952) 85 CLR 237 at 285 to resist “ … the temptation, which is so apt to assail us, to import a meretricious symmetry into the law”. Although a similar argument has succeeded in the United States (see State of Wisconsin v Cornelius 152 WIS.2d 272 (1989)), I would not adopt it here.  
     
      
    72 The scope and purpose of the Human Tissue Act, to which I will further refer below, providing as it does a definition of death of general application, does not indicate any legislative intention to alter the concept of “life” for purposes of the law, specifically the born alive rule. There is no purpose of the legislative scheme that would be served by extending its application in this manner, on the basis of a semantic analogy of the character relied upon by the Appellant. 
     
      
    73 The Act finds it origins in the consideration of brain death by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report on Human Tissue Transplants (Report No 7 A.G.P.S. Canberra 1977). The purpose of the rule proposed by the Commission, and eventually adopted, is indicated in the following observation: 
     
      
       
        
        “[118] … In practice the determination of death involves a judgment that the patient’s progress to a state of nonliving or non-existence is sufficiently far advanced to be diagnosed with certainty as  
        irreversible 
        .” [Emphasis added.] 
        
       
      
    74 The report went on to note that irreversible cessation of all brain function is referred to as brain death. It recommended a definition of death which included reference to brain death. The definition is applicable to the case of a person who had been alive, where the issue is to determine the time of death. The born alive rule is concerned with the identification of life at a time after the baby has been completely separated from his or her mother’s body. This is not the reciprocal of “death”, as now defined, because it adopts an artificial and non-scientific standard of when life begins i.e. after delivery. 
     
      
    75 As indicated above, the second way in which the proposition appeared to be put by the Appellant was that the common law should be adapted so that the born alive rule is consistent with the definition of death. There is only a single common law of Australia (see Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corp (1997) 189 CLR 520; John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson (2000) 203 CLR 503). 
     
      
    76 The Human Tissue Act is part of a scheme which is in large measure a national scheme. The Australian Law Reform Commission recommendation of a definition has now been adopted in all States and Territories, other than Western Australia. (See s45 Transplantation and Anatomy Act 1978 (ACT); s27A Human Tissue Act 1985 (Tas); s23 Human Tissues Transplant Act 1979 (NT); s2 Death (Definition) Act 1983 (SA); s41 Human Tissues Act 1982 (Vic); s45 Transplantation and Anatomy Act 1979 (Qld).) There is one difference: the definition in Queensland is only “for the purposes of this Act”. Other States adopt the New South Wales formula of “for the purposes of the law of …” the relevant jurisdiction.  
     
      
    77 There are considerable difficulties in developing the common law by analogy with statute. See the discussion in Esso Australia Resources Australia Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 201 CLR 49 esp at [23], [64], [91] and [144]. Here there is a much closer approximation to a national uniform regime than that considered by the High Court in Esso. Only Western Australia wholly fails to adopt the definition and only Queensland limits its application to the particular purposes of the Transplantation and Anatomy Act 1979 (Qld). Nevertheless, there is no uniformity. 
     
      
    78 More significant, however, for present purposes is the above analysis with respect to the application of the statutory definition of death to the common law born alive rule. The Courts should also resist the temptation to introduce a meretricious symmetry between the common law and statute law. The definition of death does not, other than in the context of semantic symmetry, require a corresponding definition of life. This is particularly so for the purposes of a common law rule which, as I have indicated above, is itself anachronistic and which adopts an artificial and non-scientific concept of when life begins. Other than in semantic terms, this test for the born alive rule is not the reciprocal of death as now defined by statute. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    79 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

      2003/70089 - REGINA v Gary Michael DOLAN 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: On 18 October 2002, Gary Michael Dolan bludgeoned his stepmother, Marcia Ann Dolan, to death with an axe. She was struck on the head at least five times as she lay sleeping on the lounge in her home at Gymea. It can be inferred that she died instantly. She was discovered a short time later by ambulance officers who were called to the home. She was still lying on the couch. 
     
      
    2 On 29 November 2004, Mr Dolan pleaded guilty to murder. Submissions on sentence were heard on 31 March and 1 April 2005. The submissions occupied some time. There were contested issues of fact. A number of witnesses gave evidence, including Mr Gary Dolan. 
     
      
    3 It remains for me to pass sentence. I must first determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion. Where the facts are adverse, they must be established beyond reasonable doubt. Where they favour Mr Dolan, it is enough that they should be proved on the balance of probabilities. 
     
      
       
      Background. 
       
      
    4 Mr Gary Dolan was born on 8 June 1963. At the time of these events he was 39 years old. He is the son of William and Winifred Dolan. He is one of six children. His parents separated when he was a teenager and divorced some time later. His father thereafter met Marcia, who came to live at the house that he occupied in Gymea. They later married. 
     
      
    5 In 1997, William Dolan inherited the house at Gymea. He and his wife decided to demolish the house and rebuild. She used the money she had accumulated as superannuation to pay the construction costs. The title to the property was then changed to reflect their respective contributions. The property was thereafter held as tenants in common. At the same time, William and Marcia Dolan executed mutual wills, that is, wills in identical terms. Upon the death of one, the surviving spouse would have a life estate in the property. Upon their death, the property would then pass to the six Dolan children in equal shares. 
     
      
    6 Marcia Dolan was born on 15 January 1942. At the time of her death she was 60 years old. When she was a young woman, long before she met William Dolan, she had a child. She was not then married. The child was adopted by a family in Western Australia. In 1996, after a search by Marcia Dolan and the child, they made contact. They ultimately met in May 2000 when Marcia Dolan travelled to Western Australia. Her son came to Sydney in March 2001 and stayed at Gymea. 
     
      
    7 At about the same time, William Dolan was diagnosed with throat cancer. He underwent treatment for the next 18 months. His son, Gary Dolan, was very close to him. He regularly stayed at Gymea, sometimes for three days a week. With his sister and Marcia Dolan, they transported William Dolan to hospital when required. Gary Dolan helped maintain the home and mowed the lawns. 
     
      
    8 William Dolan died on 8 August 2002. Each witness who knew father and son, commented upon the closeness of their relationship. His death occurred a little more than two months before this crime. I accept that the death of William Dolan had a profound impact upon the offender, Gary Dolan. 
     
      
    9 After the funeral, Gary Dolan spent the next month at Gymea with Marcia Dolan, his stepmother. That was not unusual, having regard to their relationship. He alone of the Dolan children saw a good deal of Marcia. They got on well. They went shopping together. A room was set aside in the house which was regarded as the room of Gary Dolan. 
     
      
    10 Gary Dolan came from a close knit family. Most of his siblings have been successful in one field or another. Gary Dolan was homosexual. He led a rather different life. He drank alcohol to excess, regularly indulging in alcoholic binges. He injected amphetamines and had done so for some 14 years. He had, for an extended period, worked as a male prostitute or sex worker. He lived, what his friends termed, the life of a gypsy. He had no home. He had no income. He lived from day to day, performing casual work. He lived out of a suitcase, on some nights staying at private hotels. On others, he would stay with friends or family. On occasions he would stay at Gymea with his father and Marcia and, after his father's death, with Marcia alone. Marcia Dolan plainly welcomed her stepson's presence. Indeed she complained of the neglect of the Dolan children other than Gary Dolan. 
     
      
    11 Within a month of the death of William Dolan, Gary Dolan was diagnosed as suffering from the HIV virus, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. A certificate was issued enabling him to claim Social Security benefits on 24 September 2002. He began anti-viral therapy to combat the disease. 
     
      
       
      The incident. 
       
      
    12 On Thursday 17 October 2002, Gary Dolan rang his stepmother, Marcia, saying that he would come to Gymea the following day at about 6.00 pm. Mrs Dolan was planning a barbeque for neighbours and family, including the Dolan children. She had in mind that Gary Dolan would attend to the garden and mow the lawns, as he usually did. 
     
      
    13 On Friday 18 October 2002, Gary Dolan spent the morning with his mother and sister, Kerri. At about 2.00 pm they drove him to Blacktown. They dropped him off at the Adams Tavern bottle shop where he purchased and drank alcohol. 
     
      
    14 Mr Dolan then caught the train to Petersham. He collected wages that were owing to him and used part of the money to purchase more alcohol. He bought a six-pack of beer, drinking three small bottles of beer at the premises. 
     
      
    15 Mr Dolan then caught the train to Gymea. Surveillance footage within the Gymea Hotel showed that he entered that hotel at about 4.30 pm. He bought a pack of Johnnie Walker Whisky and Cola and was given a complimentary can of the same drink. He then walked to Gymea Bay. At some point he purchased a 375 ml bottle of Bundaberg Rum. 
     
      
    16 At 5.40 pm Marcia Dolan telephoned her friend, Judith McInnes. She said that she was expecting Gary. She was apprehensive because he had not yet arrived. At 6.15 Mrs Dolan telephoned her cousin, Alison Fay. Gary had still not arrived. She said she thought he would not come. She added that she was not looking forward to spending the weekend alone.  
     
      
    17 However, at about 6.30 pm, Gary Dolan arrived. Together he and his stepmother sat in a garage, which had been furnished and which was an annex to the house. Mrs Dolan enjoyed a drink. She and Gary Dolan shared a drink, sitting in the garage with the roller shutter door open. The garage opened onto a laneway. A neighbour, Beth Robinson, drove along the laneway at 6.45 pm. She saw Marcia and Gary Dolan having a drink. Ms Robinson's statement to the police included the following observation: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I thought I heard them both laughing and they seemed to be enjoying each other's company."" 
        
       
      
    18 Another neighbour, David Silversmith, walked down the laneway, past the garage, at about 7.00 pm. He saw Marcia and Gary Dolan seated inside the garage, facing each other, sharing a bottle of Bundaberg Rum. Mr Silversmith could see that Gary had had a few drinks. He spoke briefly to Marcia and then passed on his way. 
     
      
    19 Marcia then prepared a meal which she and Gary ate together. Mr Dolan said that he did not feel hungry and ate very little. 
     
      
    20 At some time between 7.30 pm and 10.30 pm, Mr Dolan armed himself with an axe. He then murdered Marcia Dolan, as she lay dozing on the couch. Mr Dolan, in his evidence, gave an account of comments made by his stepmother which he found extremely hurtful. He said that he had no real recollection of what he did after 7.30 pm before making certain telephone calls later that evening. Indeed, he asserted that even later in the evening, his memory was patchy. 
     
      
    21 The remarks said to have been made by Marcia Dolan are the only explanation Gary Dolan can offer for his attack upon his stepmother. He acknowledged at once that, even were his evidence accepted, the remarks afforded no excuse for what followed. 
     
      
    22 The Crown strongly challenged Mr Dolan's account. It suggested an altogether different motive. The Crown alleged that Mr Dolan had been planning the murder for some time. He was driven by greed. He was impatient for his share of the Gymea property.  
     
      
    23 I shall review what happened between 10.30 pm and Mr Dolan's arrest the next morning at 5.30 am. I shall then examine the evidence put forward by the Crown as proof of premeditation and motive. Having done that, I will return to the explanation given by Mr Dolan, namely, that he overreacted to certain hurtful remarks made by his stepmother that evening. 
     
      
       
      Evidence of premeditation. 
       
      
    24 At 10.30 pm Gary Dolan rang his mother. He asked that she telephone his twin brother, Paul. Paul ordinarily lived in Tokyo. At the time of the murder he was in Sydney in a city apartment. Mrs Winifred Dolan rang Paul. She asked him to telephone Gary at Gymea. 
     
      
    25 Five or ten minutes later, Gary Dolan rang his mother again. He had not heard from Paul. His conversation with his mother included these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(GD) Did you call Paul? 
         
        (Mother) Yes, hasn't he called you yet? 
        
       
       
        
        (GD) No, could you get him to phone me now? 
         
        (Mother) Well, like urgently? 
        
       
       
        
        (GD) Yeah now."" 
        
       
      
    26 Paul Dolan rang his brother at 10.45 pm. Gary Dolan told him that he thought Marcia was dead. He added: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I'm standing here with a club in my hand and Marcy's on the floor and I'm pretty sure she's dead."" 
        
       
      
    27 Gary Dolan did not sound drunk. However, he did appear to be somewhat vague. 
     
      
    28 Paul Dolan immediately rang his brother, John, in Yamba. John then rang Gary at Gymea Bay. Gary Dolan affirmed that Marcia was dead. He said there was blood everywhere. John said that he would ring the ambulance. Gary Dolan responded, saying: 
     
      
       
       ""Too late. They won't be able to help her."" 
       
      
    29 At 11.12 pm John Dolan, nonetheless, telephoned 000 asking for the ambulance and police. He said that his brother had told him that he had done a terrible thing. Either Gary Dolan said, or John inferred, that he had murdered his stepmother, Marcia Dolan. 
     
      
    30 At 11.16 pm John Dolan rang his brother back. He told him that he had notified the ambulance and the police. Gary Dolan, meanwhile, had telephoned a taxi. The taxi arrived at about 11.24 pm. As the taxi arrived, the driver saw a vehicle leave the premises. Gary Dolan, after his brother's phone call, had decided not to wait for the taxi. Instead he took Marcia Dolan's car. The ambulance and police arrived at about 11.30 pm. 
     
      
    31 Mr Dolan drove to the city. Just after midnight he called his brother Paul on a mobile phone. He was standing across the road from his apartment. His brother looked out the window and saw him. He told him to come up. Paul Dolan then watched his brother cross the road, looking neither left nor right. Cars had to swerve to avoid him. 
     
      
    32 Gary Dolan then spoke to his brother Paul. He seemed unusually quiet. He recounted again the circumstances of finding Marcia covered in blood. He included, as he later acknowledged, a false account of another person at the premises at the time he made his discovery. He also showed his brother a medical certificate confirming that he had the HIV virus, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. 
     
      
    33 Mr Dolan then left his brother's apartment to visit a friend. He was arrested at 5.30 am the following morning as he returned to Marcia Dolan's car. He was later interviewed by the police. He told the police that he left the premises at 7.30 pm and that when he left Marcia was still alive. 
     
      
       
      Pre-meditation. 
       
      
    34 One then comes to the evidence suggesting pre-meditation. Pre-meditation, were it found, would be a circumstance of aggravation (s21A(2)(n) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). Two witnesses gave evidence of planning on the part of Gary Dolan of the murder which he ultimately committed. The first, Kurt Jordan, was Gary Dolan's partner for seven years. Their relationship ended in 1992. They nonetheless remained on good terms. Mr Dolan continued to see Mr Jordan and his new partner, Mr Stephen Pattinson, from time to time. He would often stay overnight. Mr Stephen Pattinson was the second witness. 
     
      
    35 Mr Jordan gave evidence that, about a month after Gary's father died, that is about a month after 8 August 2002, he received a phone call from Mr Dolan. The phone call was as follows: (T5) 
     
      
       
        
        ""He rang me up and he said 'can you get me a gun' and I asked him what for and he told me that it's no one that I knew and he said what price range would it be and I told him it would be between 750 for a gun that wasn't clean, to 3200 for a Glock in a box."" 
        
       
      
    36 According to Mr Jordan, Gary Dolan said that he would get back to him once he had the money. 
     
      
    37 Some weeks later, Mr Dolan attended the apartment of Mr Jordan. He brought with him a bottle of Scotch and several grams of amphetamines, which they then shared. Mr Dolan disclosed that he had been diagnosed as suffering from the HIV virus, Hepatitis B and C. Mr Jordan himself, incidentally, also suffered from the HIV virus. 
     
      
    38 The conversation then turned to Mr Dolan's stepmother, Marcia. According to Mr Jordan, Gary Dolan said this: (T7) 
     
      
       
       ""He asked me if I wouldn't get a gun how else to kill her."" 
       
      
    39 Mr Jordan enquired why Mr Dolan wanted his stepmother dead. According to his evidence, Mr Dolan gave the following explanation: (T7) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Did the prisoner answer you? 
         
        A. He said that his sister had a baby that was blind and wanted a house for Kerri and Michael to raise the child. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he say anything about the consequences upon him of doing anything of that nature? 
         
        A. After what he just contracted he didn't mind doing that to give them somewhere to live."" 
        
       
      
    40 During the course of their conversation, Mr Jordan made another suggestion. He knew Marcia. He knew she took valium. He had some knowledge of drugs, and said this: (T8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... I was the one that told him that if he wanted to use valium he would have to have morphine or use morphine like in palliative care to stop the respiratory system from working."" 
        
       
      
    41 This discussion took place on a day that Mr Dolan arrived at Mr Jordan's home at 4.00 am. He was still there at 11.00 am when Mr Jordan left to visit his partner, Stephen Pattinson, in hospital. Mr Jordan returned some time after midday. By then Mr Dolan had gone. When they had the conversation about Marcia, Mr Dolan was, according to Mr Jordan, ""very intoxicated"". 
     
      
    42 The conversation with Mr Dolan occurred on the day Mr Jordan brought his partner home from hospital (T13). Mr Pattinson was discharged from hospital on 3 October 2002. Plainly, therefore, Mr Pattinson was not present during the conversation which Mr Jordan recounted. 
     
      
    43 The statement he made to the police, incorporating these conversations, was dated 18 February 2003, almost four months after the conversations were said to have taken place. Mr Jordan's evidence must be approached with some caution. It may be unreliable. First, he gave evidence of admissions made by Mr Dolan. Admissions fall within the class of evidence that may be unreliable (s165(1)(a) Evidence Act 1995). Secondly, during the face to face meeting, he and Mr Dolan consumed a bottle of Scotch and several grams of amphetamines (s165(1)(c)). Thirdly, there is a risk of contamination. The other witness who gave evidence, concerning this issue, is Mr Jordan's partner, Mr Stephen Pattinson. He, likewise, made a statement to the police on 18 February 2003. 
     
      
    44 Before expressing a view concerning this evidence, it may be useful to recount what Mr Pattinson said. Mr Pattinson had also been diagnosed with the HIV virus. He was admitted to hospital in February 2002 and remained there until 3 October 2002. He was then discharged. At some point after his discharge, he came home to the flat and saw Gary Dolan speaking to Kurt Jordan in the lounge room. The conversation was very intense. Mr Pattinson said that he passed through the lounge room unnoticed. As he did so, he overheard a conversation which was in these terms: (T30) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. I heard Gary Dolan say to Kurt, 'how do I kill her?'. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did Kurt say anything in reply? 
         
        A. Yes he did. He said, 'I think you need to talk to somebody about how you feel'. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you hear the prisoner Mr Dolan say anything further? 
         
        A. No, he didn't respond to that. He further [went] on to say, 'well I got nothing to lose now I may as well kill her'."" 
        
       
      
    45 Mr Pattinson formed the view that Mr Jordan was intoxicated with alcohol and amphetamines. 
     
      
    46 The evidence of Mr Pattinson must also be approached with caution, for many of the same reasons as in the case of Mr Jordan, although there was no evidence that he was affected by alcohol or drugs at the time of the conversation. 
     
      
    47 Mr Pattinson said that the conversation occurred some days, or even a couple of weeks, after his discharge from hospital, that is, mid October 2002. At about this time he closely observed Gary Dolan. He thought that he detected the symptoms of the HIV virus. He urged Mr Dolan to have a test, which Mr Dolan did in the next day or so. The test showed that Mr Dolan did indeed have the HIV virus. 
     
      
    48 Clearly there are irreconcilable differences between the accounts given by Mr Jordan and Mr Pattinson. No one suggested there were two separate face to face conversations involving discussions concerning Marcia's death. On the account each gave, there was only one meeting where Marcia's murder was discussed. According to Mr Jordan, his meeting and conversation with Mr Dolan took place no later than 3 October 2002, in Mr Pattinson's absence. Mr Pattinson was still in hospital. Mr Pattinson, however, says that he was present. The conversation took place some time after his discharge on 3 October 2002 and coincided with the diagnosis of Mr Dolan with the HIV virus. 
     
      
    49 However, it is clear that Mr Dolan was diagnosed with the HIV virus no later than 24 September 2002, being the date on his certificate (Exhibit 3). Mr Pattinson was still in hospital. Mr Pattinson thought that the explanation for the discrepancy may be that Mr Dolan was ""foxing"", that is, deliberately misleading him. However, since Mr Jordan's account includes the fact that Mr Dolan told him of his diagnosis, that makes no sense at all, especially since both Mr Jordan and Mr Pattinson themselves had the HIV virus. It would be pointless to tell Mr Jordan and on the same day conceal the information from his partner, Mr Pattinson. 
     
      
    50 Mr Jordan was cross examined concerning the circumstances in which he made his statement to the police. The police asked him beforehand whether he had had any involvement in the murder. He denied that he had. He believed, nonetheless, that he was under suspicion. The police told him that, in the course of their investigation, they had found certain fingerprints in the house which had not been identified. As Mr Jordan had not been to the Gymea house since it was rebuilt, he volunteered that, if his fingerprints were present, they could only be on an ampule of a drug which he had provided Mr Dolan. 
     
      
    51 Mr Jordan was also cross examined about his memory. His evidence in this Court was that the telephone conversation was about a month after William Dolan's death, which would make it about 8 September. The meeting with Gary Dolan was on the day that his partner was discharged from hospital, 3 October 2002. However, his statement to the police and his evidence in the committal proceedings, suggested a somewhat different timetable. The phone call had occurred within seven to ten days of William Dolan's death. The meeting with Gary Dolan was ""a couple of weeks after that"", which would make it the end of August 2002. Mr Jordan explained that one of the side-effects of the HIV virus was peripheral neuropathy. His memory had been affected. 
     
      
    52 Mr Gary Dolan, as mentioned, also gave evidence. He denied the conversations attributed to him by Messrs Jordan and Pattinson. At no stage had he sought a gun, nor advice or help from Mr Jordan to murder his stepmother. Mr Jordan had, however, provided an ampule of a drug to Mr Dolan in about May that year. But, it had nothing to do with Marcia Dolan. It was given so that a very old cat could be put to sleep. The owner of the cat was a friend of Gary Dolan and was reluctant to have the cat put down. Mr Jordan, indeed, referred to the cat in his statement to the police. 
     
      
    53 Mr Dolan also said he did mention to Mr Jordan in conversation that his sister, Kerri's, baby was technically blind. He said nothing, according to his testimony, about Kerri requiring a home to raise her child. He understood that Kerri and her partner were financially secure. They had a home. 
     
      
    54 Ms Kerri Dolan also gave evidence. She and her partner, Michael Jackson, had a baby. The baby had difficulties with his sight, but was certainly not blind. He is able to attend an ordinary pre-school. They had no financial difficulties. She and her partner owned an investment unit. Both were employed in secure jobs. She had never suggested to her brother that she was at risk of being homeless. 
     
      
    55 There was other evidence concerning the relationship between Marcia Dolan and Gary Dolan before the night of the murder, which is relevant to an evaluation of this evidence. The Crown tendered a number of statements. They included the statements of friends and relatives who knew both Marcia and Gary Dolan well and saw them together. Subject to one matter, which I will come to shortly, each witness said that Marcia Dolan got on well with Gary Dolan. They spent considerable time together. The conversations between Mrs Dolan and her friends, a matter of hours before her death, suggested that she enjoyed Gary Dolan's company and was looking forward to his visit. 
     
      
    56 Weighing these matters, I am not satisfied that Gary Dolan spoke to Kurt Jordan in the terms suggested or that he made the statements attributed to him by Stephen Pattinson. I therefore do not find premeditation. 
     
      
       
      Changes to the Will. 
       
      
    57 I should deal with one other aspect. There was some evidence which may suggest a possible motive. It will be remembered that in 1997, having built a new home at Gymea, William Dolan and Marcia Dolan executed mutual wills. The Dolan children were the ultimate beneficiaries after both died. Marcia Dolan, meanwhile, had made contact with her son. At some point, she apparently altered her will to make provision for him. He was to receive 40% of her estate and the six Dolan children 10% each. 
     
      
    58 Some time after that, Marcia Dolan again spoke to her son about the will. It is not entirely clear when the conversation took place, although one infers that it was not long before her death. She told her son that she intended to change her will. She planned to make him the major beneficiary of her estate. 
     
      
    59 The statement provided by Marcia Dolan's son to the police included one other matter. After her husband's death, Marcia Dolan disclosed to her son that she was having problems with Gary. They had been arguing over something. She did not elaborate.  
     
      
    60 The Crown acknowledged that there was no evidence that Gary Dolan became aware of Marcia Dolan's intention to alter her will. Mr Dolan denied that he was aware. It was his understanding that Marcia's estate would be divided between the six Dolan children. 
     
      
    61 It cannot, of course, be assumed that the argument between Mrs Dolan and Gary Dolan, to which her son referred, related to her will. No inference adverse to Mr Dolan can be drawn on that aspect. Financial greed is not a convincing motive on these facts. Mr Gary Dolan had lived a nomadic life for some time. There appeared to be no shortage of people, whether family or friends, who were willing to shelter him and care for him. 
     
      
       
      The night of the murder. 
       
      
    62 I come then to the suggestion by Mr Dolan that his stepmother made certain hurtful remarks on the night of the murder, which in some way triggered the violence that followed. When interviewed by the police on the day following the murder, nothing was said by Mr Dolan about his stepmother having said anything to upset him during the evening. At that stage, Mr Dolan denied any involvement in the murder. 
     
      
    63 The suggestion of hurtful remarks first emerged in a psychiatric report from Dr Allnutt on 9 February 2005. Mr Dolan told Dr Allnutt that, before his arrival at Marcia's home, he had consumed a substantial amount of alcohol and had also taken amphetamines. He continued to drink with Marcia after he arrived. 
     
      
    64 He also provided an explanation for the way in which the axe, which was ultimately used as the murder weapon, came to be close by. Dr Allnutt's report included these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He said that he eventually got up and went to the other garage where he collected an axe. He told me that in the garden was a plum tree that was dying that he had been gradually chopping down over the past few months. With the axe he chopped a few times at the plum tree. He then returned to the kitchen through the lounge garage and put the axe next to the fridge. He made more drinks. At this stage he recalled his stepmother was in the kitchen working."" 
        
       
      
    65 Mr Dolan said that, whilst sitting with Marcia sharing a drink, he noticed that a photo of his father had been removed. The photo had particular significance for him. He began looking elsewhere throughout the house for the photograph. He could not find it. He did not raise the issue with Marcia immediately, although he did disclose to her that he had been diagnosed with the HIV virus and the other illnesses. 
     
      
    66 At some point, the issue of the photograph was discussed. They had an argument. Mr Dolan said that, in the course of the argument, Marcia said something to the effect that he had been hanging around watching his father die. He thought that she was, in some way, implying that he was responsible for his father's illness. He saw this as a reference to the HIV virus. He recalled feeling furious. But that was all he recalled. His next recollection was of seeing blood. It was then that he phoned members of his family. 
     
      
    67 In evidence, Mr Dolan elaborated upon his account of the events of 18 October and his interaction with Marcia. He said that he arrived at the premises at about 3.00 pm. He worked in the garden for a time, using the axe. He came inside to go to the toilet at about 4.00 pm. He left the axe next to the fridge in the kitchen. He then became distracted and the axe remained in that position. 
     
      
    68 When giving evidence, the account Mr Dolan gave of his conversation with his stepmother was somewhat different. The exchange concerning his diagnosis with HIV was recounted almost as a joke. Mr Dolan said this: (T57) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. ... I told Marcia my medical condition. And I told her that I had Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. And she got - she became indignant and said 'I hadn't caught it here', meaning at Gymea Bay at the house I assumed. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How did you respond to that? 
         
        A. I laughed and said, 'yes, I know'."" 
        
       
      
    69 The conversation which was hurtful was somewhat later. It was after dinner at about 7.30 pm. Mr Dolan gave the following evidence: (T58) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. What happened next? 
         
        A. I was wandering around the backyard. I went back inside the house. I went to the bathroom. I came out of the bathroom and Marcia was lying on the lounge watching television or dozing. And she told me she didn't want me coming around the house when I was sick. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you comment on that? 
         
        A. Yes. I said 'what do you mean?'. She said that she had been taking care of myself and my family, and my father for the last two years and she was sick of it. She had enough. She wanted a break from it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you say? 
         
        A. I said to her, 'what do you mean, you haven't been taking care of my father. It was Kerri and I.' She wasn't able to poach an egg. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did she say anything bout your father dying? 
         
        A. Yes. She said to me that 'you have just been hanging, sitting around for him to die the last year and a half.' 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How did that make you feel? 
         
        A. She said 'and you took care of that', and I was very upset at that point."" 
        
       
      
    70 Mr Dolan repeated that his next recollection was of seeing blood. He then made a number of telephone calls to members of his family. 
     
      
    71 Mr Dolan was again strongly challenged in cross examination in respect of that account. Had he positioned the axe near the kitchen as an aspect of his plan to murder Marcia Dolan? Had Marcia, who had looked after him like a mother, made the remarks which he attributed to her? What had happened between 7.30 pm, when he said the remarks were made, and 10.30 pm, when he telephoned his mother? How was it that Mr Dolan so conveniently had no recollection of that interval? 
     
      
    72 Mr Dolan again denied planning. He insisted that his stepmother had spoken to him in the terms that he had described. He simply had no recollection of the hours before 10.30 pm. 
     
      
    73 There are difficulties with aspects of Mr Dolan's account. His memory is plainly awry on some issues, perhaps because of the alcohol and drugs that he had consumed. It is clear that he did not arrive at the house at 3.00 pm. Marcia Dolan's phone calls to her friends as late as 6.15 pm suggest that his arrival was closer to 6.30 pm. Neighbours thereafter saw Mr Dolan sitting with Marcia in the garage talking and drinking at 6.45 and 7.00 pm. It therefore seems unlikely that he did gardening after his arrival, unless he used the interval during which Marcia was preparing the meal. However, by the time of his arrival it was already late. It would have been dark, unless part of the garden was illuminated. 
     
      
    74 Leaving that issue to one side for a moment, the terms of Mr Dolan's phone calls to his mother at 10.30 pm, and his urgent need to speak to his twin brother, Paul, suggest that the murder had only just occurred. The position of the deceased, lying on the couch, suggests that she was asleep when she was struck. That, in turn, suggests that the conversation between Marcia and Gary Dolan, if there was a conversation, took place some time before. It offers perhaps some confirmation of Mr Dolan's evidence that he last spoke to her at about 7.30 pm, or at least at some time earlier in the evening. 
     
      
    75 One cannot say without speculation exactly what happened. I nonetheless think it likely that Marcia Dolan did say something to Gary Dolan which carried the implication that she was not willing to look after him as he became progressively more disabled by reason of his illness and that he would not be welcome in her home. 
     
      
    76 Those who knew Marcia Dolan spoke well of her. She was a kind woman. She nonetheless had suffered from schizophrenia from time to time. According to Kerri Dolan, she was given to mood changes. She was capable of making a cutting remark. Mr Dolan himself described her as ""quirky"". 
     
      
    77 Mr Gary Dolan was, as I have said, very close to Marcia Dolan. She had been like a mother to him. Since she was clearly fond of him, she would naturally have been upset to learn of his illness, which was life threatening. People react in different ways to bad news. I think it likely that she may have reacted by making the comments attributed to her by Mr Dolan, even though she may not have meant them. I also think it likely that, after dwelling on these remarks and perhaps consuming more alcohol, Mr Dolan then got the axe from the garage and murdered Marcia Dolan. 
     
      
    78 The circumstances of the murder do not suggest planning or premeditation. It was well known that Mr Dolan was going to Marcia's home that evening. He was, that evening, seen by a number of neighbours in the garage with Marcia. He had telephoned a number of his siblings immediately after the murder. He, in effect, confessed to the murder. He thereafter telephoned a taxi to pick him up from the premises. When told by his brother that the police and the ambulance were on their way, he took Marcia's car. He could not take the chance that the police would arrive before the taxi. These are all the hallmarks of a spontaneous and unplanned act. 
     
      
    79 The events which are fundamental to an understanding of this crime occurred within a little more than two months. On 8 August 2002, Mr Dolan's father died. In mid September 2002, Mr Dolan was diagnosed as suffering from various illnesses including the HIV virus. The murder took place on 18 October 2002. It took place when Mr Dolan was at a low ebb. I also accept that Marcia Dolan was important in his life, just as he was important in her life. Her remarks that evening were no doubt unintended, in the sense that they would not have reflected her state of mind the following day. Yet, in Mr Dolan's intoxicated state, they appeared to have touched more than a nerve. His intoxication, of course, is no excuse. However, it is part of the explanation for this shocking and brutal crime. 
     
      
       
      Mr Dolan's background. 
       
      
    80 Let me move from the crime to Mr Dolan himself. I have already said something about his background. He is almost 43 years old. Throughout his adult life, he has clearly had a problem with alcohol and drugs. His criminal record reflects that problem. On a number of occasions he has been convicted of driving whilst affected by alcohol (1989, 1991, 1996, 1999 and 2000). On some of those occasions he has been grossly affected. He has been repeatedly disqualified from driving.  
     
      
    81 Mr Dolan also has other convictions. Again, one suspects that they are alcohol or drug related. In 1986 he was convicted of both receiving and having goods in custody. He was fined on one charge and required to enter into a three year bond on the other. In 1989, he and Kurt Jordan were convicted in Queensland of false pretences. He was ordered to serve a number of hours community service. In 1990, Mr Dolan was convicted of assault. He was involved in an altercation with a taxi driver. He was required to enter a three year bond. In 1994, he was convicted of supplying a prohibited drug. His sentence was six months periodic detention. On 4 February 2003, Mr Dolan was imprisoned for six months for failing to comply with a community service order. The community service order had been imposed for a further drink driving offence. 
     
      
    82 The Crown acknowledged in argument, nonetheless, that Mr Dolan's criminal record cannot be considered a circumstance of aggravation in terms of s21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
       
      Plea of guilty. 
       
      
    83 Mr Dolan's plea of guilty, on the other hand, is a matter in mitigation (s21A(3)(k) and s22). Mr Dolan was committed for trial on 23 October 2003. He was arraigned on 15 March 2004. At that stage he entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was set down for 29 November 2004. On 5 November 2004, the solicitors for Mr Dolan communicated his intention to plead guilty. The plea was taken on 29 November 2004. The matter was then adjourned for submissions on sentence. 
     
      
    84 The discount on a plea of guilty is primarily determined by the timing of the plea. Here it was a late plea, which would ordinarily attract a 10% discount. Counsel for Mr Dolan, however, urged a greater discount. There was a change of solicitors after the committal. The investigation of possible psychiatric defences had not been undertaken. It was necessary to make arrangements for Mr Dolan to be examined by a psychiatrist and thereafter confer with him. That took time. The plea was entered once it had been determined that there were no available defences. I accept that a 15% discount is appropriate.  
     
      
    85 I also accept that Mr Dolan is contrite. He appeared to be genuinely horrified by his actions. In his evidence he apologised to the family of Marcia Dolan and to his own family. I accept that his apologies were sincere. 
     
      
       
      Mr Dolan's health. 
       
      
    86 One then comes to Mr Dolan's health. His treating doctor, Dr Jeffrey Post, provided a report of 18 February 2005. Dr Post is a specialist in infectious diseases. The HIV virus, of course, affects the immune system. A person with that disease is at high risk of infections. In 2003, Mr Dolan experienced an episode of immunodeficiency, secondary to the HIV infection. He remains at significant risk of developing other opportunistic infections. He requires constant anti-retroviral therapy, administered by means of tablets twice a day. 
     
      
    87 Mr Dolan, as mentioned, also has Hepatitis B and C and chronic liver disease. Such diseases progress more rapidly in people who are also infected with the HIV virus. In respect of that disease, he requires further treatment, which he is receiving. 
     
      
    88 In February 2005, when seen by Dr Post, Mr Dolan had developed good control of viral replication. He does, however, require constant monitoring and regular blood tests whilst in prison. He has access to specialist medical care and medication. However, the difficulties experienced by Mr Dolan in 2003 were the consequence of a failure to administer medication as required. The nursing staff at the gaol have been asked to address that problem. Should it reoccur, Mr Dolan will be at risk of treatment failure and HIV progression. I accept that the treatment of his complex diseases, in an institutional setting, puts him at a disadvantage. 
     
      
    89 Dr Post expressed his prognosis in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""With the current therapy, his prognosis is good in the medium term, with him likely to survive more than ten years."" 
        
       
       
      Protection. 
       
      
    90 When first taken into custody, Mr Dolan was housed at Parklea Gaol. He was not on protection. He was then transferred to the hospital section of the Long Bay Gaol. He was placed in the protection zone with seven other patients who also had the HIV virus. Having been placed in protection, Mr Dolan has been obliged to remain there. It would be dangerous, having been in protection, to re-enter the general prison system. I accept that he is likely, therefore, to remain in protection for the duration of his sentence. Mr Dolan described the disadvantages of protection in these terms: (T64) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It means I can't work so there is nothing to do (in) the day and there is no access to facilities such (as) education, library or very limited music. Visits are different. Very restricted in your visits. Just the stigma that's placed upon you, strictly by being a protection inmate. And other things, like access to hot showers, we don't have. We have to shower outside, and one of the yards that we share with another section of the gaol only has cold running water. So access is things like that. I have not been able to shower since Tuesday and that was a cold outdoor shower. It is very limited."" 
        
       
      
    91 A sentencing principle, relevant in this context, was stated in R v Smith (1987) 27 A Crim R 315, by King CJ in these terms: (at 317) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The state of health of an offender is always relevant to the consideration of the appropriate sentence for the offender. The courts, however, must be cautious as to the influence which they allow this factor to have upon the sentencing process. Ill health cannot be allowed to become a licence to commit crime, nor can offenders generally expect to escape punishment because of the condition of their health. It is the responsibility of the Correctional Services authorities to provide appropriate care and treatment for sick prisoners. Generally speaking ill health will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment only when it appears that imprisonment will be a greater burden on the offender by reason of his state of health or when there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse effect on the offender's health."" 
        
       
      
    92 I accept that the multiple illnesses suffered by Mr Dolan will make his imprisonment a greater burden. I also accept that his illness has brought about his placement in protection, where he will remain. Protection will add to his burden. 
     
      
    93 I further accept that the fact of imprisonment could adversely affect Mr Dolan's health, were there a recurrence of what was recognised by Dr Post as inadequate treatment in 2003. If that were to occur, Mr Dolan may not indeed survive the minimum term which I have in mind. That, too, is a relevant consideration (Queen v Giardini (CCA, unreported, 25.2.93)). 
     
      
    94 What relevance does the limited life expectancy of Mr Dolan have on the term that should be imposed? It is relevant to both the term and the non parole period (R v Szabo [2003] NSWCCA 341). There are limits, nonetheless, to the extent which a sentence which is otherwise appropriate can be moderated by reason of this aspect. In R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193, Howie J said this: (para 18) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Common humanity will sometimes require a court to consider a life-threatening physical illness as a matter of mitigation even though the offender was suffering from such an illness at the time of the commission of the offence. However, where as here, the issue is one of the protection of the community, it may be that common humanity for the offender gives way to concern for potential victims."" 
        
       
      
    95 If Mr Dolan's condition were to deteriorate during the course of his sentence, such that his release ought to be permitted on humanitarian grounds, the executive has the power to deal with that situation, or the Offenders' Review Board can grant parole at any time if the offender is dying or there are other exceptional circumstances (R v Vachalec (1981) 1 NSWLR 351; R v L (CCA (NSW), unreported, 17.6.96); s270 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999). 
     
      
       
      Prospects of rehabilitation. 
       
      
    96 I then come to the question of Mr Dolan's prospects of rehabilitation. Mr Dolan has a limited life expectancy. Inevitably the sentence I am obliged to impose for murder must be a significant term of imprisonment. Mr Dolan had a criminal record, although for relatively minor offences. He has a loyal family. They have stood by him. I accept that, for what remains of his life after release, his prospects of rehabilitation are good (s21A(3)(h)). Mr Dolan, nonetheless, will remain vulnerable to alcohol and drugs. He will require greater supervision than usual. That fact, his incarceration on protection and his serious illnesses make it appropriate to make a finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    97 Murder has always been regarded as the most serious crime in the criminal calendar. Absent extraordinary circumstances, it calls for a substantial sentence by way of imprisonment to serve the interests of punishment, including general deterrence. The circumstances in which Marcia Dolan died were brutal in the extreme, although the crime must be understood in the context which I have identified. Taking account of that context, the plea of guilty and other significant matters in mitigation, the sentence must nonetheless be substantial. It should date from the time Mr Dolan entered custody, that is the day after the murder, 19 October 2002. 
     
      
    98 GARY MICHAEL DOLAN, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 15 years 4 months commencing on 19 October 2002 and expiring on 18 February 2018, with a non parole period of 10 years 3 months. You will be eligible for release on parole on 18 January 2013.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant, Tony Tadrosse, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by Delaney DCJ (the Judge). He pleaded guilty in the Local Court to eleven offences of dishonesty and was committed for sentence to the District Court where he adhered to his pleas. He asked the Judge to take into account another 22 matters of a similar kind on a Form 1 under the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The offences all arose from the fraudulent use made by the applicant of documents providing him with false identities. The Judge imposed upon the applicant a total sentence of imprisonment for 6 years with an overall period that the applicant must serve before being eligible for release to parole of 3 years 6 months. I will return to consider the sentences imposed in more detail shortly. 
     
      
    3 There were three clear errors made by the Judge when sentencing the applicant. The Crown concedes so much. The first error arose from his Honour’s reference to the offences occurring over a period amounting to 18 months when in fact the offences took place over a period of 6 months. This was obviously a mere slip and could not have affected his Honour’s discretion. The other two matters are more significant. The second error arose during the course of the remarks on sentence when his Honour took into account two matters of aggravation under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, neither of which arose from the facts of the offences committed by the applicant. The third error occurred in the sentences imposed by the Judge for two offences, those sentences each exceeding the maximum sentence prescribed for the offence in question. This Court must re-sentence the applicant but the extent to which it is necessary to do so will depend upon whether the Court is persuaded that, notwithstanding these errors, no lesser sentence is warranted: see s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
    4 The facts can be dealt with relatively briefly. The applicant’s cousin gave him at least three sets of false identity documents, including driver’s licences and banking cards, for the purpose of perpetrating frauds in order to obtain property, some of which he gave to his cousin in return for cash. Between December 2002 and April 2003 the applicant used those documents to obtain property in one of two ways: he used them directly to obtain goods, such as mobile telephones or rental property, by entering into a contract using the false identity or indirectly by obtaining the use of credit facilities and a cheque account in the false identity then using those facilities to obtain property that he appropriated for himself. 
     
      
    5 The property obtained included the following: mobile phones; a DVD player and television valued at $3,999; a Yamaha motorcycle valued at $12,265; a Polaris All Terrain Vehicle valued at $11,900; a ride-on mower valued at $14,536.36; and a laptop computer and accessories to the value of about $6,000. The applicant obtained rental equipment that he never returned including the following: a Rock Breaker valued at $10,710; an excavator with a replacement value of $87,500; and a Laser Level. 
     
      
    6 The applicant also used the false identity documents to establish himself in a business called Sydney Wide Concreting and Landscaping. Under this business name the applicant secured work with members of the public and was paid in advance for carrying out that work. The work was never commenced or never completed and the applicant did not return any money to his customers. In one case he received the sum of $39,000 for work that was never completed. 
     
      
    7 The Judge during his sentencing remarks commented on the degree of planning involved in the commission of the offences and described them as “a calculated course of criminal conduct”. He found the criminality involved to be “of a very high order” and that the offences were “at the very least, towards the top of the middle range of criminality”. 
     
      
    8 As a result of this fraudulent conduct carried on for a period of about six months the applicant obtained property and cash to the value of over $200,000. None of the property or money obtained by the applicant has been recovered. The applicant became the target of media attention because of his fraudulent landscaping business and eventually surrendered himself to police. He entered into a recorded interview admitting the offences committed by him. 
     
      
    9 As a result of this course of conduct the applicant came to be sentenced for the following offences under the provisions of the Crimes Act: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Having a false instrument contrary to s 302 (x1) 
         
         
        Using a false instrument contrary to s 300(2) (x4) 
         
         
        Make a false instrument contrary to s 300(1) (x2) 
         
         
        Obtaining property by deception contrary to s 178BA (x2) 
         
         
        Passing valueless cheque contrary to s 178B (x2) 
         
        
       
       
      The offences concerned with false instruments carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years, those concerned with obtaining by deception imprisonment for 5 years and those involving valueless cheques imprisonment for 12 months. 
       
      
    10 The Form 1 matters were taken into account when sentencing the applicant for one of the offences of using a false instrument. These matters involved similar criminal activity to that covered by the committal charges and occurred during the period from 1 December 2002 to 7 March 2003. There were seven offences under s 178BA of the Crimes Act, eight under s 300(1), six under s 300(2) and one offence under s 302. 
     
      
    11 The Judge applied a discount of 25 per cent for the pleas of guilty and found that the applicant was remorseful for his offending. 
     
      
    12 The applicant was aged 39 years at the time of sentencing and, although he had a minor criminal record, the Judge treated him as if he had lived a blameless life prior to commencing the course of fraudulent conduct that brought him before the court. He had an unremarkable upbringing as part of a caring and structured family. The applicant had been married for twenty years but was separated from his wife and family at the time of sentencing. However, there was some prospect of a reconciliation. There were four children of the marriage and the youngest child was suffering from a medical condition called Lupus that required intensive treatment including periods of hospitalisation. There were character references placed before the court and the applicant and his wife gave evidence. 
     
      
    13 The explanation for the offending was that the applicant had been in business with his brother in Bilpin, where he lived with his family, when the brother suffered serious head injuries in an accident in 1997 disrupting the business and causing the applicant considerable distress. Eventually the business was placed into receivership and the applicant left his wife and family to enter into a relationship with another woman. He commenced using cocaine and gambling in order to escape his depression. The applicant used the money that he obtained for the property given to his cousin to finance his drug addiction and gambling. In early 2002, however, he decided to get his life back together and ceased using drugs. He wanted to start a business and used the false identity documents to obtain equipment and materials he needed. However the business failed on his arrest and, by the time he came for sentence, he was in full-time employment with a concreting company. He had not gambled for about 8 months prior to sentencing. 
     
      
    14 There was in evidence reports from a psychologist setting out the applicant’s background and the circumstances in which he came to commit the offences for which he was sentenced. The reports indicates that the applicant is in good physical health but that he has dependent and depressive aspects of his personality. There is little in the report that was relevant to the Judge’s task of determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon the applicant and nothing to indicate that his criminal responsibility was diminished or that normal sentencing principles should not be applied in sentencing him. Although some explanation for the offending might be found in the applicant’s involvement with drugs and gambling, it is clear that he continued to offend even after he addressed those issues, simply so that he could re-establish himself in a business of his choosing. 
     
      
    15 The Judge’s sentencing remarks were extensive and during the course of it he referred in detail to the various considerations that he took into account in determining both the objective seriousness of the offence and relevant subjective considerations. However towards the end of his remarks and shortly before indicating the sentences he was about to impose his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I now turn briefly to some of the principles of sentencing the court is required to take into account by the legislation. Section 21A of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         provides a framework upon which to judge to some extent the aggravating and mitigating factors relating to an offence or a series of offences. And whilst I do not apply that section to each individual offence, I propose to indicate generally the aggravating and mitigating features that I have found in this case. 
         
         
        When one goes to s 21A(2), the aggravating factors, the factors that I find that are present are: (g), (l), (m) and (n). In relation to mitigating factors I find that the mitigating factors that are set out in subsection (3) are (e), (f), (h), (i), and (k). I also consider that there are some elements in (m), being the assistance provided. Section 21A says that any other objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offences are to be taken into account and I refer to all of those matters I propose should be taken into account. 
         
         
        
       
      
    16 It is this passage that gives rise to the second error to which I referred at the start of this judgment. The aggravating factors listed in s 21A(2) that his Honour took into account were as follows: (g) “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”; (l) “the victim was vulnerable, for example, because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability, or because of the victim’s occupation (such as a taxi driver, bank teller or service station attendant)”; (m) “the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts”, and (n) “the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity”. The Crown concedes that his Honour was in error in taking into account factors (l) and (m). 
     
      
    17 In R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193, in a judgment with which Bell and Hislop JJ agreed, I noted the limitations to be placed upon the aggravating features listed in s 21A(2) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        22 When a sentencing court is about to consider matters of aggravation or mitigation under s 21A it is important that it recognises the limits upon the use to be made of those factors. The first is that found in relation to factors of aggravation in s 21A(2) which, after listing a number of aggravating features, provides:  
         
          
           
          The court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence. 
          
         
         
        The effect and policy behind such a limitation is self-evident: there should be no double counting of aggravating features of an offence. 
         
         
        23 The second limitation is that found in s 21A(4), which provides:  
         
          
           
          The court is not to have regard to any such aggravating or mitigating factor in sentencing if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so. 
          
         
         
        The effect of this provision is to ensure that a factor is not taken into account in a way inconsistent with general sentencing principles and policy. It was the intention of Parliament to replicate the common law. 
         
         
        
       
      
    18 The significant part of that quote for present purposes are the last two sentences. When turning to consider s 21A and in particular subsection (2), a sentencing court must remain conscious of these limitations upon the scope of the aggravating features listed. If a court finds itself considering an aggravating feature that would not have been taken into account before s 21A was enacted, then it is very likely that the court has misconstrued the section. 
     
      
    19 In my opinion a sentencing judge would be prudent to raise with the parties during addresses whether any of the factors listed in s 21A(2) apply to the particular sentencing exercise being undertaken. If the sentencing judge considers that any of the aggravating factors listed are present, it seems to me that, in fairness to the offender and as a matter of good common sense, the judge should indicate to the offender’s legal representative that he or she is considering taking that matter into account so that, if necessary, the court might be persuaded that the aggravating feature is not present or for some reason it should not be taken into account in the peculiar circumstances of the particular case. 
     
      
    20 That is not a course that was adopted in the present case. The Crown submitted to the Judge that, in accordance with the decision in R v Pont (2001) 121 A Crim R 302, the relevant features of offences such as those committed by the applicant were breach of trust, planning and repetition of offending, all of which, it was submitted, were present in the offences before his Honour. Quite exactly how there was a breach of trust was not made clear and his Honour apparently did not accept that submission. But his Honour did find that the victim or victims were vulnerable, a matter not raised during addresses, and certainly not by the Crown. 
     
      
    21 His Honour did not give reasons to explain why he found that the aggravated features he nominated were present. Of course in many cases one or more aggravating factors would be obvious and it may be that a failure to do any more than identify the factors as being taken into account would hardly amount to an error in the exercise of discretion. But there have been a number of recent decisions of this Court that stress the importance of reasons being given by sentencing judges for reaching findings, especially where they are adverse to the offender. For example, the Court has held that it is an error for a judge to fail to explain why a discount in the order of 25 per cent has not been given for a plea of guilty made in the Local Court: see R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 307, R v Dowd [2005] NSWCCA 113. The Court has also found error in the failure of a judge to explain why no special circumstances were found to reduce the non-parole period where there were in the evidence matters that manifestly would have justified such a finding: R v Novakovic [2004] NSWCCA 437. More relevantly perhaps the Court has expressed its concern about the failure of a sentencing court to indicate how it has taken into account the aggravating factor mentioned in s 21A(2)(d), “the offender has a record of previous convictions”: see R v Walker [2005] NSWCCA 109. 
     
      
    22 In the present case the Judge stated that he was not applying s 21A to each individual offence but was indicating generally the aggravating and mitigating factors he was taking into account. With respect I do not understand what his Honour meant by that remark. If there was a general aggravating feature that applied to all the offences, then it operated in determining the sentence to be imposed for each of the offences. As the principle enunciated in Pearce v The Queen has been taken as requiring that the court determine the appropriate sentence for each offence before considering the question of totality, so his Honour was required to consider the effect of any aggravating or mitigating factor when determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed for each offence before him. If an aggravating factor applied to one or more of the offences but not all of them, then clearly his Honour was required to indicate in respect of which offence or offences that aggravating feature was being taken into account. 
     
      
    23 The aggravating or mitigating factors do not necessarily apply globally to all the offences for which sentence is being passed: they may do so or they may not. For example, in the present case it was clearly a general aggravating factor applicable to all the offences that they were part of a planned or organised criminal activity and so that factor was to be taken into account when determining the sentence for all offences. But it is less certain that the aggravating factor under (g), that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial, applied generally to all the offences: it depends upon the facts of any particular offence. However, I accept that this criticism of the unspecific nature of the approach taken by the Judge to aggravating and mitigating factors may generally speaking be a somewhat technical one having no practical significance in the determination of the overall sentence in respect of most of the factors mentioned by him. But with respect it is not a principled approach and is one that could lead to error particularly in the case of aggravating factors that very often will be offence specific. 
     
      
    24 However, because of the general approach taken by his Honour to the factors in s 21A and because of his failure to give reasons for his findings that any particular aggravating factor was present, it is impossible to know whether his Honour was applying the aggravating factor in (l) to all the offences or to only some of them, and if the latter which ones. But there was no evidence that any of the victims fell within the examples of the categories of victims given in s 21A(2)(l) or that they came within any analogous category. They were either persons working in unremarkable businesses who just happened to have acted on the false documents shown to them, or they were private individuals who parted with their money because they happened to believe the applicant’s promise to carry out the work that they paid to have performed. It may be, although there is no evidence of it, that one or more of them were more easily persuaded to part with property or money than some other members in the community might have been, but that fact would not make them vulnerable for the purpose of the section. 
     
      
    25 Before s 21A(2) was enacted, the common law recognised that there were certain categories or classes of persons who needed to be especially protected because they were particularly vulnerable to criminal offences generally or a criminal offence of a particular type. Of course the purpose of sentencing is to protect the community generally and this is achieved by each of the aims of sentencing such as deterrence, denunciation and rehabilitation. But an aggravating factor is something that operates over and above the general considerations that indicate that a particular class of offending should generally be dealt with in a particular way. 
     
      
    26 It may well be the case the persons generally in the community would be vulnerable to a proficient fraudster armed with forged documents such as a driver’s licence because it is common to rely upon such documents as proof of identity. But that fact does not give rise to an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(l). That provision is concerned with the weakness of a particular class of victim and not with the threat posed by a particular class of offender. 
     
      
    27 In R v Williams [2005] NSWCCA 99 this Court held that a sentencing judge was in error in taking into account as an aggravating factor under the section that the victim of a manslaughter offence was vulnerable. Buddin J with whom the other members of the Court agreed stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [40]……………The sentencing judge concluded that the deceased was vulnerable, as I understand his Honour’s reasons, upon the basis that the applicant was a powerful man who had violent tendencies, whereas the deceased did not have those characteristics. That was clearly a matter that was relevant to an assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. It should not however have been treated as a factor which further aggravated the offence.  
         
         
        [41] In any event all victims of a homicide can be said to be vulnerable. In my view, s 21A(2)(l) is not directed to vulnerability in that generalized sense. Indeed, the examples set out in the subparagraph suggest that it is vulnerability of a particular kind that attracts its operation. 
         
        
       
       
      The Judge in the present case was in error into taking into account in any manner that the victims of the applicant’s offences were vulnerable. 
       
      
    28 His Honour was also in error in taking into account as an aggravating feature s 21A(2)(m) “the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts”. Clearly there were multiple offences before the court and they indicated that there were multiple victims and a series of criminal acts. But the applicant was going to be sentenced for each of those offences and the fact that there were multiple victims and multiple acts of criminality would be addressed by the sentences to be imposed for each of those offences in accordance with the principle of totality. With respect it is illogical to take into account, where there are multiple offences charged, that it is an aggravating factor relevant to each offence that there is a series of criminal acts disclosed by the offences before the court. 
     
      
    29 Clearly the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(m) is concerned with the situation where a single offence contains a number of allegations of criminal acts that are part and parcel of a single course of criminal conduct. A charge of this nature will be frequently found in cases of fraud or dishonesty perpetrated against a single victim such as a charge of embezzlement or larceny as a servant. It is also common to charge multiple instances of supplying drugs over a lengthy period of time as one offence under s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Of course there are offences that have, as an element of the offence, multiple acts of criminality, such as an offence of ongoing drug supply under s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act or an offence of persistent sexual abuse of a child under s 66EA of the Crimes Act. When sentencing for such an offence, the court must bear in mind the prohibition against taking into account as a matter of aggravation that which is an element of the offence charged. 
     
      
    30 As I indicated at the outset of this judgment, the judge also erred in imposing a sentence for two of the offences that exceeded the applicable maximum penalty. In respect of each of the offences under s 178B of the Crimes Act, his Honour imposed a fixed term of two years whereas the maximum penalty for such an offence is imprisonment for 12 months. However, those two sentences were made concurrent with sentences of imprisonment for 2 years for two offences under s 178BA of the Crimes Act, the maximum penalty being 5 years, and sentences of 3 years for six offences under s 300(2), where the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 10 years. The error was a technical one and could not have made any difference to the overall sentence imposed upon the applicant in light of the number of offences for which sentence was imposed. 
     
      
    31 However, error has been shown in that the Judge took into account aggravating factors under s 21A(2) that were not relevant. The question, therefore, is whether this Court should conclude that no lesser sentence was warranted. In my view, notwithstanding the seriousness of the applicant’s criminal conduct over a period of more than 6 months, a total sentence of six and a half years was excessive in light of the fact that the applicant had no relevant prior criminal history, that the offending was part of a single course of criminal conduct and the applicant’s rehabilitation. Still the sentence must be a relatively lengthy one. 
     
      
    32 His Honour found special circumstances. I would sustain that finding with some reservations but the diminution of the overall non-parole period cannot be great as there appears to be little need for the applicant to undergo an extensive period of parole supervision and there is no other reason to reduce the appropriate non-parole period. The sentences I propose have been discounted by approximately 25 per cent for the pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    33 I propose that the appeal be allowed in part. The sentences in respect of the two offences of passing a valueless cheque should be quashed and in lieu the applicant sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for six months to date from 18 June 2004 and which expired on 17 December 2004. The sentence for the offence of using a false implement and taking into account the Form 1 matters should be quashed and in lieu the applicant sentenced to imprisonment for four years and six months. That sentence should date from 18 December 2004. There should be a non-parole period specified of 2 years 6 months from the same date and to expire on 17 March 2007, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. 
     
      
    34 HALL J:  I have read the draft judgment and with respect agree with the reasons and orders proposed.35 THE COURT: Since orders were made in this matter on 20 April 2004 it has come to the Court's notice that there is an incongruity between the order made specifying the length of the non-parole period for the offence of using a false implement and the specification of the date upon which that period expires. The order states that the non-parole is a period of 2 years 6 months to date from 18 December 2004 and is to expire on 17 March 2007. However, a period of 2 years and 6 months from 18 December 2004 would expire on 17 June 2007. The Court intended that the period of the non-parole period should be as specified and, therefore, the expiry date is incorrect.36. The order sentencing the applicant for the offence of using a false implement should be amended to read: The sentence for the offence of using a false implement and taking into account the Form 1 matters should be quashed and in lieu the applicant sentenced to imprisonment for four years and six months. That sentence should date from 18 December 2004. There should be a non-parole period specified of 2 years 6 months from the same date and to expire on 17 June 2007, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole.

     REGINA v Sharon Mary PEARSON 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: Sharon Mary Pearson applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on her in the District Court on 30 June 2004 by her Honour Judge English, after she had pleaded guilty to:- 
     
      
       
      (1) three counts of aggravated indecent assault, being offences under s 61M(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for seven years, the circumstances of aggravation relied on by the Crown being that the victim was under the age of sixteen years. 
       
       
      (2) one count of using a child under the age of fourteen years for pornographic purposes, an offence under s 91G(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for seven years. 
       
       
      (3) one count of being a principal in the second degree to another person doing something intending to hinder the investigation of a serious indictable offence, an offence under s 315(1)(a) and s 345 of the  
      Crimes Act 
       for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for seven years. 
       
      
    2 The victim of each of the first four offences, that is the three offences of aggravated indecent assault and the offence of using a child under the age of fourteen years for pornographic purposes was a girl born in September 1989, who I will refer to as “the complainant”. The first offence of aggravated indecent assault was committed on an occasion between 1 December 2002 and 23 February 2003. The second, third and fourth offences, that is the other two offences of aggravated indecent assault and the offence under s 315(1)(a) and s 345 of the Crimes Act, were committed on an occasion between 1 March 2003 and 31 March 2003.  
     
      
    3 In sentencing the applicant on the first count Judge English took into account pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act two further aggravated indecent assaults on the complainant committed on the same occasion between 1 December 2002 and 23 February 2003 and an offence that on 6 April 2003 she knowingly made to a member of the police force a false representation such as called for investigation by a member of the police force, an offence under s 547B(1) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for twelve months. 
     
      
    4 In sentencing the applicant on the second count Judge English took into account pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act six further offences, which were all committed on the same occasion between 1 March 2003 and 31 March 2003, consisting of four offences of an aggravated act of indecency towards the complainant, being offences under s 61O(1) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for five years, and two offences of aggravated indecent assault on the complainant. 
     
      
    5 The last offence for which the applicant was sentenced, of being a principal in the second degree in an offence under s 315(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, was committed on 29 April 2003. The principal in the first degree was a girl born on 5 May 1987, who I will refer to as “SLM”. 
     
      
    6 The sentences imposed by Judge English were as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) for the offence charged in count 1 and taking into account the three further offences, a non-parole period of imprisonment for eighteen months commencing on 25 March 2004 and expiring on 24 September 2005, with a balance of the sentence of eighteen months, making a total sentence of three years. 
       
       
      (2) for the offence charged in count 2 and taking into account the six further offences, a non-parole period of imprisonment for eighteen months commencing on 25 March 2004 and expiring on 24 September 2005 with a balance of the sentence of two years, making a total sentence of three and a half years.  
       
       
      (3) for the offence charged in count 3 a fixed term of imprisonment of one year commencing on 25 March 2004 and expiring on 24 March 2005. 
       
       
      (4) for the offence charged in count 4 a fixed term of imprisonment of eighteen months commencing on 25 March 2004 and expiring on 24 September 2005. 
       
       
      (5) for the last offence a non-parole period of imprisonment for six months commencing on 25 September 2005 and expiring on 24 March 2006 with a balance of the sentence of one year, making a total sentence of eighteen months. 
       
      
    7 The overall effect of the sentences was that the applicant was sentenced to sentences totalling three and a half years with non-parole periods or fixed terms of imprisonment totalling two years. 
     
      
    8 The date 25 March 2004 from which Judge English made most of the sentences she imposed commence was the date on which the proceedings on sentence had been conducted and the applicant had gone into custody. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was sentenced at the same time as a male co-offender Robert James Weston, who had pleaded guilty to the same offences and had asked for the same further offences to be taken into account, except that the third offence to be taken into account in sentencing him for the first offence was a separate offence under s 547B(1) of the Crimes Act and the offence under s 315(1)(a) of the Crimes Act was alleged to be an offence under s 315(1)(a) and s 346 of the Crimes Act rather than s 315(1)(a) and s 345 of the Crimes Act. On this application no submission was made on behalf of the applicant that there was any lack of parity or proper proportionality between the sentences imposed on the applicant and the sentences imposed on Weston and there is accordingly no need to set out the sentences which were imposed on Weston. It would appear that Weston has not sought to appeal against the sentences imposed on him. 
     
      
    10 On 30 June 2004 Judge English delivered one set of remarks on sentence for both the applicant and Weston. Her Honour began her remarks on sentence by summarising the offences of both offenders. At p 4 of her remarks her Honour began a long section of her remarks by saying that “the facts and circumstances giving rise to the charges against Robert James Weston are as follows”. At p 20 of her remarks her Honour began another section of the remarks by saying that “the facts and circumstances giving rise to the offences committed by Sharon Mary Pearson are as follows”. Her Honour did, however, say a number of things between p 4 and p 20 of her remarks which were clearly intended by her to apply to both offenders. 
     
      
    11 The facts of the offences committed by the applicant, as stated by her Honour at pp 20-21 of her remarks, were based on a set of agreed facts and were as follows (substituting the expression “the complainant” for the complainant’s real name):- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        She and her co-offender have been in a relationship for several years and she regularly visited the co-offender and stayed overnight at his home. The offender met (the complainant) through the co-offender’s daughter Clair and she was aware that both girls were aged thirteen. In the early part of 2003 (the complainant) commenced part time employment with the Do-nut King in ….. The offender was the manager of the business during the relevant period. From time to time (the complainant) slept at the co-offender’s home overnight when she was required to work with the offender the following day. The offender accompanied the co-offender and his children and (the complainant) to Queensland on holiday in December 2002. 
        
       
       
        
        On an occasion after that holiday, but before 23 February 2003, the offender Pearson encouraged (the complainant) to strip naked and a digital camera was produced and a number of photos taken. Those photographs included shots of the offender lying naked on top of (the complainant) with their genitals in close proximity. Shots of the offender and (the complainant) kneeling naked together and shots of (the complainant) sitting naked on the co-offender’s lower stomach area holding his penis. In each instance two of the three are depicted in the photographs whilst the third person took the photo. After the photos were taken they were burnt onto a compact disk and it was kept in the co-offender’s house. 
        
       
       
        
        During another occasion in March 2003 the offender persuaded (the complainant) to strip naked with themselves in the loungeroom of the co-offender’s house. Whilst all three were naked a 35 millimetre camera was produced and a number of photographs were taken. Those photographs included shots of (the complainant) holding the co-offender Weston’s erect penis near her mouth, shots of the co-offender Weston with his face near (the complainant’s) vagina, shots of the co-offender Weston placing his penis touching the area near (the complainant’s) vagina and anus and shots of the offender and (the complainant) in positions where their genitalia were in close proximity.” 
        
       
      
    12 In her remarks on sentence her Honour then referred to what she had said earlier in her remarks in stating the facts of the co-offender’s offences. Her Honour had said (substituting SLM and KM for the real names of two of the persons concerned):- 
     
      
       
        
        “On 6 April 2003 the co-offender Pearson deposited several rolls of 35 millimetre film for processing at Big W. She left her name and the offender Weston’s home telephone number with the films. One of the rolls of film was the one containing the nude photographs during March 2003. After the film was developed the nature of the photographs was noticed by the staff of the shop and police were contacted. Later that day police attended the offender Weston’s house and spoke to both offenders. Both said the young girl in the photographs was named (giving the first name of the complainant), they did not know her last name or where she lived, and that she was seventeen or eighteen years old. Both accompanied police to … Police Station and signed statements to that effect. Neither was arrested at that time. 
        
       
       
        
        The police continued their enquiries in an attempt to ascertain the identity of the girl in the photographs. On 28 April 2003 police again spoke with the offender Weston at his house in …. He again told police he did not know the surname of the girl in the photographs or how to contact her. 
        
       
       
        
        Later on 28 April 2003 the offender (ie Weston) made a telephone call to the mobile phone of SLM and asked her when she was born. She told him her date of birth was 5 May 1987. After several further telephone calls the offenders went to SML’s house and met with her and her mother KM. Both offenders asked SLM to go to …….Police Station and say she was the girl in the nude photographs and that she was seventeen years old. After quite a bit of discussion and persuasion both SLM and KM agreed. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 8am on 29 April 2003 the complainant’s mother, attended …..Police Station and was shown the 35 millimetre nude photos. She identified her daughter ….. in those photos and told police that (she) was thirteen years old. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 8.45am on 29 April 2003 the co-offender Pearson attended ……Police Station with KM and SLM. The co-offender told police that SLM was the girl in the nude photos. SLM and KM were shown the 35 millimetre nude photos and SLM told the police that the young person shown was her. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 3pm on 29 April 2003 police commenced to interview the complainant at the office of the Joint Investigation Response Team. During the interview the complainant told the police she had participated in making the photos on several occasions. She said that she did not engage in any form of sexual intercourse. She said that she participated in what happened because both co-offenders ‘pressured her’ into doing it without threats, but by ‘nagging’ her and ‘daring’ her. While the interview was being conducted with the complainant, other police were attempting to locate the offenders. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 3.50pm on 29 April 2003 the offender Weston was seen by police driving a 4-wheel drive …. He was accompanied by the co-offender. A car chase ensued through the streets of ….. Police activated their warning devices and the offender was clearly attempting to evade capture. The vehicle was eventually stopped near a school and both offenders were arrested. 
        
       
       
        
        At 5.30pm police executed a search warrant at the offender’s house. Among a number of items seized by police was the compact disk that contained the photographs of the complainant taken with a digital camera between December 2002 and 23 February 2003”. 
        
       
      
    13 Between p 8 and p 20 of her remarks on sentence her Honour, while mainly dealing with the co-offender Weston, said a number of things which were clearly intended by her Honour also to apply to the applicant. 
     
      
    14 At p 9 her Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “On 20 June 2003 SLM was interviewed by police. She told police that the co-offenders had pressured her into agreeing to go to the police station and lie about being the girl in the photographs. She said both offenders told her what was in the photographs so that she could describe them to police if necessary. She also told police a copy of her birth certificate was made, with the date of her birth altered by the offenders to indicate that she was born in 1986 when in fact she was born in 1987”. 
        
       
      
    15 In her remarks her Honour noted that the complainant had been interviewed by the police. The complainant had said that it was the applicant who “pressured” and “nagged” her into taking her clothes off and posing with the co-offender and the applicant. The applicant had assured the complainant that the complainant would not be required to do it again but, according to the complainant, “it ends up being all the same again”. In the interview the complainant said that she had been frightened that, if she did not comply, she would lose her job. 
     
      
    16 In her remarks her Honour described all of the offences as objectively serious. She accepted that there had not been any acts of violence or threats of violence by the offenders and that there had not been any use of drugs or alcohol to procure the complainant’s compliance. Her Honour found that the activities of the two offenders had constituted more than a game. There had not been an isolated act and a single photograph but multiple acts on two occasions. The complainant had been photographed performing degrading and humiliating acts and the photographs had been taken by the applicant for developing. Whether the complainant had consented was irrelevant, having regard to the complainant ‘s age, but her Honour found that the complainant had not in fact been a willing participant. 
     
      
    17 Her Honour found that the offences committed by both offenders under s 315(1)(a) of the Crimes Act were objectively serious. Her Honour found that the efforts made by both offenders to avoid conviction and punishment contradicted the evidence of both offenders, and particularly that of the applicant, that she had not seen anything wrong in her activities with the complainant. 
     
      
    18 After stating the facts of the offences committed by the applicant and commenting on their objective seriousness, her Honour dealt with the subjective features of the applicant. 
     
      
    19 At the time of sentencing the applicant was twenty-five years old. Until taken into custody she had been living with her parents. The relationship with Weston had been her first and only serious relationship with a man. On the basis of the evidence of the complainant, SLM and KM and of her observations of the applicant giving evidence in the proceedings on sentence, her Honour rejected an opinion expressed in a pre-sentence report that the applicant “does not present as a strong person or a principal in initiating events”. Her Honour found that the applicant had displayed “an extraordinary strength of character in challenging both the Crown and myself”. Her Honour noted that the applicant had a previous offence of larceny as a clerk, which had been dealt with under s 556A of the Crimes Act (since repealed). The applicant’s employer, knowing of the present charges, had continued to employ her up until the time she went into custody. 
     
      
    20 In her remarks her Honour referred to the question of whether the applicant had evinced any contrition and to the discount which would be allowed for the applicant’s pleas of guilty. I will return to both of these matters in dealing with the applicant’s grounds of appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    21 Her Honour accepted that the applicant had never previously been in custody, that because of the nature of her offences the conditions of her custody under any sentence of imprisonment would be likely to be more than usually onerous and that the applicant would be likely to suffer extra curial punishment from neighbours and the community upon being released from custody. 
     
      
    22 I turn now to the applicant’s grounds of appeal against the sentences imposed on her. 
     
      
       
      1. The sentencing judge took into account as an aggravating feature of the offence the fact that the complainant was vulnerable having regard to her age, when the complainant’s age was an element of the offence 
       
      
    23 The first three offences for which the applicant was sentenced were offences under s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act. The offences which were taken into account in sentencing the applicant for the first offence (apart from the offence under s 547B(1) of the Crimes Act) were other offences under s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act. The offences which were taken into account in sentencing the applicant for the second offence were offences under either s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act or s 61O(1) of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    24 Section 61M(1) of the Crimes Act provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Any person who assaults another person in circumstances of aggravation, and, at the time of, or immediately before or after, the assault, commits an act of indecency on or in the presence of the other person, is liable to imprisonment for 7 years”. 
        
       
      
    25 Section 61M(3) of the Crimes Act provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In this section,  
        circumstances of aggravation 
         means circumstances in which:  
         
        (a) the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons, or 
         
        (b) the alleged victim is under the age of 16 years, or 
         
        (c) the alleged victim is (whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) under the authority of the alleged offender, or 
         
        (d) the alleged victim has a serious physical disability, or 
         
        (e) the alleged victim has a serious intellectual disability”. 
        
       
      
    26 In the prosecution of the applicant and Weston the Crown could have selected any one of the circumstances in pars (a), (b) or (c) of s 61M(3) as being circumstances of aggravation within s 61M(1). However, as is shown by the indictment and her Honour’s remarks on sentence, the circumstances selected by the Crown as making each offence an aggravated offence within s 61M(1) were that the victim (the complainant) was under the age of sixteen years. 
     
      
    27 At p 17 of her remarks on sentence her Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I am, of course, required for the purposes of counts 2, 3 and 4 to have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors under Part (sic) 21A and the relevant aggravating features are that the offences were committed in company, that there was an abuse of trust and the victim was vulnerable having regard to her age”. 
        
       
      
    28 The reference by her Honour to “Part” 21A was clearly intended by her Honour to be a reference to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Her Honour was also obliged to have regard to s 21A of the Act in its present form in sentencing the applicant for the offence charged in the first count, because although that offence might have been committed before 1 February 2003, when the present s 21A commenced, the present s 21A applies to the determination of a sentence for any offence, whenever committed (except in certain circumstances, which did not apply in the present case). 
     
      
    29 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that the sentencing judge, in identifying the fact that the victim was vulnerable having regard to her age as a circumstance of aggravation within s 21A (s 21A(2)(l)), had contravened the concluding words of s 21A(2), namely:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence”. 
        
       
      
    30 Counsel for the applicant referred to R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193, R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 and R v Mohamadin [2004] NSWCCA 401, in all of which it was held that the sentencing judge had erred by taking into account as a circumstance of aggravation a matter which was an element of the offence charged. 
     
      
    31 On this application the Crown accepted that, on the face of the remarks on sentence, there had been a breach of the concluding words in s 21A(2). However, the Crown sought to refer to part of the transcript of the argument in the proceedings on sentence as showing that the sentencing judge had taken into account the complainant’s age and consequent vulnerability in a permissible manner. No objection was raised by counsel for the applicant to the Crown seeking to supplement her Honour’s remarks on sentence by something her Honour had said in argument in the proceedings on sentence. 
     
      
    32 In the part of the transcript of the proceedings on sentence relied on by the Crown the applicant’s legal representative in the proceedings on sentence is recorded as having submitted that, if the complainant had been over the age of sixteen, no offence under s 61M(1) would have been committed. Her Honour replied:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Well she is not, she’s thirteen Mr Smyth. It’s like saying that sixteen is close to thirteen, it’s not, there’s three years difference and that’s a big three years in the maturity of a young girl”. 
        
       
      
    33 It was submitted by the Crown that her Honour had been entitled to take into account, not the bare fact that the complainant was under the age of sixteen years, but that she was only thirteen years old and more vulnerable than if she had been closer to sixteen. 
     
      
    34 By way of analogy the Crown referred to R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 in which it was said at pars (106) and (107) that the bare fact that an offence was committed in company (s 21A(2)(e)), where that is an element of the offence, cannot have an additional effect but that nevertheless the nature and extent of the company and the manner in which their presence and behaviour add to the menace of the occasion are relevant to the seriousness of the offence charged. 
     
      
    35 In my opinion, the Crown’s submissions should be accepted and I would not uphold the first ground of appeal in relation to the first three counts. I would, however, add that if, as I have been persuaded that her Honour did, her Honour took into account the complainant’s age in the way submitted by the Crown on this application, her Honour should have explicitly said so in her remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    36 The fourth offence for which the applicant was sentenced was an offence under s 91G of the Crimes Act. Section 91G was amended, after March 2003 when the fourth offence was committed and before the applicant was sentenced by her Honour. At the time the offence was committed s 91G(1) of the Crimes Act was in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Any person 
        :  
         
        (a) who uses a child for pornographic purposes, or 
         
        (b) who causes or procures a child to be so used, or 
         
        (c) who, having the care (but not necessarily entitled by law to have the custody) of a child, consents to the child being so used or allows the child to be so used, 
         
        is liable to imprisonment for 5 years or, if the child is under the age of 14 years, to imprisonment for 7 years”. 
        
       
      
    37 In both the indictment and at pp 1-2 of the remarks on sentence the fourth offence was described as being an offence of using the complainant, a child under the age of fourteen years, for pornographic purposes, that is to say the circumstance of aggravation that the child was under the age of fourteen years was included as an element in the offence charged. Her Honour included the offence charged in the fourth count in the offences for which she said that a circumstance of aggravation was that the victim was “vulnerable having regard to her age”. It may be that her Honour was misled by the amendments which had been made to s 91G by the time she came to sentence the applicant and by some submissions which were made to her by the Crown’ representative in the proceedings on sentence. However, in my opinion, it is clear that in sentencing the applicant for the offence charged in the fourth count, which included as an element of the offence charged that the child was under the age of fourteen years, her Honour, in contravention of the concluding words of s 21A(2), took into account as a circumstance of aggravation that the complainant (who was then thirteen and a half) was under the age of fourteen. The argument by the Crown which I have held should succeed in relation to counts 1, 2 and 3 is not available in relation to count 4. I uphold the first ground of appeal in relation to the offence charged in count 4. 
     
      
       
      2. The sentencing judge gave insufficient weight to the applicant’s pleas of guilty 
       
      
    38 The applicant pleaded guilty to all of the offences for which she was sentenced. At par 24 of her remarks on sentence Judge English said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I have allowed a 20 per cent discount for her pleas. Her pleas, as do the pleas of Mr Weston, show both utilitarian value and demonstrate some contrition”. 
        
       
      
    39 In the proceedings on sentence the Crown’s legal representative had expressly conceded that both offenders had pleaded guilty “at the first available opportunity”.  
     
      
    40 As to contrition, I have already quoted what her Honour said at p 24 of her remarks to the effect that the applicant had shown some contrition. However, elsewhere in her remarks on sentence, her Honour unfavourably compared the applicant with the co-offender, who she found was truly contrite. At p 18 of the remarks her Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst I find that the offender Mr Weston is truly remorseful and contrite, the same cannot be said for Miss Pearson”. 
        
       
      
    41 At pp 23-24 of her remarks on sentence her Honour found that “the deep regret for her actions”, which the applicant had expressed to the Probation and Parole Officer who prepared a pre-sentence report, arose from the situation in which the applicant found herself, rather than being a true expression of contrition. 
     
      
    42 On this application counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity, yet the sentencing judge had allowed a discount of only 20 per cent for the applicant’s pleas of guilty and had not given any reasons for not allowing a discount of 25 per cent simply for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    43 Counsel for the applicant referred to R v Johnstone [2004] NSWCCA 307 (a decision handed down on 10 September 2004, after Judge English had sentenced the applicant), a case in which the sentencing judge had allowed a discount of 15 per cent for the offender’s pleas of guilty, in which Sully J, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, said at par 28:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        In my opinion, her Honour’s approach to the quantification of the particular discount to be allowed in recognition of the applicant’s pleas of guilty is attended by error; but for my own part I would not find the error, either explicitly or implicitly, in the bare figure of 15 per cent upon which her Honour settled. It seems to me, rather, that the error lies in the total absence of any explanation of the decision to set the figure at 15 per cent rather than at a figure of or approaching 25 per cent. That is not to say that there was, in my view, any need for a page or two of discursive argument and analysis. I do think, however, that the thrust of the guideline judgment in  
        Thomson and Houlton 
         does entail that in a case of the present kind a sentencing Judge might well come to the conclusion that there were factors, whether individual factors or a number of factors taken in combination, justifying a discount of less, and even significantly less, than the guideline maximum of 25 per cent; but it seems to me to be in accord with relevant principle that a sentencing Judge who has concluded that a just discount is at the lower rather than at the higher end of the guideline range, ought to give at least a brief, clear and simple explanation of the process of reasoning that has led the Judge to that conclusion”. 
         
         
        
       
      
    44 This paragraph in Sully J’s judgment in Johnstone was quoted with approval in R v Castles [2005] NSWCCA 79 at par (23) by Santow JA, with whom the other members of the Court agreed. 
     
      
    45 Counsel for the Crown submitted that the 10 per cent to 25 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 419 (160) was merely a guideline; that it did not create any entitlement to a particular discount in a given case (R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 286 at (28)); that her Honour had found that the applicant had shown very little contrition; and that the discount of 20 per cent which her Honour had allowed was, unlike the discount of 15 per cent allowed by the sentencing judge in Johnstone, not towards the lower end of the range of 10 per cent to 25 per cent. 
     
      
    46 The Crown referred to what was said by Howie J, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, in R v Hanslow [2004] NSWCCA 163 at (27). What Howie J said at par 27 does not, in my opinion, lend unequivocal support to the Crown’s submissions. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Before leaving this ground I should remark that, notwithstanding what I have written above, I do not understand why his Honour was not prepared to give the applicant the benefit of a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of her pleas, particularly taking into account her admissions and ready assistance to police in what otherwise might have been a complex case. Even though  
        Thomson and Houlton 
         (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 makes it clear that the assessment of the discount to be awarded for the utilitarian value of the plea is a matter of discretion, it is a discretion that has to be exercised judicially. In the absence of any reasons for not giving a discount at the top of the range in the circumstances of the present case, I can only assume, with respect, that his Honour has either determined that no case should merit the full discount approved in the guideline judgment or has some misunderstanding of the considerations which are to be taken into account in determining the appropriate discount. However, in the present case I do not believe that the failure to discount the sentence by more than 20 per cent is alone an error vitiating his sentencing discretion”. 
        
       
      
    47 I have come to the conclusion that this ground of appeal should not be upheld.  
     
      
    48 On a fair reading of her Honour’s remarks on sentence as a whole, I consider that her Honour should be regarded as having found that the applicant had shown very little contrition, so that the discount of 20 per cent allowed by her Honour was almost entirely attributable to the utilitarian value of the applicant’s pleas of guilty. Accordingly, the amount of the discount allowed by her Honour, unlike the amount of the discount allowed in Johnstone and Castles, was not towards the lower end of the range of 10 per cent to 25 per cent. In Castles the sentencing judge had allowed a discount of only 14 per cent. A trial in the present case, unlike in Johnstone and Castles both of which involved a large number of charges of offences of dishonesty, would not have been a complex trial. The complexity of the trial which the offenders’ pleas of guilty had avoided was expressly referred to by Sully J in Johnstone and Santow JA in Castles. 
     
      
       
      3. Her Honour made a mistake of fact in relation to the applicant’s criminal antecedents 
       
      
    49 In the proceedings on sentence the applicant’s criminal history was tendered. The document read:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Crt Date Court Name Charge Date Charge No 
         
        Status Offence Sentence 
        
       
      ____________________________________________________ 
       
       
      23/01/1997 Belmont Local Court 21/09/1996 H999992863647 
       
      CV 001 1 Larceny as a Clerk Recog S556A $1,000 12 
       
       Months” 
       
      
    50 At par 23 of her remarks on sentence her Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “She has on her criminal record an entry of larceny as a clerk, although she was granted the benefit of s 556A of the Crimes Act, as it then was. She was fined $1000.00 and placed on a good behaviour bond for twelve months”.  
        
       
      
    51 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that her Honour had misinterpreted the applicant’s criminal history. The figure of $1000.00 was not the amount of a fine imposed on the applicant but the amount of the recognisance under s 556A of the Crimes Act.  Counsel for the applicant referred to R v Ingrassia (1996) 41 NSWLR 447, in which it was held that a judge or magistrate dealing with an offender under s 556A of the Crimes Act had no power to require the offender to pay a fine as a condition of discharging the offender on a recognisance. Counsel for the applicant submitted that, by supposing that the applicant had been fined $1000, the sentencing judge had regarded the applicant’s previous offence as more serious than it really was.  
     
      
    52 The Crown did not contest that Judge English had misinterpreted the document setting out the applicant’s previous criminal history. However, it was submitted by the Crown that the error had not played any significant part in her Honour’s sentencing decisions. The applicant had given evidence in the proceedings on sentence that the charge of larceny as a clerk had arisen out of the applicant’s stealing a set of cutlery. Accordingly, the sentencing judge had been aware of the nature of the offence and the sentencing judge had been aware that the provisions of s 556A had been applied in favour of the applicant, indicating that the offence was not a serious one. In her remarks on sentence her Honour found that the applicant, unlike the co-offender, had no criminal antecedents of a like nature to the offences for which she was being sentenced. 
     
      
    53 This ground of appeal has been made out but I accept the Crown’s submission that her Honour’s error did not play any significant part in her sentencing decisions. 
     
      
       
      4. The sentencing judge erred in making findings of fact which were unsupported by any evidence, namely: 
       
       
      (a) that the offenders were “grooming” the complainant and 
       
      (b) that the offenders intended to publish the photographs of the complainant  
       
      
    54 I will deal in turn with parts (a) and (b) of the ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      As to (a):- 
       
      
    55 At p 15 of the remarks on sentence her Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Contrary to the submissions I find they were grooming this young girl”. 
        
       
      
    56 It is not immediately clear what her Honour meant by the word “grooming”. 
     
      
    57 Counsel for the applicant submitted that her Honour should be taken as meaning that the offenders were preparing the complainant to participate in more serious offences than the offences for which the offenders were being sentenced. In support of this submission counsel for the applicant referred to question and answer 516 in a recorded interview of the co-offender by the police. The question and answer were as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Were you grooming … 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were you grooming….this young girl to form a sexual relationship with her -  
         
        A. No”. 
        
       
      
    58 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that, although the question and answer in the interview of the co-offender were not admissible in the sentencing of the applicant and the imputation in question 516 had been denied by the co-offender, the question nevertheless threw light on what the sentencing judge had meant by the word “grooming” when it was used by her in her remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    59 The Crown submitted that the word “grooming” at p 15 of her Honour’s remarks should be interpreted according to its context. Immediately before the remark which I have quoted her Honour had said “…I find the activities of these two offenders constitute more than just a game”. Immediately after the remark which I have quoted her Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There is not one isolated act and a photograph taken, there are multiple acts on two separate occasions. Her lack of protestation on the first occasion has clearly been taken by them as encouragement to continue with their illegal activities”. 
        
       
      
    60 The Crown submitted that when the word “grooming” was read in context it should be taken as meaning “grooming the complainant to participate in the kinds of activities in respect of which they (the offenders) were being sentenced. That is the indecent assaults/acts and the posing for and the taking of the photographs”. 
     
      
    61 The Crown referred to answers given by the complainant at pp 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 of an interview of the complainant by the police in which the complainant said that she had been pressed by the applicant to commit or simulate sexual acts. 
     
      
    62 I agree with the Crown that the word “grooming” should be interpreted in the context of the remarks on sentence. I have referred to what immediately preceded and what immediately followed her Honour’s remark about “grooming”. However, a little later in the remarks on sentence (at p 16) her Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It defies logic that the next step would not be for these offenders to engage this girl in their advertised sexual activity. They are, of course, not facing sentence in that regard, but I make mention of it, because it is obvious and open on the evidence to make such a finding”. 
        
       
      
    63 Elsewhere in the remarks on sentence her Honour said at p 10, with reference to the co-offender:- 
     
      
       
        
        “He denied grooming (the complainant) with a view to having a sexual relationship with her”. 
        
       
      
    64 Her Honour began the sentence in which the word “grooming” appears at p 15 of her remarks by saying “contrary to the submissions”. Fairly lengthy submissions were made to her Honour in the proceedings on sentence by both the co-offender’s legal representative and by the applicant’s legal representative. The submissions made by the co-offender’s legal representative included a submission that the acts in which the offenders had engaged had not gone beyond a game of sexual experimentation. The submissions made by the applicant’s legal representative included the following submissions:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The very idea that Ms Pearson would be encouraging an activity which could eventually lead to a sexual involvement of a more traditional sort between the young girl and Mr Weston is something that is obviously, was quite foreign to her thinking. She still loves him. He is almost forty and she is twenty-five, she was twenty-five when this occurred. He is her only boyfriend. He is the only man that she has had physical connection with”. 
        
       
      
    65 In my opinion, her Honour should be taken as having meant in what she said at par 15 of her remarks that, contrary to the submissions which had been made to her, she was making a finding that the offenders were preparing the complainant to participate in more serious offences than the offences for which the offenders were being sentenced. I note that such an interpretation is in accordance with one of the principal dictionary meanings of the verb “groom”, that is to “prepare” some person or thing (see the Macquarie Dictionary). I do not consider that there was evidence on which her Honour could have made such a finding to the requisite standard, that is beyond reasonable doubt. In any event, it would be fraught with the risk of error for her Honour, in sentencing the offenders for the present offences, to take into account what “the next step” would be. 
     
      
    66 I consider that this part of ground four has been made out. 
     
      
       
      As to (b):- 
       
       
      This part of the ground of appeal was based on the following passage in her Honour’s remarks on sentence:- 
       
       
        
        “Not only was this girl required to perform these degrading and humiliating acts but she was also photographed. Not only was she photographed but the photographs were taken for developing and the digital images were not simply viewed on a computer and deleted but burnt onto a CD for posterity with the potential for publication which, of course, the offender Weston denies”. 
        
       
      
    67 Counsel for the applicant submitted that “there was no evidence that either offender intended to distribute these photographs on the Internet or indeed anywhere else”. However, her Honour did not make any finding that either offender intended to distribute the photographs. Her Honour merely found that there was a potential for publication. In my opinion, her Honour was entitled to find as a fact relevant to the objective seriousness of the offences that the activities in which the offenders and the complainant had engaged had been photographed or had had digital images taken of them which had been preserved, so that there was a potential for publication.  
     
      
    68 I would reject this part of this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      5. The sentence was manifestly excessive 
       
      
    69 It is convenient to consider this ground of appeal at the same time as a submission made by the Crown that, even if there had been an error or errors in the sentencing of the applicant, nevertheless no less severe sentences were warranted (Criminal Appeal Act s6(3)). This submission raises the issue:- 
     
      
       
      Were less severe sentences warranted 
       
      
    70 Counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentences imposed on the applicant were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    71 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that matters lessening the objective gravity of the offences under s 61M, 61O and s 91G were that there had been no actual touching of the complainant’s genitalia, that although pressure had been exerted on the complainant to participate in the poses with the applicant or the co-offender no threats had been made to her and that there was no evidence that the applicant, as distinct from the co-offender, had obtained any sexual gratification from the commission of the offences. All of these offences had been committed on just two occasions, that is one occasion between 1 December 2002 and 23 February 2003 and one occasion in March 2003. 
     
      
    72 Counsel for the applicant referred to subjective features of the applicant, including that she was a twenty-four year old woman at the time of the offences, that she had no relevant previous criminal history, that she had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and that, having regard to the nature of the offences, she would serve any sentences imposed in protective custody. 
     
      
    73 Counsel for the applicant referred to statistics of sentences for aggravated indecent assault kept by the Judicial Commission, showing that only about 40 per cent of offenders had received full-time custodial sentences and that of those offenders who had received full-time custodial sentences only 17 per cent had received longer sentences than the applicant. 
     
      
    74 Counsel for the Crown submitted that for a number of reasons the sentences imposed on the applicant were not manifestly excessive and that no less severe sentences were warranted. 
     
      
    75 In my opinion, the submissions by the Crown should be accepted.  
     
      
    76 It is difficult to determine from the photographs whether there was any actual touching of the complainant’s genitalia but certainly her naked genitalia are photographed in close proximity to parts of the body of both the applicant and the co-offender, including the co-offender’s erect penis. 
     
      
    77 Although her Honour found in favour of the offenders that there had been no threats made to the complainant, her Honour found that the complainant had been induced to participate by pressure exerted on her by the applicant. In inducing the complainant to participate the applicant had abused a position of authority she had as manager of the business in which the complainant worked and hoped to continue working. 
     
      
    78 The applicant was sentenced for three offences of aggravated indecent assault and one offence of using a child under the age of fourteen years for pornographic purposes. In sentencing the applicant for the first offence of aggravated indent assault three further offences had to be taken into account. In sentencing the applicant for the second offence of aggravated indecent assault six further offences had to be taken into account. 
     
      
    79 The offences were committed by the applicant in company with the co-offender. Her Honour rejected a suggestion in the pre-sentence report that the applicant did not present as a person of strong personality or as a principal in initiating events and found, to the contrary, that the applicant was a person of strong character. This finding by her Honour, who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the applicant give evidence, was open to her Honour and could not be set aside in this Court. 
     
      
    80 In sentencing the applicant for the offences under s 61M and s 91G her Honour made all of the sentences commence from the same date, with no cumulation of sentences. 
     
      
    81 The offences involving interference with the administration of justice, namely the offence under s 315(1)(a) and the offence under s 547B(1) which was to be taken into account in sentencing the applicant for the first offence of aggravated indecent assault, were serious offences. The applicant committed the offence under s 315(1)(a) in an attempt to avoid prosecution and punishment for the offences under s 61M, s 61O and s 91G. The offence included the applicant persuading another girl SLM and her mother to go to a police station and give false information to the police. The applicant accompanied SLM and her mother to the police station. The offence also involved the falsification of SLM’s birth certificate. The offence under s 547B involved the applicant making knowingly false assertions about the complainant in a statement the applicant made to the police. 
     
      
    82 I accept that the applicant had some favourable subjective features. On the other hand, I have concluded that the sentencing judge found that the applicant had shown very little contrition. The information placed before this Court about the applicant’s conditions of custody shows that, while the applicant is subject to a form of custody known as Limited Association, this form of custody is not the same as Strict Protection. The applicant associates with three other inmates, she has the opportunity of attending classes and she has access to all services provided by the Correctional Centre. 
     
      
    83 The statistics of sentences for aggravated indecent assault kept by the Judicial Commission are largely based on sentences imposed before the introduction of standard non-parole periods. All of the offences of aggravated indecent assault committed by the applicant, apart from the offences committed on the occasion between 1 December 2002 and 23 February 2003, which her Honour accepted might have been committed before 1 February 2003, were committed after 1 February 2003, that is after the introduction of standard non-parole periods. Although the standard non-parole period for offences under s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act was not directly applicable, because the applicant had pleaded guilty, this Court in R v Way commented at 182 (54) and 195 (142) that the likely effect of the introduction of standard non-parole periods is that the sentences for some of the offences for which standard non-parole periods have been set will increase. 
     
      
    84 I have concluded that no less severe sentences than those imposed by Judge English were warranted. Accordingly, while I would grant leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by her Honour, I would dismiss the appeal against those sentences. 
     
      
    85 HISLOP J: I agree with James J. 
     
      
    86 HALL, J: I have read the judgment of James, J. in draft and I agree with the reasons expressed in it and the orders proposed. 
     
      
    87 I would, however, add some additional observations upon Ground Four of the application which asserts that her Honour made findings of fact which were unsupported by evidence. 
     
      
    88 Senior counsel for the applicant, Mr. John Stratton, SC., specifically challenged a finding made by the sentencing judge which was expressed in terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… I find they were grooming this young girl.” 
        
       
      
    89 The submission put on behalf of the applicant was that this finding was intended to suggest that “the offenders were preparing to commit more serious offences upon her, such as sexual intercourse without consent” (written submissions, paragraph 44). 
     
      
    90 As I have indicated, I am in agreement with James, J., in particular, with his Honour’s statement:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… she (the sentencing judge) was making a finding that the offenders were preparing the complainant to participate in more serious offences than the offences for which the offenders were being sentenced …” (paragraph 65) 
        
       
      
    91 This was a significant finding for her Honour to make without evidence that met the criminal standard of proof. It was particularly significant for her Honour to make such a finding for the purposes of determining sentence. 
     
      
    92 I have additionally been concerned by her Honour’s further finding made shortly after the abovementioned finding that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… it defies logic that the next step would not be for these offenders to engage this girl in their advertised sexual activity. They are, of course, not facing sentence in that regard, but I make mention of it because it is obvious on the evidence to make such a finding.” 
        
       
      
    93 Firstly, even if it was relevant to determine what might occur as “the next step” that was a matter that could only be determined by evidence, not by the use of logic. Secondly, the supposed “next step” was, however, not either an element or an aggravating circumstance of the offences in question. Thirdly, this matter was not put to the applicant in cross-examination when she gave evidence on 25 March 2004. Fourthly, there is otherwise no evidence that meets the requisite standard to establish “the next step” finding. Fifthly, although her Honour observed that the applicant and her co-offender were not facing sentence on this basis, she nonetheless was influenced enough by it to make it the subject of a finding. 
     
      
    94 Mr. Stratton, SC. contended that the finding made as to “grooming” was in breach of principles enunciated in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. I do not see the principle enunciated by the majority in that case has direct application to the facts of this case, although it does emphasise the importance in determining what circumstances of aggravation may or may not be brought into account. The Court of Criminal appeal had held in De Simoni (supra) that case that it had not been permissible for the trial judge in imposing sentence to have regard to the fact of wounding as a circumstance of aggravation, it not having been charged in the indictment as required by the prescribed form of indictment. 
     
      
    95 Gibbs, CJ. (Mason and Murphy, JJ. agreeing) stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… however the general principle that the sentence imposed on an offender should take account of all the circumstances of the offence is subject to a more fundamental and important principle, that no-one should be punished for an offence of which he has not been convicted. Section 582 reflects this principle …” 
         (at p.389) 
        
       
      
    96 It was, of course, not an element in any charge brought against the applicant that she and her co-offender committed the various acts the subject of the charges with the intention of committing more serious criminal acts, as for example, an act prohibited by s.66C of the Crimes Act 1900 (Prohibition of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 14 years). Nor, for example, were they charged with attempting to commit such an offence. 
     
      
    97 There is substance in the submission of senior counsel for the applicant that her Honour did, however, take into account as aggravating circumstances her finding as to preparation or “grooming” by the applicant and her co-offender for a more serious offence or offences. Her Honour made specific findings in terms referred to in paragraphs 88 and 92 above and plainly such factual findings were made for the purpose of determining the appropriate sentence in this case. 
     
      
    98 In these circumstances, the important question arises as to whether or not the errors in sentencing as identified by James, J. in relation to Ground Four of the application warrants the intervention of this Court on the basis that they resulted in a miscarriage of the sentencing process. 
     
      
    99 In order to answer this question, it is not without importance that the errors in sentencing to which I have referred amounted to substantive and not merely technical errors. On the other hand, both the number and seriousness of the offences to which the applicant entered pleas of guilty were central to the sentencing determination. 
     
      
    100 As to the latter, the objective seriousness of the offences is made plain by the evidence before the sentencing judge which was analysed in some considerable detail in her remarks on sentence of 30 June 2004. On the other hand, there is a principle, and it is a fundamental one, that an offender must only be sentenced on the facts and circumstances that fall within the ambit of the charge or charges particularised in the indictment. I have made it clear that the erroneous findings did not lead the sentencing judge to impose a sentence for offences other than those with which the applicant was charged. However, it is clear that her Honour regarded those findings as aggravating circumstances but in circumstances where they had not been proven to the requisite standard and did not in any event arise on the indictment. 
     
      
    101 In accordance with the principles stated in House v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 499, if the judge “mistakes the facts” in the sense there discussed or acts in accordance with wrong principle, then such findings are to be set aside or the error corrected. In that event, the Court may reach the opinion that some other sentence should have been passed and might pass that other sentence, should it be warranted in law: Regina v. Khouzame [2000] NSWCCA 505 [41] per Greg James, J. 
     
      
    102 When error of either kind arises, then it is wholly appropriate to give effect to the relevant provisions of s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and for this Court to consider for itself whether or not a different sentence, be it a greater or lesser one is “warranted in law”: Regina v. Cocking [1999] NSWCCA 311 [22] per Sully, J. See also Regina v. Stephen Lorne Astill (No. 2) (1992) 64 A. Crim. R. 289 at 303-304 per Lee, AJ. 
     
      
    103 In this regard, I have given close consideration to the facts established by the evidence and the remarks on sentence. Having done so, and not withstanding the observations which I have made, I have been unable to conclude that another sentence is “warranted in law” than that imposed by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    104 I accordingly agree with the orders proposed by James, J.

      2004/2101 Regina v Zaky MALLAH 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 21 March 2005 the Prisoner was indicted upon two counts alleging, in each case, that he did an act in preparation for or in the planning of a terrorist act, contrary to s 101.6(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth); and upon one further count of recklessly making to another person a threat to cause serious harm to a third person, being a Commonwealth public official, by reason of the status of that third person, contrary to s 147.2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995.  
     
      
    2 After a trial before a jury, he was, on 6 April 2005, acquitted of the first two counts. No verdict was taken in relation to the third count, for the reason that, on 29 March 2005 he changed his plea to one of guilty. He now stands for sentence on that third count. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 Although the Prisoner was acquitted of Counts 1 and 2, the offence to which he pleaded guilty was so closely connected with the facts, upon the basis of which those charges were preferred, that it is necessary to recount the full history of the events which preceded his arrest on 3 December 2003.  
     
      
    4 On 21 May 2002 the Prisoner applied to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) for a passport. He was interviewed by officers of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), and on 7 June 2002 he was advised that his application was refused, by reason of an assessment that he was likely to engage in conduct that might prejudice the security of Australia or of a foreign country.  
     
      
    5 The refusal of the passport was an occasion for considerable anguish on the part of the Prisoner, as it prevented him from travelling to Lebanon where he hoped to meet up with a family into which his brother had married, and to meet a potential bride who had been the subject of matrimonial discussions within their respective families.  
     
      
    6 The Prisoner filed an application seeking a review of the passport decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) which conducted a hearing in March 2003. For part of that hearing both the Prisoner, and his legal advisers, were excluded from the hearing room, while evidence, considered to be important for security reasons, was tendered. Those proceedings were stood over part heard and were due to be relisted in December 2003. 
     
      
    7 Both before and after the initial hearing, the Prisoner's case attracted media attention through radio and television and in the Australian and Daily Telegraph. In October 2002, following the Bali bombings, he made appearances on the television programme ""A Current Affair"", and on the Alan Jones morning radio programme. These appearances drew a good deal of adverse comment on talkback radio, as well as from friends and relatives. It also led to him receiving some counselling or advice from within the Muslim community.  
     
      
    8 There were some break-ins at his premises which led to him being relocated by the Housing Commission, and which the Prisoner attributed to persons who had been angered by his public observations.  
     
      
    9 By this time he was, on his own account, upset and angry with the government, ASIO and DFAT, and also with the members of the Tribunal, and had formed a belief that his phone was being intercepted and that he was being subjected to surveillance and monitoring. The attention, which he was attracting, had the effect of driving away his family and friends, who did not want to give an appearance of being associated with him. 
     
      
    10 In June and September 2003, he made some telephone calls and sent text messages to two associates, in a somewhat thinly disguised code, in the course of which he made inquiries about obtaining a weapon. As a result of these exchanges, he acquired a Sterling .22 rifle and about 100 rounds of ammunition, on 27 September 2003.  
     
      
    11 Police became aware of this purchase and naturally were concerned at this development. As a result, a search warrant was executed at his home on 28 September. The rifle and ammunition were found along with a number of documents, including a handwritten will, a printed document ""How can I prepare myself for Jihad"", a handwritten letter which appears to have been a message to ASIO, and a typed manifesto setting out his grievances and identifying ASIO as his target, as well as a copy of a job application and supporting documents which he had sent to ASIO.  
     
      
    12 The Prisoner was arrested and charged with firearms offences arising out of his possession of the rifle and ammunition, and of the incorrect way in which they had been stored. This led to him being fined in the Local Court at Bankstown, on 30 October 2003. He was informed, some time during the ensuing weeks, that the Crown intended to appeal against the leniency of the sentence.  
     
      
    13 His arrest, and the subsequent proceedings, attracted further media attention, and naturally enough also guaranteed that he would remain under surveillance. By this time it is evident that he was beginning to enjoy, if not to crave, the media attention, which was providing him with an interest or cause in an otherwise unfulfilling or empty life. As a result he encouraged further contact particularly with The Australian, and The Daily Telegraph but also with several television stations.  
     
      
    14 In the course thereof he showed, or sold, to the journalists copies of some of the documents which police had earlier seized, as well as some photographs of himself in dramatic poses, holding a knife, and wearing the kind of garb which, it seems, he considered appropriate for a would-be terrorist or suicide bomber. It is also evident that he made it known that he had made a videotape which, amongst other things, included recitations from the Koran, images of himself, and a recitation of what purportedly was to be his last message to the world.  
     
      
    15 In the weekend edition of The Australian of November 22-23, he featured in an article on the front page entitled ""Tortured World of an Angry Young Man"". It contained some of the photographs that he had supplied, and extracted portions of his manifesto or final message. Reference was made to his grievances and prior arrest, and the article concluded with some observations as to his potential dangerousness and vulnerability to manipulation, noting that ""without urgent help, Zak Mallah, Islam and his problems make a deadly cocktail"".  
     
      
    16 It was in this environment, that the Counter Terrorist Command, not surprisingly, and entirely appropriately, undertook an operation using an undercover operative, to investigate whether the Prisoner was in fact planning a terrorist related offence. This involved the operative ""Greg"" making telephone contact, in the guise of a freelance journalist who was interested in writing a story on the Prisoner, and later speaking face to face with him, between 28 November 2003 and 3 December 2003.  
     
      
    17 It was in the course of these discussions that the Prisoner made the threats to kill officers of ASIO or DFAT, in the course of a siege, which he said he had planned at the building of one or other of those agencies. It was these threats that gave rise to the offence to which he pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    18 The ""plan"" as recounted by him involved the surveillance of the building, after which he would make an entry armed with a weapon, hold its occupants hostage and shoot some of them. He indicated that he then expected police would be called to the scene, and that they would, at his request, permit Greg to enter the building with a video camera, by which Greg could record his message, and his execution by police when he either shot, or threatened to kill, more hostages.  
     
      
    19 In the course of these meetings, there was a progressive disclosure of this ""plan"", accompanied by discussions leading to the sale for $3000, to Greg of the video which the Prisoner had prepared, together with some photographs of himself holding a knife and in stylised Islamic extremist dress and poses, and his manifesto. The video was to be made available so as to give to Greg, as an ""independent journalist"", a newsworthy item, which he could release for broadcast in return for appropriate payment.  
     
      
    20 At the same time as these discussions were taking place, the Prisoner was also in contact with journalists from The Australian, and The Daily Telegraph and possibly also Channel 9, with a view to obtaining further coverage and the sale of photographs or the video.  
     
      
    21 The act of acquiring the rifle with the intention of killing officers of ASIO or DFAT, was the basis for the terrorist act charged in Count 1; while the sale of the video, photographs and manifesto for use in the ""planned"" siege was the basis for the terrorist act charged in Count 2. 
     
      
    22 There were issues at the trial in relation to Counts 1 and 2 as to: 
     
      
       
      (a) Whether the accused had a genuine plan by which he intended to kill ASIO or DFAT officers; 
       
       
      (b) If he had such a plan and intention whether by killing such officers he had an intention: 
       
       
        
        (i) to advance a political, religious or ideological cause, as distinct from some purely personal cause either to secure a passport, or to exact revenge on ASIO or DFAT for obstructing its issue, or to gain publicity for himself; and 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) to coerce or influence by intimidation the government of the Commonwealth, to alter its policies in relation to persons such as himself, or to do something that it would not otherwise have done.  
        
       
      
    23 It was the case for the Prisoner that he had never had a serious plan involving an intention to take the building hostage, or to kill anyone or to die himself in a siege situation. He gave evidence to the effect that he had acquired the rifle for self-protection because of the expectation of break-ins and threats; and also in the expectation of being arrested and placed before a Court, so that he could expose his grievances and obtain judicial assistance.  
     
      
    24 Additionally, he said that his dealings with Greg were to secure publicity for himself and to obtain money for items which he considered newsworthy; and alternatively, in the event of Greg being part of an undercover operation, rather than a journalist, of being arrested and of then using the opportunity of going to trial, so as to obtain redress for his grievances. He also claimed that his discussions with Greg were all ""nonsense talk"", and that he was effectively stringing him along, making the conversation sound real, so that he could get the $3000 which Greg had indicated would be available for the video.  
     
      
    25 At all material times, it was the case that the Prisoner was in straightened financial circumstances, and living in a Housing Commission flat, without any substantial means of income. There was no evidence of him having acquired or made inquiries about acquiring a second gun between 28 September and 3 December.  
     
      
    26 By its verdict it is clear that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of one or other of the elements which the Crown had to establish, in order to make Counts 1 or 2 good, having regard to the terms of s 101.6(1) and the definition of ""terrorist act"" contained in s 100.1 of the Code. Their verdict does not, however, disclose in respect of which of the issues mentioned, the Crown failed.  
     
      
    27 By reason of the terms in which s 147.2 is framed, it was not necessary for the Crown to establish for the third count that the person threatened actually feared that the threat would be carried out. Moreover the offence was charged in terms of the Prisoner's recklessness as to whether the threat would cause Greg to fear that it would be carried into fruition; it being sufficient, by reason of the definition of ""reckless"" (s 5.4(2)) that he was aware of a substantial risk that Greg would entertain that fear and that it was unjustifiable for him to take that risk.  
     
      
       
      THE SENTENCING PRINCIPLES 
       
      
    28 The Prisoner is to be sentenced in accordance with the following provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth): 
     
      
       
      16A Matters to which court to have regard when passing sentence etc. 
        
       
      (1) In determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a federal offence, a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.  
      
     
     
      
      (2) In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court:  
      
     
     
      
      (a) the nature and circumstances of the offence;  
       
        
        (b) other offences (if any) that are required or permitted to be taken into account;  
         
        (c) if the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or a similar character—that course of conduct;  
         
        (d) the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence;  
        
       
      (e) any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence;  
       
        
        (f) the degree to which the person has shown contrition for the offence:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) by taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; or  
          
         
        (ii) in any other manner; 
        
       
       
        
        (g) if the person has pleaded guilty to the charge in respect of the offence—that fact;  
         
        (h) the degree to which the person has co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or of other offences;  
         
        (j) the deterrent effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have on the person;  
         
        (k) the need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence;  
         
        (m) the character, antecedents, cultural background, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person;  
        
       
      (n) the prospect of rehabilitation of the person;  
       
        
        (p) the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person's family or dependants.  
        
       
       
      … 
       
       
       
      17A Restriction on imposing sentences  
      
     
     
      
      (1) A court shall not pass a sentence of imprisonment on any person for a federal offence, or for an offence against the law of an external Territory that is prescribed for the purposes of this section, unless the court, after having considered all other available sentences, is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. 
       
       
      … 
       
        
       
      THE NATURE AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCE 
       
      
    29 The Prisoner is to be sentenced only for the threats which he made to Greg during the period charged, and not directly or indirectly for the conduct which gave rise to the counts of which he was acquitted. The wider history is relevant so far as it places the present offence for which the maximum prescribed penalty is imprisonment for 7 years, into context and throws light, for example, on whether the words spoken were uttered seriously, or whether they were the empty words of a foolish, naïve, emotionally immature and manipulative man, who on his own admission, engaged in a sustained deception of Greg. 
     
      
    30 To some extent that depends upon an examination of his evidence, and also upon the question whether he may have been encouraged, unintentionally by Greg, to say things that he did not really mean, when the latter was, perfectly properly, questioning him in an attempt to discover whether he was genuinely threatening to kill an ASIO or DFAT officer, or whether it was all empty bluster.  
     
      
    31 The evidence which the Prisoner gave during the trial was, in many respects, self contradictory, illogical, bizarre and downright foolish. His credibility remains very much in issue, particularly in so far as he gave the impression, at times, of saying virtually anything that came to his mind, and demonstrated himself capable of deception and manipulation of others.  
     
      
    32 Paradoxically, however, I am of the view that herein lies the answer to the question whether his threats were genuine or simply the product of a fertile imagination which had been allowed, or perhaps more accurately encouraged, by the media attention which he received, to run wild.  
     
      
    33 It does seem to me to have been regrettable that some sections of the media took up the Prisoner as a person of interest, and gave him an entirely underserved and unnecessary exposure, particularly if it be the fact, as he has claimed, that he was paid for his cooperation. 
     
      
    34 Had real fears been entertained as to his potential dangerousness, then the preferable course surely would have been to pass any relevant information concerning him, to the appropriate policing and security agencies. Had he been dismissed as an attention seeker, of no moment, then there surely would have been no occasion to give him the extensive public exposure which he obviously enjoyed and indeed craved.  
     
      
    35 It is not to be overlooked that had the Prisoner's plan in this case been genuine, the journalists dealing with him, and indeed any police officer doing so without a controlled operations certificate, risked committing offences themselves, under the widely crafted terrorism laws, for example, under s 101.4 or 101.5 of the Criminal Code if they obtained possession of, or collected, documents connected with the preparation for a terrorist act by him; or under s 103.1 if they paid monies to him and were reckless as to whether they might be used by him to facilitate or engage in such an act.  
     
      
    36 Leaving this case aside, to continue discussions with a suspect in the position of the Prisoner, or to give him publicity, risks trampling all over any covert operation that may have been mounted under strict controls by professional policing and intelligence agencies, thereby potentially frustrating the collection of valuable intelligence that may have prevented a genuine terrorist event. Any investigation of such a person is far better left to professional agencies with the necessary training and access to intelligence, and should, in my view, be absolutely avoided by the media.  
     
      
    37 Furthermore, placing a person such as the Prisoner into the public spotlight is not only likely to encourage him to embark on even more outrageous and extravagant behaviour but, perhaps more importantly, it risks unnecessarily heightening the existing public concerns about terrorist activity as well as encouraging or fanning divisive and discriminatory views among some members of the community.  
     
      
    38 I have reached the conclusion in this case that the Prisoner was an idiosyncratic, and embittered young man, who was to all intents something of a loner, without significant prospects of advancing himself. I am not in a position to determine whether he was deservedly deprived of a passport, but I am satisfied that he personally felt that he had been the subject of an injustice.  
     
      
    39 I am similarly satisfied that he used the occasion of his grievance with DFAT and ASIO, and the media attention which came his way, to make something of himself so as to gain status, as he saw it, among those who may have shared his extremist views, and to present himself as an alternative voice of Islam. That he saw things this way reflects the impression which Keysar Trad formed of him. It also accords with the capacity that I find he has, for a vivid imagination and for some degree of religious fervour.  
     
      
    40 My acceptance of his sense of injustice does not mitigate his criminality. At most it helps to explain why he behaved in the way that he did. It does not excuse it. For those who feel that they have been unfairly treated in relation to passport decisions, or in relation to the attention of policing or security agencies, there are lawful avenues available for redress other than the making of threats.  
     
      
    41 While I accept that the Prisoner enjoyed posing as a potential martyr, and may from time to time, in his own imagination, have contemplated creating a siege and taking the lives of others, I am satisfied that in his more rational moments he lacked any genuine intention of doing so.  
     
      
    42 It is against this background that the objective criminality of the offence to which the Prisoner pleaded guilty is to be assessed. Clearly there is a significant difference in the criminality involved in a threat which is accompanied by a genuine intention to carry it into effect, and one which is made jocularly or by way of bluster, without any such intention.  
     
      
    43 They occupy different ends of the spectrum. The present case, I find, falls somewhere about the mid point in that range, and certainly not toward the lower end, because of the fact that it involved considerably more than an isolated observation.  
     
      
    44 Although the Prisoner was, to a considerable degree, led on by the media, whose coverage effectively brought about the meetings with Greg in which the threat was made, that threat could not be readily dismissed as having been purely of a nuisance kind.  
     
      
    45 History shows that those with bizarre and extremist views, who can easily be written off as harmless nuisances, can nevertheless carry out or attempt acts of violence, with far reaching consequences. For that reason the Counter Terrorist Coordination Command had no alternative, in this case, other than to commence an undercover operation to determine whether the Prisoner was a harmless nuisance, or a person who presented as a genuine threat.  
     
      
    46 Its time and resources, as well as those of other officers of the Commonwealth had to be diverted to this case. The strategy adopted by the undercover officer was both professional and entirely appropriate in the circumstances which presented themselves. Although there was an inevitable risk that any attempt to gain information about the Prisoner's true intentions might encourage him to embellish what he had already put into train, so as to gain more publicity for himself or money, there was little else that could be done. I am not in fact persuaded that anything which Greg said in this context was inappropriate, or that it was the catalyst for the threats. That it did not have such an effect is supported by the circumstance that the Prisoner had, to a considerable extent, already disclosed his plan in the videotape and the other documents, which he had prepared well before meeting Greg.  
     
      
    47 In summary, I find that the offence was serious, in so far as it necessarily occupied the time and resources of agencies that should have been available for potentially more important matters.  
     
      
    48 Counsel for the Prisoner pointed out that the offence to which the Prisoner pleaded could have been dealt with in the Local Court. I accept that to be the case, but clearly it was appropriate for it to have been dealt with on indictment. Moreover the fact that it could have been dealt with as a summary offence, does not of itself alter the degree of objective seriousness which attaches, that being a matter which can only be determined by reference to the nature and extent of his wrongful conduct.  
     
      
       
      Personal History 
       
      
    49 The Prisoner was born in Australia on 11 August 1983, of Lebanese parents, and was 20 years of age at the time of the offence. He grew up in the Sydney south western area, and attended Punchbowl Boys High School and then the Noor Al Houda Islamic College to Year 10. He commenced a TAFE course at Bankstown in management and leadership, and worked on a casual basis for Franklins as a shelf stacker, and later for Domino's Pizzas in a delivery capacity.  
     
      
    50 He has two brothers, one sister and one step sister. His mother, for whom he had been a primary carer during her illness, died when he was about 13 years of age. His father remarried but died when he was about 17 years of age. The relationship with his step mother was strained, and the two deaths, and the lengthy illness of his mother affected him seriously. A school counsellor and family friend, Mae Abumahmoud gave evidence confirmatory of the fact that he had been distracted during this period of his schooling, by reason of the problems within the family.  
     
      
    51 He claims to have been a devout Muslim, who had undertaken a pilgrimage with his father to Mecca, and to have been a worshipper at the Mosque and Prayer Hall at Lakemba. It is, however, apparent that he had adopted a distorted and unorthodox view of the Islamic faith, which had been of sufficient concern to Keysar Trad to cause him to counsel the Prisoner toward a more acceptable and orthodox interpretation of the Koran.  
     
      
       
       
      Antecedents and Prior Character 
       
      
    52 The Prisoner had no prior convictions other than the firearms offences for which he was fined.  
     
      
    53 There was evidence from three witnesses in relation to his character, namely Mae Abumahmoud, Alison Noori, who had been his teacher in 1998, and Keysar Trad, who is the President of the Lebanese Muslim Association and a community leader as well as a person well versed in the Islamic faith. 
     
      
    54 In general terms their evidence was to the effect that the prisoner was by nature a gentle and harmless person, who was not given to violent action, but who was also naïve, talkative, attracted by publicity, and preoccupied and depressed by the events surrounding his inability to obtain a passport, which he perceived to have involved an injustice.  
     
      
    55 Keysar Trad said that he had counselled him on his concerns, and had tried not only to persuade him to a more orthodox view of his faith, but also to dissuade him from making further public comments that were harming himself and bringing his community and his religion into disrepute. He said that the Prisoner had assured him that he had not intended to harm anyone and that the observations in his manifesto were ""merely words"". He saw him as a ""movie producer"" or ""showman"" creating entertainment for general consumption, and as perceiving himself as a ""star"" who was in fact the victim of the media attention which he had attracted. He described the Prisoner as a placid person who would not harm other people, but who was prone to going into escapades of his own imagination.  
     
      
    56 Both Keysar Trad and the Mufti Sheik Hilaly have indicated a willingness to find accommodation and mentors who would be able to keep a close eye on him post release, and to persuade him to a more rational and acceptable view of life. 
     
      
    57 He has not been a user of drugs or alcohol.  
     
      
    58 As a result of his behaviour in recent years, he has become estranged from his brothers and sisters, and also from at least some sections of his friends who presumably regarded his conduct as unacceptable. That there is some possibility of him regaining a degree of family support is indicated by the fact that some of his relatives have visited him, in recent times, while on remand.  
     
      
       
       The Plea of Guilty and Remorse 
       
      
    59 The plea of guilty was offered mid trial, and upon that basis was not, at first blush, an early plea. However to say that overlooks the circumstance that initially the Prisoner was charged only with the offence which became Count 2 in the indictment. 
     
      
    60 Well prior to the committal hearing he offered to plead guilty to a s 147.2 offence, which is not a terrorist offence, in satisfaction of that count. The offer was not accepted, and subsequently the indictment was framed in terms which added Count 1, as well as the count to which he had offered a plea.  
     
      
    61 In these circumstances, I consider it only fair to approach the plea as one that was offered at an early stage but not accepted, and as indicating a measure of contrition as well as an acceptance of responsibility and a willingness, by the time of the offer, to facilitate the administration of justice.  
     
      
    62 In circumstances where there clearly were issues of substance in relation to Counts 1 and 2, and where there was an obvious overlap between all three counts, the delay in offering the plea to the third count did not add to the length or complexity of the trial at all. 
     
      
    63 Otherwise it is the case that the defence was conducted efficiently and responsibly and in a way that did not waste any time or require the formal proof by the Crown of several matters which may have prolonged the trial, or unnecessarily trespassed on matters of national security. The Prisoner is entitled to some benefit for that degree of co operation: R v Doff [2005] NSWCCA 119 at [58]. 
     
      
    64 Evidence was led from the Prisoner during the sentencing proceedings that while he formerly regarded his actions as having been justified, he now appreciates that his conduct was stupid, was likely to have caused others to be scared, and wasted a lot of taxpayers money. He claimed to have learned a lot of lessons including the need to avoid making further threats and to seek professional help and assistance from the Muslim community instead. To the extent that these observations indicate an expression of regret and an understanding of the wrongfulness of his conduct, they may be accepted as evidence of remorse and of insight into his criminality, albeit emerging only from the time that he was placed on trial.  
     
      
    65 In truth he has been his own worst enemy, since his behaviour was exceedingly foolish, and was such as not only to divert the attention of those engaged in anti-terrorist operations from investigating potential threats of a more serious kind, but also to make it most unlikely that he will ever be given an Australian passport.  
     
      
    66 He is however entitled to a discount at the upper end of the range for his plea, remorse and contrition.  
     
      
       
      Physical and Mental State  
       
      
    67 There is no suggestion of the Prisoner suffering from any form of physical illness or disability. Reports were provided by Tim Watson-Munro, a Clinical Forensic Psychologist, and by Dr Olav Nielssen, a Consultant Psychiatrist in relation to his mental state.  
     
      
    68 Mr Watson-Munro reported that there was nothing in the Prisoner's presentation to suggest the presence of any psychotic illness, although he added that ""it was arguable that [he] was suffering features of a chronic adjustment disorder with depressive and anxiety features"" before the series of events that led to the offence. This was a somewhat qualified diagnosis which he expressed in slightly different, although still not in unequivocal terms, in his oral evidence, which was to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. And you have reached some conclusions about his mental state in the period leading up to and including the time of his offending conduct? 
         
        A. That's correct. I, of course, did not know him then, but he described a range of life events which enabled me to  
        hypothesise that in all likelihood 
         he was suffering from adjustment disorder. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What is adjustment disorder? 
         
        A. It is a condition described in the DSM-IV which is the diagnostic manual, the fourth edition, which describes a range of psychological symptoms arising from an individual's poor past to cope with life events; in other words, they have difficulty adjusting to changes that those life events impose on them. 
         
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Given your opinion about the state of his mental health at the time of the commission of this offence, are you in a position to be able to offer an opinion about how that condition would have impacted on his decisions to threaten these officers in the way that he did? 
         
        A. Well, I'm not suggesting he was not aware of what he was doing, but certainly the impact of these issues on him became more frustrating and he had difficulty to think through his behaviour, but not to the point of being unaware of the consequences of his behaviour. 
         
         
        Q. What about his ability to discern the correctness or justification for what he was doing? 
         
        A. Well, it was diminished. I am not saying he was unaware of these issues, but the predominant matter affecting him was getting his passport. A strong sense of frustration in not being able to obtain his passport and on top of that, the life events that I have described; the loss of his parents in particular.” 
         
         
        
       
      
    69 Mr Watson-Munro recorded that the Prisoner expressed to him a continuing feeling of a strong sense of resentment and injustice concerning what had happened to him, and that his mood state had been severely aggravated by his arrest and incarceration. He said that while denying any suicidal ideation the Prisoner had also described ongoing symptoms of depression, reflected in a variation of energy levels and a loss of appetite. 
     
      
    70 Dr Nielssen's opinion differed to some degree from that of Mr Watson-Munro in that he excluded a diagnosis of any form of psychiatric disorder, and did not find the Prisoner to be particularly depressed. He found him to be of normal intelligence. He saw some signs in his interview that were consistent with him being a person who sought attention, and who had some histrionic personality traits, but otherwise found no abnormality. The Prisoner's behaviour, he said, ""appears to have been to attract attention to himself because of an obstinate and idealistic belief that he has been a victim of injustice"".  
     
      
    71 I accept Dr Nielssen's opinion in preference to the somewhat qualified opinion of Mr Watson-Munro.  
     
      
    72 Even if it be the case that the Prisoner has an adjustment disorder of the kind mentioned by Mr Watson-Munro, it does not seem to me to be of the kind that excused the Prisoner's criminality or that would lessen the need for both general and personal deterrence.  
     
      
    73 Before any form of psychiatric disorder or other condition can have a relevance for sentencing, in accordance with the well known principles mentioned for example in Regina v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81; and R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255, there does need to be some positive evidence in relation to the extent to which it contributed to the commission of the offence, or to otherwise be relevant in relation to deterrence. It is not enough merely to label an offender with some disorder based on DSM-IV or some other diagnostic measurement scale: see the caution that was given by the Court of Criminal Appeal in this regard in R v Lawrence  [2005] NSWCCA 91 at [22] - [23].  
     
      
       
      Prospects of Rehabilitation 
       
      
    74 Mr Watson-Munro did not offer any opinion as to the Prisoner's risks of re-offending, although relevantly he noted the Prisoner's remark that if successful in the trial he intended to seek exile in Dubai. Dr Nielssen recorded the Prisoner's observation to the effect ""I want to stay in gaol until I get my passport"", and his additional observation that if he was released now ""I would set myself up again…I'd create a scene just to get my passport…I guess I'm just a very stubborn person."" He thought him to need further counselling, ideally by one of the well regarded Islamic clerics who might be able to persuade him to retract his statements and to act in his own interests. 
     
      
    75 During the sentencing proceedings the Prisoner resiled from these observations, suggesting that he had changed his mind about this ""the second he came to trial"", and that he no longer wishes to travel or to have a passport. Whether or not this is a truthful observation remains to be seen, bearing in mind, in particular, the Prisoner's evidence during the trial, that he was an ""amazing person"" who changes his mind ""every five seconds"". Subject to those observations I accept that in his current state of mind he does not intend to re-agitate for the issue of a passport.  
     
      
    76 In the Prisoner's favour was the evidence of Mr Trad that confirmed the readiness of Sheik Hilaly to provide him with accommodation post release, and of the Lebanese Muslim Association to take him in for counselling and supervision through its Youth Development Program, which has been successful in providing guidance for other young offenders and for those with extremist views. The Prisoner has indicated a willingness to accept this assistance and guidance.  
     
      
    77 In the light of the history of the matter, the manipulative nature of the Prisoner and the observations made to Dr Nielssen, the prospects of the Prisoner reoffending in a similar way cannot be entirely eliminated. They depend entirely, it seems to me, upon the genuineness of his commitment, that is, whether he will accept the advice and counselling of his religious leaders, and both adopt a more rational and orthodox view of the Islamic faith, and acquire a genuine insight into the wrongfulness of his behaviour and its potential impact on others.  
     
      
       
       
      Personal and General Deterrence 
       
      
    78 I am satisfied that the offence was one for which there is a need for a substantial element of general deterrence. Threats directed to the well being of Commonwealth public servants need to be regarded seriously, and absent some frank psychiatric disorder, the present case is not one that calls for any mitigation for this factor.  
     
      
    79 It can never be known, without considerable diversion of resources, and even then rarely with absolute confidence, whether such threats are likely to be carried out. Whether seriously entertained or not, they can occasion genuine alarm to the potential victim, as well as to others who are aware of them.  
     
      
    80 Potentially they can interrupt the operations of government departments, and become the occasion of increased security arrangements that will adversely affect those who need to deal with those departments.  
     
      
    81 For all these reasons such conduct is not to be written off lightly as a prank or as of little moment. Similarly for hoax calls made in relation to airlines and buildings, in the absence of special circumstances, they are to be discouraged by the risk of attracting an appropriate sentence of imprisonment of some magnitude.  
     
      
    82 In this case there is also a need for personal deterrence. The potential for further mischief on the part of the Prisoner is not capable of firm prediction. His behaviour on this occasion suggests that he could well reoffend, unless he abandons his unorthodox and unacceptable views, and accepts proper guidance and mentoring.  
     
      
       
       
      Conditions of Imprisonment 
       
      
    83 The Prisoner has been held in continuous custody since 3 December 2003. By reason of his status as a person charged under the anti- terrorism legislation, he was held in conditions of very tight security, initially at the MRRC Silverwater and subsequently in the Multi-purpose Unit at Goulburn, permitting him only very limited periods out of his cell between the time of his arrest and October 2004. Throughout this period he was deprived of any contact with other prisoners, required to eat alone in his cell and permitted only limited opportunities for exercise or access to a telephone or visitors. Whenever moved from his cell to any other location he was accompanied by specially trained correctional officers and placed in restraints.  
     
      
    84 Since October there has been some relaxation in these conditions, although he is still denied access to the oval and gymnasium, and has not been permitted to join the Friday religious services for members of his faith. His correspondence is monitored, his cell door is subject to continuous video surveillance, and he is only moved in the custody of a SWAT team, again in conditions of close confinement.  
     
      
    85 An appeal to the Serious Offenders Review Counsel against the restrictions was dismissed, although with a recommendation for review. His current classification is due for review on 28 April next, and it might reasonably be expected, in the light of the jury verdict, that he will lose the AAU classification which is reserved for those on remand for, or convicted of, terrorist offences.  
     
      
       
      The Sentence 
       
      
    86 I am satisfied, having regard to the various considerations outlined above, that the only sentence which is appropriate is one of imprisonment. I am also satisfied that it is not appropriate that any part of it should be suspended. Rather, so far as the Prisoner might be released before its expiry, that should occur by way of a recognisance release order. 
     
      
    87 It is appropriate to backdate the sentence to the date on which he went into custody, and to make allowance for the strict conditions in which he has been confined to this time.  
     
      
    88 Zaky Mallah, for the offence to which you have pleaded guilty, I sentence you to imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months to date from 3 December 2003 and to expire on 2 June 2006. I make an order that you be released on 2 September 2005 upon giving security, by way of a recognisance, without surety, to comply with the following conditions, namely that:  
     
      
       
      (i) You will be of good behaviour for a period of 2 years from 2 September 2005; 
       
       
      (ii) You will, during that period, be subject to the supervision of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service, and obey all reasonable directions of that Service as to your conduct, including any directions which it may make, as to your taking up of any accommodation which is offered to you through the good offices of the Mufti, Sheik Hilaly, or of the Lebanese Muslim Association, and as to your attendance at, and participation in, the mentoring and other programs offered by that Association and by its Youth Guidance Leader.  
       
      
    89 I need to explain to you that the effect of the sentencing order is that you will serve a period of imprisonment of 1 year and 9 months from 3 December 2003. On 2 September 2005 you will be released upon a recognisance to be of good behaviour for a further period of 2 years during which period you will be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service of New South Wales, and will be required to obey any reasonable directions which they give you as to your conduct.  
     
      
    90 If you fail to comply with a condition of that recognisance release order, then an information may be laid before a Magistrate, who may issue a summons requiring your appearance before this Court and, if necessary, a warrant for your arrest in order to secure your appearance. If the Court is then satisfied that you have failed to comply with a condition of that order, without reasonable cause or excuse, it may impose a pecuniary penalty of up to $1000 upon you; or take further action which may include amending the original order so as to extend the period for which you are required to give security to be of good behaviour, revoking the original order and directing that you serve the remainder of the sentence that you have not already served, or passing some alternative sentence which is available under the laws of this State, or taking no action.

     TELSTRA CORPORATION LIMITED V. BISLEY 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HANDLEY JA: I agree with Hodgson JA. 
     
      
    2 HODGSON JA: On 13 February 2004, Phegan DCJ gave his decision in proceedings brought by the respondent (Mr. Bisley) against the appellant (Telstra), to the effect that there should be judgment for Mr. Bisley in the sum of $75,000.00 plus certain medical expenses. Telstra has brought an appeal from that decision. It appears that a document entitled Consent Orders was filed, in which the respondent consented to an extension of time in which to file the Notice of Appeal, and consented to leave to appeal being granted. I would not consider that the filing of such a document satisfactorily overcomes the need to obtain leave for such an appeal, but in my opinion the convenient course in this case is simply to proceed to deal with the appeal on its merits. 
     
      
       
      CIRCUMSTANCES 
      
    3 On 15 May 2000, Mr. Bisley was demolishing a fence at Wingham, working on a section of land between the fence line and Gloucester Road. The area was heavily grassed, and was used as a stock route.  
     
      
    4 Mr. Bisley was removing old wire from the fence and gradually moving backwards, when he fell into a pit which was 3 feet deep, 3 feet long and 18 inches wide, and which had been created there by Telstra. There was no cover over this pit, and the pit was, on findings of the primary judge which have not been challenged, hidden from ordinary view by grass.  
     
      
    5 In the Statement of Claim, Mr. Bisley alleged negligence in failing to cover the manhole, failing to provide any sign or warning of the existence of the manhole, and res ipsa loquitur.  
     
      
    6 Telstra led no evidence at the hearing. 
     
      
       
      DECISION OF PRIMARY JUDGE 
      
    7 Since the submissions on appeal depend partly on a textual analysis of what the primary judge said, it is convenient to set out verbatim the relevant part of the judgment. In this part of the judgment, the primary judge deals with a number of submissions made on behalf of Telstra by its Counsel at the hearing, Mr. Chen. 
     
      
       
        
        It was also Mr Chen's submission that there was no evidence of what actually happened to the manhole cover 
          
        and where it 
          
        was at the time the plaintiff was injured. However, it is not for the plaintiff to adduce evidence on that particular matter. Had it been material, then this was, from an evidentiary point of view, a matter to be raised by the defendant. On the limited evidence available, I am entitled to infer that the cover was easily removed from its proper position, whatever its fate on this particular occasion and that was a matter of which the defendant should have been aware. Furthermore, I find that the exposed manhole without the cover constituted a risk of serious injury to a 'person who fell into it as the plaintiff did. As I have already found, the manhole in its exposed state was not readily visible in the long thick grass which had grown over it at the time and it had in those circumstances become a ""hidden trap"" in the sense 
          
        in which that term is frequently used in a context such as that.  
         
         
        It was a further submission from Mr Chen that the plaintiff, given the condition of the ground which was, on the plaintiff's own evidence, uneven and therefore likely to contain holes which were not readily seen from a cursory observation, should have checked the area out more carefully before proceeding with the task which he was undertaking at the time he stepped into the manhole.  
         
         
        While that may very well be a valid observation, it is not in my view one which goes to the question of the defendant's liability, but rather goes to the possibility of some contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.  
         
         
        It was further submitted by Mr Chen that there was no reason for the defendant to anticipate that anyone would use the area where the plaintiff was injured. I find that proposition difficult to accept on the evidence in view of the fact that according to the plaintiff this was a stock route and also, as Mr Rich for the plaintiff observed, again based on the plaintiff's evidence, there were other facilities in the area such as the water meter for which the plaintiff had earlier been searching, which made it foreseeable that from time to time people would be on the area for one purpose or another. Presence of someone in the area therefore was reasonably foreseeable contrary to Mr Chen's submission in that regard.  
         
         
        Mr Chen further argued that the defendant had fulfilled any duty that might arise from the existence of the manhole by placing a cover over the hole and thus rendering it safe and that the defendant was not in those circumstances answerable for the subsequent intervention or interference by others over which he had had no control. It would have been entirely unrealistic to insist that the defendant should maintain constant vigilance of the manhole in order to ensure that the cover was not removed.  
         
         
        While I accept that last proposition this does not relieve the defendant of responsibility. In constructing the manhole in the way it was constructed and in using a manhole cover which was, on all of the evidence, relatively easily removed, there was a duty on the defendant to ensure that adequate warning was provided to anyone using the area, either by ensuring that the manhole remained visible, or if that was not practicable, to erect warning signs or warning or ""location posts"", of the kind which it did subsequently install at two corners of the manhole. The consequence of installing such posts as I noted earlier, was that, even if the area became overgrown, the top of the posts would remain visible and would provide an adequate indication of the existence of the manhole.  
         
         
        In this regard it was the plaintiff's evidence that he had encountered, in other locations, manholes similarly marked by posts. Although they were posts differently designed, they were essentially to the same effect. The defendant on its part had demonstrated by the subsequent action which it took, that such a precaution was both a possible, and again one is entitled to assume in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, not unduly or disproportionately costly means of eliminating the risk of serious 
          
        injury of the kind which the plaintiff suffered.  
         
         
        In those circumstances I find, given the apparent ease with which the cover could be removed by some unknown person, that the open manhole was a foreseeable danger, especially disguised as it was by the long thick grass which had grown over it. It was a danger against which effective warning could have been provided at a relatively modest cost as demonstrated by the steps taken and depicted in photograph number 5. The defendant was in 
          
        those circumstances negligent in failing to take such a precaution and is accordingly in breach of its duty to the plaintiff. 
        
       
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
      
    8 Telstra’s grounds of appeal are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The trial Judge erred, in finding that the appellant was negligent in failing to consider: 
         
          
          (a) the application of  
          Civil Liability Act  
          2002;  
           
          (b) whether, in all the circumstances, the appellant acted unreasonably.  
          
         
        2. The trial Judge erred in defining the duty of care owed by the appellant.  
         
        3. The trial Judge erred in deciding the case on an issue not pleaded nor relied upon at trial.  
         
        4. The trial Judge erred in concluding that discharge of the appellant's duty of care required it to warn the respondent,  
         
        5. The trial Judge erred in finding as a fact that the manhole cover was easily removed. 
         
        6. The trial Judge erred in finding that the respondent had proven causation. 
        
       
       
      SUBMISSIONS 
      
    9 Mr. Watson SC for Telstra submitted that the primary judge had erred in a number of respects.  
     
      
    10 First, he submitted, the primary judge did not consider the provisions of the Civil Liability Act 2002, especially ss.5B, 5E and Part 5, although these provisions were applicable. In any event, Mr. Watson submitted, the primary judge did not consider whether Telstra had acted unreasonably. Further, he submitted, the primary judge erred in saying that there was an onus on Telstra to lead evidence of what actually happened to the manhole cover: before Telstra had any evidential burden, there had to be some evidence sufficient for an inference to be drawn against Telstra (see Rickards v. Australian Telecommunications Commission [1983] 3 NSWLR 155 at 158).  
     
      
    11 Mr. Watson submitted that the primary judge erred in dealing with the question of warning: in saying that the duty was to ensure that an adequate warning was provided, he overstated the duty, and he also did not consider cost or inconvenience in relation to any need to give a warning.  
     
      
    12 Next, Mr. Watson submitted that the primary judge erred in finding that the pit cover was easily removed, and was removed by some unknown person; and in any event, Mr. Watson submitted, such a case would involve an allegation of deficiency in design, and no such case was pleaded.  
     
      
    13 Finally, Mr. Watson submitted that the primary judge erred in finding causation through lack of warning. Mr. Bisley had taken no steps to check the safety of the area, so an inference that a warning would have been effective was not justified, particularly where Mr. Bisley did not give evidence to that effect. 
     
      
       
      CIVIL LIABILITY ACT 
      
    14 Sections 5B and 5C of the Act are in Division 2 of Part 1A, entitled “Duty of Care” and are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        5B General principles 
         
        (1) A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless:  
         
          
          (a) the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known), and 
           
          (b) the risk was not insignificant, and 
           
          (c) in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person’s position would have taken those precautions. 
          
         
        (2) In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following (amongst other relevant things):  
         
          
          (a) the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken, 
           
          (b) the likely seriousness of the harm, 
           
          (c) the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm, 
           
          (d) the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm. 
          
         
         
        5C Other principles 
         
        In proceedings relating to liability for negligence:  
         
        (a) the burden of taking precautions to avoid a risk of harm includes the burden of taking precautions to avoid similar risks of harm for which the person may be responsible, and 
         
        (b) the fact that a risk of harm could have been avoided by doing something in a different way does not of itself give rise to or affect liability for the way in which the thing was done, and 
         
        (c) the subsequent taking of action that would (had the action been taken earlier) have avoided a risk of harm does not of itself give rise to or affect liability in respect of the risk and does not of itself constitute an admission of liability in connection with the risk. 
        
       
      
    15 Sections 5D and 5E are in Division 3 of Part 1A, entitled “Causation”, and are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        5D General principles 
         
        (1) A determination that negligence caused particular harm comprises the following elements:  
         
          
          (a) that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm ( 
          factual causation 
          ), and 
           
          (b) that it is appropriate for the scope of the negligent person’s liability to extend to the harm so caused ( 
          scope of liability 
          ). 
          
         
        (2) In determining in an exceptional case, in accordance with established principles, whether negligence that cannot be established as a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm should be accepted as establishing factual causation, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party. 
         
        (3) If it is relevant to the determination of factual causation to determine what the person who suffered harm would have done if the negligent person had not been negligent:  
         
          
          (a) the matter is to be determined subjectively in the light of all relevant circumstances, subject to paragraph (b), and 
           
          (b) any statement made by the person after suffering the harm about what he or she would have done is inadmissible except to the extent (if any) that the statement is against his or her interest. 
          
         
        (4) For the purpose of determining the scope of liability, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party. 
         
         
        5E Onus of proof 
         
        In determining liability for negligence, the plaintiff always bears the onus of proving, on the balance of probabilities, any fact relevant to the issue of causation. 
        
       
      
    16 There was reference in the written submissions to ss.5G and 5H, but these sections were not relied on at the hearing of the appeal, in circumstances where it was clear that the pit could not be regarded as an obvious risk, within the meaning of these sections.  
     
      
    17 Part 5 of the Act deals with “Liability of Public and Other Authorities”, and s.42, which has some relevance to this case, is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        42 Principles concerning resources, responsibilities etc of public or other authorities 
         
        The following principles apply in determining whether a public or other authority has a duty of care or has breached a duty of care in proceedings for civil liability to which this Part applies:  
         
        (a) the functions required to be exercised by the authority are limited by the financial and other resources that are reasonably available to the authority for the purpose of exercising those functions, 
         
        (b) the general allocation of those resources by the authority is not open to challenge, 
         
        (c) the functions required to be exercised by the authority are to be determined by reference to the broad range of its activities (and not merely by reference to the matter to which the proceedings relate), 
         
        (d) the authority may rely on evidence of its compliance with the general procedures and applicable standards for the exercise of its functions as evidence of the proper exercise of its functions in the matter to which the proceedings relate. 
        
       
       
      DECISION 
      
    18 It appears that the primary judge assumed in Telstra’s favour that a concrete cover had initially been placed over this pit, and had not been displaced by Telstra itself. It is not entirely clear why the primary judge made these assumptions in favour of Telstra, when it led no evidence to that effect, but no challenge is made on behalf of Mr. Bisley to those assumptions. The primary judge also accepted Telstra’s submission that it would have been entirely unrealistic to require that Telstra should maintain constant vigilance of the manhole in order to ensure that the cover was not removed, and no complaint is made on behalf of Mr. Bisley about that finding.  
     
      
    19 The primary judge found that the pit without the cover was a hidden trap, and constituted a risk of serious injury to a person who fell into it, and these findings were plainly open to him. Furthermore, the primary judge found it was foreseeable that from time to time people would be on the area; and although the primary judge did not express this in terms of likelihood of the risk eventuating, it is plain from the tenor of his judgment that he accepted that there was a significant risk that persons present on the area, where this hidden trap existed, could fall into it.  
     
      
    20 In those circumstances, it was plainly open to the primary judge to conclude that Telstra had an obligation to exercise reasonable skill and care with a view to ensuring that the pit it created did not cause injury. In circumstances where “constant vigilance” was impractical, this might have been achieved by installing a robust cover that was difficult to move. It was plain from the evidence that, at the time of the accident, the cover was not over the hole, nor were fragments of it in the hole, nor was it obvious in a position immediately adjacent to the hole. In those circumstances, in my opinion the inference was open to the primary judge, in the absence of further evidence, that the cover had been removed.  
     
      
    21 When one has regard to the assumption favourable to Telstra that it had not been removed by Telstra, to the lack of attraction of such a cover to larceny, and to the circumstance that it did not appear to have been broken in place by vandals, it was in my opinion open to the primary judge to consider that the fact of its removal supported an inference that it was “easily removed”, or at least that its removal was not so difficult as to make reasonable, in circumstances where there was no “constant vigilance”, the lack of any warning of the presence of the pit. In so far as Telstra relied on the robustness and permanence of the cover to overcome any inference of negligence from its creation of the pit, it was open to Telstra to lead evidence of its robustness and permanence, which it did not do. In those circumstances, in my opinion the inference of easy removal could more readily be drawn by the primary judge.  
     
      
    22 Having drawn that inference, in my opinion it was open to the primary judge to reach the view that the exercise of reasonable skill and care by Telstra, in circumstances where the pit cover was readily removable, would have required the placing of warning signs. As submitted by Ms. Katzmann SC for Mr. Bisley, the evidence of similar markers on nearby pits, and the evidence that markers were subsequently put on this pit, coupled with the absence of evidence that the expense of doing so was unreasonable, could support the inference that the expense and inconvenience of installing such warnings was not such as to prevent it being a breach of Telstra’s duty of care not to have installed such markers: cf. Nelson v. John Lysaght (Australia) Limited (1975) 132 CLR 201.  
     
      
    23 Turning to the particular submissions of Mr. Watson, in my opinion the matters raised by the various provisions of the Civil Liability Act relied on by Mr. Watson were taken into account by the primary judge. In terms of s.5B(1), the primary judge found the relevant risk was foreseeable, and not insignificant, and that a reasonable person in Telstra’s position would have taken precautions which Telstra failed to take. In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken such precautions, the primary judge did take into account the probability that harm would occur if care were not taken, the likely seriousness of the harm and the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm. There was no explicit reference to the social utility of Telstra’s activity, but there is nothing to suggest that the primary judge did not accept and act on the basis that Telstra’s activity had substantial social utility. Similarly, in terms of s.5C(a), in finding that the taking of appropriate precautions was not unduly or disproportionately costly, there is nothing to suggest that the primary judge left out of account that similar precautions may need to be taken in relation to similar pits. The same general comment applies to s.42 of the Act.  
     
      
    24 In my opinion, the primary judge did in substance find that Telstra acted unreasonably. For the reasons given above, the primary judge was not in error to hold that there was an evidentiary onus on Telstra on the question of what happened to the pit cover. The primary judge’s statement that there was a duty on Telstra “to ensure that adequate warning was provided” was not in my opinion an inaccurate statement as to the content of Telstra’s duty, which plainly was a duty to exercise reasonable care; but rather, it was a statement of a conclusion as to what the exercise of reasonable care required in the circumstances of this particular case. In so far as it suggests an elevation of a duty of care into something like strict liability, it is no more than an infelicitous expression.  
     
      
    25 The primary judge did not decide in Mr. Bisley’s favour on the basis of a deficiency in design. Rather, he found that, in circumstances where he inferred that Telstra had used a cover that was easily removable, Telstra’s duty of care required the placing of some warning; and in my opinion, that view of the case was within the pleadings.  
     
      
    26 Finally, in my opinion the finding that, had such a warning been in place the accident would not have happened, was well open to the primary judge. The failure of Mr. Bisley to give evidence that, if such a warning sign had been in place, he would have avoided the pit, was of no significance because, as pointed out by Ms. Katzmann, that evidence that could not have been given, by reason of s.5D(3)(b) of the Civil Liability Act.  
     
      
       
      CONCLUSION 
      
    27 For those reasons, in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs. 
     
      
    28 BRYSON JA: I agree with Hodgson JA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
     
     
       
      
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: There are before the Court a notice of appeal and a notice of application for leave to appeal in relation to convictions and sentences before Hock DCJ at Sydney District Court on 26 June 2003. Notice of abandonment of appeal against conviction was filed on 9 March 2005. 
     
      
    2 Following pleas of guilty, the appellant was sentenced on two counts of obtaining money by deception contrary to s 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and two counts of passing valueless cheques contrary to s 178B of that Act. On each of the latter counts the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of two months, to be served between 12 April 2002 and 11 June 2002, and on one of the counts of obtaining money by deception, to imprisonment for a fixed term of one year, to be served between 12 April 2002 and 11 April 2003. 
     
      
    3 On the outstanding count of obtaining money by deception, he was sentenced to imprisonment for three years and eight months, commencing on 12 April 2003 and expiring on 11 December 2006 with a non-parole period of two years and six months which expires on 11 October 2005. The last mentioned is the earliest date of eligibility for parole. 
     
      
    4 I should briefly sketch the facts particularly relating to the offence for which the sentence is still current. On 14 June 2001 the appellant encountered a woman (Mrs Laudie Karam). They had grown up in the same village in Lebanon and had not seen each other since they were teenagers. The appellant’s date of birth is 18 May 1951.  
     
      
    5 Following this encounter, a relationship developed between them. In the course of this the appellant told Mrs Karam that he was a wealthy doctor and was expecting some millions of dollars to arrive from the United States in the near future. In some fashion the appellant had obtained the name and telephone number of a Mr Kennedy, an employee of the Reserve Bank, and at various times he purported to telephone him, and Mrs Karam heard his end of the conversation which concerned the asserted progress of the transfer of large funds to Australia. Although Mr Kennedy received telephone calls he is unacquainted with the appellant and was conducting no business on his behalf. 
     
      
    6 Pending the claimed anticipated arrival of these funds, the appellant persuaded Mrs Karam to lend him amounts of money, the nett amount of which, unrepaid, was said to be $28,000. Mrs Karam had acquired some of the money, which she passed to the appellant, by borrowing it herself from friends and acquaintances. Amongst other things, the appellant at one point produced a document purporting to be a cheque drawn on an American bank in the sum of $US50 million. 
     
      
    7 Although the appellant pleaded guilty to the appropriate count, there was a dispute of fact tried by her Honour as to whether the relevant amount was $28,000 as claimed by Mrs Karam or $9,000 as claimed by the appellant. Both of them gave evidence before her Honour. Her Honour made significant credit findings against the appellant which were clearly open to her. She found that the correct amount was $28,000. 
     
      
    8 The other count of obtaining money by deception related to representations of a similar sort made to Mr Nasr, the proprietor of a service station, who was persuaded to “loan” the appellant $5,000 pending the arrival of the overseas funds. He also obtained petrol to the value of $19.00 for which he did not pay. 
     
      
    9 Mr Nasr was also persuaded to introduce the appellant to a tyre service, which, after the introduction by Mr Nasr, supplied the appellant with tyres and a car radio, for which they accepted payment in a cheque for the sum of $535. The cheque was dishonoured. 
     
      
    10 The other count related to the giving of a cheque for $292.60 to a toy shop at Liverpool, in exchange for computer games. It is of interest to note that the appellant (who had told both Mrs Karam and Mr Nasr that he was a doctor) has asserted that he had a doctorate from George Washington University in the United States. The material which he has forwarded to the Court does not claim that he is a medical practitioner, but when he went to the toy shop at Liverpool, the Crown facts disclose that he was wearing a stethoscope around his neck. 
     
      
    11 The appellant has a criminal history which shows that he has been dealt with for offences of dishonesty in 1976, 1990, 1992 and 2000. The sentences imposed by Hock DCJ were not the first full time custodial sentences received by the appellant. Her Honour held that his history did not entitle him to leniency and that finding is not open to challenge. 
     
      
    12 The applicant presents four grounds of appeal against sentence. It is convenient to deal with grounds 1 and 2 together: 
     
      
      (1) The total effective sentence is manifestly excessive. 
       
      (2) The individual sentences imposed in respect of each count are manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    13 Counsel for the appellant has pointed out that the maximum penalty for the passing of a valueless cheque is imprisonment for one year. As I have indicated, on each count the appellant was sentenced to two months imprisonment. This could not possibly be categorised as excessive. 
     
      
    14 The maximum penalty for each of the offences of obtaining money by deception is five years imprisonment. 
     
      
    15 Counsel points to the circumstance that offences charged under this section frequently involve much larger amounts of money and offenders who are in positions of trust. That may be so, but there is a wide variety of circumstances in which seriousness of offence can escalate. In the present case, the appellant took advantage of Mrs Karam who, it is plain, succumbed to the charms of a man whom she identified as a childhood friend. 
     
      
    16 It is true that a similar consideration does not apply to the deception practised upon Mr Nasr, but this is reflected in the much lesser sentence imposed in respect of the offence concerning him. 
     
      
    17 It is submitted that none of the offences involved a complex or sophisticated scheme. What was involved was a persistent continuation of false representations. To add colour to his claims, the obtaining and the use of the telephone number of Mr Kennedy is a matter which portrays both planning and cunning. 
     
      
    18 Complaint is made that the offence concerning Mr Nasr “basically involved a confidence trick”. No doubt that is so, but the implication that this is a matter of little moment is something that I entirely reject. 
     
      
    19 It is further complained that the sentences were totally accumulated in respect of those matters. Whilst that is true, there is a counterbalancing advantage received by the appellant in that the sentences for passing the valueless cheques and the sentence in respect of the deception of Mr Nasr were ordered to be served entirely concurrently. 
     
      
    20 It is not without significance that the appellant’s parole was current when he offended. 
     
      
    21 I am unpersuaded that her Honour’s discretion has miscarried. 
     
      
    22 Ground 3 asserts that the learned sentencing judge erred in sentencing the appellant on the basis that he has no employment history in Australia. In the course of submissions made to the sentencing judge, it was remarked that there was no evidence in respect of some matters, subjective to the appellant, which were being advanced. Leave was given to recall the appellant and he gave evidence of working for two corporations and conducting a restaurant between approximately 1971 and 1979. 
     
      
    23 In her remarks on sentence the judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I find I am able to place little weight on anything (the appellant) said. He does live with his mother and is apparently a divorced man, the father of two boys aged 17 and 15. He is apparently multilingual, but he does not have any employment record in Australia.” 
        
       
      
    24 The evidence which the appellant gave concerning his activities between 1971 and 1979 was not challenged. It is, however, literally true that there was before her Honour no record of any employment here in Australia. A reading of the material makes it easy to understand why her Honour was sceptical about anything the appellant said. 
     
      
    25 Counsel described the events concerning Mr Nasr as a confidence trick. It would not be inaccurate to describe the appellant as a confidence trickster. The very nature of committing offences of deception is that a person is able to obtain, in this case money for himself, by persuasive lies. 
     
      
    26 There is no indication that the observation by her Honour added any weight to her assessment and I would not regard this matter as provocative of intervention by this Court on sentence. 
     
      
    27 The fourth ground complains that the trial judge erred in her approach to the appellant’s pleas of guilty. These were entered on the day of trial but it is said that it occurred after the prosecution discontinued proceedings in respect of four other offences. Those four offences consisted of another offence of obtaining money by deception and three further counts of passing valueless cheques. 
     
      
    28 Her Honour granted a discount of 10 percent, which is described in a submission by counsel as “not a generous one”. That may be an available description, I would neither endorse nor reject it, however I am persuaded that it is within the range of the exercise of her Honour’s discretion. 
     
      
    29 In my opinion, the overall sentences and their structure were also well within the range of the sound exercise of discretion, and I would grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal 
     
      
    30 HOWIE J: I agree 
     
      
    31 LATHAM J: I also agree. 
     
      
    32 GROVE J: The order of the Court will therefore be as I have proposed.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for extension of time for lodging an appeal brought by the applicant who has represented himself. It is necessary to sketch the background to this application.  
     
      
    2 On 19 February 1998, following pleas of guilty to eleven counts in an indictment, the applicant was sentenced to various terms of imprisonment by Nash ADCJ in Sydney District Court.  
     
      
    3 Counts 1 to 4 and count 10 in the indictment charged indecent assault upon a male person. Counts 5, 7, 9, and 11 charged sexual intercourse with a child under sixteen years contrary to s 61D(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Counts 6 and 8 charged offences of assault and committing an act of indecency. The sentencing judge was also asked to take into account pursuant to the Form 1 procedure, offences of indecent assault on a male.  
     
      
    4 The span of time from the earliest offence charged to the latest was between 1 October 1978 and 21 July 1989.  
     
      
    5 The applicant sought and was granted leave to appeal against severity of sentence and on 6 August 1999 the sentence imposed in respect of count 11 was reduced.  
     
      
    6 The present application bears date 22 August 2004 although I note a record’s receipt date of 5 November 2004. For present purposes, I would accept the earlier date which is in excess of six years after the date of sentence and five years after the matter was dealt with in this Court on 6 August 1999.  
     
      
    7 In a written submission to the Court the applicant has set out the ultimate relief which he seeks in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The ‘sexual intercourse’ convictions I am requesting to be overturned on appeal, to be substituted with the wording ‘indecent assault’, attracting the same degree of penalty as the pre 14 July 1981 offences”. 
        
       
      
    8 The applicant has drawn to attention that enquiries made by him have revealed that the extended definition of sexual intercourse in the Crimes Act was effected by legislation coming into effect on 14 July 1981 and that that provision has since been repealed. That information does not give a complete picture. The extended definition of sexual intercourse which was numbered s 61A of the Crimes Act was introduced in 1981 but on its repeal it was substituted by a section thereafter numbered s 61H.  
     
      
    9 The complaint of the applicant is that the offences described as sexual intercourse did not include any action by him such as anal or vaginal intercourse.  
     
      
    10 At all times between 1981 and the time of the applicant’s offences there was in place a definition of sexual intercourse which included activity such as fellatio. Such action was the basis of counts 5, 7, 9 and 11 in respect of which the applicant seeks intervention. Although the applicant was dealt with on some charges in respect of conduct prior to 1981, the earliest of those counts alleged commission of crime between 1 January 1982 and 30 November 1982.  
     
      
    11 Accordingly, at all relevant times there was in effect a statutory definition whereby the conduct of the applicant was lawfully described as sexual intercourse.  
     
      
    12 I have related these matters in order to demonstrate that there is no merit in the argument sought to be advanced by the applicant. In that circumstance, it is not necessary to consider in isolation whether the applicant should or should not be permitted to bring a second appeal to this Court some six years after conviction following his pleas of guilty. Neither is it necessary to elaborate upon the restriction upon the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain an appeal on a second occasion.  
     
      
    13 I propose that extension of time for lodging an appeal be refused. 
     
      
    14 HOWIE J: I agree. 
     
      
    15 LATHAM J: I also agree. 
     
      
    16 GROVE J: The order of the Court is that extension of time for lodging appeal is refused.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence of imprisonment of four years and eight months with a non parole period of two years and eight months, which was imposed following his plea of guilty to one count of supplying drugs on an ongoing basis (s 25A Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985). 
     
      
       
      FACTS 
       
      
    2 The applicant was arrested following his sale of heroin to an undercover agent on 19 August 2003, 21 August 2003 and 26 August 2003. The quantities sold on the first two occasions were 4.9 grams with a purity of 34.5%, and on the third occasion 5 grams with a purity of 35%. The sum paid on each occasion was $1400. 
     
      
    3 The sales were not isolated transactions. The applicant, who had been the subject of ongoing electronic and physical surveillance, was found to have received, over a period of thirteen days, some 1415 calls on his mobile telephone service, 85% of which openly involved the purchase, sale and packaging of drugs. Police estimate that eighty customers, or thereabouts, dealt with him on a daily basis over this period. On two occasions he offered to sell larger quantities of drugs to the undercover officer, comprising one ounce of heroin for $6,500 and later, two ounces of that drug. 
     
      
    4 On 24 August police intercepted 64 incoming calls and 12 outgoing calls on his mobile phone service, all of which were related to drug transactions. On 25 August he was placed under physical surveillance and observed to attend various addresses, and to meet with a number of people in his motor vehicle, which meetings obviously involved drug sales. 
     
      
    5 At the time of his arrest on 27 August he was found to be in a possession of four ounces of the drug packaged in balloons. He was released on bail but when, following his rearrest on 28 August, his rented premises were searched, some $2335 in cash was found, along with materials used for drug packaging, drug paraphernalia and white powder residue containing heroin. 
     
      
    6 The applicant had no prior record but did have a drug habit. He was aged thirty years at the time of his arrest. He admitted his guilt when interviewed by police and entered the plea in the Local Court. The sentencing judge gave him a fifteen percent discount for his early plea and for the remorse and contrition disclosed by that circumstance and by his admissions to police. Special circumstances were found referable to the applicant's age, prior good record, and good prospects of rehabilitation if given adequate guidance and proper supervision. 
     
      
       
      GROUND 1  
       
      
    7 In assessing the value of the plea in the remarks on sentence, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept that he has shown remorse by his early plea of guilty, and I take also into account his remorse is demonstrated by his agreeing to be interviewed by the police and admitting his involvement in the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        ... 
        
       
       
        
        I form the view that the offender should have the benefit of a discount for his early plea of guilty and his contrition. His contrition was not expressed before me in the court, but it can be inferred: he certainly made it clear to the probation and parole officer that he regretted his actions. He also, by partaking in an interview and admitting his guilt and pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity, gave tangible evidence of his contrition. 
        
       
       
        
        In the circumstances I consider a discount of fifteen percent for his plea of guilty and his facilitation of the administration of justice, together with his expressed contrition, is appropriate in this case”. 
        
       
       
      
    8 The remarks on sentence set out above make no reference to the strength of the Crown case. However, in the course of submissions, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I intend to allow him fifteen percent for the plea of guilty. One can say that the case for the Crown is a strong one but he did when being interviewed by police admit his guilt from the earliest. He hasn’t disputed the charge. I intend to allow him fifteen percent. I've read many cases where the Court of Criminal Appeal is critical of 20 percent being allowed in cases where there's a very strong case. In my view I should allow him fifteen percent”. 
        
       
      
    9 It is submitted that appellable error is shown in this passage insofar as it suggests that his Honour took into account the strength of the Crown case when assessing the utilitarian value of the plea, contrary to the decisions of this court in R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 45 NSWLR 383 at [137], R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [12], R v Brett [2004] NSWCCA 372 and R v Oliver [2005] NSWCCA 6.  
     
      
    10 It is by no means clear whether his Honour addressed the remarks in question to the utilitarian value of the plea or to the aspect of contrition. In any event, this court has had occasion in several recent decisions to emphasise that exchanges during the course of submissions do not form part of the reasons, and that it is not safe to assume that some observation passed by a judge, at that stage of the proceedings, represents a considered or final view as to the basis upon which a sentence is passed: see, for example, R v Kain [2004] NSWCCA 143 at [56], R v A [2004] NSWCCA 292 and R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94. The first leg of this submission is not made good. 
     
      
    11 It is next submitted that, given the early timing of the plea, its utilitarian value and the finding of contrition, a larger discount than fifteen percent should have been given. 
     
      
    12 In a case where the discount of only fifteen percent is given where the plea has been entered in the Local Court, it would normally be expected that clear and cogent reasons for so doing would be given, having regard to the judgment in Thomson & Houlton and to the warnings of this court, for example, in R v Johnstone [2004] NSWCCA 307. 
     
      
    13 The fact that a discount is pitched in the lower half of the range referred to in Thomson & Houlton, however, does not of itself guarantee success in an appeal against sentence. The question for this Court is whether some sentence other than that imposed was warranted in law and should have been passed: Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(3). This is the question to which the second ground of appeal was directed. 
     
      
       
      GROUND 2 - The sentence is manifestly excessive  
      
     14 The applicant advanced this submission by reference to the findings that “he was engaged in a regular supply of small quantities of heroin at the bottom end of the scale” and that he had “good prospects of rehabilitation”. Additionally, it was submitted that the sentence falls towards the top of the range as disclosed by the Judicial Commission’s statistics for all offenders. 
     
      
    15 It is to be observed that sentencing is not driven by these statistics. Although they do provide useful information as to the range, they mask the wide variety of objective and subjective circumstances found in the individual cases, which make up the statistical population, which also encompass a variety of drugs. 
     
      
    16 Of greater relevance for sentencing in this case is the fact that the maximum prescribed penalty is imprisonment for twenty years, an indication of the seriousness with which it is regarded by the legislature. In my view, the objective criminality here involved was very considerable. The drug involved was heroin; the amounts involved were not inconsiderable; the sales were clearly not isolated incidents but were part of a regular ongoing and planned criminal activity conducted by the applicant for financial reward and not simply to feed a habit. 
     
      
    17 As was pointed out in R v Khaled [2001] NSWCCA 169 at [19], there is a need for a sentence in relation to this offence to carry with it a strong message of general deterrence; see also R v Smiroldo (2000) 112 A Crim R 47. 
     
      
    18 It was asserted that error was disclosed by the fact that the applicant’s subjective circumstances were more favourable than those in R v Radford [2002] NSWCCA 122. However, as was pointed in R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 and R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 at [176] to [177], comparison between individual cases provides little by way of a basis for appellate review. 
     
      
    19 In order to succeed in this appeal the applicant needs to show that the sentence was so manifestly disproportionate to the objective and subjective circumstances that it can be said that a substantial “wrong” has occurred: House v The Queen (1936) 55 CLR 499. 
     
      
    20 I am not persuaded, in circumstances where the appellant’s objective criminality was significant, and where a finding of special circumstances was made, which led to a very considerable adjustment in the ratio between the non parole period and the balance of the term, that any lesser sentence than that imposed was warranted in law and should have been passed. 
     
      
    21 I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal.22 GROVE J: I agree. 
     
      
    23 HOEBEN J: I agree. 
     
      
    24 WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the court will be as I proposed.

      JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 GREG JAMES J:  Each of the offenders are persons to whom section 11 of the Childrens (Criminal Proceedings) Act applies so I refer to them by initials. Each of the offenders has pleaded guilty to one charge of manslaughter committed on 31 December 2002 at Emu Plains. 
     
      
    2 The offender, BM has also pleaded guilty to one count of common assault, that being an assault on the companion of the person who died whose death resulted in the charges of manslaughter to which I have referred. The offender, JT has similarly pleaded guilty to one count of common assault on that companion. The offender, MD has pleaded guilty also to one count that he stole a mobile telephone from the person of the young man who died. It now falls to me to pass sentence on all of these young offenders for those crimes. 
     
      
    3 It should be clear, notwithstanding some assertions that were made in the evidence in the trial which aborted, late last year that being a trial of each of the accused for murder, that none of the offenders are convicted of the crime of robbery and it is not for me to deal with them on a factual basis that amounts to the commission of that crime. None of the offenders are convicted of murder and none of the offenders are convicted of occasioning any bodily harm to the deceased’s companion and it is not for me to deal with them as though they had pleaded guilty to those crimes either. 
     
      
    4 Before me there is a victim’s impact statement provided by that companion and a psychiatric report provided in respect of the harm occasioned to that companion. Whilst I have taken the contents of those documents into account and particularly into account in respect of the sentencing on the common assault count and, whilst I have had regard to the effect on the companion of the assault upon the deceased, since that set the context for the common assault count, I am bound by law not to sentence in respect of the attacks upon the companion on the basis of any aggravation such that a more serious crime, for example assault occasioning actual bodily harm or any crime of malicious injury, had been committed.  
     
      
    5 Similarly in relation to the crime of manslaughter, assertions were made in the trial which might have founded, had they been accepted and acceptable, a basis for alleging the crime of murder against each of the accused. That basis was, however, in each case very weak indeed. For the crime of murder to have been committed it was necessary for the Crown to prove an act causing the death charged, accompanied by the relevant mental state or an accessorial liability or that the parties in company embarked upon that class of crime described in s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 which make persons accomplices, with those who do the act causing death, for them to be fixed with liability for murder. 
     
      
    6 None of those applied, on the basis upon which the Crown accepted the plea of guilty to manslaughter and, the basis, in each case, on which the plea of guilty to manslaughter was proffered by the offender. The basis upon which the plea of manslaughter in each case was proffered did not include that each of the offenders had combined together in a common design to rob and kill the deceased. That basis did not include that the offenders had combined together in some joint enterprise, reckless as to whether they killed or did not kill or reckless as to whether they might occasion even grievous bodily harm. Indeed that latter circumstance would not, in this State, have made the crime murder unless the common enterprise, or joint enterprise, included a crime of which s 18 of the Crimes Act speaks. 
     
      
    7 It therefore falls to me to deal with each of the offenders on their pleas, and on the basis on which the Crown accepted those pleas, in accordance with the principles of law applicable on sentencing and, particularly, because all of the offenders were children, as they are described in the legislation, at the time of the offence being committed, in accordance with the principles set out in the statutes dealing with children, notably the Childrens (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. 
     
      
    8 The pleas of guilty were entered, except in the case of JT, on 14 October 2004. JT’s plea was entered somewhat later in November 2004.  
     
      
    9 There is no relevant criminal history on any for the offenders. 
     
      
    10 The events which gave rise to the charges occurred on 31 December 2002 in the vicinity of the highway at Emu Plains alongside the park. They occurred late at night at a time when many of the young persons who had convened at the park were affected at least by alcohol, if not by alcohol and other substances. The events occurred in circumstances of poor lighting with patches of shadow created by vegetation and some degree of intermittent lighting coming from the highway with a fixed light around the vicinity of a power pole. 
     
      
    11 The deceased, his male companion and some young girls, were proceeding from the station to a party about an entirely lawful occasion. They passed by the oval at which various young people were assembled some considerable distance away. That group included the various offenders. 
     
      
    12 Persons from that group, including the offenders, moved either individually or in small sub-groups over to the highway. There an altercation occurred. The detail of that altercation - bearing in mind the condition of certain of the witnesses, their inability after the lapse of some considerable time to be reliably precise in many cases, and bearing in mind the various witnesses to some extent contradicted each the other, and sometimes were internally contradictory - is most difficult to ascertain, but, as I have already said, I am precluded by law from concluding that any one of the offenders, much less the group, were embarked upon an offence of robbery. 
     
      
    13 I have used the term “the group”. It is not at all clear to me that the various offenders acted as a group, and I cannot find that I am satisfied that they did. It is clear to me that some of the persons who came from the other side of the oval arrived at the scene. Some seemed to act individually and some in aid of one or more of the others. Certainly there was a call, which at least was transmitted back to the oval, suggestive that some companion, or a person well known to those assembled, had got himself somehow or other into a fight of which he was getting the worst. That call was completely mistaken. 
     
      
    14 What had happened instead was that the offender, MD, somehow, in confrontation with the deceased, resorted to physical violence, and at least punched the deceased and at least, in some fashion, frightened, propelled, pushed, chased or herded the deceased, head-on into the pole. He sustained severe cerebral injuries and fell to the ground. It is not at all clear how the deceased came to collide with the pole, whether he was forced or frightened into the collision. The evidence would support the proposition that he was propelled into the pole by his own motion possibly to some extent assisted by an attempt to push him or herd him. 
     
      
    15 The evidence does not allow me to find that after that event the offender, MD, kicked or punched the deceased in the head while the deceased was lying recumbent on the ground. 
     
      
    16 The admission that is made by the plea by MD and by that of each of the offenders, though I will have some more to say about this in the case of BM, is that the offender’s acts in each case amounted to an unlawful and dangerous assault. Although in the case of MD it appears that assault, constituted by the initial punching and causing the victim to collide with the pole was of a greater degree of severity, it was an assault which, combination with the other assaults, contributed substantially to the death of the deceased. It was an assault which it appears on the evidence to me is established as having a greater contributing potential than the cumulative effects of the assaults of the co-accused. The deceased died from the combination of the acts done to him, although it is not established that any of the offenders intended any serious harm to him. 
     
      
    17 MD has, as have all of the offenders, expressed their contrition for what they did that night. In the case of MD it was the Crown case that either MD actually propelled the deceased into the power pole, or that the contact with the power pole occurred when the deceased was trying to escape from assault and the threat of further assaults. The plea proceeded on that basis. 
     
      
    18 The offender NA denied being party to any concert to assault but did accept that he pushed the deceased and punched him about four or five times when the deceased was on the ground incapable of defending himself and was vulnerable. It is conceded by his plea that, in so punching the deceased, these unlawful and dangerous acts contributed substantially to the deceased’s death. 
     
      
    19 The offender, JT, also denies being party to any concert to assault the deceased, but accepts that he kicked the deceased to the head at a time following the assaults on the deceased by MD and NA. The preponderance of evidence does establish in my view that he said at that time – “wake up.” 
     
      
    20 The submission has been put that I should accept that the kick was more in the nature of a nudge intended to rouse. I do not accept that it was of that little significance. I do accept that it was of sufficient violence to contribute substantially to the death of the deceased. It may be, although this is a matter for speculation, that JT thought that the deceased was shamming having been seriously affected by the earlier assaults, and treated him in this way with a view to trying to bring him to his feet, but that has not been given in evidence. Nor indeed have any of the offenders given evidence themselves on their pleas.  
     
      
    21 I am not satisfied that the offender, JT, stomped on the head of the deceased. There is no evidence to that effect, nor any admission, to that effect. I accept however that the kick was intentional. I accept that it caused the harm to which I have referred.  
     
      
    22 I can only accept, consistent with the pleas in the cases of all of the three offenders to whom I have referred, that there was an intention unlawfully to assault with the acceptance that would cause some physical harm but that it was not within the contemplation of any of the offenders that grievous bodily harm would be caused by the acts they did notwithstanding those acts contributed to the death of the deceased. 
     
      
    23 In the case of BM the Crown concedes that although there was some evidence of BM punching and kicking the deceased, the credibility and reliability of that evidence is questionable. Consequently I do not accept that he did those things. 
     
      
    24 His plea was not entered on the basis that BM himself did a discrete act of an unlawful and dangerous kind to the deceased substantially contributing to the death. The basis of the pleas was that what he did was to assault the companion in order to prevent the companion going to the aid of the deceased when the deceased was being assaulted by one or more of the other three. In that sense he gave active approval and encouragement and aided and abetted what was occurring. His offence is one of complicity rather than taking a primary violent role in the attack on the deceased. It is in that respect that I referred earlier to my saying more concerning the element of concert in his case. 
     
      
    25 It is not established that any one of these offenders concerted with any other or others to aid that other or others in what was being done. BM’s assistance did not seem sought by the others. Further the sequence of these events remains, after hearing the mass of evidence that was before me in the Crown case at that trial, still suspect. 
     
      
    26 It is the Crown case the attack on the deceased was brutal and cowardly. One can only agree. There seems no basis on which one could conclude that the attack was in any way provoked by any behaviour on the part of the deceased or his companions who were merely proceeding about their lawful occasion heading to a lawful party for the purpose of having a happy and peaceful night out.  
     
      
    27 The community will not tolerate gang violence, nor will it tolerate individual assaults by those minded to commit brutal and cowardly acts upon persons who are merely innocuously passing by. I will have to have regard to that when coming to sentence each of the offenders in relation to the matters to which I have referred as affecting the objective seriousness of their offences. 
     
      
    28 In the case of MD he was also observed to take from the recumbent body of the deceased, at a time when the deceased was disabled, the mobile phone. I have already mentioned how BM assaulted the companion, and JT also punched the companion.  
     
      
    29 Whatever it was that motivated all of this and the various confrontations is simply not at all clear. I cannot find beyond reasonable doubt what it was that caused the matter to escalate from what was no doubt some exchange of words between the deceased or his companion, and the boys who had run up to them out of the dark from the oval, that produced this explosion of violence in which it seems the various offenders acted more or less triggered by some sort of instant stimulus to mindless brutality. They have had, however, in each case a considerable time to consider their position and have now pleaded guilty. The pleas will, in each case, be accepted as some evidence of contrition. 
     
      
    30 I will turn, first, with thanks to his counsel for the detailed and exhaustive written submissions, to the circumstances of MD. In his case a plea to manslaughter was apparently offered on the first day of the trial. I have already referred to the date upon which, in due course, the plea was entered. That offer of a plea to manslaughter was not initially accepted by the Crown. It was an offer which had some substantial utilitarian effect, notwithstanding that the evidence, in my view, left it appropriate, bearing in mind the difficulties with many of the witnesses, for the Crown to proceed on the charge of murder until it became apparent that there were such difficulties that the Crown elected to take the benefit of the pleas to manslaughter. 
     
      
    31 I have therefore reached the view that there should be a ten per cent allowance made for the utilitarian value of the plea in his case. He has been in custody since 9 January 2003 and in continued custody.  
     
      
    32 The principles I must apply to the sentencing for a serious children’s indictable offence are set out in the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. The offender is to be dealt with according to law which means he is to be sentenced in accordance with the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  I must have regard, therefore, to the matters referred to in Div 4 of Pt 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act which applies to serious indictable offences. Section 18 1A) requires: 
     
      
       
        
        “In determining whether a person is to be dealt with according to law or in accordance with Division 4 of Part 3, a court must have regard to the following matters: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the seriousness of the indictable offence concerned 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the nature of the indictable offence concerned, 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the age and maturity of the person at the time of the offence and at the time of sentencing, 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the seriousness, nature and number of any prior offences committed by the person, 
        
       
       
        
        (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.” 
        
       
      
    33 MD was born on 16 December 1985 and, as I have already said, the fact is that in his case there is no relevant prior serious criminality.  
     
      
    34 Section 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act requires all courts to have regard to the principles stated in s 6. Those principles include that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity require guidance and assistance and that the penalty to be imposed upon a child should reflect that, wherever possible, the education of the child should proceed without interruption. 
     
      
    35 It has been accepted by the courts that any court exercising criminal jurisdiction even in a case of this kind should give particular emphasis to the prospects of rehabilitation and the offender’s prospects for the future such that, as the offender approaches more closely to adulthood, that principle would fall to be regarded as of less significance and the offender more likely to be treated more like an adult, but it is in the public interest that young persons who have committed a serious crime - and there is no more serious crime than taking the life of another member of the community - should be rehabilitated and assisted in progression to become a worthy member of society. 
     
      
    36 In this regard the Act requires that I take into account and in each case I do, the background reports that have been furnished by the New South Wales Department of Juvenile Justice. 
     
      
    37 In each case, except that of JT, I will, in addition, take into account the evidence the Programs Unit Assessment provided with that report. 
     
      
    38 I accept that considerations of general deterrence, generally in the case of young persons, would receive less emphasis, having regard to issues of rehabilitation, than they would with adults. It is only because of the background reports and the absence of significant prior relevant criminality that I am minded to consider at their age - approaching as it did, adulthood - that the principle of general deterrence should receive less weight than would be afforded to it in the case of adults who had done the same as these boys did. 
     
      
    39 I do not regard the presence of alcohol and its effects, or the effects of other substances, as in any way mitigatory or as in any way suggesting that the principle of general deterrence should not have received substantial regard in sentencing. 
     
      
    40 However, in each case each offender has received the benefit of that Juvenile Justice report which in each case, and particularly in the case of NA, strongly suggests good prospects of rehabilitation and, in each case, supports that each offender is truly contrite - not just for having got themselves into this difficulty, but for having caused the harm that they did. It is in that context that I will apply the principle of general deterrence to a lesser extent than I would apply it to adults who had done what they had done. 
     
      
    41 I am particularly concerned, in having regard to that principle, because the objective gravity of their actions that night, even considered now in a courtroom with the benefit of analysis and some years of hindsight, and allowing them the benefit of the deficiencies in the evidence is nonetheless very high.  
     
      
    42 I have a function to protect the community by in sentencing applying both general and specific deterrence and, although in this case I accept the principle of deterrence should receive lesser weight, I nonetheless will have regard to the proper weight that should be accorded to it, to represent the community’s denunciation of the conduct that occurred that night and to embrace the principle of community protection through deterrence and retribution. 
     
      
    43 In s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 there are set out various criteria to which I must have regard. The aggravating factors set out in s 21A(2) include that the offences involved the actual use of violence, was committed in company, that the injury was substantial, that it was committed without regard for public safety, and that the victim was vulnerable. The offences involved two victims and a series of criminal acts, but, having said that - and what I have just said concerning those elements is applicable to all of the offenders - I am not to give additional regard to those factors so far as they are elements of the very offences charged.  
     
      
    44 Section 21A(3) provides for mitigating factors. In each case the offender does not have any significant record of previous convictions. I will refer in the case of each offender to the material before me concerning the offender’s character as put forward particularly by reference to, in the case of NA, by a letter written by him to me, which was tendered in evidence and became an exhibit in the case. 
     
      
    45 In each case there is the expression of opinion from the Department of Juvenile Justice of the prospects each offender might have for rehabilitation and the prospects concerning the offender re-offending. I have referred to each offender showing remorse and contrition. I have also referred to each offender not being fully aware of the consequences of his actions when I referred to the way in which these offences came to be committed and that in the atmosphere of the night, the escalation to violence and what might have caused it to have reached the peak that it did, did not seem to be appreciated by the individuals. 
     
      
    46 I have regard, in each case under s 22, to the guilty pleas. I have regard, in each case - and I will refer to it - to the period spent in custody by each offender. 
     
      
    47 I return to the submissions in relation to MD. I find, in his case, special circumstances when applying s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I am required under s 44 as it stood at the date of the offences to set the term of the sentence and then to fix a non-parole period. That non-parole period must not be less than three quarters of the term of the sentence, unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being less, in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision. 
     
      
    48 The special circumstances MD’s case include, the age of the offender and his comparative immaturity. In the Juvenile Justice report it appears that he has acknowledged his circumstances and the consequences by way of sentencing which may apply to him, he has been compliant and reflective, he has evidenced a genuine remorse, and he has significant community-based support giving him a response to custody which shows a positive attitude which may well be on the way to producing in him a non-offending lifestyle when released into the community. I have here paraphrased the remarks of the Deputy Governor of the custodial institution in which he has been held.  
     
      
    49 A report from the principal of the Kariong School refers to his satisfactory level of involvement and his taking advantage of all offers whilst in custody in an effort to ensure positive options when he is released.  
     
      
    50 His life had centred around his family and at the time of these events he was deprived of a member of that family, that apparently having a considerable effect upon his ability fully to appreciate his circumstances in life. He has positively progressed within the classification system. 
     
      
    51 In those circumstances I have concluded that special circumstances exist in the matters to which I have referred and in the current assessment made by the Intensive Programs Unit which concludes that he is able to comprehend the impact of his offending behaviour. He showed an appropriate level of remorse, empathy and sincerity, and he is willing to embark upon such counselling and courses as the Department requires of him. I therefore conclude that there are special circumstances, not only for the purpose of applying s 44, but also when considering whether to apply s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. 
     
      
    52 There is, in addition to the report of the two Juvenile Justice background reports, other evidence of his subjective circumstances. The offender had the benefit of a close and highly supportive relationship with his family. He has, as I have said, a strong prospect of rehabilitation. He had been in full time employment - and full time employment is available for him on release. He had cooperated by way of interview with the police.  
     
      
    53 He is now eighteen years of age and it is appropriate that he and, as will be seen the others, serve the sentences as juvenile offenders. In each case the warrant of commitment will need to reflect the order I will make pursuant to s 19 of this Act.  
     
      
    54 I was provided, helpfully by the Crown and by counsel for MD, with a summary of the various sentences passed in many cases on young offenders, juveniles or children, as they are defined by the Act for offences of manslaughter. 
     
      
    55 Manslaughter, of all crimes, has been referred to as that which takes the most disparate forms. The acts or omissions which might cause death which are punishable within the crime of manslaughter range in their gravity from acts almost accidental to those verging on murder. The range of culpability in manslaughter is very wide but it is always an offence of great seriousness because a member of the community has had their life taken unlawfully. 
     
      
    56 The sentencing statistics provided by the Judicial Commission and the various cases in summary form referred to by Mr Zahra SC in his submissions are of limited utility in trying to attribute to the actions of MD that night, his particular actions, a specific degree of culpability which might be expressed, subject to the various subjective considerations and applying the principles of law, in a particular sentence.  
     
      
    57 Having regard to those subjective factors to which I have referred and to all the references and certificates, including the chaplain’s report, Ex 5D to which I have particularly referred when considering the application of s 19, I have concluded that, in the case of MD, that he should have passed upon him, and I so pass, a sentence of six months fixed term for the crime of steal from the person, to date from the date he went into custody on 9 January 2003 and to expire on 8 July 2003 and for the crime of manslaughter, I impose a full term of five and a half years to date from 9 April 2003 to expire on 8 October 2008. 
     
      
    58 Having regard to the special circumstances to which I have referred, I impose a non-parole period of three and a half years to date from 9 April 2003 and expire on 8 October 2006. Having regard to the special circumstances to which I have referred, I direct the whole of the sentence is to be served as a juvenile offender. 
     
      
    59 I pass, then, to the case of NA. Much that I have already said concerning the other offenders applies in this case. Again there is a chaplain’s report. Again I have reference to its contents particularly concerning the application of s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. Again in this case the offender has shown genuine contrition and remorse. The materials with which I have been provided in his case also include the background report and the assessment. That background report refers to, again, a family orientation and that maintained somewhat surprisingly notwithstanding the split in the family. The dependence on the now deceased grandparent is notable. The later contact that had been resumed between the parents left the relationship still troubled, and there had been some conflict between NA and his stepmother. None of this, however, gives one much of a clue as to what the dynamics must have been that underlie the offence being committed by NA that night. 
     
      
    60 There is reference in the material to his involvement with unsuitable peers at school. The evidence does not establish whether those persons were among the number of people assembled that night at Emu Plains and I do not feel that all persons so assembled could properly be described as falling within that category. 
     
      
    61 The response to custody noted in the Departmental records included reference to there being an apprehension on his behalf concerning his safety. No basis has been put before me to suggest that any particular person should be regarded as responsible for that apprehension. 
     
      
    62 However, the circumstances of his detention were then, and may well be for the future, somewhat more onerous because of the matters to which that apprehension relates, than might be the case with the other offenders. 
     
      
    63 Certain it was that he was assaulted in October 2004 and has remained highly anxious and emotional. I have particular regard to that and the detail of those matters given in the background report. I have particular regard also to the fact that it was this offender who initially offered to plead guilty and it was he who at trial offered a plea of guilty at the outset to the jury, a plea of guilty to manslaughter, a plea that was rejected by the Crown. In effect he admitted publicly at the start of the trial his responsibility for an act causing death done as an unlawful and dangerous act.  
     
      
    64 He is now a person who has impressed the Juvenile Justice authorities as a personable, mature and insightful young man. However, that report continues that “He has unfortunately been involved in the tragic death of another person.” To express it in that way is to understate what occurred. He was more than unfortunately involved, he substantially caused that death, and I must have regard to that when sentencing. 
     
      
    65 I have regard to all the materials provided - and there are a mass of them in the written materials that were handed to me in book form as well as the material provided in the Juvenile Justice reports - which make it clear these events that night and his involvement in them seem to have been entirely out of character for him, and that his reaction thereafter was to display contrition and guilt in a dramatic way. He has comprehensive support from his family such that the positive prospects for his rehabilitation are reinforced. 
     
      
    66 The Intensive Programs report recommends that certain issues which it is said might be manifested in him should be adequately addressed in counselling, and this particularly for the purpose of relapse prevention and management of negative mood issues. Certainly the application of such a program will tend to avoid inappropriate peer associations. 
     
      
    67 There has, in his case, been an episode of a dramatic kind in which he either attempted suicide or attempted to act it out. It is not at all clear how that relates to his manifestations of guilt but I take it into account as reflecting his attitude to the crime he had committed and to the life that he has been leading since. Amongst the recommendations of the assessment team are recommendations which are designed to ensure that he does not harm himself in the future. 
     
      
    68 The matters referred to in that report, and to which I have already referred, plainly constitute, taking his age into account and the nature of the offence, special circumstances, when one comes to considering the relationship of the non-parole period to the full term of the sentence, and the application of s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act.  
     
      
    69 With the materials provided to me there was provided a psychologist’s report. That psychologist’s report refers to the anxiety about depression and to the suicidal ideation. It refers to the difficulties he has had in custody whereby he will suffer a more onerous regime, whether imposed by himself or external influences is not clear, and it is clear to the psychologist that he might be permitted back into the community with regular supervision. 
     
      
    70 Also provided as part of the materials were a great many references to which I have regard, including one from his father and one from his mother. 
     
      
    71 There was also provided the letter that he has written to me. I do not have any reason to doubt the truth of what he says in that letter. Although it was not evidence given in the witness box on oath its admissibility was not objected to by the Crown. Nor was its content challenged and it accords with the other material. 
     
      
    72 It refers to the four to five punches to the left side of the deceased’s jaw and cheek. It refers to his attack on the deceased as being an unthinking one. It refers to his contrition for the harm that he has done in contributing to the taking of the life and the blame he has put on himself for it. It is a letter which speaks very highly for his prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    73 The submissions on his behalf note that he has been in custody since 14 October 2004 and that he accepts, by his plea, his responsibility for his individual actions, his punching, his contributing to the death of the deceased.  
     
      
    74 In the submissions it is put that I would not accept that his punching occurred with knowledge that the deceased had been propelled, or had run into, the pole. The evidence does not allow me to conclude that he did see what MD had caused to happen but he was aware of the victim lying at the base of the pole, vulnerable. 
     
      
    75 Prior to his going into custody on 4 October 2004 he had been subject to stringent bail conditions. I have regard to that, in particular, when considering the commencement date of the sentences. I assess his offer of plea and its utilitarian value as fifteen per cent. I have concluded there are special circumstances such that the non-parole period to full term proportion should be varied, particularly with a view to his rehabilitation. 
     
      
    76 I have concluded there are special circumstances such that the order should be made under s 19 that he should serve the whole sentence as a juvenile offender. 
     
      
    77 NA, you are sentenced to a full term of four and a half years’ imprisonment to commence on 1 September 2004 and to expire on 28 February 2009 with a two year non-parole period to date from 1 September 2004 and to expire on 31 August 2006. I backdate the sentence beyond the date you entered into custody to reflect the particular stringent bail conditions and the circumstances of the regime under which you have been held since. 
     
      
    78 I shall move now to the case of BM. Again, much of what I have said at the commencement of these remarks applies to BM. He was born on 21 March 1986. He went into custody on 14 October 2004. The plea he offered was offered in very much the same circumstances as MD. He will receive a ten per cent discount for the utilitarian value of it. 
     
      
    79 His offence, as I have already referred to, was not one of applying direct physical violence to the deceased, but he stands convicted of two offences. They include complicity in the manslaughter, committed by assaulting the companion with a view to preventing the companion going to the aid of the deceased, and the offence of assaulting the companion. It is important, in proper application of sentencing principle, to have regard to how the elements of these offences overlap. In this case they overlap considerably. So far do they overlap that, although in each case I have fixed a sentence appropriate for the particular offence, I have determined that the sentences should be concurrent but it must be remembered that there is an additional component in the assault on Sean Clifford relevant to the overall sentencing that the motivation for that assault was not simply to assault the companion, but also to deter assistance being given to the deceased which is reflected in the manslaughter sentence. 
     
      
    80 The plea was accepted by the Crown on the basis of liability as an accessory. It was accepted that the offender saw punches thrown by one or more of the other boys at the deceased, before the deceased ran and collided with the pole. It was at about that time that the companion apparently went to go to his aid and, at that time, the offender punched the companion twice. He was aware in doing so that he was helping those who were assaulting the deceased. He denies any further involvement after those two punches. That was what he had said at the time of his plea and that was what he said when he spoke to the police and that was what the Crown opened to the jury at the trial. 
     
      
    81 The evidence, whilst I have already referred to it as being somewhat inconsistent and somewhat confused, does not, in my view denigrate from the position as it was put by the Crown although, I have already referred to the Crown concession as to the reliability and credibility of certain of the witnesses. 
     
      
    82 He was sixteen years old at the time of the commission of the offences and I have already referred, in the case of MD, to the general principles of sentencing which I will apply in the case of each of the offenders. 
     
      
    83 I accept - and I will refer to this in some further detail when I turn to the other materials provided as to his subjective circumstances - that he was of prior good character, that he remained out of trouble during the lengthy period he was on remand and he was subjected to stringent bail conditions. 
     
      
    84 I accept, and in particular from the report of the Juvenile Justice, that he shows genuine remorse and that he has evidenced that remorse not only to Juvenile Justice but to his parents, his aunt, and as recorded in the report of Joel Rombouts dated 10 March 2005. 
     
      
    85 I consider having regard to the material, and in particular the Juvenile Justice report, that there is not only genuine contrition but also good prospects of rehabilitation. I shall have regard to the stringent conditions imposed upon him on bail when passing sentence. 
     
      
    86 I find, in his case, again having regard to the matters in the Juvenile Justice report in particular, special circumstances which warrant the reduction of the non-parole period, particularly his age and immaturity at the time and his prospects of rehabilitation. I similarly find those special circumstances make it appropriate that I direct the whole of the sentence to be served as a juvenile offender and I so direct. 
     
      
    87 His counsel has submitted, and I accept, that it is necessary to reflect the abhorrence the community has for the taking of human life. I have expressed in each case that that is a matter to which the most important regard must be had when sentencing for manslaughter. His counsel has accepted the necessity for the imposition of a head sentence of some years. 
     
      
    88 In this case, and in the cases of all the offenders, it is necessary that there be passed a sentence such as to reflect the community’s abhorrence not only of what each individual did, but also the consequence of that behaviour, but I particularly have regard here, as I have had with the other offenders, to the special function of a longer parole period in achieving the rehabilitation of young offenders sentenced according to law. 
     
      
    89 In BM’s case, the notable feature is the lack of any direct violence applied to the deceased, and the overlap in the elements of the various offences leading to an appropriate concurrency.  
     
      
    90 The statements with which I have been provided include the statements of his parents which makes perfectly clear that the family is fully supportive of their son, notwithstanding their insight into what he has done, and their appreciation of what he might need for the future. 
     
      
    91 The other references make it clear that he had a prior good character involving conscientious work, even under difficult circumstances.  
     
      
    92 The chaplain’s report has, in his case, referred to a character which is friendly, caring and one not afraid to learn. Again specific reference is made to the appropriateness of his staying within the Juvenile Justice system. 
     
      
    93 The clinical psychologist’s report, with which I have been provided, refers to his having been influenced by his peer group. I am prepared to accept that conclusion on the material. I am prepared to accept that that influence included an influence towards drugs and alcohol. That report refers to his having received a serious “wake-up call” for his life, and his willingness to take full responsibility. That is the matter to which I have referred earlier when I made reference to his evidencing remorse. 
     
      
    94 The background report concludes that he possesses a number of protective factors that would serve to promote his overall rehabilitation and re-integration into the community. Those factors include relocation of his family. The author, whilst properly referring to the difficulty of assessing a risk of re-offending, referred to the level of remorse coupled with those factors as supporting his future prospects. The conclusion is that positive rehabilitation is likely. 
     
      
    95 The assessment report makes particular reference to the level of positive functional family relations and the stability and support within the family, and that those factors are such as to protect, or buffer, against the risk of re-offending in his case. The report does, as I think indeed all the offenders’ reports do, recommend that there should be continued support and assistance upon release. 
     
      
    96 BM, for the offence of common assault you are sentenced to a six month fixed term to date from 14 September 2004. The backdate is to reflect the regime under which you were held on bail. That sentence will expire on 13 March 2005. 
     
      
    97 For manslaughter you are sentenced to a full term of four years’ imprisonment to expire on 13 October 2008 with a non-parole period of two years to commence on 14 September 2004 and to expire on 13 September 2006. The concurrency is to reflect the overlap between the elements of the various offences. 
     
      
    98 I find special circumstances, as I have already referred to, as contained in the Juvenile Justice report such as warrant the difference in proportion between the non-parole period and the head sentence and as supporting the direction, which I give, that the whole of the sentence must be served as a juvenile offender. 
     
      
    99 I turn to the last of the offenders, JT. I have already referred to the actions of this offender. It does not appear that he had any prior involvement in the violence inflicted upon the deceased and it does not appear that the assault upon Mr Clifford was committed with some additional component of preventing Mr Clifford from aiding the deceased. 
     
      
    100 It is the Crown case, in relation to JT, that NA was in the process of punching the deceased when JT arrived on the scene. In effect he saw the deceased incapable and being punched in the head, and thereafter kicked the deceased. The kick was one I find of some considerable violence, though I am unable to be satisfied that it was a kick that was struck with full strength. It was intentionally done. Beyond that, the evidence really leaves one in some considerable difficulty and unable to make any finding of any further aggravating nature in the conduct. 
     
      
    101 Similarly there is little material that establishes with any clarity what he did to Mr Clifford. It is asserted he swung a punch which missed. 
     
      
    102 The plea in his case was much later than that of the others. . In due course, however, he did plead and he thus obviated the holding of a further trial, even if it had been limited to manslaughter which would have been of some considerable length and would have affected adversely no doubt many of the witnesses who had already given evidence. The plea was of some utilitarian value but only limited utilitarian value. I allow five per cent. 
     
      
    103 His action, as I have already said, was simply one kick, and I accept he is to be sentenced not for repetitive damaging behaviour but for that one kick and for the assault on Clifford. His kick, however, by his plea, he has admitted was at least to some substantial extent a contributing factor to the death of the deceased.  
     
      
    104 Thus it is that only one of the offenders did not directly, by violence, contribute to the death of the deceased, and that was BM. The deceased died as a result of the compound effect of the multiple blows. I cannot find that any one, much less JT, in inflicting those blows had a realisation of any real harm being likely to be caused. That, however, is not to understate the fact that the harm was caused and that the individual caused substantial contributing harm which produced the death of the deceased, but I have to sentence JT on the basis that, although he swung the kick, and although perhaps a kick of that kind may be more serious than one or two punches, it was one action as opposed to a number of actions. 
     
      
    105 There is no evidence which would establish that JT’s involvement prior to the kicking was in any way in concert with any of the others, though it was clear that at the time he kicked the deceased the deceased was lying disabled and probably unconscious. 
     
      
    106 The assault on Clifford seems to be, as far as I can ascertain, such that I should not find it to be more culpable than swinging a punch at Clifford. I cannot hold that it caused any particular harm to Clifford. 
     
      
    107 I do not regard the fact that it is said JT was well affected by alcohol as mitigating. He was seventeen at the time of these offences, having been born on 3 April 1985, and he has been in custody since 3 January 2003. 
     
      
    108 It was accepted by his counsel, and it is plainly right, that a gaol penalty must be imposed. I do have to have regard to the fact his action does not seem to have been premeditated and calculated to cause harm. 
     
      
    109 Again in the background report there is material that shows that there has been considerable progress made by him although there have been some negative aspects of his long remand. He has moved from that to taking advantage of many of the educational opportunities offered to him and has completed various educational courses. His mother has remained very supportive of him, as has his sister and girlfriend. 
     
      
    110 The assessment included that he had suffered from having grown up without the benefit of a positive male model, and in circumstances in which he has become accustomed to some degree of violence around him. 
     
      
    111 His attitude that has evolved in those circumstances appeared to justify violence, this particularly because of the activities of those peers with whom he associated. His parent did not seem able to cope with that matter. 
     
      
    112 The author of the report concludes that his regret for the critical consequences and the harm that he caused is genuine, that his reaction which caused him to swing the kick was more or less instinctive in a way that was typical for him having been conditioned by the violent circumstances around him during his earlier life. 
     
      
    113 It is clear he would benefit from continued counselling specifically targeted to negate the effects of those circumstances and to reduce the possible risk of any further offending. 
     
      
    114 The report is of less assistance on his prospects for rehabilitation but, having regard to the time he has been in custody, his progress, he has made efforts to use the time constructively, has significant educational achievements and whilst on parole will be subject to supervision such that he might be directed to embark upon appropriate courses to ensure that such violent effects of his earlier life are negated. 
     
      
    115 I conclude that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, particularly in the light of the further report from the Gerald Anderson Walpole School at Kariong which points out there is no discipline problem, that he was compliant, helpful, interested and motivated at all times. 
     
      
    116 The chaplain’s report referred to some occasions on which he had warranted attention but particularly important, from the viewpoint of whether rehabilitation might be achieved, is the reference to his: 
     
      
       
        
        “On those occasions climbing down and taking responsibility for his actions. He has assisted others who have been having difficulty within the system.” 
        
       
      
    117 I have referred to the chaplain’s conclusions that his remorse is genuine and that he has matured “in a big way since coming to Kariong.” He apparently has the potential to make positive contributions to society in the future. I have regard to the chaplain’s expression of view that he would benefit by being detained in custody as a juvenile offender. 
     
      
    118 In his case, as in the others, in the matters referred to in the Juvenile Justice’s background report there are special circumstances as with the others relating to his age, state of maturity, prospects of rehabilitation and the nature of the crime.  
     
      
    119 It is appropriate, therefore, that I find - and I do - special circumstances in relation to the proportion the non-parole period is to bear to the whole sentence and in relation to s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. 
     
      
    120 I will direct, in his case, the full sentence to be served as a juvenile offender. 121 JT, for the assault on Mr Clifford you are sentenced to six months’ fixed term from 3 January 2003 to expire on 3 July 2003.  122 For manslaughter you are sentenced to a full term of four years’ imprisonment to date from 3 April 2003 and expire on 2 April 2007. In that regard I impose a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from 3 April 2003 and expire on 3 October 2005. 123 I refer again to the special circumstances I have found in respect of that non-parole period and in the light of those special circumstances direct the full sentence is to be served as a juvenile offender.

    2 SIMPSON J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    3 HIDDEN J: This is a case stated by Norrish DCJ, pursuant to s5B of the Criminal Appeal Act, arising from the appellant’s appeal to the District Court against his summary conviction of two charges of committing an act of indecency towards a person under the age of ten years, an offence under s61O(2) of the Crimes Act. His Honour has submitted two questions of law for the determination of this Court: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Does an offence of committing an act of indecency “towards” another person pursuant to s61O(2) of the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 NSW on its proper construction require that a relevant act of indecency be committed in the immediate physical presence of the victim? 
        
       
       
        
        2. If so, did I err in law in holding that, in the circumstances of these alleged offences, the “towards” element of the s61O(2) charges was established? 
        
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    4 The charges arose out of the same incident, involving two complainants. In the case stated his Honour set out the facts which he found as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        At about 2.25pm on 21 November 2002 JV and LM, then both aged 6 years, were travelling in a bus with other school children in Elizabeth Drive, Liverpool, New South Wales. There were present in the bus several teachers and parents. JV and LM were sitting together at the rear seat and on the driver’s side of the bus at all relevant times. 
         
         
        JV saw the appellant driving a motor vehicle adjacent to the bus and she observed that he was “wiggling his penis”, that is manipulating it with his hand. She saw that he was looking at them and smiling and laughing in her direction. When the two vehicles were stationary at a traffic light with the appellant’s vehicle adjacent to the side of the bus at which the children were sitting the appellant pulled his pants down and manipulated his penis in a manner which JV demonstrated as a stroking or hand moving exercise. He did that four times. He did this while his vehicle was stationary along the rear portion of the bus, JV being seated at the rear of the bus on the right hand side. 
         
         
        LM saw the appellant in the motor vehicle which had been driven to a position beside the right hand rear of the bus. She saw that he had pulled his pants down to his knees and that he was “wiggling” his penis by moving it with his hand. 
         
         
        The appellant committed these acts when at a distance of between 3 and 6 metres from the complainants. They were able to see him and he was able to see them. He intended that his actions should be seen by them. The evidence of the appellant smiling established that the appellant achieved, or sought to achieve, some form of sexual gratification from his conduct. 
        
       
       
      The issue for determination 
       
      
    5 Before his Honour, it had been submitted on behalf of the appellant that indecent conduct “towards” a person, within the meaning of s61O(2), had to be conduct perpetrated in the immediate presence of the victim, such that there was a prospect of physical contact between them. It was argued that that element could not be established in this case because the appellant and the complainants were in different vehicles. However, his Honour held that, to whatever extent proximity between offender and victim was a requirement, it was met in this case. His Honour found that the appellant’s conduct was “towards” the complainants in the relevant sense by reason of that proximity, and the fact that he could see the complainants and they him, and that he intended that they should see what he was doing. 
     
      
    6 Mr Rosser, who appeared for the appellant before Judge Norrish and in this Court, took us to the history of the provision under which his client had been charged, s61O(2) of the Crimes Act. That sub-section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        Any person who commits an act of indecency with or towards a person under the age of 10 years, or incites a person under that age to an act of indecency with or towards that or another person, is liable to imprisonment for 7 years. 
        
       
      
    7 The offence of committing an act of indecency with or towards a person was first introduced into the Crimes Act in 1974, as s76A. That section provided: 
     
      
       
        
        Any person who commits any act of indecency with or towards any girl under the age of sixteen years, or incites a girl under that age to any act of indecency with him or another, shall be liable to imprisonment for two years. 
        
       
      
    8 In 1981, s76A was repealed and replaced by s61E(2). Except that it provided for offences against “a person”, regardless of gender, that sub-section was not relevantly different from its predecessor. It provided: 
     
      
       
        
        Any person who commits an act of indecency with or towards a person under the age of 16 years, or incites a person under that age to an act of indecency with that or another person, shall be liable to imprisonment for 2 years. 
        
       
      
    9 The High Court was called upon to consider the ambit of s61E(2) in Saraswati v The Queen (1990-91) 172 CLR 1. For that purpose, McHugh J (at 25-7) examined the rationale for the introduction into the Crimes Act of its predecessor, s76A. His Honour referred to two decisions of the English Court of Criminal Appeal in which it was held that the offence of indecent assault could not be made out where a man had requested a young girl to touch him indecently and she had complied: Fairclough v Whipp (1951) 35 Cr App R 138 and DPP v Rogers [1953] 1 WLR 1017.  
     
      
    10 The charge could not lie in either case because there was no conduct on the part of the man which could amount to an assault in the relevant sense (allowing for the fact that, if there had been such conduct, the consent of the child would have been no defence). It was to cure this deficiency in the offence of indecent assault, for which there was provision in the Crimes Act, that the legislature created the new offence of committing “any act of indecency with or towards” a girl under the relevant age.  
     
      
    11 The issue in Saraswati was whether three charges against that appellant of committing an act of indecency under s61E(2) were appropriate when the conduct alleged amounted to indecent assault (s61E(1)) as to two charges, and carnal knowledge (s71) as to the remaining charge. The significance of the issue was that, by virtue of s78, charges of indecent assault and carnal knowledge were subject to a limitation period, whereas the charge of committing an act of indecency was not. The majority, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ, held that s61E(2) did not embrace that conduct. 
     
      
    12 Of course, as a matter of ordinary usage, the behaviour alleged on the part of Mr Saraswati could be described as the commission of acts of indecency. However, McHugh J, with whose judgment Toohey J agreed, referred to ss33 and 34 of the Interpretation Act and the purposive approach to statutory construction encouraged by modern authority. His Honour said (at 21): 
     
      
       
        
        In many cases, the grammatical or literal meaning of a statutory provision will give effect to the purpose of the legislation. Consequently, it will constitute the “ordinary meaning"" to be applied. If, however, the literal or grammatical meaning of a provision does not give effect to that purpose, that meaning cannot be regarded as “the ordinary meaning” and cannot prevail. It must give way to the construction which will promote the underlying purpose or object of an Act… 
        
       
      
    13 Applying those principles, and in the light of the legislative history outlined above, his Honour concluded (at 27): 
     
      
       
        
        Clearly, Parliament saw “the ordinary meaning” of the predecessor of s61E(2) as covering cases falling outside the scope of indecent assault and, it must follow, cases falling outside the scope of the offence of carnal knowledge.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Despite the literal meaning of the words “act of indecency”, the context of s61E(2) and the history and purpose of the legislation show that in s61E(2) “the ordinary meaning” of the words “act of indecency” does not include conduct which constitutes an indecent assault for the purposes of s61E(1) or an act of carnal knowledge for the purposes of s71. 
        
       
      
    14 That, however, was not the whole of McHugh J’s reasoning. As I have said, the issue arose in Saraswati because prosecutions for indecent assault or carnal knowledge would have been statute barred by s78. His Honour referred (at 24) to the principle “that a statutory power, expressed in general form, is not to be construed so as to avoid any condition or limitation placed upon the exercise of a specific power…”. He found it “difficult to accept” that Parliament would have countenanced the use of the “general power” to institute prosecutions for committing an act of indecency to “circumvent the limitation” imposed by s78. Speaking of the predecessor of s61E(2), his Honour added (at 26): 
     
      
       
        
        No ground exists, however, for supposing that in enacting s76A Parliament had any purpose to interfere with the protection which s78 gives to a person who is alleged to have committed an indecent assault or had carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of sixteen years. 
        
       
      
    15 It was by a similar path of reasoning that Gaudron J arrived at the same conclusion as McHugh J. Her Honour referred (at 17) to the “basic rule of construction that, in the absence of express words, an earlier statutory provision is not repealed, altered or derogated from by a later provision unless an intention to that effect is necessarily to be implied”. After reference to authority, her Honour concluded (at 18): 
     
      
       
        
        If s 61E(2) of the Act has the meaning for which the respondent contends, it necessarily derogates from the protection earlier afforded by s78. So much may be seen from the present case for although, by force of s 78, the applicant could not be charged with carnal knowledge and indecent assault, his prosecution under s61E(2) required him, as a matter of practical reality, to answer those very charges. In my view s 61E(2) has neither the meaning nor the effect for which the respondent contends.  
        
       
      
    16 Clearly, the ratio of Saraswati is not determinative of the present case. Mr Rosser did not suggest that it was. He relied upon the case only as authority for the proposition that s61O(2) should not be read literally, divorced from its history and context. He noted that in 1974, when s76A was introduced into the Crimes Act, there was provision in the Summary Offences Act 1970 for the offences of indecent exposure of a person in or within view of a public place or a school (s11), and wilful and obscene exposure of a person in or within view of a public place or a school (s12). Both were summary offences, the former carrying a maximum penalty of a fine of $100 and the latter a maximum penalty of a fine of $400 or imprisonment for six months. S76A created an indictable offence, although in certain circumstances it could be dealt summarily: s476 of the Crimes Act. In either event, it carried a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment. 
     
      
    17 Mr Rosser argued that these offences, particularly wilful and obscene exposure, were part of the context in which s76A was enacted and that Parliament could not have “had in its contemplation the augmentation of those offences.” He relied upon the decision of Taylor J in Moloney v Mercer [1971] 2 NSWLR 207. It is unnecessary to set out the facts or the issues for determination in that case. It is sufficient to say that his Honour was called upon to consider the distinction between indecent exposure, on the one hand, and wilful and obscene exposure, on the other. This, in turn, required an examination of the difference in nuance between the words “indecent” and “obscene”. His Honour referred to R v Stanley [1965] 2 QB 327, in which it was held that those words convey one idea, that is, offending against recognised standards of propriety, with “indecent” being at the lower and “obscene” at the upper end of the scale. Giving the judgment to the Court, Lord Parker adopted a passage from the judgment of Lord Sands in the Scottish case of McGowan v Langmuir [1931] S.C. (J.) 10, at 13: 
     
      
       
        
        I do not think that the two words “indecent” and “obscene” are synonymous. The one may shade into the other, but there is a difference of meaning. It is easier to illustrate than define, and I illustrate thus: for a male bather to enter the water nude in the presence of ladies would be indecent, it would not necessarily be obscene. But if he directed the attention of a lady to a certain member of his body his conduct would certainly be obscene. 
        
       
      
    18 Taylor J accepted that analogy for the purpose of the New South Wales provisions. It follows, Mr Rosser submitted, that the offence of wilful and obscene exposure requires more than the display of an intimate part of the body; there must be “some degree of lewdness or conduct directed towards a victim.” He noted that s12 of the Summary Offences Act 1970 has been re-enacted as s5 of the Summary Offences Act 1988 (although s11 has no counterpart in the later Act). That section remains in force, and co-exists with the current provisions dealing with committing acts of indecency: s61N, in respect of offences committed against persons of the age of sixteen years and below or above that age, and s61O, in respect of offences committed against persons under the age of ten years or in various circumstances of aggravation. Wilful and obscene exposure remains a summary offence, carrying a fine of up to ten penalty units or imprisonment for up to six months.  
     
      
    19 Mr Rosser submitted that, consistently with the reasoning in Moloney v Mercer, that offence would embrace the present appellant’s conduct. He argued that Parliament could not have intended that conduct amounting to that offence should be the subject of prosecution for the significantly more serious offence of committing an act of indecency. This argument did not find favour with Judge Norrish, although it seems that his Honour was not referred to Taylor J’s judgment.  
     
      
    20 I find it unnecessary to decide the point, but it might be said that the manipulation of his penis described by the two young complainants takes the appellant’s actions outside the scope of wilful and obscene exposure. However that may be, I do not consider the fact that the legislature has provided for that offence relevant to the construction of the provisions dealing with the commission of acts of indecency. The fact that there may be some overlap between those provisions and the summary offence is not to the point. It is clear from the legislative history that the whole purpose of creating the offence of committing an act of indecency was to make good the deficiency exposed in the offence of indecent assault. The crucial question in the present case remains whether, as a matter of law, his Honour’s findings of fact are capable of establishing that offence.  
     
      
    21 In Fairclough v Whipp (supra) the respondent, while urinating into a canal, asked a young girl to touch his penis and she did so. In DPP v Rogers (supra) a father exposed himself to his daughter and had her masturbate him. In Saraswati (at 26) McHugh J said that he found it unnecessary “to determine whether s76A was intended to cover cases which are not indecent assault but go beyond the Fairclough-type situation.” There are reported cases dealing with other situations.  
     
      
    22 In R v Francis (1989) 88 Cr App R 127, it was accepted that the offence was established where a man masturbated in the presence of two thirteen year old boys in the changing room at a swimming pool, provided that he was aware that the boys could see him and derived sexual satisfaction from that fact. That decision was followed by this Court in R v Gillard (1999) 105 A Crim R 479, in which it was held that the offence could be made out on each of two occasions when a couple engaged in sexual acts in the presence of a young girl, encouraging the girl to watch and, on one occasion, inviting her to join in: see the judgment at [61]-[65]. 
     
      
    23 The common thread in all those cases, Mr Rosser observed, is that the offending conduct was committed in the immediate presence of the victim. He argued that it was within that context that the provisions relating to committing acts of indecency are intended to operate. He pointed out that the acts of the appellant could not be said to have been done in the immediate presence of the complainants because they were “in separate enclosures without the prospect of physical contact between them.” Hence, he argued, the appellant’s conduct could amount to no more than wilful and obscene exposure.  
     
      
    24 The various provisions dealing with the commission of acts of indecency, including s61O(2), refer to such acts “with or towards” a person. In R v Orsos (1997) 95 A Crim R 457 a majority of this Court (Hulme J dissenting) drew a distinction between those two words. Grove J, with whom Priestley JA agreed, said (at 460), “To commit an act of indecency ‘with’ a person involves two participants whereas logically and grammatically one person may commit an act of indecency ‘towards’ another”. His Honour went on to observe that it was not necessary, for the purpose of that case, “to define the limits of activity which might be comprehended” by those expressions.  
     
      
    25 A similar approach had been taken in the earlier decision of R v Page (CCA, unrep, 25 November 1991). More recently, the reasoning of the majority in Orsos was discussed and affirmed in R v Chonka [2000] NSWCCA 466. In a joint judgment, Fitzgerald JA and Ireland AJ said (at [46]): 
     
      
       
        
        Broadly speaking, an act of indecency “with” another requires two participants in the indecent act, while an act of indecency “towards” another is committed by a person who acts indecently towards a non-participant.  
        
       
       
      Shortly after that judgment was delivered, the High Court arrived at the same conclusion, albeit in respect of a different statutory provision, in  
      Crampton v The Queen  
      (2001) 206 CLR 161. 
       
      
    26 On this analysis, the facts in Francis and Gillard are examples of acts of indecency committed “towards”, rather than “with”, the complainants. In those cases the complainants were in the immediate presence of the victims, but the question remains whether that is an essential prerequisite of the offence of committing an act of indecency “towards” a person. That word has a number of shades of meaning, depending upon its context, but I find nothing in its ordinary usage, or in the relevant legislative history, which requires it to be given such a limited denotation for present purposes. 
     
      
    27 In Chonka the appellant had been found guilty of a number of counts of inciting acts of indecency by young girls and, in one case, an eighteen-year-old woman. The offences were said to have been committed in the course of telephone conversations between the appellant and each of the complainants. Four counts alleged telephone calls in which he incited the complainant to commit an auto-erotic act. Three of those counts charged the incitement of an act of indecency “with” the appellant, while the fourth charged the incitement of an act of indecency “towards” him. Consistently with the statement of principle from their judgment set out above, Fitzgerald JA and Ireland AJ entered verdicts of acquittal on the three counts alleging acts of indecency with the appellant. As to the other count, their Honours found it unnecessary to decide whether the act of the complainant incited by the appellant could constitute an indecent act towards him. However, for other reasons they set aside the verdict on that count (and several other counts to which I have not referred) and directed a new trial. 
     
      
    28 The third member of the Court, Smart AJ, took a different view of the case. For reasons which need not concern us, his Honour would have allowed the appeal against conviction in respect of one count only. Relevantly, however, he expressed himself (at [63]) to be in no doubt “that an act of indecency could be directed towards a person over the telephone or by other means not involving the act of indecency being carried out in the personal presence of the other person.” 
     
      
    29 As the Crown prosecutor before us pointed out, whether an act of indecency can be directed towards a person over the telephone need not be determined for present purposes. However, I respectfully agree with Smart AJ’s observation to the extent that it conveys that immediate presence is not required. In most cases the offence will have been committed in such proximity to the complainant as to amount to immediate presence. This is not such a case but, in my view, the appellant’s act of indecency could fairly be said to have been committed “towards” the complainant for the reasons identified by Judge Norrish: he exposed and manipulated his penis in circumstances where he was within view of the girls and intended that they should see what he was doing. 
     
      
    30 Let me return, then, to the two questions of law submitted for determination. To the first question, whether the offence requires that the relevant act of indecency be committed in the immediate physical presence of the victim, I would answer ‘No’`. That being so, the second question, whether his Honour erred in finding that the “towards” element was established, need not be answered. I would propose that the case be remitted to the District Court to be dealt with accordingly.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is a Crown appeal under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Armitage QC in the District Court of New South Wales on 9 December 2004. The respondent pleaded guilty to a charge of armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for the offence is twenty years. His Honour imposed a term of four years with a non-parole period of two years. The Crown asserts that this sentence is manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
    2 In the course of the robbery a significant amount of property was taken, primarily in the form of electronic equipment, jewellery, and a small amount of cash, including three televisions sets, two video players, four video game consoles, one digital video camera, two disc players, one compact disc Walkman, five gold rings, three gold chains and one gold bangle.  
     
      
    3 The circumstances of the offence were set out by his Honour Judge Armitage in a matter not challenged as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “At about 10.45pm on Monday 15 December 2003, the victim, then aged forty-three was in her unit at Dalmeny Avenue, Rosebury, when she heard a knock at the door. At the time her seven and nine-year-old sons were asleep in their bedroom. She opened the door and saw the offender standing directly in front of her with a young person standing behind her. The offender was disguised by a hooded sloppy joe and sunglasses and was armed with a baseball bat and a large silver bladed break knife, the blade about 12 inches long. The young person was disguised by a balaclava and was armed with a knife. As the victim screamed and attempted to close the door the offender pushed the door open and pushed the victim in the chest causing her to fall backwards on to the floor. As the victim stood up the offender pushed her to the floor a second time, and it was about the time, apparently, that the victim noticed a small cut at the top of her left shoulder. The offender continually swore at and threatened the victim with the knife. She said to her “You dog, slut, cunt, I want to have a piece of you.” The victim heard the offender say to the young person, ‘Go and clean the place out’, upon which he proceeded to take a number of items of property from the living area and the main bedroom and placed it into bags. Whilst he was doing that the offender continued to threaten the victim with the knife and to make threats against the victim’s two children. 
        
       
       
        
        At some stage the young person, who was holding a knife, approached the victim and stood near her, whilst the offender collected property from within the unit. The young person then assisted the offender to disconnect the television set and the video. After that the offender approached the victim and demanded that she remove her jewellery, which she did. The young person left the unit with a bag containing the victim’s property, and returned to remove a second bag of property. At that stage the offender made the victim assist her in carrying the television set from the unit to Dalmeny Avenue. The victim showed the offender where her car was parked. The victim’s car was a 1988 model Toyota Corolla, registered number QVT-672. The offender and the young person loaded the car with the victim’s property. The offender got into the driver’s seat and the young person got into the front passenger seat. The offender started the car with the victim’s keys, which she had taken from the unit. The offender drove the car about 200 metres north along Dalmeny Avenue where she collided with the rear of a Toyota Corolla which was being driven north along Dalmeny Avenue.” 
        
       
      
    4 The young person was subsequently identified as the respondent’s son, aged fourteen. She and he were subsequently arrested. The taking of the victim’s motor car was a separate offence and it was taken into account on a Form 1 in the sentence for the armed robbery offence.  
     
      
        
      
    5 His Honour made reference to the respondent’s prior criminal history, which encompassed offences committed over a period of a decade, from 1992 to 2002, including offences for offensive language, malicious damage and assaulting police, all of which led to the imposition of fines.  
     
      
    6 However, on 18 July 2002 she was sentenced in the District Court with respect to three armed robbery offences. Each of these offences were committed whilst the respondent was armed with a knife, on two occasions she obtained cash and on the third occasion she was charged with the offence of assault with intent to rob whilst armed with an offensive weapon. The three offences had been committed, respectively, on 11 September, 30 September 2001 and 24 January 2002. On the second and third occasions she was at liberty on bail for the prior offence or offences. For two of the offences she was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years with a non-parole period of two years which concluded on 1 December 2003. In the third matter she was sentenced to a fixed term of two years commencing on the same date. Accordingly, the offence the subject of the present appeal on 15 December 2003 was committed during the parole period for the prior offences. Indeed, she had only been at liberty for two weeks. 
     
      
    7 The respondent gave evidence which was summarised by his Honour in his Remarks on Sentence. It is unnecessary to set out his Honour’s summary in full. Of some significance was the respondent’s evidence that she had come to believe that during her period in prison her de facto husband had had a sexual liaison with the victim. She also said that her son had told her that the victim had on one occasion inappropriately touched his penis. His Honour did not determine whether or not any such incident occurred but he did say that he accepted the respondent’s evidence that she believed that her son had been sexually interfered with.  
     
      
    8 The respondent also gave evidence that her original intention when going to the premises was not to commit a robbery but, in fact, to terrorise the victim and give her a belting. She said that she had become enraged when her son told her about the acts that he said had been committed upon him and that reminded her of acts of sexual abuse committed on her. Nevertheless, it did take three days between her being informed of these matters and the offence. 
     
      
    9 The respondent’s evidence was that it was not her original intention to rob the victim but that she could not bring herself to assault her and, accordingly, decided to steal from her to make her feel small. In cross-examination she said that the main purpose for which she and her son were disguised at the time of the confrontation was in order to scare the victim but she did agree in cross-examination that a secondary purpose was to conceal her identify. His Honour, nevertheless, accepted her account that she went to the premises without an intention to steal but decided to do so when she found herself unable to inflict further physical injury upon the victim. 
     
      
    10 In this regard his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offence committed by Ms Vincent is obviously of a very serious nature. Her attendance at the premises of the victim was for the purpose of terrorising her, and that is exactly what she did. Even if there is some truth in Ms Vincent’s allegations of impropriety on the part of the victim, it would not assist in any substantial degree to reduce the extent of her criminality.”  
        
       
      
    11 His Honour had before him the report of a clinical psychologist outlining the respondent’s personal history which contains elements which are, unfortunately, all to frequently encountered with Australians of indigenous origin, including alcohol and drug use commencing at an early age and also sexual abuse at an early age. The psychologist also reported a history of mental illness, including a possible diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The report noted that her drug use, particularly cannabis, appeared to have had some impact on her mental state in the form of an element of paranoia and excessive agitation. There was further negative impact from the development of a heroin and cocaine addiction.  
     
      
    12 His Honour referred to a victim impact statement by the victim which outlined the considerable emotional disturbance she had suffered by reason of the offence which included sleep loss, irrational conduct, considerable difficulty with performance of routine tasks and chores and an attempt to escape by the use of alcohol. Her conduct eventually led to her ex husband reporting her to DOCS and the children were removed from her care. His Honour said that he would give “full weight” to the “severe emotional harm” that the victim suffered as a result of the offence. 
     
      
    13 His Honour referred to provisions of s3A and s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and noted that it was a requirement that adequate punishment be imposed and weight given to general and specific deterrence. His Honour identified the list of aggravating factors set out in s21A that were pertinent to the current proceedings as encompassing the following: 
     
      
    · The defendant had a record of previous convictions.  
     
      
        
      
    · The offence was committed in company. 
     
      
    · Substantial emotional harm was caused by the offence. 
     
      
    · The offence was committed while the offender was on conditional liberty. 
     
      
    · The offence was, to some extent, planned. 
     
      
       
      His Honour then identified the mitigating factors to be:  
       
      
    · The offender has reasonably good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    · She has shown remorse for the offence. 
     
      
    14 She pleaded guilty to the offence and did so at the first reasonable opportunity for which his Honour said, “I give her full credit.”  
     
      
        
      
    15 His Honour made a finding of special circumstances by reason of the need for a considerable period of supervision arising from the offender’s history of alcoholism and drug use. 
     
      
    16 The Crown asserts that the sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate. It notes in particular that his Honour failed to make any reference to the guideline judgment of this Court with respect to this offence set out in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. The Crown notes that the typical case referred to in Henry was of a less severe character than the actual offence committed by the respondent. In particular, this was not a young offender with little or no criminal history and the degree of violence actually used could not be described as “limited”. Furthermore, there was a degree of planning, albeit, on the facts accepted by his Honour, planning of an assault rather than of a robbery. Nevertheless, there was an element of impulse involved. However, what the impulse here did was to quite possibly avert the more serious offence of the actual infliction of grievous bodily harm, by reason that the offender came prepared with a baseball bat and a knife. 
     
      
    17 In the present case there are additional elements of aggravation particularly the fact that the crime was committed in company and that it involved an intrusion into the victim’s home when she was alone with her two sons. Furthermore, this was an offence committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty for other such offences.  
     
      
    18 His Honour found on the issue of special circumstances that the respondent had good prospects of rehabilitation. It is not clear to me on what evidence his Honour based this conclusion, it may have been on the basis of observing the Respondent in the witness box. However, the clinical psychologist’s report concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “... one feels somewhat pessimistic about her ability to benefit from counselling-type interventions, at least in her current state of mind.” 
        
       
      
    19 The fact that the offence was committed within a few weeks of being released on parole with respect to three similar offences, in each of which she used a knife, and the second and third of which had also occurred whilst on conditional liberty for the earlier offence or offences, are circumstances which indicate that personal deterrence was entitled to considerable weight in the sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    20 In my opinion, it is quite clear that the end result was a sentence which was manifestly inadequate, primarily because it did not serve the function of personal deterrence but also because it failed to adequately take into account the objective gravity of the offence, especially in terms of the degree of violence proffered and in fact inflicted by the offender herself who was in company with another, together with the fact that the offence occurred in the victim’s own home at a time when she was alone with her two young sons. 
     
      
    21 The personal history of the respondent indicates a subjective case of some strength by reason of the adversity of many aspects of her life over a lengthy period of time.  
     
      
    22 Even taking these matters into account, a sentence of four years with a non-parole period of two years is, in my opinion, manifestly inadequate. Inadequacy is also manifest in the fact that the non-parole period for the offence presently under consideration would expire prior to the head sentence imposed for the earlier robberies. As noted above, this offence occurred within two weeks of Ms Vincent being released on parole for those earlier robberies.  
     
      
    23 Although it may be that her prospects of release on parole are lessened by reason of the subsequent offending, there remains the possibility that, having lost the benefit of parole for the previous offences by reason of the offence presently under consideration, the structure of the sentence leaves open the possibility that the respondent will not have any additional actual punishment by reason of the offence. That is not a possibility that should have been allowed in the sentence.  
     
      
    24 The appeal should be allowed and the sentence quashed. Taking into account the matter on the Form 1, I would impose a non-parole period of three years and an additional term of three years, giving a head sentence of six years. But for the plea of guilty, I would have approached the matter on the basis of imposing a head sentence of eight years.  
     
      
    25 Accordingly, the orders I propose are:  
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed and sentence quashed. 
       
       
      2. The respondent is sentenced to a non-parole period of three years commencing on 15 December 2003 and expiring on 14 December 2006 and a balance of term of three years commencing on 15 December 2006. 
       
      
    26 STUDDERT J: I agree. 
     
      
    27 GREG JAMES J:  I also agree. 
     
      
    28 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the Court are as I have indicated.

      THURSDAY 7 APRIL2005 
      
      REGINA v TONIA PIPER 
     JUDGMENT1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I invite Greg James J to deliver the first judgment.2 GREG JAMES J: Relying upon s 5F (2), the Director of Public Prosecutions seeks to appeal against what is asserted to be an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings in the District Court of New South Wales during a trial by judge alone of the respondent on an indictment containing one count that she drove dangerously, causing the death of Ms Fallow and on another count that she, by driving dangerously caused grievous bodily harm to Carl Wong.3 The learned trial judge embarked upon a voir dire, notwithstanding that he was sitting as a judge alone, on the admissibility of evidence sought to be tendered by the defence, which evidence in particular, so it was said, was tendered to support a defence of mental illness, the defence referred to in s 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, 1990. His Honour considered the Crown's objection that the evidence was irrelevant to a charge of the kind faced by the respondent since that offence, so it was asserted, was an offence of ""strict liability"", that is to say, it was an offence in which there was no active fault element to be proved by the Crown as existing in the mind of respondent at the time of the commission of the acts or omissions causing the death and the injury asserted i.e. a specific intent. 4 His Honour in an extensive judgment examined the question of whether the defence of mental illness might apply to such offences. He expressed his views of the task he was undertaking at page 2 of that judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        ""At this stage I am simply determining the admissibility of certain psychiatric evidence following the giving of that evidence on the voir dire. This issue of admissibility arises because the Crown contends that the evidence is not relevant to any issue in the trial and is therefore inadmissible."" 
        
       
      
    5 Reference was made throughout the judgment to the Crown's contention that the defence is not available in respect of such offences. At page 3 in his Honour's judgment appears the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “In these circumstances the Crown says that what I will refer to, for short, as the psychiatric evidence is irrelevant ... The Crown contends that the psychiatric evidence is only relevant to the question of the accused’s lack of a guilty intent and that because the Crown does not have to prove any guilty intent, simply an intent to drive the vehicle, the evidence is not relevant to any issue in the trial."" 
        
       
      
    6 During the judgment there was reference made to prior decided cases on the issue of insane automatism. One could be forgiven for thinking, following the judgment of this Court in R v S [1979] 2 NSWLR 1, that insane automatism is a species of the mental illness defence to which s 38 refers. Not withstanding, reference was made in the trial judge’s decision to a dearth of authority on the point but I note there would appear, after research, to be further authorities than those referred to in the decision and further authorities than those cited to us, in particular the decision of the English Court of Appeal in R v Andrew Michael Hennessy (1989) 89 CAR 10.  
     
      
    7 However, as the matter has come before us objection has been taken to the competence of the purported Crown appeal. In that regard, our attention has been drawn to a line of cases in this Court, concluding with the decision in R v Adamson (31 January 2005) NSWCCA 7, which was an application for leave to appeal pursuant to the provisions of s 5F(3).8 Section 5F(3) relates to applications for leave to appeal by other parties to criminal proceedings. In that case the applicant had raised the ambit of the legal doctrines relating to intoxication and particularly had raised a question on what is sometimes referred to as the defence of intoxication and its relationship to specific intent in the light of s 428C of the Crimes Act 1900. 9 The trial judge had ruled that the applicant could not rely on the defence of intoxication in relation to the charges before him. He had rejected tendered evidence. The court held that he had made no order and that his reasons for decision did not constitute a judgment, notwithstanding that it was argued, as it is argued here, that his determination of the application of the legal doctrine involved a final legal ruling on a discrete legal controversy. It was even suggested in that case that the judge, although sitting in the criminal jurisdiction, had given a declaration but the Court of Criminal Appeal held, that had not occurred.  
     
      
    10 That decision sat squarely within a long line of authority, which included R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 and R v Neil Joseph Lethlean (1995) 83 A Crim R 197, in which latter decision are set out a number of the cases concerning rulings on the admissibility of evidence being held not to found a right of appeal under s 5F(2) or (3). Particularly those cases include: Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136; Rogerson (1990) 45 A Crim R 253 and Steffan (supra). In Lethlean (supra), the court's attention was drawn to an early seminal case in the High Court of Australia R v Snow (1915) 20 CLR 315, concerning what was said to be an error at trial and its ability to be corrected by the High Court. On an application for special leave regard was had to the terms ""judgment or order"" in legislation and in the Constitution. The Court of Criminal Appeal held, consonant with that decision that a ruling on admissibility does not answer the statutory requirements for appeal under section 5F (3). 
     
      
    11 In R v Bozatsis and Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296 the Crown brought an appeal pursuant to s 5F (2) against what were said to be interlocutory judgments or orders, and the court examined, in some detail, the ambit of the term ""judgment or order"". Allowing for a rare case where a ruling on evidence, which might form the basis of a stay of proceedings, or would have the effect of determining the fate of the prosecution case, as being possibly the subject of a s 5F appeal, the court held that a mere ruling lacks the quality of finally determining the rights of the parties such as to partake of being a judgment or order. It held that it is only where the Crown is effectively refused the opportunity to make a case against a respondent that such a decision is properly to be categorised as a judgment or order coming within the scope of s 5F(2). That decision and the line of authority that was examined in Lethlean (supra) to me makes clear that what occurred here, even though the trial judge was examining the ambit of a legal doctrine possibly applicable, was concerned with the rejection or admission of evidence in the defence case, so that his decision did not fall within any such exception to how rulings on evidence are to be regarded so that the right of appeal for which the Crown contends under s 5F(2) exists.12 The Criminal Appeal Act 1912, does provide in s 5A for points of law to be stated by the judge in the event of either an acquittal or a conviction and for those points to be determined by this Court in a particular way and in particular circumstances. The co-existence of that provision with s 5F speaks against s 5F(2) or (3) being interpreted as they apply to interlocutory judgments or orders in a way that would be wider in ambit than this Court has hitherto held.13 In my view this Court should remain within the flood of authority on the point and in particular should be concerned to avoid the discontinuity in criminal trials which will occur if there are to be applications to this Court on questions of admissibility or on general questions of a what legal doctrine a judge should or should not apply, in mid-trial. 14 Section 5F(3)(a) makes provision for there to be, in appropriate circumstances, an application to the Court. That is not, however, the provision upon which reliance is placed here In my view the appeal should be dismissed as incompetent.15 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree16 STUDDERT J: I also agree17 SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the court is as indicated by Greg James J.

     Judgment 
     1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed upon the applicant by Sides DCJ at the Campbelltown District Court. The applicant pleaded guilty to three counts in an indictment but it was noted that he had earlier made appropriate pleas of guilty before a magistrate and it was for procedural reasons only that an indictment was presented. His Honour applied a “discount” of 25 percent for early pleas. 
     
      
    2 The offence in count 1 charged supply a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis for which the prescribed maximum penalty is 20 years' imprisonment. Count 2 charged selling firearms on an ongoing basis contrary to section 51B of the Firearms Act which also carries a maximum prescribed penalty of 20 years' imprisonment. Count 3 charged supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug for which the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for life. Also taken into account pursuant to the Form 1 procedure were six further offences.  
     
      
    3 The applicant was sentenced on count 1 to imprisonment for six years and six months with a non-parole period of three years and six months. On count 2, to imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of three years and six months, and on count 3, to imprisonment for seven years and six months with a non-parole period of four years and six months. The Form 1 matters were taken into account in the sentence imposed in relation to count 1. The dates specified for commencement and conclusion of the various sentences and non-parole periods had effect that the applicant would be in custody from 28 May 2002 and become eligible for parole from 27 May 2009, thus, there was an effective sentence of 11 years and six months with a non-parole period of seven years.  
     
      
    4 The offences all occurred as a result of activity by undercover police officers authorised pursuant to the appropriate statute. The commencement of the applicant's criminality can be dated from 6 March 2002 when an undercover officer referred to as ""Brad"" went to premises at Bradbury and spoke to one Joseph Kormos. He asked for drugs to be supplied, and in response, Mr Kormos apparently made a call as a result of which the applicant appeared and sold some 15 tablets to Brad in return for $600.  
     
      
    5 It might be noted that the activity involved a purported sale of drug commonly known as ecstasy, but substantially the drug actually supplied (where it was an actual drug) was methylamphetamine. The first supply which I have mentioned involved a total weight of tablets of some 5.3 grams. Later, on 14 March, Brad again went to Kormos's house and the applicant arrived shortly thereafter. An introduction was arranged later at a car park to a second undercover officer referred to as ""Tony"". The applicant provided Tony ultimately with an amount of drug. 
     
      
    6 The third action which the Crown asserted constituted the ongoing supply, took place on 19 March. On this occasion Tony bought some blue-coloured tablet for $1,800. Subsequent analysis showed that the substance was not a drug then on the schedule of prohibited drugs. 
     
      
    7 The fourth occasion was 26 March. On this occasion Tony purchased from the applicant some 50 tablets. The fifth occasion (all of these relating to the first count), was on 4 April when Tony bought more tablets from the applicant for a sum of $2, 500.  
     
      
    8 In summary over this period, a total weight of some 84.7 grams of drugs or purported drugs were supplied for a purchase price of $7,600. 
     
      
    9 The police investigation material included the product of listening devices, and his Honour found that it was clear on the evidence that the applicant believed that Tony was selling the drugs obtained from him to customers. His Honour found that the applicant was a wholesaler selling to another wholesaler lower down the drug trafficking hierarchy. There is no reason to think that his Honour's finding in this regard is vulnerable to any challenge, nor has it been suggested that this is so. It might be mentioned that his Honour accepted that the applicant must have been obtaining his supply from someone else and that he was earning money in effect by selling at a higher price than he was buying, however he also accepted that most of the money earned was used to fund a drug addiction of the applicant's own. 
     
      
    10 Three of the matters taken into account on the Form 1 involved similar transactions to those which I have described. More importantly, however, the first of those transactions occurred on 16 April when Tony asked the applicant whether or not a “shooter” could be obtained. This was a reference to a weapon. The applicant immediately responded that he was able to supply such a weapon. In short, on 19 April, 2 May, 8 May and 13 May, the applicant, on each occasion in response to inquiries for supply of weaponry, made available to Tony for large amounts of money, self-loading pistols. The first two were accompanied by supplies of ammunition. The applicant also stipulated that he could acquire more ammunition as required. All pistols were of the same calibre. The fourth delivery included a silencer. The weapons all had the serial numbers obliterated, and were obviously of the character of weapons used in criminal enterprises.  
     
      
    11 The third count related to a further request by Tony for a large quantity of ""tablets"". On 28 May arrangements were made for the applicant to meet him at what was described as the ""usual meeting place"" which was near a shopping centre. On this occasion the applicant arrived with a plastic bag which he transferred to Tony for an agreed purchase price of $45,000. There were 3,000 tablets in the plastic bag. The drug weighed 1,020 grams and contained 2.5 percent pure methylamphetamine. At this point, the applicant was arrested. 
     
      
    12 In addition to the facts which I have but briefly related, it can be noted that the final three matters on the Form 1 concern the result of search of premises on that day occupied by a Miss Broderick. There were found some cash, (reasonably suspected of being unlawfully obtained), nearly 240 grams of cannabis, and about 37 grams of methylamphetamine. In due course the applicant told police that Miss Broderick was in fact minding these items for him and that they were his property. 
     
      
    13 As a result of all that conduct, his Honour imposed the sentences which I have mentioned. In a helpful and succinct submission on behalf of the applicant, Mr Ramage QC raised a number of issues, the principal of which was that the total sentence imposed was unduly harsh and severe. This was particularly so having regard to the substantial accumulation of the sentence on the second count to those imposed upon the first and third counts.  
     
      
    14 A specific submission was made asserting that the sentencing judge was in error in taking into account matters as aggravating circumstances. In particular, his Honour had, in his remarks, observed that the applicant had provided the pistols without regard for public safety. This is a specified aggravating factor pursuant to section 21A 2(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I perceive no error in his Honour's approach to this circumstance. 
     
      
    15 As the Crown Prosecutor has pointed out, the concept of an offence being committed without regard for public safety is distinguishable from the concept of specifically placing the public at risk. It seems to me it is beyond argument that the supply of a lethal weapon fits the category of aggravation as mentioned in the statute. In addition, attention was drawn to remarks pertinent to this submission in R v Way 2004 60 NSWLR 168 in which it was said:  
     
      
       
        
        “We also consider that it was appropriate for his Honour to have regarded the offence as one committed without regard for public safety (another s21A(2) factor). The applicant was not to know that the buyer was an undercover operative and that the drugs would be seized and destroyed. What was relevant in this context was his motivation or understanding, so far as that went to an assessment of his moral culpability. He undertook the transaction expecting a considerable personal profit, and in the understanding that the drugs would be resold, heedless of the consequences to those who purchased and consumed them, or of the fact that users commonly resort to property offences to feed a habit, leaving other victims in their wake. The observations of Smart AJ in  
        R v Chan 
         [1999] NSWCCA 103 as to the limited relevance of the fact that drugs which are supplied to undercover agents will not reach the community, apply. As his Honour pointed out, that circumstance was not due to any act of the offender”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    16 Thus from that citation, it can be seen that his Honour was correct in taking into account the lack of regard for public safety in relation to all the counts with which he was dealing, the supply of drugs as well as the supply of what I have described as lethal weapons. 
     
      
    17 A submission that his Honour erred in taking into account an irrelevant matter, in that the third supply which I have described, turned out not to be the drug represented was not pressed in the light of the provisions of section 40(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985:  
     
      
       
        
        “40 (1) A substance (not being a prohibited drug) which, for the purpose of its being supplied, is represented (whether verbally, in writing or by conduct) as being a prohibited drug or a specified prohibited drug shall, for the purposes of this Act and the regulations, be deemed to be a prohibited drug or the specified prohibited drug, as the case requires.” 
        
       
      
    18 A further submission was made that the sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the role of the police in promoting the offences. This submission, in my view, cannot be sustained. There is no evidence that the police promoted the offences except in the sense that they made inquiries first through the man Kormos as to whether drugs could be supplied. It was the applicant who turned out to be the supplier and he willingly continued to supply whenever requests were made. This is not a case where the police officers were urging the applicant to do anything that he was unwilling to do. Indeed, the evidence shows they did no more than make inquiries as a result of which the applicant all too readily met their requests. It is perhaps indicative of the applicant's ready response to even oblique requests that there is a telephone call between the undercover operative Tony and the applicant when the question of weaponry was first raised which is simply in these terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “Tony: and he’d asked me for a shooter. 
         
        Applicant: A gun? 
         
        Tony: Yeah. 
         
        Applicant: Yeah, I’ve got one. Two and, two and a half.” 
        
       
       
      The lastmentioned being a quotation of price which was in the end fulfilled. $2,500 was paid in exchange for the first weapon. 
       
      
    19 The next specific submission was that there was lack of parity between the applicant and the co-offender Kormos. His Honour was aware that Kormos, the man whom the undercover operative had first approached, had previously been dealt with by Coorey DCJ. Kormos had pleaded guilty to four offences. He, of course, was not involved in all the offences of the applicant and in particular had nothing to do with any of the offences involving firearms. The learned sentencing judge said in his remarks on sentence that he would take into account the principle of parity (with Kormos). This must be read in the context of the minimal relationship between the offences with which Kormos was dealt and the offences for which the applicant stood for sentence. The effective sentence which Kormos received was a head sentence of four years with a non-parole period of two years. For my part, I am unable to see that the applicant can claim a justifiable sense of grievance by reason of the way he was treated when compared with Kormos. The offences of Kormos, as I have said, are not entirely parallel or even associated with all of those relating to the applicant. 
     
      
    20 The final two submissions were that the sentencing judge failed sufficiently to take into account subjective circumstances, and as I have earlier indicated, that the total sentence imposed was unduly harsh and severe. His Honour acknowledged that the applicant was a person without prior conviction. He was in fact near the end of a recognizance to be of good behaviour imposed for an offence of assault. No conviction had been recorded and the offence was conditionally dismissed pursuant to s 10 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. His Honour observed that it was a matter of aggravation that the applicant was subjected to that recognizance at the time of these offences. In so observing, I do not perceive that his Honour fell into any error. 
     
      
    21 The applicant's background was examined by his Honour. He took into account the difficulty of his family's circumstances. He observed that the applicant had himself been the victim of an apparently serious violent offence committed against him by his wife when she stabbed him in the stomach on one occasion. That relationship was however terminated, and the parties had been divorced by the time he appeared for sentence. 
     
      
    22 The total effective sentence imposed upon the applicant is undoubtedly a lengthy one. It merits examination, having regard to the applicant's background and the absence of prior conviction. He is some 34 years of age. He was 33 at the time he appeared for sentence. He was qualified as a mechanic and had a business of his own. I have mentioned that he had become addicted to drugs. He is the father of a small boy. This boy is residing with relatives whilst the applicant is incarcerated. Nevertheless it cannot be overlooked that the applicant needed to be sentenced for three very serious crimes. It almost suffices, in my view, to recite the facts and the prescribed background of maximum penalties to see that what his Honour has imposed lies within the range of sound exercise of discretion. 
     
      
    23 At first glance it may appear that accumulating the sentence for the firearms matters upon the drugs matters resulted in an overly severe impost. However, when one observes that the non-parole period specified in respect of the third count (which carried a prescribed maximum of life imprisonment) is ameliorated in the sense that the sentence for the pistol offences was directed to commence one year before the expiry of the non-parole period specified in respect of that serious drug offence, that perspective is removed.  
     
      
    24 The ultimate question for this Court is whether or not the sentence imposed is outside the range of his Honour's sound exercise of discretion. I have come to the conclusion that it is not. 
     
      
    25 I propose that application of leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but the appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    26 HUNT AJA: I agree with the orders proposed by Grove J for the reasons he has given. 
     
      
    27 HALL J: I agree with the orders as stated by Grove J and the reasons.

     REGINA v. STORM BRYCE HUGHES 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HUNT, AJA: Justice Hall will give the first judgment.2 HALL, J: The applicant, by way of application for leave to appeal dated 9 December 2004, seeks the leave of this Court to appeal a sentence of four years and six months with a non-parole period of three years imposed in the District Court of New South Wales by His Honour Judge McGuire on 4 June 2004. 
     
      
    3 The applicant entered pleas of guilty in respect of two offences described as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        Firstly, that on 7 February 2003 at Pyrmont he did break and enter the dwelling house of one Frederick Collachi, situated at 20 Union Street and committed the serious indictable offence of larceny in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he was armed with an offensive weapon. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, assault on a constable of police in the execution of his duty.  
        
       
      
    4 The first offence attracted a maximum penalty of 20 years and the second offence a maximum penalty of five years. 
     
      
    5 The applicant supported the application by contending that the sentences were manifestly excessive in the light of his mental disorder and his plea of guilty. 
     
      
    6 The applicant was born on 1 September 1975 and his criminal history reveals that his first conviction was for an offence of common assault in 1997. His record contains entries for violence, the contravention of an Apprehended Violence Orders and the offence of entering a building with intent to commit an indictable offence for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for 20 months. 
     
      
    7 On Friday 7 February 2003 he had consumed an amount of alcohol and on that date at 5.45 pm, after banging on the door of a dwelling house and shouting, “I’m going to kill you, you’re dead” he commenced to kick the side passage door and in due course he gained entry to the premises. By this time the victim had run to the back section of the premises and climbed onto a roof in fear for his safety. He contacted the police. 
     
      
    8 Whilst inside the premises the applicant stole property consisting of 56 compact discs in a carry case that had a value of approximately $880. He damaged various household items whilst in the premises including a computer system. 
     
      
    9 A uniformed constable attended the backyard of the premises and saw the applicant hiding in the rear of the backyard. He appeared to have something in his hands, namely a metallic object. The constable called upon him to get his hands up but the applicant refused. The applicant grabbed hold of the constable by the throat until he was eventually restrained by other police who arrived on site. 
     
      
    10 There were two medical reports placed before the sentencing judge; firstly, a report of Dr. Westmore which revealed the applicant had consumed alcohol and cocaine. He told Dr. Westmore that he had been out every night since his release from Goulburn Gaol some weeks before. He had consulted a psychiatrist and a psychologist whilst in prison and he apparently had a lengthy history of drug taking from the age of 14 years. 
     
      
    11 The medical evidence before the court also included a report of Dr. Allnutt and this report dealt with the applicant’s medical conditions. Dr. Allnutt is a visiting senior forensic psychiatrist. Dr. Westmore noted a history of suggested auditory hallucinations in the past and a history of some paranoid feeling when using amphetamines. He presented as of dull to dull-average intelligence and Dr. Westmore observed that “he may suffer from drug induced psychosis” and qualified for the diagnosis of “poly substance and episodic alcoholic abuse”. 
     
      
    12 The applicant had exhibited bizarre behaviour on Gladesville Bridge not long before, which resulted in police taking him to a psychiatric hospital. However, he decamped before he could be assessed. 
     
      
    13 Dr. Allnutt considered that he was labouring under delusional beliefs of persecution and that at the time had felt justified in his actions based on the delusions. He considered that he had been compromised in his capacity to rationalise his circumstances and considered that he had an underlying predisposition and an internal vulnerability, as he termed it, to develop mental illness independent of substances. 
     
      
    14 Dr. Allnutt considered that should the applicant be released into the community he should be admitted on the basis that he be admitted directly to a psychiatric hospital under a Schedule 2. The sentencing judge observed that having regard to Dr. Allnutt’s opinions it appeared to him, the sentencing judge, that the prisoner, the applicant now, may well have been able to successfully raise a mental health defence. However, at pages eight and nine of the remarks on sentence it is reported that counsel then appearing for the applicant stated that she had no instructions to raise such a defence. 
     
      
    15 The sentencing judge considered that he could not regard the applicant’s conduct as other than attracting what he referred to as the appropriate standard non-parole period of five years, referring to Section 54B(1), (2) and (3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    16 He considered he was obliged to consider whether the standard non-parole period of five years should be varied, having regard to the provisions of s.21A of the Act,  
     
      
    17 Whilst observing that the applicant’s threats of violence or the implied threat to use a weapon and his previous criminal history were matters of aggravation, the sentencing judge also had regard to the mitigating factors including those referred to in s.21A(3)(j) of the Act. 
     
      
    18 The sentencing judge proceeded upon the basis that the applicant was suffering a major intellectual disability when he committed the break and enter accompanied by larceny and that his conduct towards the police officer was “totally bizarre” and was demonstrative of a person acting in a senseless and irrational manner. 
     
      
    19 In sentencing the applicant the sentencing judge assessed the discount for the pleas of guilty at 25%. He stated that it was difficult to determine the question of his prospects for rehabilitation and was simply unable to conclude what his rehabilitation prospects were for the future. That is an observation Ms. Burgess of counsel has placed considerable emphasis upon in her submissions before this Court for it goes, so the submission went, to the question of prognostication or future possibility as to whether or not the applicant would in fact present as a danger to the community if released on a shorter non-parole period. 
     
      
    20 Whilst personal and general deterrence were major considerations in fixing a sentence for such offences, the sentencing judge did not believe, or at least he did not proceeded upon the basis that it was significant in the circumstances of this offence, at least so far as the risk presented by the applicant was one arising from his medical condition. 
     
      
    21 In determining whether or not the sentence of four and a half years imprisonment and a non-parole period of three years commencing 7 February 2003 for the first offence and a concurrent term of eighteen months was excessive, the approach taken by Mr. Justice Sperling in Regina v. Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 is instructive for His Honour there considered the significance of mental illness in the sentencing context. 
     
      
    22 I should also add that offences set out in the Form 1 were offences of resisting an officer in the execution of his duty contrary to s.58 which called for a maximum penalty of five years and the further offence of maliciously damaging property of another contrary to s.195(a) of the Act. That offence also carries a maximum penalty of five years. 
     
      
    23 I return to consider Hemsley’s case and how it assists. In exercising his sentencing discretion, the sentencing judge appropriately had regard to both the applicant’s prior criminal history and the nature and circumstances of each offence. In the latter respect, the sentencing judge had regard to the objective seriousness of the break and enter offence involving threats of violence or the implied threat to use a weapon and the assault on the police officer. 
     
      
    24 The extent to which a disabling mental condition operates as a mitigating factor is, of course, a matter of significance in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. However, this is not a case in which the judge omitted to make a finding in respect of the mental condition as, for example, had occurred in Hemsley (supra). I have earlier recorded findings made in respect of the applicant’s mental condition at the time of the offences and the significance of that medical condition. The important point is, however, that within the sentencing context these matters were the subject of specific attention by the sentencing judge. The real question seems to me whether or not the approach taken to evaluating it as a mitigating factor, particularly having regard to future risk, resulted in an appropriate exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    25 In this respect it is important to note that, having allowed a discount of 25% as earlier indicated, the sentencing judge considered the question of the prospects of rehabilitation, although no conclusion could be reached in respect of it. However, the sentencing judge addressed the question of deterrence and, in my view, appropriately stated that he did not believe that the element of deterrence was “a significant matter to be taken into account” and in so saying his Honour was referring to the fact that, insofar as general deterrence was concerned, on the facts of the case , such deterrence was not to be evaluated as a countervailing risk factor in the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    26 In Hemsley (supra), Sperling, J. addressed the question of the relevance of mental illness in the sentencing context. He stated and I quote:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Mental illness may be relevant - and was relevant in the present case - in three ways. First, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced; there may not then be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced:  
        Henry 
         at 254;  
        Jiminez 
         (1999) NSWCCA 7 at 23;  
        Tsiaras 
         (1999) 1 VR 398 AT 400;  
        Lauritsen 
         (2000) 114 A. Crim. R. 333 at 51;  
        Israil 
         [2002] NSWCCA 255 at 23;  
        Pearson 
         [2004] NSWCCA 129 at 43. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration:  
        Pearce 
         (NSWCCA, 1 November 1996, unreported) … 
        
       
       
        
        Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person:  
        Tsiaras 
         at 400;  
        Jiminez 
         at 25;  
        Israil 
         at 26. 
        
       
       
        
        A fourth, and countervailing, consideration may arise, namely, the level of danger which the offender presents to the community. That may sound in special deterrence;  
        Israil 
         at 24.” 
        
       
      
    27 I note in passing that his Honour quashed the sentence in that matter and re-sentenced to imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of two years. 
     
      
    28 Unlike in Hemsley (supra), the sentencing judge did not, as pointed out by counsel for the applicant expressly make a finding in respect of community risk as a countervailing factor. The sentencing judge did, at least implicitly, have regard to the issue of moral culpability. 
     
      
    29 There was no specific consideration as to whether a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily on the applicant as a mentally ill person being one of the factors referred to by Sperling, J. in Hemsley (supra) and I will return to that aspect shortly.  
     
      
    30 As to the question of the level of danger to the community posed by the applicant, there was little said on the question, although, I believe, there is an indication in the comments that the judge had that matter well in mind. At page 11 of the remarks on sentence he stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I am simply unable to conclude, on the material before me, as to whether there are such prospects (that is, prospects for rehabilitation). I will, however, find special circumstances as I consider it in the interests of the community and the prisoner that he be subjected to an extended period of supervision.” 
        
       
      
    31 The trial judge ultimately made a recommendation that the applicant continue to be afforded psychiatric treatment whilst in custody and that his release be considered only after a review and a determination by the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 
     
      
    32 Having addressed the applicant’s mental condition and its significance as a mitigating factor along with issues of deterrence and rehabilitation, the question for this Court is whether the sentence was excessive, having regard, firstly, to the effect a custodial sentence may have on the applicant as a mentally ill person and, secondly, the absence of an express finding that the applicant was a continuing danger to the community and whether there was sufficient evidence for such a finding. 
     
      
    33 As to the first of these two matters no argument has been presented in printed or oral submissions to indicate the effect or relevance of the sentence to this applicant in the Hemsley (supra) sense. 
     
      
    34 In these circumstances, the real question is whether or not the length of the sentence imposed can be justified upon the basis of an established and continuing danger to the community by reason of the applicant’s mental condition. In Regina v. Lauritsen (2000) 114 A. Crim. R. 333, Malcolm, CJ. said at page 48:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Hence mental illness is not only relevant to assessing culpability, in which case it must be shown to have contributed to the offence, but is also relevant to assessing the level of danger the offender presents and the appropriate way in which the offender is to be rehabilitated.” 
        
       
      
    35 It is conceded in the Crown submissions that there was no express finding that the applicant was a continuing danger to the community. It, however, is pointed out that his Honour was unable to find that he would not re-offend in the future, that Dr. Allnutt had referred to his past failure in drug and alcohol counselling and the fact that he had walked out of a psychiatric hospital after having been taken there following the incident on Gladesville Bridge. 
     
      
    36 Furthermore, the report of Dr. Allnutt does provide evidence of potential danger to the community. Dr. Allnutt considers the applicant had an underlying predisposition and internal vulnerability to develop a mental illness independent of substances taken. He stated that should the Court consider releasing him into the community he should be admitted directly to a psychiatric hospital under a Schedule 2.  
     
      
    37 Dr. Allnutt went on to recommend psychiatric treatment whilst in custody. This evidence, along with the applicant’s past history is sufficient, I believe, to establish that the applicant, at least as last assessed by Dr. Allnutt, presented as a continuing danger to the community and there is no evidence to indicate that there is no future prospect of a threat to the community in that respect. 
     
      
    38 The question remains then whether in the light of all of the evidence (including previous history of violence offences) the sentences were manifestly excessive in light of the applicant’s mental disorder and plea of guilty. I am unable to so conclude. 
     
      
    39 I would accordingly dismiss the application.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions against the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge JX Gibson QC, following the Respondent’s plea of guilty to one count of escaping lawful custody, an offence for which a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years is prescribed (Crimes Act 1900 s 310D(a)). 
     
      
    2 The sentence which was imposed on 22 October 2004 was one of imprisonment for 18 months commencing on 15 June 2004, and expiring on 14 December 2005, with a non-parole period of 12 months, also commencing on 15 June 2004. The Crown appeal is based upon the practical effect of that sentence when considered in the light of the Respondent's existing custodial position, arising by reason of his prior criminality.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 On 13 February 1998, the Respondent was sentenced in the Sydney District Court to imprisonment for a minimum term of 3 years to date from 17 April 1997, with an additional term of 2 years and 6 months for an offence of armed robbery with wounding. The minimum term (non-parole) period was set to expire on 16 April 2000. The additional term was due to expire on 16 October 2002. An appeal against the sentence was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal (R v Pham [1999] NSWCCA 225).  
     
      
    4 The Respondent was released to parole on 16 April 2000, but fell into breach about 2 months later after indicating to his parole officer that he was going into hiding in order to avoid deportation. This resulted in the formal revocation of his parole on 11 July 2000 with effect from 20 June 2000. He was at large until 26 February 2003, at which time he was arrested on charges of goods in custody and shoplifting. On 26 February 2003 he was sentenced, in respect of those charges, to a fixed term of imprisonment for one month, to commence from that day, and to expire on 25 March 2003.  
     
      
    5 On 7 May 2003, 43 days after the expiry of the fixed term of one month, while serving the balance of parole for the armed robbery offence, the Respondent escaped from custody when attending the Auburn District Hospital for treatment. He then remained at liberty for approximately 9 months until he was apprehended in Victoria and charged with one offence of theft and one offence of go equipped to steal or cheat.  
     
      
    6 For these offences he was sentenced in Victoria on 15 March 2004 to an aggregate term of 4 months imprisonment, of which one month of time in custody was reckoned as a period of imprisonment already served. 
     
      
    7 He was extradited to NSW on 15 June 2004, that is, at the expiration of the Victorian sentences.  
     
      
    8 Pursuant to s 254 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 the unexpired parole period referable to the sentence for the 1997 armed robbery with wounding offence was extended by the Parole Board until 27 July 2005, to take into account the period of 405 days during which he had been at large in Victoria, or held in custody in that state. 
     
      
    9 The effect of the sentence imposed by his Honour for the escape, being one involving imprisonment for less than 3 years, is that, by reason of s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the Respondent is due to be released for that offence on 14 June 2005, that is, 13 days before expiry of the balance of parole for the earlier armed robbery offence. Thereafter he would be subject to supervision on parole for approximately 5 ½ months between 14 June 2005 and 14 December 2005, and to the possibility of having that parole revoked if he re-offends or fails to comply with any relevant condition of parole.  
     
      
       
      1. Deportation 
       
      
    10 The Crown first relies upon a submission that the exchanges between the bench and counsel, during the submissions on sentence, show that despite an observation by the Crown that the issue of deportation could not be taken into account when determining the length of the sentence, his Honour inappropriately factored, into the sentencing decision, his expectation that the Respondent would be deported as soon as the custodial portion of any sentence, which he imposed, was served.  
     
      
    11 This is not expressly stated in the exceedingly succinct reasons for sentence, and normally this Court will not find an error of principle from interchanges between the bench and counsel that indicate an apparent incorrect appreciation of the law, since those views do not necessarily reflect a considered decision: R v Kain [2004] NSWCCA 143 at [56] and R v A [2004] NSWCCA 292 at [12]. 
     
      
    12 The possibility that his Honour did take the factor of deportation into account, when fixing the sentence, is perhaps suggested by the concluding observation of his Honour concerning the non-parole period that was passed in so far as he noted, “that the Respondent was going to be deported”, but is not otherwise evident.  
     
      
    13 It is established principle that the fact of deportation is irrelevant as a sentencing consideration, it being a matter exclusively for the Executive Government: R v Jap NSWCCA 20 July 1998 and R v Latumetan and Murwanto [2003] NSWCCA 70. Moreover the High Court has held that a foreign national should receive the benefit of being eligible for release on parole: Shrestha v The Queen (1991) 173 CLR 48 at 71 per Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ.  
     
      
    14 The fact that the Respondent would be or might be deported to Vietnam, was accordingly an immaterial factor in structuring a sentence in this case and error would be demonstrated if it could be established that it became a factor in determining any aspect of the sentence including the selection of an appropriate commencement date. I am not however persuaded, particularly in circumstances where a period for potential release on parole was fixed, that his Honour erred in this respect. 
     
      
       
      2. Manifest Inadequacy 
       
      
    15 The Crown conceded that a sentence of 18 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 12 months, for the Respondent's escape was properly within range, and no complaint was made in that respect. Its submission as to the inadequacy of the sentence depends exclusively upon the practical effect of the backdating of the sentence to 15 June 2004, a date which his Honour selected upon the basis that the Respondent should have the benefit of the time which he had spent in custody in New South Wales, following his extradition.  
     
      
    16 The offence of escape has been regarded by the courts as a serious offence, which potentially jeopardises the future of minimum security facilities and threatens the continued provision to prisoners of beneficial and humanitarian custodial arrangements and opportunities. It may lead to additional restrictions being placed upon their access to external medical treatment, and it may also impede the progress of rehabilitation for offenders with favourable prospects, if conditions of detention are strengthened, in order to prevent escapes.  
     
      
    17 These considerations were noted, for example, in R v Thomson NSWCCA 21 May 1986 where, in a case decided before enactment of the Sentencing Act 1989, Street CJ observed that the ordinary sentence for an unremarkable escape “could be expected to approximate two years” (at a time when the maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for 7 years); and also in R v Mathieson [2002] NSWCCA 97 at [27]. 
     
      
    18 Where the offender has remained at large for a very lengthy period or has used the opportunity of being at large to commit further offences, as was the case here, then the overall objective seriousness of his criminality is potentially increased: R v Plummer [2000] NSWCCA 363 at [34] and R v Josef Regina [2000] NSWCCA 100. The elements of both personal and general deterrence are also important, it being essential that prisoners understand that any offence of escape or attempted escape will result in a meaningful overall increase in their detention: R v Butler [2000] NSWCCA 525 at [18] and R v Smith [2004] NSWCCA 69. That this is so is also demonstrated by the fact that the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence has been increased from imprisonment for 7 years to imprisonment for 10 years. 
     
      
    19 It is also for that reason that the legislature enacted, by way of s 57(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, a requirement for sentences for escape to be served consecutively upon any existing sentence that has yet to expire, or upon any other sentence that is imposed in the same proceedings.  
     
      
    20 The present case is complicated by the fact that s 57(3) of the Act provides that the reference to a sentence of imprisonment in ss (2) upon which the escape sentence is to be served consecutively, is taken to be a reference to:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) the non-parole period of the sentence, in the case of a sentence for which a non-parole period has been set, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the term of the sentence, in the case of a sentence for which a non-parole period has not been set. 
          
         
        
       
      
    21 It is further complicated by the fact that s 47 of the Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        47 Commencement of sentence 
        
       
       
        
        (1) A sentence of imprisonment commences:  
         
         
          
          (a) subject … to any direction under subsection (2), on the day on which the sentence is imposed, … 
          
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A court may direct that a sentence of imprisonment:  
         
         
          
          (a) is taken to have commenced on a day occurring before the day on which the sentence is imposed, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) commences on a day occurring after the day on which the sentence is imposed, but only if the sentence is to be served consecutively (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively) with some other sentence of imprisonment. 
          
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The day specified in a direction under subsection (2) (b) must not be later than the day following the earliest day on which it appears (on the basis of the information currently available to the court) that the offender:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) will become entitled to be released from custody, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) will become eligible to be released on parole, 
         
          
           
            
            having regard to any other sentence of imprisonment to which the offender is subject. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (5) A direction under subsection (2) (b) may not be made in relation to a sentence of imprisonment imposed on an offender who is serving some other sentence of imprisonment by way of full-time detention if:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a non-parole period has been set for that other sentence, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the non-parole period for that other sentence has expired, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the offender is still in custody under that other sentence 
          
         
        
       
      
    22 There are two distinct purposes apparent from these provisions: the first is to ensure that the offence of escape attracts an actual and meaningful accumulation of sentence; the second is to avoid the existence of a possible hiatus in custody which would arise if the offender was later released to parole for the existing sentence, before the date fixed for commencement of the fresh sentence.  
     
      
    23 The question which arises is whether these provisions required, or alternatively permitted, his Honour to commence the sentence from:  
     
      
       
      (a) the date on which the Respondent was first released to parole for the armed robbery with wounding offence, that is, 16 April 2000; 
       
       
      (b) the expiry of the balance of his parole for the armed robbery offence, recalculated to take into account the 405 days during which he was either at large, or in custody in Victoria, before his return to New South Wales, that is, 27 July 2005. 
       
       
      (c) the date of his return to custody in NSW, that is 15 June 2004; 
       
       
      (d) the date on which sentence was pronounced, that is, 22 October 2004, or  
       
       
      (e) some other date. 
       
      
    24 Had the sentence for the escape been directed to be served consecutively to the non-parole period for the armed robbery, then the full term of that sentence would have commenced on 16 April 2000 and expired on 15 October 2001, yet for almost the whole of that period, the Respondent would have been at large. To have allowed for that circumstance, by artificially enlarging the term of the sentence beyond that which, it is conceded, was properly within range for an offence of escape, would have infringed basic sentencing principles.  
     
      
    25 On the other hand, if his Honour had fixed the commencement date of the sentence for escape as the date of the expiry of the recalculated balance of parole for the armed robbery, namely 27 July 2005, that would have infringed against s 47, and possibly resulted in a hiatus between the custodial components of the original and new sentences.  
     
      
    26 That arises from the circumstance that, as a Prisoner serving the balance of parole for the armed robbery, it was always open for the Respondent to apply to the Parole Board for a review under s 174(1)(a) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act. The Parole Board, upon such a review, could have rescinded its original revocation order, at any time from 16 June onwards, and readmitted the Respondent to parole.  
     
      
    27 Although the revocation order had not been rescinded by the time that sentence was passed, if that was to occur at any later time prior to 27 July 2005, then there would potentially have been a hiatus of the kind which is not permitted by s 47.  
     
      
    28 It is evident that s 57 of the Act did not contemplate a case such as the present, being one in which the offender having been earlier released to parole, escaped at a time when, by reason of a breach of his parole, he was back in custody serving the balance of parole. 
     
      
    29 The present case, not being one where the escape occurred during the currency of a non-parole period, or during a term in respect of which there was no relevant non-parole period, I am of the view that s 57 of the Act did not apply, or dictate the selection of the commencement date. Rather, it seems to me that the discretion as to the selection of a commencement date was properly to be decided by reference to s 47, which permitted the sentence to be fixed to commence at the date on which it was passed, or backdated, but which did not allow its commencement to be postponed. Counsel for the Respondent and the Crown appear to have conceded as much, since neither submitted that the commencement date was required by force of law, to be either 16 April 2000, or 27 July 2005. 
     
      
    30 The question which then arises is whether in exercising his discretion to commence the sentence from 15 June 2004, his Honour erred. In substance this gives rise to the question whether the effect of the backdating to 15 June 2004 resulted in a sentence that was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    31 That is a question which needs to be determined in the light of the principles, including the discretion reserved for Crown appeals, which were discussed in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499, Lowndes v The Queen (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671-2, Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321, and in Regina v Wall  [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70].  
     
      
    32 The Crown has submitted that there was appellable error in this respect, and that the sentence that was warranted in law was one that would have commenced upon the date that the sentence was passed, namely 22 October 2004, although it later accepted that it would also have been open to his Honour to have selected 8 October 2004, in lieu of the first mentioned date.  
     
      
    33 This submission needs to be considered in the light of the Respondent's submissions that: 
     
      
       
      (a) any interference with the sentencing order would offend against the principle referred to in  
      R v Tait 
       (1979) 46 FLR 386, having regard to the position which the Crown took during the sentencing proceedings; 
       
       
      (b) any variation of the commencement date would work an unfairness to the Respondent, who had pleaded guilty from the outset, and who was not responsible for the delay between his plea and the final determination of the sentencing proceedings on 22 October 2004, and that; 
       
       
      (c) in the absence of any statutory constraint upon his Honour (beyond that contained in s 47), the Crown faced a special difficulty in demonstrating appellable error in what amounted to a discretionary exercise of judgment.  
       
      
    34 The final proposition may be accepted, but it does not provide any answer to the present appeal, if the result of the sentencing order was one that did not properly reflect the sentencing considerations that are applicable to offences of escape, or was one that resulted in a sentence that was appellably inadequate.  
     
      
    35 These submissions call for an examination of the course of the proceedings on sentence. It appears that the Respondent was committed for sentence under s 102 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 on 12 August 2004, followed by a first listing for mention in the District Court on 20 August 2004. The matter was called up for sentence on 30 September 2004, but stood over to 8 October because of the Respondent's need for an interpreter.  
     
      
    36 On 8 October there was some debate as to the effect of the legislative provisions which I have earlier mentioned in relation to the commencement date, but the proceedings could not be concluded that afternoon, and were then stood over to 22 October. On that day the Crown conceded that it would be incorrect in law for the sentence to commence on 27 July 2005, and observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “In terms of whether your Honour backdates any sentence to take into account time spent in custody, that’s an issue for your Honour”,  
        
       
       
      although also making it clear that, 
       
       
        
        “it’s still open to your Honour, in our view, to commence the sentence from today.” 
        
       
      
    37 While it was submitted that this amounted to a concession that it was open to his Honour, in the circumstances of the case to backdate the sentence, that involves, in my view, something of an overstatement. All that the Crown was doing was outlining to his Honour what it was that he had a power and a discretion to do. These observations and the position now taken by the Crown do not fall within the kind of case which was considered in R v Tait. 
     
      
    38 Secondly, I am unpersuaded that any unfairness would arise by reason of the period which passed between the date of committal and the date of listing for sentence in the District Court. This was not a matter which was urged upon his Honour, nor was it taken into account by him in exercising his sentencing discretion. In my view this was not a case involving any unreasonable delay, having regard to the work load of the court, let alone where any responsibility for that delay could be sheeted home to the Crown.  
     
      
    39 While it might have been possible for the sentencing proceedings to have been resolved earlier, with the consequence that the commencement date for the sentence would have been brought forward, the fact is that this did not occur. Nor was the parole revocation order rescinded in the meantime.  
     
      
    40 Where his Honour fell into error, it seems to me, was in not crafting a sentencing order that took into account the fact that the parole revocation order had not been rescinded at the time that sentence was passed, and that adequately punished the Respondent for his serious offence of escape.  
     
      
    41 While it was submitted that the seriousness of that offence was mitigated by the escape having been a spur of the moment decision, which was motivated by the respondent’s concerns as to the health of his wife, I am unable to agree with that proposition. To the contrary the escape was one which involved a violation of the trust that was implicit in allowing the Respondent the opportunity of an external hospital attendance. The Respondent remained at large for a lengthy period, without any attempt to turn himself in, and he re-offended while at large.  
     
      
    42 In these circumstances I have reached the conclusion that the back dating of the sentence to 15 June 2004 resulted in a sentence that was manifestly inadequate. That was, in my view, an error in circumstances where the Respondent should have been required to serve a significant additional period of time in custody by reason of his earlier serious breach of parole, and his subsequent escape.  
     
      
    43 In my assessment, the sentence which was warranted in law and which should have been passed was the same as that passed by his Honour, subject however to a variation of the commencement date from 15 June 2004 to 8 October 2004. While it would have been entirely appropriate for the commencement date to have been 22 October, the Crown concession as to its commencement on 8 October, having regard to the court’s inability to complete the proceedings that day, would justify the selection of the last mentioned date. That would result in the Respondent being taken to have been serving an additional period in custody of approximately 5 and a half months as a result of his breach of parole, and receiving a sentence involving a non-parole period of 12 months for the offence of escape with a balance of parole of 6 months.  
     
      
    44 I would accordingly propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Crown appeal allowed; 
       
       
      2. Quash the sentence below, and in lieu sentence the Respondent to imprisonment for 18 months, with a non-parole period of 12 months, each to date from 8 October 2004. 
       
       
      3. Direct the Respondent’s release on parole on 7 October 2005. 
       
      
    45 Finally, I observe that some of the potential problems with the application of s 57 were noted in R v Dickson (2002) 132 A Crim R 137, although without any resolution of assistance for the present case. The failure of the section to deal with a case such as the present requires legislative reconsideration, in order to address the difficulties identified in this case, as well as in the earlier decision mentioned.

    1 HIS HONOUR: On 26 November 2004, after a trial presided over by me, the jury found Sophear Em (whom I will refer to as “the prisoner”) guilty on all three counts in the indictment which had been presented on 3 November 2004 at the commencement of the trial, namely that on 7 January 2002 he had murdered Joseph Logozzo (the first count), that on the same date being armed with a dangerous weapon he had assaulted Joseph Logozzo with intent to rob him (the second count) and that on the same date he had fired a firearm with disregard for the safety of Marianne Logozzo, Mr Joseph Logozzo’s wife (the third count). It will be convenient to refer to these three offences as “the Logozzo offences”. 
     
      
    2 Under s 19A of the Crimes Act the maximum penalty for the crime of murder is imprisonment for the life of the offender. The second count in the indictment charged an offence under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for twenty-five years. The third count in the indictment charged an offence under s 93G(1)(c) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for ten years. 
     
      
    3 The trial which commenced on 3 November 2004 had been set down as a trial, not only of the three counts in the indictment to which I have referred, but of five other charges as well. However, on 3 November 2004, in the absence of the jury panel which had been summoned for the trial and before any jury was empanelled, the prisoner pleaded guilty to those five other charges, which were charges that on 17 January 2002 being armed with a dangerous weapon he had robbed five individuals, Mr Michael Kress, his wife Mrs Beverly Kress, his daughter Alyson Kress, his son Jonathon Kress and Ramzi Tamer who was a friend of his daughter. It will be convenient to refer to these offences as “the Kress offences”. Robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon is an offence under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for twenty-five years. 
     
      
    4 The sentencing proceedings which have been conducted before me have been proceedings for the sentencing of the prisoner for both the Logozzo offences and the Kress offences. 
     
      
    5 As the sentencing judge I am required to determine the facts relevant to the sentencing of the prisoner for all of the offences. In performing that function I am to apply the principles stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374, which have been referred to with approval by the High Court in Olbrich v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 280 (24) and Cheung v The Queen (2001) 209 CLR 1 at 12-14 (13-17). These principles include that any facts found by me for the purpose of sentencing the prisoner for an offence of which he was found guilty must be consistent with the verdict of the jury and that in sentencing the prisoner for any of the offences I cannot make a finding of fact adverse to the prisoner unless I have arrived at that finding beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    6 I will firstly make findings of fact about the Logozzo offences. There was no dispute at the trial or in the proceedings on sentence about many of the facts of those offences. However, there were some disputed issues of fact which later in these remarks I will attempt to resolve. There was no dispute about the facts I am about to state. 
     
      
    7 Joseph Logozzo, his wife Marianne Logozzo and some of their adult children lived in a two storey house at 69 Feodore Drive, Cecil Hills. Shortly after midnight in the early morning of 7 January 2002 Mr and Mrs Logozzo returned to their home, after having been at a club. Mrs Logozzo parked the vehicle in which they had been travelling on the driveway near the front door of the house. Mr and Mrs Logozzo then walked towards the front door of the house. 
     
      
    8 As Mrs Logozzo was looking for the front door key among a big bunch of keys she had, she heard voices. She turned around and saw two men with guns in their hands. One of the men was armed with a rifle and the other man was armed with a pistol. The bodies of both of the men were completely covered by dark clothing and their faces were covered by balaclavas. Each man was wearing large goggles. 
     
      
    9 One of the two men said words to the effect, “do as we say and no one will get hurt”. He asked if there was anyone inside the house and Mrs Logozzo, seeking to protect her children who were inside the house, replied that there was only her husband and herself. Mr and Mrs Logozzo were told to go inside the house. Mrs Logozzo opened the front door and she and her husband entered the house. They were followed by the two men. All of Mr and Mrs Logozzo and the two intruders entered the lounge room of the house.  
     
      
    10 The man with the rifle walked towards a stairway leading to the second storey of the house. Mrs Logozzo then disclosed that two of her sons were asleep upstairs. She implored the men to tell her husband and herself what they wanted and that she and her husband would give the two men what they wanted. She added “just leave them (her children) alone”. 
     
      
    11 The man with the rifle walked some distance up the stairs and then came running back down the stairs. He expressed a fear that the persons upstairs were probably already telephoning the police. He then ran back up the stairs. 
     
      
    12 The man with the rifle entered a bedroom in which Mr and Mrs Logozzo’s son Robert Logozzo, then aged twenty-two, was asleep. The man with the rifle woke Robert Logozzo, telling him to get out of the bed and to get out of the bedroom. While speaking to Robert Logozzo he pointed the rifle at Robert Logozzo. 
     
      
    13 Robert Logozzo got out of bed and walked down the stairs to the lounge room. He was told by the other intruder to lie down on the floor and he lay down on the floor of the lounge room, face down. 
     
      
    14 The man with the rifle entered a bedroom in which Mr Logozzo’s son Julian Logozzo, then aged twenty-four, and his fiancée Natalie Curmi, now Natalie Logozzo, were asleep. The man with the rifle woke Julian Logozzo and Natalie Curmi. He told them to get out of the bed and to go downstairs. He pointed the rifle at Julian Logozzo and Natalie Curmi.  
     
      
    15 Julian Logozzo and Natalie Curmi went downstairs, followed by the man with the rifle and, as directed, lay face down on the floor of the lounge room behind Robert Logozzo. 
     
      
    16 The man with the rifle then said to Joseph Logozzo, “you, come with me and show me what you have got”. Joseph Logozzo and the man with the rifle started walking up the stairs. The act of pointing the rifle at Joseph Logozzo with intent to rob him constituted the offence charged in the second count in the indictment. 
     
      
    17 On the stairs a physical struggle occurred between the man with the rifle and Mr Logozzo. Both the man with the rifle and Mr Logozzo fell down the stairs, wrestling with each other. In falling Mr Logozzo struck a coffee table in the lounge room near the stairs.  
     
      
    18 The man armed with the pistol discharged the pistol. The projectile entered Mr Logozzo’s chest and passed through the wall of the chest and part of Mr Logozzo’s lung. 
     
      
    19 Mrs Logozzo ran towards her husband. The man with the pistol discharged the pistol a second time. The projectile struck Mrs Logozzo entering and then exiting the metacarpophalangeal joint of her right thumb. It was this firing of the pistol which constituted the offence charged in the third count in the indictment. 
     
      
    20 After the two shots had been fired both intruders ran out of the house. No property had been actually stolen. 
     
      
    21 Mr Logozzo was taken to Liverpool Hospital but was pronounced dead at 2.59 am on 7 January 2002. 
     
      
    22 It will be observed that so far, in making findings of fact about the Logozzo offences, I have referred to the intruders as “the man with the rifle” and “the man with the pistol”, without attempting to make a finding as to which of the intruders the prisoner was (by returning verdicts of guilty of the Logozzo offences the jury must necessarily have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner was one of the two intruders). I will have to attempt to resolve this issue, but it is convenient to postpone this attempt until after I have made findings of fact about the Kress offences. 
     
      
    23 The facts of the Kress offences can be found very simply. During the trial the prisoner made extensive admissions pursuant to s 184 of the Evidence Act (exhibit 28), including admissions about the events of 17 January 2002, that is the events constituting the Kress offences. The prisoner made these admissions, after I had ruled that evidence about the Kress offences would be admissible in the trial of the Logozzo offences pursuant to Pt 3.6 of the Evidence Act. I make findings of fact about the Kress offences in accordance with these admissions. 
     
      
    24 The prisoner made the following admissions about the events of 17 January 2002. 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Late in the evening of 17 January 2002, Michael Kress and his wife Beverly Kress, with their daughter Alyson aged 17 years, their son Jonathon aged 16 years and Alyson’s boyfriend Ramzi Tamer were at their home at 134 Greenway Drive, West Hoxton. 
        
       
       
        
        2. At or about 11.30pm, Michael Kress opened his garage and stood at the open door smoking a cigarette. As he stood there, a white model Ford Laser stopped on the street directly opposite his driveway. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The Ford Laser sedan, registered number UKK-412, was previously stolen some time after 9.00pm on 16 January 2002 from Chertsey Avenue, Bankstown. 
        
       
       
        
        4. A man, carrying a pistol, ran up the driveway from the vehicle and said: 
        
       
       
        
        ‘Get in quick, don’t shout, if you shout, I’ll shoot you’. 
         
         
        5. Two further men ran up behind the first. 
        
       
       
        
        6. Michael Kress described one of these men as holding an army style rifle and the other as holding a knife. 
        
       
       
        
        7. He describes all as dressed in dark clothing, balaclavas, and two were wearing ski goggles. 
        
       
       
        
        8. The three men forced Michael Kress into the garage and into his home by way of an internal doorway. As they did so, the man with the pistol placed the weapon against Michael Kress’s right temple and said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Don’t look back. Don’t look at me. Don’t look at anybody’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        9. Beverly Kress was standing at the internal door. 
        
       
       
        
        10. The man with the pistol said to her: 
        
       
       
        
         ‘Go inside, be quiet and nobody will get hurt’. 
        
       
       
        
        11. Beverly Kress walked into the bar area of the house. 
        
       
       
        
        12. Once inside the house, in the bar area, the man with the pistol told Michael Kress to lie down on the tiled floor face first and to put his hands behind his back. Michael Kress did as he was told. Beverly Kress remained standing, and saw the other two men, one of whom was armed with a knife and the other with a rifle. 
        
       
       
        
        13. The man with the knife had black plastic ties in his hand and a light silver grey coloured sports bag with a centre zipper and two handles. The bag was square or rectangular and made of shiny material. 
        
       
       
        
        14. The man with the handgun asked Beverly Kress if there was anyone else in the house. She replied, ‘my children and my daughter’s boyfriend’. The man with the handgun told her to go up and get them. 
        
       
       
        
        15. Beverly Kress walked up the stairs followed by the man with the pistol and the man with the knife. The man with the rifle remained behind, guarding Michael Kress. 
        
       
       
        
        16. Beverly Kress went to her daughter Alyson’s bedroom and told her and her boyfriend Ramzi Tamer to come downstairs and do as they were told. Alyson Kress and Ramzi Tamer went to the downstairs bar area where they were made to lie face down on the floor. 
        
       
       
        
        17. Beverly Kress then went into the bathroom where her son Jonathon was having a shower and told him to come downstairs. The man with the pistol stood behind Beverly Kress with the gun pointed at her as she did this. 
        
       
       
        
        18. Beverly Kress returned downstairs. 
        
       
       
        
        19. Jonathon Kress dressed and was then forced downstairs to the same area. He was made to lie on the floor. 
        
       
       
        
        20. The man with the handgun asked, ‘where’s the money? If you do what we say, no one will get hurt’. Beverly Kress took money out of her bag and handed it to him He looked at the remaining items in the bag and discarded them. Beverly Kress was made to lie face down on the floor. 
        
       
       
        
        21. Everyone was told to remove their jewellery, and thereafter their hands were bound behind their backs using black plastic cable ties. 
        
       
       
        
        22. As this was happening, one of the men was searching the upstairs area of the house. 
        
       
       
        
        23. The men stole from this family mobile telephones, jewellery, a watch, wallets and their contents and bottles of spirits. 
        
       
       
        
        24. One of the men produced a roll of silver ducting tape. He cut numerous pieces off with a knife and stuck them to the stairs. Each of the occupants then had a piece of tape placed over their mouth. 
        
       
       
        
        25. The man with the handgun then told the victims to keep their heads on the ground for another ten minutes and not to call the police, otherwise they would come back and kill them. All three men then left the premises. 
        
       
       
        
        26. A short time later some of the victims were able to free themselves and raise the alarm. 
        
       
       
        
        27. On 18 January 2002 the 1984 white GL Ford Laser UKK-412 was recovered from where it had been abandoned on Old Cowpasture Road, West Hoxton”. 
        
       
      
    25 In giving evidence at the trial the prisoner gave some evidence about what he said were the circumstances in which he had participated in the Kress offences. He said that he had participated in the Kress offences, after travelling to the vicinity of the Kress home in a car with some friends, not knowing where he was going or what was going to happen, that he had got into the car in his underwear, that the clothing he had worn during the robberies had been provided to him in the car by his friends and that in the carrying out of the robberies he had merely done what he had been told to do by his friends. The prisoner was effectively cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor on this evidence and I do not accept any of the evidence. 
     
      
    26 I will now return to the issues of fact about the Logozzo offences which I have not so far attempted to resolve. 
     
      
    27 At the trial the act which the Crown alleged had caused the death of Mr Logozzo was identified as being the act of firing the pistol so as to cause the fatal wound to Mr Logozzo.  
     
      
    28 At the trial the jury were directed that they could find the prisoner guilty of the murder of Mr Logozzo on any one of a number of bases, namely that it was the prisoner who had fired the pistol and that he had done so with the intent required for murder or that the prisoner was guilty of constructive murder (formerly known as felony murder), either on the basis that it was he who had fired the pistol (although not necessarily with the intent required for intentional murder) or that one or other of the prisoner and the other offender had fired the pistol, and that in either case the other conditions for finding the prisoner guilty of constructive murder were satisfied. 
     
      
    29 Similarly, the jury were directed that they could find the prisoner guilty on the other counts in the indictment in accordance with principles of joint criminal enterprise and common purpose, without necessarily having to be satisfied that it was the prisoner, and not the other offender, who had pointed the rifle at Mr Logozzo or who had fired the shot which struck Mrs Logozzo. 
     
      
    30 Accordingly, the jury’s verdicts of guilty necessarily determine that the prisoner was one of the two offenders who entered the Logozzo’s house on 7 January 2002 but do not determine whether the prisoner was the man armed with the rifle or was the man armed with the pistol who fired the two shots. 
     
      
    31 In the proceedings on sentence it was submitted by the Crown, and disputed by counsel for the prisoner, that I should find to the requisite standard, that is beyond reasonable doubt, that it was the prisoner who was the man with the pistol and that, accordingly, it was the prisoner who had fired the two shots, one killing Mr Logozzo and the other injuring Mrs Logozzo. At the trial there was no evidence by any witness identifying the prisoner as being either of the two offenders. It is not surprising that none of the occupants of the house on 7 January 2002 could give any such identification evidence. As I stated earlier in these remarks, the bodies of the two offenders were completely covered by dark clothing, their faces were covered by balaclavas and their eyes were covered by large goggles. 
     
      
    32 In the proceedings on sentence the Crown sought to establish that the prisoner was the man with the pistol by an argument consisting of a number of steps. These steps were that I should find:- 
     
      
       
      (i) that the offender other than the prisoner was a young man named Mao Van. 
       
       
      (ii) that Mao Van was substantially taller than the prisoner. 
       
       
      (iii) that the man armed with the pistol on the night of 7 January 2002 was the shorter of the two intruders and was, therefore, the prisoner. 
       
      
    33 The second step in the Crown’s argument can readily be accepted. On 20 May 2002 the prisoner, after being arrested, was photographed by a police officer against a scale from which his height could be determined and his height was determined as being approximately 170 centimetres. On 29 July 2002 Mao Van was photographed by a police officer against the scale and Mao Van’s height was determined as being between 178 and 180 centimetres. 
     
      
    34 The first step in the Crown’s argument presents greater difficulties.  
     
      
    35 I accept that there was evidence at the trial that the prisoner and Mao Van were close associates and there could be no dispute that Mao Van, as well as the prisoner, was one of the offenders in the Kress offences. Exhibit 28 at the trial includes admissions that on 16 February 2002, when police executed a search warrant at 26 Parker Street Canley Vale, Mao Van and the prisoner were each occupying a bedroom at the premises (exhibit 28 par 61), that in the bedroom occupied by Mao Van police found the watch which had been stolen from Alyson Kress on 17 January 2002, that in the same bedroom police located a pair of black cargo pants (exhibit 28 par 62) and that in a spare room at the premises police located the fishing licence which had been stolen from Mr Kress on 17 January 2002 in a suitcase labelled with Mao Van’s name and the address of his mother (exhibit 28 par 64). It was further admitted that the mobile phones which had been stolen from Alyson Kress and Ramzi Tamer on 17 January 2002 had been traced to Mao Van. 
     
      
    36 In support of this first step in its argument the Crown relied on the admission made in par 67 of exhibit 28 that Mao Van was the owner as of 8 February 2002 of an SKS rifle, on evidence that an SKS rifle is similar in appearance to an AK 47 rifle and on evidence that one of the occupants of the Logozzo home had selected an AK 47 rifle as being similar in appearance to the rifle he had seen one of the offenders carrying on 7 January 2002. 
     
      
    37 However, there are difficulties in the way of finding beyond reasonable doubt that the other offender in the Logozzo offences was Mao Van. While Mao Van was an offender in the Kress offences, there was a third offender in the Kress offences, who might have been the other offender in the Logozzo offences. Mao Van has been in custody since 2002; yet, he has apparently not been charged with any of the Logozzo offences. When he was questioned by police on 15 May 2002, the prisoner denied that Mao Van had been involved in the commission of the Logozzo offences. 
     
      
    38 I have concluded that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the other offender in the Logozzo offences was Mao Van. 
     
      
    39 As regards the third step in the Crown’s argument, the Crown relied on evidence given by Mrs Logozzo in her evidence in chief that the man with the pistol was much shorter and was stockier than the man with the rifle and that the man with the rifle was about six inches taller and was slimmer than the man with the pistol. 
     
      
    40 Mrs Logozzo said in her evidence in chief that when she first saw the two men outside the house, they were standing on the grass, level with each other, and she was then able to observe that the man with the handgun was shorter and stockier. She said that the two men were then no more than about a metre away from her. 
     
      
    41 I do not doubt that in her evidence at the trial Mrs Logozzo was conscientiously endeavouring to give a truthful and accurate account. However, there are some difficulties with this part of her evidence. 
     
      
    42 It was elicited in cross-examination of Mrs Logozzo that shortly after 7 January 2002 she had told a police officer investigating the offences that when she first saw the offenders they were standing, not on the grass, but on the paving and that the two men were “a fair distance from me”. 
     
      
    43 In a statement she gave to police on 12 January 2002 Mrs Logozzo had not given any description of the build of either of the offenders and before giving her evidence at the trial about the build of the prisoner she had had the opportunity of observing him, even if he was then sitting down. That the prisoner had a stocky build is readily observable, even when he is sitting down. 
     
      
    44 Mrs Logozzo’s evidence that the man with the pistol was the shorter of the two men was contradicted by the evidence of Robert Logozzo. Robert Logozzo, who gave evidence that his own height was about six foot one inch (about 185 centimetres) gave evidence that the man with the rifle was shorter than himself, no taller than 175 centimetres, whereas the other man (that is the man with the pistol) seemed taller than the man with the rifle by about five to eight centimetres. Later in his evidence Robert Logozzo said that the man with the pistol was “slightly” taller and that “I wouldn’t say he was a much bigger build than the first person”. 
     
      
    45 Parts of the evidence of Julian Logozzo might lend some support to Mrs Logozzo’s evidence. Julian Logozzo gave evidence that he himself was five foot eleven inches (approximately 180 centimetres) in height, that the man with the rifle was smaller, but not much smaller, than Julian Logozzo, about five foot nine inches or five foot ten inches, and that the man with the pistol was a little bit smaller in height than the man with the rifle and was of medium build, whereas the man with the rifle was thinner. 
     
      
    46 However, Julian Logozzo had formed his opinion about the height of the man with the pistol, while he himself was lying on the floor. After 7 January he had endeavoured to assess the height of the man with the rifle by marking what he thought was the man’s height on a doorway and that height had been determined to be five foot eight inches or five foot nine inches. On 7 January 2002 Julian Logozzo had told police that the man with the pistol was five foot eight inches or five foot nine inches in height. 
     
      
    47 Natalie Curmi gave no evidence about the comparative heights of the two men. She had had no more than a glimpse of the man with the pistol. 
     
      
    48 I have reached the conclusion that, in the state of the evidence, I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the man with the pistol was shorter than the man with the rifle. 
     
      
    49 As I have not been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that I should find either step one or step three in the Crown’s argument, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the prisoner who was the man with the pistol and who fired the two shots with the pistol. 
     
      
    50 A further issue of fact which was raised in the proceedings on sentence was, if it was the prisoner who had fired the shot which killed Mr Logozzo, whether I should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner had fired the shot with the intent to kill Mr Logozzo or at least with the intent to inflict really serious bodily injury on him. As I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the prisoner who fired the shot, this issue about the intention of the shooter does not really arise. However, I will endeavour to resolve the issue. 
     
      
    51 On this issue the Crown relied heavily on evidence given by Robert Logozzo in evidence in chief at p 96 of the trial transcript, in which Robert Logozzo said that “he (the man with the pistol) had his arms stretched out, holding the pistol with both hands”. 
     
      
    52 Robert Logozzo was asked by the Crown Prosecutor to demonstrate how the man had been holding the pistol. Robert Logozzo complied and agreed with the following description given by the Crown Prosecutor of what he had demonstrated – “he was standing erect, both arms are extending forward, both arms are together, with your fingers interlaced, pointing slightly below shoulder height”. 
     
      
    53 It was submitted by the Crown that I should accept this evidence by Robert Logozzo and, on the basis of this evidence, find that the person holding the pistol had an intention to shoot Mr Logozzo, which would necessarily have been an intention to kill him or at least an intention to inflict really serious bodily injury. 
     
      
    54 I note that the Crown made the submission that I should accept this part of Robert Logozzo’s evidence, while submitting that I should reject the same witness’s evidence about the comparative heights of the man with the rifle and the man with the pistol. 
     
      
    55 The position taken by the Crown in both written and oral submissions in the proceedings on sentence was that the shot which killed Mr Logozzo was the first shot fired and that the shot which injured Mrs Logozzo was fired subsequently. This view of the sequence of the two shots is supported by the evidence and is the sequence which I have stated earlier in these remarks. 
     
      
    56 According to Robert Logozzo’s evidence, he did not see the first shot fired. He gave evidence that he was lying on the floor of the lounge room face down, when he heard what he thought was a scuffle; he then heard a bang, which at the time he did not think was loud enough to be a gun shot (but which apparently was a gun shot) and he then heard a further noise, which he described as a “big thud” and it was only then that he looked up and saw the man with the pistol. Accordingly, even if Robert Logozzo’s evidence is accepted, it is evidence about the stance of the shooter at some time after the fatal shot had been fired. 
     
      
    57 In her evidence Mrs Logozzo said that she saw a flash come from the handgun but she did not give any evidence about the stance of the man with the pistol at the time she saw the flash. When asked where her husband was at the time she saw the flash, she gave somewhat conflicting evidence. She said, “he was standing in front of the closet, his body was lying on the closet, on top of the coffee table, so he was in that vicinity there” and “the man with the rifle was struggling with Joe at the time”. 
     
      
    58 At the time the fatal shot was fired events were happening quickly in the lounge room of the house and there had been a struggle, and there might have been a continuing struggle, between Mr Logozzo and the man with the rifle. The Crown did not allege that the second shot, which struck Mrs Logozzo, was fired with any intent to injure her. 
     
      
    59 I do not consider that I could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, on the basis of Robert Logozzo’s evidence, that whoever fired the shot which killed Mr Logozzo did so with the intent required for intentional murder. 
     
      
    60 I have concluded that I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the prisoner who fired the shot which killed Mr Logozzo and that the prisoner is to be sentenced for the crime of murder on the basis that he is guilty of constructive murder and that the Crown has not established that it was he who fired the fatal shot. However, even on this basis the crime of murder of which the prisoner is guilty was a very serious offence. The prisoner in company with another person entered the home of Mr and Mrs Logozzo late at night, intending to rob the occupants of the home. Each of the offenders was disguised by black clothing, a balaclava and large goggles and would have presented a terrifying appearance to the occupants of the house. The robbery which the offenders intended to commit was obviously a planned robbery. Each of the two offenders was armed with a firearm and at least one of the firearms was loaded. There was a serious risk that one of the firearms might be discharged in the course of committing or attempting to commit the planned robbery. In the course of attempting to commit the robbery one of the firearms was discharged and Mr Logozzo was fatally shot. 
     
      
    61 In the proceedings on sentence I received victim impact statements from Mrs Logozzo, Natalie Logozzo (formerly Natalie Curmi) and Michael Kress. I have considered all of these victim impact statements. In her victim impact statement Mrs Logozzo described her married life of approximately thirty years with Mr Logozzo and the severity of the impact on her of the loss of her husband. 
     
      
    62 The five offences of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon committed on 17 January 2002, that is the Kress offences, were very serious examples of armed robbery. A number of the aggravating factors referred to in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were present. The offences were committed in company (s 21A(2)(e)), the offences, taken collectively, involved multiple victims and a series of criminal acts (s 21A(2)(m)) and the offences were part of a planned or organised criminal activity (s 21A(2)(n)). 
     
      
    63 Other matters increasing the objective seriousness of the offences were that there were as many as three offenders; all of the offenders were armed, two with firearms and one with a knife; the offenders were disguised; the offenders were disguised in such a way as to present a terrifying appearance; the offenders entered the victims’ home late at night; the victims were not merely robbed but were deprived of their liberty, being compelled at gunpoint to lie on the floor and having their hands tied behind their backs with cable ties and having their mouths covered with duct tape. A particular circumstance of aggravation is that the prisoner participated in the Kress offences committed on 17 January 2002, notwithstanding that he knew that in the commission of the Logozzo offences on 7 January 2002 Mr Logozzo had been shot and killed. 
     
      
    64 I turn to the subjective circumstances of the prisoner.  
     
      
    65 As I have already mentioned, the prisoner gave evidence at the trial. He did not, however, give evidence in the proceedings on sentence. A report dated 13 December 2004 by Mr Peter Champion, a clinical psychologist, who had interviewed and tested the prisoner on 12 December 2004, was tendered by counsel for the prisoner and is the main source of such information as is before me about the prisoner’s subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    66 The prisoner was born in South East Asia of Cambodian parents on 2 June 1982. He was accordingly nineteen years old at the time of committing these offences.  
     
      
    67 The prisoner came to Australia with his family, when he was three years old. In Australia he attended school until year 12. His parents separated when he was sixteen years old. 
     
      
    68 The prisoner has a criminal history but it consists also entirely of driving offences, such as driving with a low range prescribed concentration of alcohol and driving while his licence was suspended or while he was disqualified from driving. 
     
      
    69 In his report Mr Champion said at par 32:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Sophear Em is a 22 year old man of Cambodian descent who has been in custody since mid 2002, awaiting trial, and subsequently awaiting sentence. There is a history of polysubstance abuse, with alcohol abuse being the most significant feature at or about the time of the offence/s. There is a history of familial dysfunction, contributing to a decline in his social and educational adjustment and to the changes in his pattern of substance abuse. There are indications of periods of mood disorder and perhaps also some anxiety disorder features.” 
        
       
      
    70 At par 31 of his report Mr Champion said that it was extremely difficult to talk about prognosis and future dangerousness, “when the individual denies any culpability or indeed any involvement in the primary offence (murder)”. I do not consider that, on the limited evidence before me, I am able to make any finding about the prisoner’s prospects of rehabilitation. I am unable to make any finding in favour of the prisoner that he has good prospects of rehabilitation or that he is unlikely to re-offend.  
     
      
    71 Most of the submissions of the parties in the proceedings on sentence were devoted to the disputed issues of fact about the murder of Mr Logozzo which I have already dealt with, namely whether I could find beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner was the person who shot Mr Logozzo and whether I could find beyond reasonable doubt that, if it was the prisoner who shot Mr Logozzo, the prisoner had the intent required for intentional murder. 
     
      
    72 The Crown submitted that I could properly impose a life sentence for the murder, without submitting that I would be required to do so and would be in error if I did not impose a life sentence. The Crown submission that I could properly impose a life sentence for murder was dependent on my accepting the Crown’s submissions on the disputed issues of fact about the murder and I have decided that I should not accept those submissions. The Crown submitted that, even if it did not succeed on the disputed issues of fact, the offence the prisoner had committed was a very serious offence and called for a long determinate sentence. The Crown referred to R v Mills (unreported NSWCCA 3 April 1995) in which the Court of Criminal Appeal held that an offence of constructive or felony murder is not to be regarded as less serious and thereby attracting a lighter total sentence or non-parole period than that which is appropriate for other categories of murder. See also R v Jacobs and Mehajer [2004] NSWCCA 462 especially at (332) per Wood CJ at CL. 
     
      
    73 The Crown submitted that the sentences for the Kress offences should be towards the upper end of sentences for armed robbery with a dangerous weapon and that, if I imposed a determinate sentence for the murder, there should be an accumulation of the sentences for the Logozzo offences and the sentences for the Kress offences. 
     
      
    74 Counsel for the prisoner in the proceedings on sentence, apart from making submissions on the disputed issues of fact about the murder of Mr Logozzo, submitted that in sentencing the prisoner I should take into account his youth and immaturity at the time of committing the offences and his lack of any relevant criminal history and that, in sentencing the prisoner for the Kress offences, I should take into account the prisoner’s pleas of guilty. On the subject of the prisoner’s youth and immaturity counsel referred to R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451 especially at pars 25-28. It was submitted that I should find special circumstances within s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    75 It was not in dispute in the proceedings on sentence that the prisoner had continuously been in custody since 20 May 2002, that the five sentences for the Kress offences could be made fully concurrent with each other but the length of the sentences could reflect that there were five victims (without the need to make the five individual sentences partly cumulative on each other), that the sentences for at least the first two of the Logozzo offences should commence from the same date and that, if I imposed a determinate sentence for the offence of murder, there should be at least some accumulation of the sentences for the Kress offences and the sentences for the Logozzo offences.  
     
      
    76 In sentencing the prisoner I take into account the provisions of s 3A and s 21A and other relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I take into account the objective facts of the offences and the subjective features of the prisoner, which I have already described. As I am sentencing the prisoner for multiple offences, I have regard to the principle of totality in sentencing and questions of whether and to what extent sentences should be made concurrent or cumulative.  
     
      
    77 I do not consider that I should take the extreme course of imposing a life sentence for the murder of Mr Logozzo. The prisoner is being sentenced for a single murder only. I have not found that I am satisfied to the requisite standard that it was the prisoner who fired the shot which killed Mr Logozzo. The prisoner is being sentenced on the basis that he is guilty of constructive murder. Even if I had been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the prisoner who fired the fatal shot, the act of firing the fatal shot was clearly unpremeditated (although the prisoner realised that there was a serious risk that one of the firearms might be discharged). I also take into account that the prisoner was only nineteen years old at the time of the murder and was to some degree immature and that he had no relevant criminal history. Although I have decided that a life sentence should not be imposed, the crime of murder committed by the prisoner remains a serious offence of murder. 
     
      
    78 The Kress offences were, in my opinion, much worse offences than the kind of armed robbery offence described in par 162 of the Chief Justice’s judgment in the guidelines decision of R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at 380 (162) for which the Chief Justice said a total sentence of imprisonment for four to five years should generally be imposed. In the present offences there was not a limited degree, but a high degree, of planning. As I have noted earlier in these remarks there were many circumstances of aggravation. In my opinion, the objective criminality of the Kress offences was considerably above the mid-range for offences of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. As was agreed by counsel in the proceedings on sentence, I will make the sentences for the five Kress offences fully concurrent with each other. However, the fact that there were five victims will result in a more severe penalty than if there had been merely one victim. 
     
      
    79 The prisoner pleaded guilty to the Kress offences. However, the pleas of guilty were late and I will allow a discount of not more than about 10 per cent for the pleas of guilty. I do not consider that the prisoner has shown any contrition for the Kress offences. 
     
      
    80 I do not consider that I should find that there are any special circumstances within s 44 (2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, otherwise than in the accumulation of sentences. Under the sentences I am about to impose there will be quite a lengthy period during which the prisoner will be eligible for release on parole, which will be equal to one quarter of the total sentences. 
     
      
    81 I propose to make the sentence for the offence committed against Mrs Logozzo, which will be the shortest of the sentences, the first to commence of the sentences. The sentence for this offence should impose some separate effective punishment on the prisoner, because the victim of the offence is a different person from the victim of the first two of the Logozzo offences. The offence of discharging a loaded firearm in the lounge room of a house with disregard for the safety of a person in the lounge room was a serious offence, even if the Crown did not allege that there was any intention to injure anyone. The sentence for this offence will be a fixed term of imprisonment, because if I were to impose a sentence containing a period during which the prisoner would be eligible for release on parole, that parole period would be subsumed in the non-parole periods of subsequent sentences. The fixed term will be equivalent to what would have been the non-parole period, if I had imposed a sentence containing a non-parole period and a parole period. 
     
      
    82 I propose to make the sentences for the Kress offences the next to commence of the sentences. I will impose fixed terms of imprisonment, because, if I were to impose sentences containing a period during which the prisoner would be eligible for release on parole, that parole period would be subsumed in the non-parole period of subsequent sentences. The fixed terms will be equivalent to what would have been the non-parole periods, if I had imposed sentences containing non-parole periods and parole periods. The sentences for these offences will be partly cumulative on the sentence for the offence committed against Mrs Logozzo. 
     
      
    83 The sentences for the first two of the Logozzo offences will commence from the same date and will be partly cumulative on the sentences for the Kress offences. The sentence for the offence charged in the second count in the indictment will, for reasons similar to those I have already given concerning the other sentences, be a fixed term of imprisonment. In sentencing the prisoner for the offence of murder I will impose a sentence containing a non-parole period and a parole period, such that the parole period will be one quarter of the total period of the sentences imposed on him. 
     
      
    84 Sophear Em for the offence of firing a firearm with disregard for the safety of Marianne Logozzo I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 20 May 2002 and expiring on 19 May 2004. 
     
      
    85 For each of the offences of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon committed on 17 January 2002 I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of twelve years commencing on 20 May 2003 and expiring on 19 May 2015. The five sentences to be served concurrently with each other. 
     
      
    86 For the offence of assaulting Joseph Logozzo with intent to rob him whilst armed with a dangerous weapon I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of ten years commencing on 20 May 2013 and expiring on 19 May 2023. 
     
      
    87 For the offence of murdering Joseph Logozzo I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of twenty-five years commencing on 20 May 2013 and expiring on 19 May 2038 with a non-parole period of sixteen years commencing on 20 May 2013 and expiring on 19 May 2029. 
     
      
    88 The earliest day on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 19 May 2029.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
       
      
    1 MASON P: The applicant, who appeals against sentence imposed in the District Court, was born on 10 July 1989. He is now 15 years old. He was aged between 13 years and 5 months and 14 years and 2 months at the time of the offences. 
     
      
       
      
    2 The sentence was a non-parole period of 12 months imprisonment commencing on 10 August 2004 and expiring on 9 August 2005, to be served in a detention centre. The balance of the sentence is two years commencing on 10 August 2005 and expiring on 9 August 2007. The applicant was directed to be released to parole subject to the supervision of the Department of Juvenile Justice at the conclusion of the non-parole period and other appropriate conditions (see RS 26-7). 
     
      
       
      
    3 The applicant is the only child of parents who separated when he was about 13 months old. Both parents have since remarried. His mother formed her current relationship in about 1992 and there is a daughter of this union. The applicant’s father also married in 1992 and there are three daughters to this union, the applicant’s half-sisters.4 The offences involve the oldest of those three daughters, who was aged 8 at the relevant time. 
     
      
       
      
    5 The applicant lived with his mother except at weekends when he would visit the home of his father and step-mother. 
     
      
       
      
    6 On 4 October 2003 the victim EB reported something to her mother. Within days she and the applicant were interviewed by the police. With one exception, the applicant admitted immediately the conduct alleged. He was charged on 7 October 2003. Upon his plea of guilty to all charges, he was committed to the District Court for sentence in relation to four offences and a Form 1 document that set out two additional offences.  
     
      
       
      
    7 Each of the six offences was a contravention of s66A of the Crimes Act 1900, namely having sexual intercourse with a person under 10 years. 
     
      
       
      
    8 Offences 1 and 2 occurred between 1 November 2002 and 25 December 2002. The applicant was playing hide and seek. The victim and the applicant were in a toilet in the house. The applicant locked the toilet door, pulled his pants down and told the victim to bend over and touch the floor. He inserted his penis into her anus three times. The complainant smelt a funny smell after the anal penetration. This particular incident represents count 1, which was charged as a continuing act. The applicant then turned the victim around and inserted his penis into her vagina twice. This is the subject of the second charge. 
     
      
       
      
    9 At a later time, between 1 June 2003 and 1 September 2003, there was another visit to the father’s home. The applicant told the victim to go to the toilet and wait for him. She complied. Shortly after he entered the toilet, pulled the victim’s pants down and told her to bend over and touch the floor. Once again he inserted his penis into her anus three times. He then turned the victim around and inserted his penis into her vagina twice. These were the third and fourth offences for which the applicant was committed for sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    10 The two Form 1 offences relate to events that occurred between 1 January 2003 and 1 September 2003. Again there was a game of hide and seek. The applicant followed the victim into a toilet in the house, locked the toilet door, pulled down the victim’s pants and inserted his penis into her anus.  
     
      
       
      
    11 There were adults in the house at the relevant times. The applicant told the complainant not to tell anyone what was occurring between the two of them as they would get into “heaps and heaps” of trouble and the applicant would be kicked out of the house. 
     
      
       
      
    12 The information supplied by the young victim, when she first spoke to her mother and subsequently to the police, shows that she felt confused, guilty and betrayed by these acts of abuse by an older step-brother whom she had previously trusted. 
     
      
       
      
    13 On 7 October 2003 the applicant was interviewed by the police in the presence of his father. He made admissions in relation to five of the six acts. He confirmed that he locked the toilet door so that nobody could catch him doing what he was doing to his sister. He was aware that what he was doing was wrong and he realized this from the first occasion. 
     
      
       
      
    14 The sentencing judge correctly recorded that these offences committed over a period of time were deliberate acts of sexual abuse of a child in circumstances where the young person, notwithstanding his considerable youth, knew that what he was doing was wrong and was fearful of the consequences of being found out. 
     
      
       
      
    15 The pleas of guilty were entered at the first reasonable opportunity. The sentencing judge allowed a 25% discount based upon their utilitarian benefit, including the sparing of the victim of the ordeal of having to give evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    16 His Honour also accepted that the plea was a reflection of the young person’s remorse for his conduct. This last feature is also remarked upon in the psychologists’ reports tendered at the sentencing hearing. There are some indications, particularly in the initial interview by the police, of attempts by the applicant to block out the memory of the events the consequences of which he was coming to regret. There were also some early qualifications in the offender’s recognition of the full impact of his offences upon the young victim of the abuse. To my mind both of these matters are reflections of the offender’s immaturity and inexperience as to the impact of sexual abuse. The later psychologists’ reports and the affidavit from the applicant tendered in this Court on the usual basis shows an appropriate development on both of these fronts. 
     
      
       
      
    17 I am quite satisfied that the applicant now appreciates the immediate and long-term impact of his offending and the damage it has done to his sister and trusting relationships within the family as a whole. 
     
      
       
      
    18 The sentencing was not and is not an easy exercise. Abuse of this nature involving such a young person and his sibling is fortunately rare in the experience of the Court. 
     
      
       
      
    19 As the law stood at the time of the first two offences, the maximum penalty was 20 years imprisonment. For the remaining offences it was 25 years. The sentencing judge was however informed by the prosecutor at trial that the maximum was 25 years for each offence. The impact of this misapprehension on the sentences imposed and upon the challenge to them in this Court is unclear. I have found it unnecessary to resolve this matter. 
     
      
       
      
    20 The District Court was required to deal with the applicant according to law because an offence under s66A of the Crimes Act is a “serious children’s indictable offence”.  
     
      
       
      
    21 Legislation dealing with standard non-parole periods found in Pt 4 Div 1A (ss54A-54D) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 commenced operation on 1 February 2003. This also operated differentially on the matters before the court since it did not apply to offences committed before its commencement (see Schedule 2, cl 45(1)). This new regime did apply to the remaining offences, imposing a standard non-parole period of 15 years for a s66A offence. The general operation of this provision is outlined in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. 
     
      
       
      
    22 These provisions are not adverted to on the face of the reasons, although there is a passing reference to a 15 year standard non-parole period in a hypothetical example given by the sentencing judge when he spoke directly to the offender explaining the sentence already imposed. The judge said he thought it unnecessary to apply Div 1A because of the plea of guilty (RS 29). This misunderstanding was not made the ground of appeal by either party in this Court. The appeal proceeded on the basis that the extreme youth of the applicant rendered the standard non-parole period of comparatively little gravitational force. I imply no criticism in this observation. 
     
      
       
      
    23 The learned sentencing judge set out the circumstances of the offences. 
     
      
       
      
    24 His Honour took full account of the complainant’s Victim Impact Statement. The abuse greatly upset the complainant who still has disturbing dreams and occasional nightmares about it. There are however some encouraging signs of a lessening of her anxiety. She will doubtless bear the scars for a long time. 
     
      
       
      
    25 The judge was assisted by a detailed background report prepared by specialist counsellors of the sex offender program of the Department of Juvenile Justice. Extensive information was garnered about the social/developmental background of the applicant, his education, social competency, emotional regulation and psycho-sexual development. This report was prepared at a time when the applicant was on conditional bail awaiting sentencing in the District Court. It remains capable of application in this Court (cf Roos v Director of Public Prosecutions (1994) 34 NSWLR 254). 
     
      
       
      
    26 At the time of sentencing the applicant was residing with his paternal grandfather in a regional city near where the rest of his divided family lives. The grandfather swore an affidavit that was placed before this Court indicating his preparedness to have the applicant continue to reside with him when released from custody. The applicant was born in the vicinity of this regional city. His upbringing and schooling have also taken place there. 
     
      
       
      
    27 The separation of the applicant’s parents was not amicable. They reported that it took approximately four years before the animosity “smoothed out”. The applicant had been “pulled between them and at times utilised as a ‘pawn’”. Since he was about 8, the applicant spent periods living in both households. The parents themselves informed the counsellors that their parenting over the years had tended to be inconsistent, with punishments being rarely followed through. The applicant had become proficient in playing the two parents off against each other.  
     
      
       
      
    28 His situation as the only boy and the only child moving between the two households is very likely to have contributed to his anger and difficulty in anger control. Whether such source of anger contributed in any way to the particular offending is unknown. One of the psychologists adverts to a background of jealousy that is understandable, not that it justifies the offences in any way. 
     
      
       
      
    29 There were continuing behavioural problems including disruptive behaviour at school and frequent lying. 
     
      
       
      
    30 The applicant is of above average intelligence. His schooling has been disrupted to a degree by his disruptive behaviour. In 2004 he was in Year 9 at a Christian School in the regional city. That school has continued its pedagogical and pastoral responsibility for the offender and has, to its credit, indicated its willingness to receive him back upon his release from custody. 
     
      
       
      
    31 A good deal of the background report went beyond the matters required to be addressed by s25 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. I imply no criticism. This was a matter in which the sentencing judge required as much assistance as possible in understanding the continuing impact of the offence upon the offender and his family, including of course the victim. 
     
      
       
      
    32 One matter that properly received considerable attention was exploration as to the reason for offending especially in the context of the risk of re-offending and the prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      
    33 The abusive conduct was specific and repeated. It went beyond characterisation solely as a product of naughty curiosity. Yet there was (thankfully) no evidence of earlier offending in this or any other regard. The background report records no evidence of abusive sexual attitudes or behaviour (apart from that involving the complainant). 
     
      
       
      
    34 Those who interviewed the applicant found some difficulty stemming from his coyness in discussing the offending actions. This made it difficult to ascertain the level of his insight with respect to the behaviour and the degree to which he accepted responsibility for his actions. Nevertheless there is, as indicated, a clear sign of progression over time towards fuller understanding and fuller responsibility. The interviews obviously involved effective counselling as well as the mere recording of the subject’s beliefs and attitudes. 
     
      
       
      
    35 The statutory background report dated 30 July 2004 was guarded in its risk assessment. It urged that the applicant continue to receive counselling that targeted his “general anti-social behaviour and entitlement belief system”. Counselling for his primary carers was also recommended.36 In his recent affidavit the applicant states: 
     
      
       
        
         
         I have a very supportive family. I speak to them on the phone every night. My Mum, Dad and Step-Mother … also come to visit me once every couple of weeks or whenever they can get away. They come all the way from … to see me. 
         
        
        
       This is an encouraging sign that the whole family is continuing to recognise their responsibility for the applicant’s ongoing welfare. 
        
       
      
    37 The key recommendation of the background report was that there should be sentencing by way of a probation order subject to appropriate conditions including ongoing supervision and sex offender counselling through the Department of Juvenile Justice. 
     
      
       
      
    38 Two psychological assessment reports were tendered for the defence. These on the whole presented a slightly more favourable position than the statutory background report. Each report documented genuine remorse, a growing sense of responsibility stemming from various matters including the impact of the legal process that had been set in train. Both of these reports also recommended against a custodial sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    39 The primary judge was nevertheless of the view that (RS10): 
     
      
       
        
         
         … The seriousness of the conduct of the young person is so great and the need in my opinion to denounce the young person and to ensure there is some punishment for his conduct is so great that I could not accord with those recommendations that have been made in these reports. 
         
        
        
       See also RS 7. 
        
       
      
    40 The judge quoted the reports extensively, much more so than the summary I have given. Having done so, he restated his conclusion that “these matters are too serious to be outweighed in their seriousness by considerations such as the remorse expressed by the young person” (RS18).  
     
      
       
      
    41 Since each offence was a serious indictable offence the judge was required to deal with the applicant according to law. He was thus unable to make an order pursuant to s33 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 that the applicant be released on probation. He was not, however, obliged in law to impose a custodial sentence. Nevertheless, he signalled his intention to sentence to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period, with a direction that the applicant serve the term in a detention centre. 
     
      
       
      
    42 Relevant to the structure of the sentence, there were what I regard as key findings in his Honour’s conclusions that the applicant was safe to remain within the community (RS19) and that he was a person of previous good character and with good prospects of rehabilitation (RS23). The judge also accepted that the applicant had shown remorse for the offence and that because of his age he may not have been fully aware of the consequences for his victim of his conduct. 
     
      
       
      
    43 A critical portion of the reasons stated (RS23, emphasis added):  
     
      
       
        
         
         In my view it is important  
         primarily 
          in this matter to ensure that the young offender is adequately punished for the offence and to prevent him from committing further offences by deterring him. The need to protect the community from the offender is not great in this matter and I trust that the non-parole period that I fix promotes his rehabilitation. However, the young offender has to be made accountable for his actions and he must understand the harm that he has done to the victim and I believe no other order can be made to reinforce these matters given the other material before me. 
         
        
        
         
         In relation to s21A upon which I was addressed by the learned Crown Prosecutor, it is quite clear that  
         the primary aggravating matter in these offences were that the offender sexually assaulted a vulnerable victim 
         . It is not an abuse of a position of trust in the way in which a parent could be claimed to have breached a position of trust. It is clear, however, that the young child would have trusted the offender when agreeing, at some early stage, to remain in the toilet with him. The offender did not have, in any meaningful way, any responsibility for the care of the victim. I am sentencing the offender for a multiple series of criminal acts and there was an element of planning in the offences committed by the offender. I accept as an aggravating factor that the emotional harm and injury to the victim could be described as substantial. 
         
        
        
       
      
    44 This passage reveals the complexity of the sentencing exercise. It also explains why counsel for the applicant in this Court recognised that it was open to the sentencing judge to find that some custodial term was warranted. 
     
      
       
      
    45 According to Mr Smith’s most helpful submissions, the second paragraph of the passage just quoted discloses a specific error in that the judge viewed as a “primary aggravating matter” the fact that the complainant was “a vulnerable victim”. It is submitted that this remark betrayed error in that the concluding portion of s21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 enjoins the court not to have additional regard to any aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence. In the present case the age of the victim of the sexual assault is such an element.  
     
      
       
      
    46 The Crown argued that the balance of the second paragraph reveals that the judge had regard to more than just the age of the victim. In truth, the vulnerability stemmed from a combination of her age and her relationship with the offender. I strongly doubt that this does justice to his Honour’s expressed reasoning. I read everything but the first sentence of the second paragraph as addressing and ultimately rejecting the argument that there was an abuse of “a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim”, which is mentioned as a separate aggravating factor in s21A(2)(k). I therefore conclude that there is a particular error disclosed in the reference to “a vulnerable victim”. But if that error stood alone I would not be persuaded that a sentence other than that imposed by the primary judge was “warranted in law” ( cf Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s6(3)). 
     
      
       
      
    47 My greater concern lies with the earlier paragraph that gives express primacy to deterrence and relative insignificance to rehabilitation, which is mentioned almost as an aside in the phrase “I trust that the non-parole period that I fix promotes his rehabilitation”. The primacy of deterrence and denunciation is also observable in earlier passages at RS 7 and 10 that have already been cited. 
     
      
       
      
    48 The impact of these offences on the victim and indirectly the family is significant and inescapable. So too is the objective seriousness of the offences bearing in mind the element of planning and the threats. The offender knew that he was doing wrong. All of these matters must be acknowledged. But so too must the very young age of the offender. His immaturity undoubtedly contributed to his lack of insight into the impact of his wholly selfish action. It was also a factor which, coupled with his dysfunctional family situation, contributed to a lessening of the constraints against wrongdoing that hopefully attend a well-formed moral and social conscience. 
     
      
       
      
    49 Mr Tyrer, a psychologist who provided a report for the applicant, expressed his conclusion in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
          I believe that J would benefit from a clear, concrete reminder of the seriousness of the situation, although I am confident that J is safe to continue dealing with these issues from within the community. He has worked hard during our counselling sessions and he and I are both happy to continue this supportive arrangement. Another option would be for this work to be continued through the Office of Juvenile Justice. I do not believe that the best interests of the community or J require a custodial sentence. The process of maturation for J is clearly continuing, with issues that need addressing by his family. However, he has shown remorse, responsibility and appropriate planning for the future sufficient for me to recommend to the Court the continuation of community based management and support. 
          
         
        
       
      
    50 The sentencing judge was not bound to accept this opinion. He does however appear to have taken up the first half of the opening sentence of Mr Tyrer’s concluding opinion in a sense contrary to that intended by the psychologist.  
     
      
       
      
    51 It was open for his Honour to do so, as the applicant concedes in this Court. The sentence is however appealably excessive, in my opinion, because of the matters to which I have referred and because of the duration of the custodial sentence which of necessity has had to be served by the applicant in Western Sydney some considerable distance away from the place of his family support. 
     
      
       
      
    52 His Honour determined to administer a “sharp shock”, but it was in all of the circumstances too long a one, in my opinion. For an offender of this age, facing his first time in custody, extreme youth should have meant that rehabilitation and not deterrence was the primary focus of attention (see generally GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112). 
     
      
       
      
    53 The delay between admission of the offences and the sentencing was too long, even allowing for the need to get the various assessments. When, after various interruptions, the matter was addressed in mid August 2004 the sentence imposed bore unnecessarily harshly upon the offender in that it disrupted his education over two school years. In light of s6(c) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act and the reports, it would, in my opinion, have been more appropriate for full time custodial sentence to have ceased before the start of the academic year in 2005. The orders that I propose are designed to address this matter in particular. 
     
      
       
      
    54 Hopefully the applicant will continue to draw positive responses from the strong legal denunciation of his conduct and the ongoing supervision that forms part of the varied sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    55 The reasons for special circumstances are as stated by the primary judge. The age of the offender, the need for significant counselling as he attempts to reintegrate himself into society and his family amply justify departure from the statutory norm. 
     
      
       
      
    56 The form of the amended sentences reflects the fact that the first two offences predated the repeal of the former s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
       
      
    57 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
       1. Leave to appeal. 
        
        
       2. Appeal upheld. 
        
        
       3. Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court on 12 August 2004. 
        
        
       4. In lieu thereof: 
        
        
         
         (i) On the first two charges, sentence the appellant to a term of imprisonment for 3 years, commencing on 10 August 2004 and ending on 9 August 2007, to be served in a detention centre; set a non-parole period for the sentence expiring on 24 March 2005; 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) On charges three and four, sentence the appellant to a non-parole period commencing on 10 August 2004 and expiring on 24 March 2005 with the balance of a three year sentence expiring on 9 August 2007; 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) At the conclusion of the non-parole period the appellant is to be released to parole subject to the supervision of the Department of Juvenile Justice and subject to the parole conditions set by Norrish DCJ on 12 August 2004; 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) In sentencing the appellant upon the first charge, I have taken into account the two matters contained on the Form 1.

     REGINA v Gregory Allan SHORTEN 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1 JAMES J: Gregory Allan Shorten has applied for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him in the District Court on 2 December 2003 by his Honour Judge Blackmore for one offence of breaking, entering and stealing, an offence under s 112 (1) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years. His Honour imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment of three years commencing on 25 March 2003 and expiring on 24 March 2006. The sentence did not include any period during which the applicant would be eligible for release on parole.  
     
      
    2 Most of the facts of the offence were undisputed. At some time between 4 May and 6 May 2001 the applicant broke and entered a house owned by a Mr and Mrs Varnasky at Mittagong and stole a quantity of goods from within the house. Mr and Mrs Varnasky, who had been away from the house for the weekend, returned on the evening of Sunday 6 May 2001. They observed that the house had been broken into and that a number of items of property were missing. Mr and Mrs Varnasky prepared an inventory of the property which was missing.  
     
      
    3 When he was spoken to by police about this offence, which did not occur until April 2003, the applicant admitted that he had broken into the house and that he had stolen some of the missing property but he denied that he had stolen all of the missing property. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was indicted before Judge Blackmore on a charge that he had broken and entered the dwelling house of Mr and Mrs Varnasky and committed the offence of larceny, without the chattels which he had allegedly stolen being specified in the indictment. When indicted, the applicant pleaded guilty. However, after the applicant had pleaded guilty, there was a lengthy sentence hearing before Judge Blackmore in which the Crown contended, and the applicant disputed, that he had stolen all of the items in the inventory of missing property.  
     
      
    5 In a judgment given on 2 December 2003 his Honour recorded that Mr Varnasky had given evidence that, when he and his wife had returned to the house on 6 May 2001, he had noticed two distinct sets of footprints inside the house. His Honour noted that the Crown had not charged the applicant with the offence of robbery in company and, this being so, his Honour considered that the Crown should be excluded from arguing that the applicant had been in company with another person when he committed the offence. His Honour held that any finding by him that the applicant had committed the offence in company with another person would be unfair to the applicant and would change the basis on which the applicant had entered his plea of guilty. His Honour proceeded to find that the second set of footprints inside the house had been placed there independently of the applicant, leading to a conclusion that someone other than the applicant had stolen some items of property from the house, after the applicant himself had left the house. Accordingly, the applicant was to be sentenced on the basis that he had stolen only the items of property which he admitted stealing. These items consisted of a large quantity of jewellery valued at about $54,000 for which the applicant had received $15,000 from a receiver, cash amounting to approximately $950 and some computer games. His Honour commented that, even on this basis, the offence committed by the applicant was a very serious one. 
     
      
    6 In his remarks on sentence his Honour referred to the applicant's criminal history. The applicant had more than 20 convictions for breaking, entering and stealing and numerous other convictions for offences of dishonesty. The applicant had committed the present offence, while on parole under a sentence for an offence of breaking, entering and stealing. He had been released from custody on parole only a few days before committing the offence. That the applicant had committed the present offence while he was on conditional liberty was an important circumstance of aggravation.  
     
      
    7 On 23 August 2002 for another offence of breaking, entering and stealing the applicant had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years six months, which commenced on 25 March 2002 and would expire on 24 September 2004. At the express request of the applicant, the judge who had sentenced him had not set any non-parole period. Judge Blackmore made the sentence that he imposed partly cumulative on this sentence, so that the sentence he imposed commenced on 25 March 2003.  
     
      
    8 In his remarks on sentence Judge Blackmore referred to a number of subjective features of the applicant. The applicant was born on 13 October 1958 and was accordingly 42 years old at the time of committing the offence. The applicant said, when giving evidence in the proceedings on sentence, that by reason of the many years he had spent in prison he had become in effect institutionalised. His Honour commented in his remarks that the applicant had been treated leniently on many occasions by sentencing courts and had then proceeded to re-offend. His Honour referred to a number of reports about the applicant including a report by a Dr Allnutt, a psychiatrist, in which Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion that the applicant was an adult sufferer of an attention deficit disorder. 
     
      
    9 In his remarks on sentence his Honour noted what his Honour described as a “strident” request by the applicant that no non-parole period be set in any sentence imposed. His Honour said that ""the offender is of the view that nothing constructive is achieved by parole. It should be remembered he lives in a country area where services are naturally limited"". His Honour complied with the applicant's request that no non-parole period be set. As I have already noted, a similar request, which had also been complied with, had been made to the judge who sentenced the applicant on 23 August 2002.  
     
      
    10 There is only one ground of appeal against sentence, namely that the sentencing judge erred in failing to adequately take into account the delay in prosecution. 
     
      
    11 The facts relied on by counsel for the applicant as showing a delay in the prosecution of the applicant were that the offence had been committed between 4 and 6 May 2001, on 10 May 2001 a swab of what appeared to be human blood had been taken from the crime scene, on 9 January 2002 the swab had been found to contain human blood and on 27 June 2002 police had been notified that the blood from the swab matched the applicant's DNA. The applicant had not been arrested until 16 April 2003, when he admitted having committed the offence but disputed that he had stolen all of the missing property. It was submitted in written submissions that no satisfactory explanation had been given for the various delays which had occurred. 
     
      
    12 Counsel for the applicant referred to the decision of this court in R v Kay [2004] NSWCCA 130 a case involving somewhat similar facts, in which the court rejected a submission made on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge had insufficiently taken into account the delay which had occurred in the sentencing of the offender. Counsel for the applicant submitted that the present case was distinguishable from Kay on the basis that in the present case the delay between the commission of the offence and the imposition of the sentence was longer, the delay between the making of a DNA match and the arrest of the offender was longer and that in Kay's case a prior sentence had been imposed before a match had been made between a swab taken from the crime scene and the offender's DNA. 
     
      
    13 I accept that these factual distinctions do exist between the present case and Kay and that the present application should not be decided simply by applying the decision in Kay on the basis that the present application is indistinguishable from Kay. However, I consider that the present application should be determined by the application of principles rather than by an attempted point by point comparison between the present case and Kay. 
     
      
    14 In Kay McColl JA, who gave the leading judgment, referred to the often quoted passage in the judgment of Street CJ in R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 on the subject of delay in the sentencing of an offender. Street CJ said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Moreover, where there has been a lengthy postponement, whether due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence, to the circumstance that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence on a subsequent occasion and to the fact that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach passage of time between offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner."" 
        
       
      
    15 This passage in the judgment of Street CJ in Todd was referred to with approval by the High Court in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 64-66. 
     
      
    16 In my opinion, when the principles stated by Street CJ in Todd are applied it can be seen that the only ground of appeal in the present application should be rejected.  
     
      
    17 In the first place, the delay in sentencing which occurred in the present case, although regrettable, was much shorter than the “lengthy” delay of several years which occurred in both Todd and Mill. 
     
      
    18 In the present case it was not submitted that the first of the factors referred to by Street CJ, that is progress towards rehabilitation during the delay in sentencing, had any application. In the present case there was no evidence whatever that during the period of any delay the applicant had made any progress towards being rehabilitated.  
     
      
    19 Nor was it submitted that the second factor referred to by Street CJ, that is that during a protracted period the offender had been left in a state of suspense or uncertainty, had any application. It is well settled that the only state of suspense or uncertainty which will be relevant is any state of suspense or uncertainty experienced by the offender after he has been arrested or after it has been indicated to him by some person in authority that he is likely to be prosecuted for the offence. Any suspense or uncertainty on the part of an offender as to whether his committing of the offence will ever be detected is not to be taken into account. See Kay especially at paras (30) to (33) and R v Law (Queensland Court of Appeal) (1995) 84 A Crim R 142 at 145 per curiam. In the present case the first indication to the applicant that he was likely to be prosecuted for the offence was when he was spoken to by police on 16 April 2003. There was then a delay of only a few months before he was sentenced. 
     
      
    20 The submission which was made on behalf of the applicant was that the sentencing judge had failed to comply with the third principle stated by Street CJ, that sentencing an offender for a stale crime, long after the committing of the crime, calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach.  
     
      
    21 I do not consider that it has been shown that the sentencing judge failed to comply with this principle. His Honour did refer to the delay which had occurred in the sentencing of the applicant in a passage in his remarks on sentence. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… as the offence was committed before his last sentence, and had the DNA testing been carried out in a timely fashion and had he been charged, he could have been dealt with on the one indictment at the time of that sentencing. In the circumstances, this is a case where the principal of totality must be kept firmly in mind”. 
        
       
      
    22 Accordingly his Honour took into account that, if such delay as had occurred had not occurred, the applicant might well have been sentenced for the present offence at the same time as he had been sentenced for another offence on 23 August 2002. His Honour reasoned that, if the applicant had been sentenced for the present offence on 23 August 2002, the sentencing judge would have had regard to the sentencing principle of totality but would have considered that a sentence should be imposed for the present offence which imposed some additional, separate punishment on the applicant. His Honour concluded that he should make the sentence of three years imprisonment he imposed commence on 15 March 2003, when the sentence imposed on 23 August 2002 still had 18 months to run, with the practical consequence that the sentence imposed by his Honour would impose additional, separate punishment on the applicant for the present offence but only to the extent of imprisonment for eighteen months. In my opinion, it has not been shown that the sentencing judge failed to demonstrate the understanding and flexibility of approach required by the third principle stated by Street CJ. In my opinion, the only ground of appeal against sentence should be rejected and, accordingly, while I would grant leave to appeal against sentence, the appeal itself should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ & HUNT A-JA : We agree with Mason P, for the reasons he has given, that the decision of Sully J to grant a permanent stay in this case should be set aside. However, the view we have formed as to how the trial should be conducted in relation to the charge of defrauding the Commonwealth differs sufficiently from that proposed by the President that it is necessary to state our own reasons as to the nature of the issue posed and how it should be put to the jury. 
     
      
       
        
       Defrauding the Commonwealth 
        
       
      
    2 The first count in the indictment is currently in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
         Between 1 September 1997 and 27 February 1999, Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias did defraud the Commonwealth in that [,] while an officer of the Australian Taxation Office, he did put the revenue of the Commonwealth at risk by causing Private Binding Rulings and Advance Opinions to issue to taxpayers, by dishonest means. 
         
        
       
      
    3 The three categories of fraud identified by Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Peters v The Queen (1998) 192 CLR 493 at [30], are the intentional creation of a situation in which the accused: 
     
      
       
        
       (1) deprives another person of money or property, or 
        
       (2) puts the money or property of that other person at risk, or 
        
       (3) prejudicially affects that person in relation to some lawful right, interest, opportunity or advantage, 
        
        
       knowing that he has no right to deprive that person of that money or property or to prejudice his or her rights. (See also McHugh J to the same effect, at [73].) 
        
       
      
    4 In previous proceedings in the Court of Appeal relating to the case against this accused — Wills v Petroulias (2003) 58 NSWLR 598 — these three categories were described, respectively, as an actual loss of revenue, an actual risk of loss of revenue and the lost opportunity of testing the views expressed in the private rulings, the Commissioner being bound in other cases (at least administratively) by the rulings made. The distinction between the second and third categories is that, in the second category, there must be the possibility that the Commissioner, were he not bound by the rulings made, would win a case by demonstrating that the rulings were wrong (Wills v Petroulias at [64]), whereas in the third category there is merely a loss of the opportunity to litigate whether the rulings were correct. 
     
      
       
      
    5 The Crown asserts that its first count was intended to reflect the second of those three categories. The relevant particulars of harm nominated by the Crown as encapsulating its case are particulars N(iv) and N(v): 
     
      
       
        
         
         (iv) In each case, the revenue of the Commonwealth was at risk because of the prejudice to the right or advantage of the Commissioner of Taxation to otherwise act without restriction to assess and recover any tax payable. 
         
        
        
         
         (v) The PBRs [private binding rulings] and AOs [advance opinions] issued at the direction of Petroulias were arguably wrong. 
         
        
       
      
    6 Particular N(iv), standing by itself, is no more than a third category (lost opportunity) case, the least serious of the three categories. However, particular N(v) is said by the Crown to be itself a particular of particular N(iv). It is only by reading the two together that the case can be elevated to the second category (an actual risk of loss of revenue case). In order to support the count, therefore, the Crown must establish that the private rulings were, as tentatively suggested in Wills v Petroulias, arguably wrong. The Crown cannot be permitted to put these two particulars in the alternative. 
     
      
       
      
    7 Without the particulars, the first count in the indictment simply states that the accused “did put the revenue … at risk”. Such a charge would be ambiguous, and thus impermissible, in that it does not specify with sufficient particularity the actus reus of the offence. It would, for example, permit the Crown to pursue either a lost opportunity case or an actual risk of loss case. However, particulars N(iv) and N(v) cure any such problem of ambiguity so long as they are read together. The Crown has expressly abjured any reliance on a lost opportunity case. Sully J was correct to determine that the Crown would be held to pursue only the case which it has now particularised. 
     
      
       
      
    8 There was some discussion in Wills v Petroulias as to what had to be established in a case alleging that the private rulings procured by the accused constituted an actual risk that the revenue of the Commonwealth was imperilled, but only tentative views were expressed. We agree with Mason P that the time has come for this Court to express a concluded view. If this Court adopts the need to prove that the private rulings were arguably wrong (or any variation of that formulation), a second issue must then be determined — whether that issue is one of law for the judge to decide or whether it is one of fact (or mixed law and fact) for the jury to determine. 
     
      
       
        
        
       The relevant issue 
        
       
      
    9 The three categories of fraud already adopted descend in order of seriousness — and consequently in the nature of the punishment to be imposed — from the actual loss (when it would be necessary in the present case to establish that the private rulings were wrong) to the loss of an opportunity to test the views expressed in those rulings (when the Crown would need to establish no more than the existence of a genuine dispute by the Commissioner concerning those rulings). What must be established for the second category must therefore be somewhere between those two categories.  
     
      
       
      
    10 In Wills v Petroulias, the Chief Justice expressed support for, but did not determine, the proposition that it would be necessary to establish that the rulings were arguably wrong, and that there must be the possibility that the Commissioner would win a case in which he was allowed to dispute those rulings: Wills v Petroulias (No 1) at [55], [59], [62] and [64] and Wills v Petroulias (No 2) at [67]. The views expressed in the earlier judgments were, however, concerned with the application of a particular statutory regime — particularly with ss 104 and 110 of the Justices Act 1902. The issues which arise in relation to the trial of the charges on which the accused has now been committed are quite distinct. The phrase “arguably wrong” was appropriate for the arguments which arose in those earlier proceedings, but it is not helpful in understanding what is really involved in the issue which arises.  
     
      
       
      
    11 In our opinion, the issue which arises in a second category (actual risk of loss of revenue) case would be expressed more clearly if it were made clear on its face just why the issue arises and if it were couched in a positive rather than a possibly negative way. In this way, the difficulties which Sully J saw in the “arguably wrong” formulation would largely disappear. In our view, to say that the private rulings are arguably wrong is really saying no more than that the Commissioner of Taxation has an arguable case to put that the rulings were wrong and, accordingly, that the risk to the revenue was such that the Commonwealth was in fact deprived of something of value. There is no difference in substance in stating the issue in this way. But stating the issue in this way leads immediately to a consideration of the approach to be taken in determining the issue, be it by the judge or the jury. 
     
      
       
        
       One issue of law for the judge 
        
       
      
    12 The arguable case to be put by the Commissioner must first demonstrate the possibility that the Commissioner would win a case in which he was allowed to dispute the private rulings. Is the case which the Commissioner wishes to put one which is capable of success? That is clearly an issue of law for the judge. The ruling would be given in the way that every such ruling is given as to whether the Crown case can go to the jury — before counsel address the jury, and after argument in the absence of the jury. In the event that the judge rules that the arguable case the Commissioner wishes to put forward is capable of success, no further mention of the ruling should be made to the jury, as jurors may well be misled as to its effect upon the issues which they have to determine. 
     
      
       
        
       The approach to be taken by the relevant tribunal 
        
       
      
    13 An arguable case is (by definition) a case which is supported by an argument which is plausible or apparently reasonable on its face. A plausible or apparently reasonable argument is one which can be reasoned logically from one step to the next step to its conclusion. It is not the function of the relevant tribunal to determine whether either the Commissioner’s argument or the taxpayer’s argument is correct, or even which is the more plausible or the more apparently reasonable argument. It may be that each of those parties has an arguable case. That is not unusual in litigation. Even though the taxpayer may have an arguable case, it does not mean that the relevant tribunal may not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Commissioner also has an arguable case. If so satisfied that the Commissioner has an arguable case, the relevant tribunal has resolved the issue posed by a second category fraud case, subject to the mens rea component identified in par 3, supra. 
     
      
       
        
       Which is the relevant tribunal for this issue? 
        
       
      
    14 Whatever conclusion is reached on this question, the primary issue which must ultimately go to the jury is whether the Commonwealth has suffered a detriment as a result of the private rulings given. That detriment is to be established in this case by demonstrating, according to our suggested formulation, that the Commissioner has an arguable case that the private rulings were wrong. The parties (for quite different purposes) agreed before Sully J and this Court that the predecessor of this issue (whether the private rulings were arguably wrong) was an issue of law for the judge. We have already accepted that the capacity of the Commissioner’s arguable case to succeed is an issue of law for the judge (par 12, supra). But we do not agree that the remaining issue is a question of law to be determined by the judge. In our opinion, that issue, despite its obvious legal character, is a fact in issue in the trial to be determined by the jury. 
     
      
       
      
    15 A trial judge must direct the jury as to, inter alia, the manner in which the jurors are to carry out their functions and the elements of the crime charged. The contents of such directions are accepted as being matters of law for the trial judge to decide. But the issue of whether or not the Commissioner has an arguable case that the private rulings given were wrong is not an element of the crime of defrauding the Commonwealth. It is what the Crown puts forward as establishing that the actual risk that the revenue of the Commonwealth was imperilled amounts to the deprivation necessary for a charge of defrauding the Commonwealth. The relevant element of the crime is deprivation. Whether the Commissioner has an arguable case that the private rulings were wrong is, therefore, a fact in issue relevant to the deprivation element of the crime charged.  
     
      
       
       The directions to be given on arguable case 
        
       
      
    16 The requirement that the trial judge direct the jury on the applicable law in relation to the elements of the crime charged does not require the judge to direct the jury as to what the law is in relation to Fringe Benefits Tax, the meaning of the term “associate” in s 26AAB(14)(a)(iv) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, or whether the employer’s payments under the relevant scheme were deductible. Nor is it appropriate that the judge direct the jury that the arguments put forward in the Crown case in this regard are “arguable”. 
     
      
       
      
    17 The directions which the judge will be required to give in this case will be such as are required for the jury to determine for themselves whether the Crown has established an arguable case on either of the two issues that have been raised — fringe benefits tax and deductibility — so that the jury are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the risk to the revenue was such that the Commonwealth was in fact deprived of something of value. Subject to the course of the trial, the judge will probably be required to outline the relevant provisions of the statute and identify in the material admitted into evidence the arguments in favour of the liability to fringe benefits tax and those against deductibility, together with the evidence that supports or detracts from the strength of those arguments. The assessment of the evidence — whether in terms of “arguable case” or “arguably wrong” — is a matter for the jury. 
     
      
       
      
    18 The issue for the jury to determine is whether or not the arguments propounded on either of the two issues identified in the previous paragraph are of sufficient strength to justify the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the Commonwealth was in fact deprived of something of value by reason of the issue of the private rulings. It should be noted that the Commonwealth’s case in this regard could be made out if the members of the jury determined that the Crown case was of sufficient strength on either the fringe benefits tax issue or the deductibility issue. It would not be necessary for jurors to be unanimous as to which of the two were of such strength. 
     
      
       
      
    19 The approach to be taken, already identified in par 13, supra, will constitute the basis for the directions to be given to the jury. It would not be appropriate for the trial judge to direct the jury that, depending on the view they have formed of certain factual matters, the Australian Tax Office did lose something of value — or even that the rulings did put the revenue of the Commonwealth at risk. Such a direction may well be subject to various permutations and combinations of the factual matters, and the direction could lead to confusion. The more usual form of directions to a jury — and the infinitely safer one — is to define the issue which the jury must determine, then explain to them the arguments of both parties in relation to the relevant factual material, and finally conclude that, if the Crown has satisfied them that it has established that particular issue, they may move on to the next issue. 
     
      
       
      
    20 In order to produce directions in terms which can easily be assimilated by the jury, their contents should in our view be debated by the parties and tentatively determined by the judge at or before the trial, and reduced to writing for the jurors to use during the summing-up and in their deliberations. Those tentative directions can always of course be revisited before the summing-up in the light of what happens during the trial. Additional assistance by way of elaboration or comment may also be given by the judge during the course of giving the directions which are in writing. 
     
      
       
        
       The difficulties to which the Crown referred 
        
       
      
    21 The summing-up in this case will undoubtedly be a complex task, but it is not an impossible one. It will be by no means as difficult as the directions which must be given in a murder trial where there is a serious dispute between pathologists as to whether the injury causing the death of the deceased was consistent with murder or accident, or in a fraud case based on complicated accounting methods, or a prosecution under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cwth) based on alleged breaches of accounting standards, or (when civil juries were available in such cases) in a case based on medical negligence or a case based on legal negligence (where the negligence is alleged to have been a misinterpretation of the law). 
     
      
       
      
    22 The difficulty in directing the jury in this case was put forward by the Crown as a reason for the issue to be decided by the judge rather than the jury. The Crown’s argument was based on the decision of this Court in Regina v Cassell (1998) 45 NSWLR 325 at 334, where it was held that the issue of materiality, in a charge of giving evidence before the Independent Commission Against Corruption knowing that it was false or misleading in a material particular, was for the judge to decide as a question of law, thereby putting that charge on the same basis as perjury. Section 327 of the Crimes Act 1900 expressly provides that materiality in a perjury case is a matter of law, and thus for the judge to determine. Smart J, with whom the other judges agreed, pointed out that what would be material to the corruption investigation being carried out by ICAC could not be understood without a knowledge of ICAC’s statute, the objects and provisions of that statute and an appreciation of the particular investigation being carried out when the evidence is given, and that for that reason it was a question of law for the judge. Such difficulties are inherent not only in every case of perjury but also in every case of knowingly giving false evidence before tribunals other than courts. There was every reason for assigning the issue to the judge rather than the jury. 
     
      
       
      
    23 The High Court took a similar approach in Ahern v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 87, where it was held in a joint judgment that it was for the judge, and not the jury, to decide whether there was a prima facie case of conspiracy made out by the Crown before statements made by co-conspirators not otherwise admissible against the accused became so admissible. It is true that the Court referred (at 104) to the need for directions which would be of unacceptable complexity if the issue were to be determined by the jury, but that was because of the nature of the issue itself, not because of the facts of that particular case. The true basis for the Court’s decision is stated (at 100) to have been that the existence of a prima facie case was only another way of saying that there was a reasonable basis in the evidence for admitting the evidence of such statements against the accused, a standard by which the admissibility of many different types of evidence may be admitted, and a decision which is always made by the judge.  
     
      
       
      
    24 Those two cases illustrate that the assignment of the relevant issue to the judge rather than the jury is to apply in every case in which that issue arises, and not just in those individual cases where the task of directing the jury as to its task in relation to that issue is a difficult one. We do not accept that the question as whether there is an arguable case in relation to a basic issue arising under the Income Tax Assessment Act could be a question of law for the judge in one case (because of the complexity of that particular case) but a question of fact for the jury in another case (because that complexity did not exist). We were informed by the Crown that, in Ahern (a “bottom of the harbour” tax scheme case of defrauding the Commonwealth), all of the issues under that statute relating to the tax scheme were left to the jury, but the rejection of the Crown’s argument in the present case does not depend upon the accuracy of that information. 
     
      
       
      
    25 The accused (the respondent to the appeal) did not present any further specific arguments as to why the issue of whether the private rulings were arguably wrong was for the judge rather than the jury. Rather, the accused’s argument was that, because it was for the judge and not the jury to decide, the law would be brought into public disrepute if it permitted the judge to decide such an important issue in the case, one which may effectively decide the whole case. We agree with Mason P that this argument should be rejected as untenable. 
     
      
       
      
    26 It is for these reasons that we are of the opinion that whether an arguable case exists that the private rulings were wrong is a fact in issue in the trial to be determined by the jury.  
     
      
       
        
       Evidence admissible in relation to this issue 
        
       
      
    27 Related to this issue as to whether the decision is one for the judge or the jury is the admissibility of evidence upon which the decision is to be based. In our opinion, but subject to the Crown being permitted to enlarge its particulars in the light of the decision now given by the Court of Criminal Appeal, there is no bar to the admission of relevant statements by courts or others as to the interpretation of these provisions merely because they may have come into existence after the time when the private rulings were made. What the law was at that time is an objective matter which the Crown must prove. That objective fact has nothing to do with any state of mind on the part of the accused which may be relevant to his mens rea. There is therefore no need to restrict the admissible material to material which was in existence at that relevant time. The issue as to what the law was at the relevant time may be proved by reference to what has since been held to be the law, provided that there has been no change in the relevant statutory provisions in the meantime. It is presumed to have been the law all along.  
     
      
       
      
    28 Although the Crown, on its particulars, does not propose to rely on expert evidence concerning this fact in issue, such would be admissible. The ultimate issue rule has been abolished by s 80 of the Evidence Act 1995, and the jury may be greatly assisted by such evidence. There is one caveat to the use to be made of opinion evidence on this issue. That evidence should, so far as is possible, be expressed as being that the Commissioner’s case on deductibility and/or fringe benefits tax was or was not correct, rather than that it was or was not arguable.  
     
      
       
      
    29 Mason P has outlined the evidence relied upon by the Crown to establish the proposition that the “arguably wrong” test could be satisfied. It is unnecessary to repeat the material here. It is sufficient to say that, for the purposes of an application for a permanent stay, the material referred to is sufficient to give rise to a real issue as to whether or not the risk to the revenue was such that the Commonwealth was in fact deprived of something of value. We do not, however, intend by these remarks to suggest that the trial judge — particularly in the light of such evidence to the contrary on which the accused may wish to rely in this regard — would not be entitled to form his own judgment on the issue of law we have identified in pars 12 and 17, supra, namely whether or not the case to be put by the Commissioner is sufficiently arguable to demonstrate the possibility that the Commissioner would win a case in which he was allowed to dispute the private ruling. 
     
      
       
      
    30 MASON P: The Director of Public Prosecutions for the Commonwealth appeals against the order of Sully J made on 21 February 2005 permanently staying proceedings on a particular count in a proposed indictment. The charge is brought pursuant to s 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
         A person who defrauds the Commonwealth or a public authority under the Commonwealth is guilty of an indictable offence. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
        
       
      
    31 The broad factual basis of the Crown case was described by the Chief Justice in earlier proceedings in the following terms (Wills v Petroulias (2003) 58 NSWLR 598 at 600): 
     
      
       
        
         
         3 Between 1997 and 1999 the Opponent held office in the Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”). In September 1998 he became First Assistant Commissioner. The Crown alleges that at the time of such employment the Opponent was also involved in the planning, promotion and implementation of tax schemes with certain other persons and that he used his position as an officer of the ATO to facilitate favourable Advance Opinions and Private Binding Rulings issued by the ATO. 
         
        
        
         
         4. Private Rulings are issued under Pt IVAA of the  
         Taxation Administration Act  
         1953 (Cth) 
         .  
         The scheme of Private Binding Rulings is as follows:  
          
           
           • A person may apply to the Commissioner for a ruling as to how a tax law would apply to the person in relation to an arrangement (s14ZAF).  
            
           • The Commissioner is obliged to comply with an application for such a ruling, subject to certain exemptions (s14ZAL(1) and s14ZAN).  
            
           • There are circumstances, not presently material, in which a Commissioner may decline to make a ruling (s14ZAQ).  
            
           • A ruling given in this manner is binding by force of statute (s170BB of the  
           Income Tax Assessment Act  
           1936 (Cth). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         5 The Opponent and his partners established a business known as the Productivity Incentive Corporation (“PIC”) which, inter alia, applied for Private Binding Rulings with respect to tax schemes described as Employee Benefit Arrangements (“EBAs”). In general terms the EBAs involved the payment by an employer of monies into a trust fund. The trust would lend money to individual employees for the purpose of purchasing units in the trust. The income of the trust would enure to the benefit of nominated employees. The eligibility of the employees to receive returns on the units would depend on continued service with the employer and the attainment of productivity or performance standards. The corpus would eventually vest in favour of the employee. The purpose of these arrangements was said to be to encourage employees to remain with their employer and also to act as an incentive for such employees to become more productive.  
         
        
        
         
         6 As is usually the case, the taxation treatment of the cash flows was of critical significance to the commercial viability of the arrangements. It was always accepted that each employee would be assessable on his or her share of income of the trust. Four issues arose:  
          
           
           • Would the employer’s contributions be deductible at the time they were made?  
            
           • Would the employer be liable for fringe benefit tax under the  
           Fringe Benefit Tax Assessment Act  
           1986 (Cth) with respect to its contributions?  
            
           • Would the general anti-avoidance provisions found in Pt IVA of the  
           Income Tax Assessment Act  
           apply to the scheme?  
            
           • Would the employee be assessable on the value of the units in the trust that each acquired?  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         7 The Crown case was that the Opponent used his position to ensure that officers under his direction issued favourable rulings with respect to applications made by the joint venture in which he had a financial interest. This was in contrast with the Opponent’s intervention with respect to applications by other promoters of similar schemes, in the case of which he allegedly intervened to ensure that favourable rulings were not given. Indeed, the Crown contended that the Opponent was involved in the preparation and publication of a Public Ruling in which the ATO indicated a view opposed to the efficacy of the EBAs.  
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    32 The favourable rulings issued at the respondent’s instigation assisted the taxpayers who were “Rulees” (an ATO expression) on two matters of continuing relevance, the deductibility of the employer’s contributions, and the absence of liability to fringe benefits tax (FBT). 
     
      
       
      
    33 A brief chronology of earlier proceedings provides the background to the present appeal: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          24 March 2000  
          Respondent first charged. The original charge of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth was subsequently amended to include a s29D charge 
          
          
          November 2001-June 2002 
          36-day committal hearing 
          
          
          17 July 2002  
          Respondent committed for trial on three charges, including a s29D charge. 
          
          
          16 December 2002 
          Simpson J granted leave to appeal against the committal order on the basis of errors of law (see Petroulias v Wills [2002] NSWSC 1190, 51 ATR 564, 174 FLR 258) 
          
          
          3 March 2003 
          Simpson J allowed appeal and quashed the order for committal on s29D charge (see Petroulias v Wills [2003] NSWSC 106, 138 A Crim R 182) 
          
          
          3 October 2003  
          Court of Appeal set aside Simpson J's orders and dismissed appeal to Supreme Court (see Wills v Petroulias [2003] NSWCA 286, 58 NSWLR 598 (""Petroulias (No 1)"")) 
          
          
          22 December 2003 
          Court of Appeal varied its orders, remitting the case to a magistrate to make the order of committal authorised by law and to amend the order [for committal] accordingly (see Wills v Petroulias [2003] NSWCA 390. 58 NSWLR 598 (“Petroulias (No 2)”) at 618)

          16 August 2004 
          Sperling J dismissed appeal against committal order (see Petroulias v Wills [2004) NSWSC 739) 
          
          
          7 February 2005  
          Date originally fixed for trial before Sully J 
          
         
        
        
       
      
    34 In Petroulias (No 1) and (No 2) the reasons of the Court of Appeal were given by Spigelman CJ. Handley JA and Santow JA agreed with the Chief Justice. 
     
      
       
        
       The changing forms of the s29D count 
        
       
      
    35 The s29D count has undergone several transformations, both as to its form and the case sought to be proved under it. 
     
      
       
      
    36 The history down to Petroulias (No 1) in the Court of Appeal was outlined by the Chief Justice (emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         12 The charge before the magistrate, which remained the basis of the proceedings at the time that the leave application was heard by Simpson J, was in the following terms:  
          
           
           “That between about 1 September 1997 and 17 February 1999 Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias, also known as Nick Petroulias, did defraud the Commonwealth, namely the Australian Taxation Office contrary to s29D of the  
           Crimes Act  
           1914 in that, while an officer of the Australian Taxation Office he did, by dishonest means,  
           assist taxpayers to avoid the payment of taxation 
           .” 
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
         13 The two particulars originally given of this charge were as follows:  
          
           
           “While an officer of the Australian Taxation Office involved in the regulation of tax avoidance arrangements, in breach of his duty he 
            
             
             (a) was involved in devising, promoting and implementing tax avoidance arrangements known as employee benefit arrangements; and 
              
             (b) facilitated the issue by the Australian Taxation Office of favourable Advance Opinions and Private Binding Rulings to taxpayers entering into such arrangements.” 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
         14 Further particulars of dishonesty were sought and supplied. No particulars of the element of deprivation were sought. 
         
        
        
         
         15 An issue arose in the course of the hearing before Simpson J as to whether or not the charge, as originally formulated, required the Crown to establish an actual loss of revenue. During the course of the hearing those appearing for the Crown, whilst rejecting the proposition that the charge was capable of such an interpretation, nevertheless put forward an alternative charge formulated in the following terms:  
          
           
           “Between about 1 September 1997 and 27 February 1999 Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias, did defraud the Commonwealth, namely the Australian Taxation Office, in that, while an officer of the Australian Taxation Office, he did, by dishonest means,  
           assist taxpayers to endeavour to avoid the payment of tax 
           .” 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
          
         
         
         16 In the submissions to this Court, the Crown put its case in another formulation. It alleged that the Opponent had “put the interests of the Commonwealth at risk”. It may be that the concept of ‘risk’ or ‘imperilment’ in this formulation was what was sought to be conveyed by the word “endeavour” in the reformulated charge.  
         
        
        
         
         17 During the course of the hearing before Simpson J the Crown case was expressed in a third way, although this version was never reduced to the terms of a formal charge. Her Honour recorded the Crown position at a number of points in her first judgment of 16 December 2002 in terms of the loss of the “opportunity to litigate”.  
         
        
        
         
         18 For example, after referring to submissions that the element of defrauding could arise where the Commonwealth’s revenue was “put at risk, prejudicially affected, or ‘imperilled’”, her Honour said at [38]:  
          
           
           “The consequence … is that the Commissioner was deprived of the opportunity to test, by adjudication in a court, the correctness of the views expressed in the rulings. Once the ruling was given, the employer and employees were safe from the imposition of taxation of the kinds the subject of the rulings. This was so whether or not curial adjudication of the issues involved would have resulted in a favourable decision for the taxpayer. What the Crown proposes to prove was ‘imperilled’ by the applicant’s dishonest conduct was its opportunity to litigate the effectiveness of the schemes or plans.” 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    37 The Chief Justice added the following comment (id at [19]): 
     
      
       
        
         
         19 I note that the Crown did not at any time formulate the element of deprivation in terms of “deceiving public officers into committing a breach of duty”. This has considerable support in the authorities. (See e.g. 
          R v Bassey 
          (1931) 22 Cr App R 160 at 162;  
         Board of Trade v Owen 
          [1957] AC 602 at 622;  
         R v Withers 
          [1975] AC 842 at 877 (see below [1974] 1 QB 414 at 420);  
         Wai Yu-tsang 
          [1992] 1 AC 269 at 277;  
         Peters v The Queen 
          (1998) 192 CLR 493 at [74]). This effect was once expressed in terms of “deceiving a person responsible for a public duty into doing something that he would not have done but for the deceit” ( 
         R v Terry 
          [1984] 1 AC 374 at 379). The Crown case in these proceedings did not rely on any such loss or disadvantage. 
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    38 Later in his reasons in Petroulias (No 1) the Chief Justice said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         50 As indicated above, Simpson J formed the view that the charge as originally formulated, i.e. “… did, by dishonest means, assist taxpayers to avoid the payment of taxation” was such as to allege that the Commonwealth did, as a matter of fact, lose revenue. The Crown submission to her Honour, repeated in this Court, was that the use of the word “to” in the phrase “to avoid the payment of tax” did not carry any implication that tax was in fact avoided, but simply put tax payers, to repeat the submission exactly, “in a position to endeavour to minimise their taxation liabilities.” It was in order to make this proposition clear that the Crown introduced the words “to endeavour to” in the alternative formulation of the charge.  
         
        
       
       
        
         
         51 It was, of course, always open to the Commonwealth to particularise an actual loss of revenue as the relevant deprivation for the purposes of the offence of “defrauding”. In my opinion, the specific and unusual use of the word “to” in the sense of “to endeavour to”, was not the natural meaning of the original charge. At the very least, it is so ambiguous as to be inappropriate for the formulation of an indictable offence. In my view, her Honour was correct to conclude that the charge as originally formulated presented a Crown case to the effect that revenue had in fact been lost. There was no evidence of any such loss.  
          
          
         Alternative Formulations 
          
         52 The alternative charge contains difficulties of its own in the use of the word “endeavour” and the word “avoid”. Without commenting on the terminology, the Crown invokes a line of authority to the effect that it was sufficient for the purposes of the element of deprivation in a defrauding charge to establish a “risk” or some form of “imperilment” or of “prejudice” to an economic interest of the Commonwealth. It was this approach which, her Honour concluded, required the Crown to adduce some evidence that the Private Rulings were at least arguably wrong. She concluded that it had not done so.  
         
        
        
         
         53 The third way the Crown put its case was variously described in terms of a “right to litigate” or as the deprivation of “the opportunity to test the correctness of the views by adjudication”. Her Honour rejected this approach to the Crown case on the basis that any such ‘right’ or ‘opportunity’ must be shown to have been of some value in the same way as her Honour rejected the previous formulation, i.e. there had to be evidence of an arguable case that the Rulings were wrong. 
          
         
        
       
      
    39 For reasons contained in Petroulias (No 2), the Court of Appeal remitted the matter for further committal. The Court described the arguability of the FBT issue and the arguability of deductibility as matters yet to be resolved (see 626[49] and 629[67]. See also Petroulias (No 1) at 612[59], [62]).  
     
      
       
      
    40 At that stage further versions of the count were discussed, but the Court decided that it should not settle the form of the indictment (see Petroulias (No 2) at [69]). 
     
      
       
      
    41 In early 2004 the Crown Prosecutor reformulated the charge once more. It became (emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         18 Between about 1 September 1997 and 27 February 1999 Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias did defraud the Commonwealth namely the Australian Taxation Office, in that while an officer of the Australian Taxation Office he did by dishonest means cause Private Binding Rulings and Advance Opinions to issue to taxpayers  
         whereby the Commissioner of Taxation was prejudiced in relation to his rights, interests, opportunity or advantages to determine the taxation consequences of the arrangements referred to in the Rulings and Opinions 
         . 
          
          
         
        
       
       
      
    42 The respondent was committed for trial on such a charge on 24 March 2004. As indicated, his appeal against that order was dismissed by Sperling J on 16 August 2004. 
     
      
       
      
    43 The proposed indictment tendered by the Prosecutor to Sully J earlier this month contains a different formulation, as follows (emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Between about 1 September 1997 and 27 February 1999, Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias did defraud the Commonwealth, in that while an officer of the Australian Taxation Office,  
         he did put the revenue of the Commonwealth at risk  
         by causing Private Binding Rulings and Advance Opinions to issue to taxpayers, by dishonest means. 
         
        
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
      
    44 This is the portion of the criminal proceedings that has been permanently stayed by the order under appeal. 
     
      
       
        
       Different species of deprivation 
        
       
      
    45 The focus of the proceedings in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and now in this Court has at all times been the element of “loss” or “disadvantage” in the offence of “defrauding the Commonwealth”. As Spigelman CJ observed in Petroulias (No 1) at [8]: 
     
      
       
        
         
         It is not enough to establish a fraud. Someone must have been defrauded. 
         
        
        
       
      
    46 The “someone” has always been the Commonwealth and/or the Australian ATO. But of what has the Commonwealth or ATO been defrauded? The several manifestations of the s29D count have endeavoured to answer this question, thereby hopefully setting the scene for the factual contest at the trial. 
     
      
       
      
    47 In Petroulias (No 1), the Chief Justice pointed to the availability of different species of loss/imperilment/prejudice. One species or variant was the proposition that a charge of defrauding can be made out by putting the property or rights of a person at risk or imperilling them or prejudicing them in some way (see eg R v Kastratovic (1985) 42 SASR 59 at 62, Peters v The Queen (1998) 192 CLR 493 at 508[30], 525[73]-[74], 529[84], 552[138], MacLeod v The Queen (2003) 214 CLR 230 at 241[35], Petroulias (No 1) at 611[54]). This is the species invoked in the final version of the count, with “the revenue of the Commonwealth” being identified as the particular interest imperilled. 
     
      
       
      
    48 However, the charge on which the respondent was committed for trial on 24 March 2004 described the Commissioner of Taxation’s imperilment as prejudice in relation to his rights, interests, opportunity or advantages to determine the taxation consequences of the arrangements referred to in the Rulings or Opinions issued by the respondent. This different species of prejudice was discussed in Petroulias (No 1) at [63]-[79] under the heading Opportunity lost. The Chief Justice summarised that concept as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         63 The Crown also relied on an element of deprivation expressed in terms of a loss of an opportunity to test the views expressed in the rulings by adjudication or of an opportunity to litigate. The issue that arises in this respect is whether or not the element of detriment in a charge of defrauding can be made out on the basis of a loss of opportunity to determine a matter, which is an open question and about which a bona fide belief favourable to a person is held by that person. If that is sufficient, then it is not, in my opinion, necessary to establish in a positive way that the Commonwealth had an arguable case.  
         
        
       
       
        
         
         64 It was the loss of the ability to argue the case, by the mandatory operation of s170BB of the  
         Income Tax Assessment Act 
          1936 (Cth) which gave the Private Rulings binding force, as distinct from the possibility of winning the case that was, on this approach, the relevant deprivation. It is only if reliance is place on the possibility of winning a case, that establishing an arguable case could be an essential part of the Crown case in proceedings under s29D. 
         
        
       
      
    49 As indicated in the final sentence of the two paragraphs just quoted, this lost opportunity to litigate approach did not require proof that the rulings were arguably wrong. It would suffice if they put to rest a genuine dispute (see Petroulias (No 1) esp at [71]-[72]). Adverting to the material placed before the magistrate at the original committal, the Chief Justice said:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
         56 The Crown pointed to the evidence, presented to her Honour and this Court in summary form, which indicated that strong views had been expressed within the ATO that the regime would apply; that the Opponent himself had actively promoted that opinion with respect to the consideration within the ATO of Private Rulings sought for EBA schemes, other than those in which the Opponent had a financial interest; that the Opponent actively promoted a Public Ruling to the effect that the schemes did not work in terms of their fringe benefits tax implications and that a Public Ruling to that effect was in fact issued. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         … 
          
          
         78 In my opinion, there was evidence before the magistrate which established that there was a “genuine dispute”, to use the language of King CJ in  
         Kastratovic 
         , or that the Commissioner was “genuinely asserting” a position, to use the language of Toohey and Gaudron JJ in  
         Peters 
         . The element of “genuineness” was established on the basis of the contrary opinions expressed, the contrary rulings made and the circumstances and manner in which they were made. 
         
        
        
         
         79 On this basis, there was material before the magistrate which entitled her to conclude that there was “evidence … capable of satisfying a jury beyond reasonable doubt” (within s41(2) of the  
         Justices Act 
          1902) and that there was “a reasonable prospect that a jury would convict the defendant” (within s41(6)). 
          
          
         
        
       
      
    50 When the matter returned to the magistrate after Petroulias (No 2), Sweeney LCM ordered committal on a lost opportunity to litigate charge because she regarded the Court of Appeal’s decision about the evidence binding on her. She added that it accorded with her own view of the evidence previously given (see extracts from her reasons set out in the judgment of Sperling J in Petroulias v Wills [2004] NSWSC 739 at [22]-[25]). 
     
      
       
      
    51 One might be excused for thinking that the stage was now set for the trial.  
     
      
       
      
    52 However, the Crown Prosecutor later recast the count in a materially significant manner. 
     
      
       
        
       The s29D charge now proffered and its supporting particulars and evidence 
        
       
      
    53 As indicated above, the charge now proffered reads (emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Between about 1 September 1997 and 27 February 1999, Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias did defraud the Commonwealth, in that while an officer of the Australian Taxation Office,  
         he did put the revenue of the Commonwealth at risk by 
           
         causing Private Binding Rulings and Advance Opinions to issue to taxpayers, by dishonest means 
         . 
         
        
        
       
      
    54 By departing from the “lost opportunity” to litigate formulation, this latest form of the count drew back down upon the prosecutor’s shoulders the need to establish that the revenue was actually put at risk. At various stages this has been referred to as the second of the three categories of deprivation mentioned by Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Peters v The Queen (1998) 192 CLR 493 when they said (at 508[30], citations omitted, numbers inserted):  
     
      
       
        
         
         Ordinarily, however, fraud involves the intentional creation of a situation in which one person [1] deprives another of money or property or [2] puts the money or property of that other person at risk or [3] prejudicially affects that person in relation to “some lawful right, interest, opportunity or advantage”, knowing that he or she has no right to deprive that person of that money or property or to prejudice his or her interests. 
         
        
       
      
    55 Senior counsel for the appellant confirmed that the present count is to be understood this way, both before Sully J (Tr 17/02/05 p321) and in this Court. 
     
      
       
      
    56 The Crown Case Statement that has been provided offers Particulars of the prosecution case with reference to the Evidence said to support each Particular. I imply no criticism when I observe that this information sometimes addresses the defrauding (actus reus) and the dishonesty (mens rea) arms simultaneously. This overlap reflects the reality of a Crown case of this nature, where dishonesty is sought to be inferred from the conduct proven. 
     
      
       
      
    57 Particular A(ii) states: 
     
      
       
        
         
         PBRs are issued pursuant to Part IVAA of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 and are binding on the Commissioner of Taxation, provided the factual circumstances specified in the application for the ruling are put into effect. AO’s are also issued by the ATO but are without statutory authority, however the Commissioner considers himself as administratively bound by the decision of the AO. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
        
       
      
    58 Section N of the Statement deals with Financial Harm. This item is summarised with the averment: 
     
      
       
        
         
         The action of Petroulias put the economic interests of the Commonwealth at risk – imperilment. 
         
        
        
       
      
    59 The detailed Particulars are: 
     
      
       
        
         
         N(i) As a result of the favourable rulings issued the taxpayers who received them and implemented the arrangements in the manner described in the applications, were in a position to lodge returns declaring their income and deductions consistent with the rulings, and were thereby entitled to expect Notices of Assessment issued by the ATO in accordance with the rulings and the returns submitted. The Commissioner of Taxation lost the advantage of independently assessing the tax returns because of the rulings, and was precluded from taking appropriate action to ensure that any further tax which might otherwise have been assessed, was paid. 
         
        
        
         
         N(ii) Similarly, as a result of the Advance Opinions being issued taxpayers were able to take advantage of the protocol applied by the Commissioner of Taxation regarding the AOs as administratively binding upon him, so that the Commissioner of Taxation again lost the advantage of independently assessing the tax returns, and proceeding to take appropriate action to ensure that any further tax assessed, was paid. 
         
        
        
         
         N(iii) Petroulias endeavoured to achieve the same advantage for other taxpayers who entered into similar arrangements, but without the benefit of a PBR or AO, by endeavouring to create a situation where by virtue of the number of favourable rulings and AOs issued to taxpayers entering into the arrangements, the Commissioner of Taxation would also regard himself as administratively bound to follow the precedents for those taxpayers. 
         
        
        
         
         N(iv) In each case, the revenue of the Commonwealth was at risk because of the prejudice to the right or advantage of the Commissioner of Taxation to otherwise act without restriction to assess and recover any tax payable. 
         
        
        
         
         N(v) The PBRs and AOs issued at the direction of Petroulias were arguably wrong. 
         
        
        
       
      
    60 Senior Counsel for the appellant informed this Court that N(v) is a particular of N(iv) (CCA Tr p2). There is potential latent ambiguity in this observation, if not in the count thus understood. It is possible that the Crown wishes to prove N(v) is an aggravating element of the offence, if only for sentencing purposes. It is also possible that the Crown perceived that proof that the private rulings were “arguably wrong” was an essential element of the count as presently formed. So long as N(v) remains an element of the Crown case the charge in the count stands to be dismissed if it is not established. 
     
      
       
      
    61 The Evidence referable to Particular N(v) is said to be: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “See evidence from H(i) and H(v);  
         Essenbourne 
           
         Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation; 
          Ingersoll April 04 
         . 
         ” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    62 I discuss Essenbourne below. But it should be stated at the outset that (the reasons for) a Federal Court decision are not themselves evidence. Nothing to the contrary was stated in Petroulias (No 1) or (No 2), which went no further than pointing to that decision as a well from which to draw ideas that might become the basis of admissible evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    63 We were informed that “Ingersoll April 04” is an inapt reference for Particular N(v). It deals with the financial consequences of the rulings in question. 
     
      
       
      
    64 The critical evidence for Particular N(v) is therefore the cross reference “See evidence for H(i) and H(v)”. 
     
      
       
      
    65 Particular H avers generally: 
     
      
       
        
         
         Petroulias facilitated the issue of favourable AOs and PBRs to taxpayers using the PIC scheme knowing that the AOs and PBRs were contrary to his view of the ATO policy. 
         
        
        
       
      
    66 Sub-particulars H(i) and H(v) and the Evidence relating to them read are follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          H(i) Early in March 1998 Lowman Chow advised Petroulias of his view that Fringe Benefits Tax (“FBT”) applied to the EBT schemes, and on 25 March 1998 Chow provided Petroulias with a paper entitled “Initial Opinion – Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”)” to the effect that FBT applied to EBT schemes. Petroulias advised Chow that the view expressed by him would be the ATO view.

    67 Particulars I, J and K should also be referred to. They state: 
     
      
       
        
         
         I. Petroulias used his position in the ATO to disadvantage promoters of similar EBT schemes: 
         
        
        
         
         J. Petroulias used his position in the ATO to detect threats to the continued marketing of the schemes and to devise new schemes to be promoted and implemented pursuant to the aforesaid arrangement: 
         
        
        
         
         K. The Commissioner was deprived of the opportunity to evaluate the potential tax implications of these schemes. 
         
        
        
       
      
    68 The evidence said to support sub-particulars H(i) and H(v) was placed before Sully J and we were taken to it. It discloses the following (in summary): 
     
      
       
        
       (i) On 16 January 1998 a letter was sent to the Commissioner on behalf of Morgan H R Pty Ltd (MHR) requesting a private ruling in relation to the taxation implications associated with a Productivity Incentive Trust Plan which MHR proposed to establish. The letter outlined the structure of the Plan. It asserted the belief  
        
        
         
         (a) that MHR would be entitled to an immediate deduction for the amounts contributed by it to the unit trust in respect of participating employees; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) no FBT liability to MHR would arise in respect of the issue of units in the trust. 
         
        
        
         
         This application is said to be typical of 74 applications all of which resulted in identical favourable treatment at the respondent’s hands. 
         
        
        
       (ii) MHR was a company associated with Mr Morgan. The prosecution will seek to prove that Mr Morgan was an associate of the respondent and that the respondent’s dishonesty was evidenced by the steps he took to obtain a favourable private ruling in favour of MHR and other associates willing to enter into dishonest arrangements with him. The prosecution will also seek to establish that “competitors” were given unfavourable rulings at the respondent’s instigation in circumstances where there was no legitimate basis for distinguishing between the schemes laid before the Commissioner by the respective applicants for the rulings (see Particulars I and J above). 
        
        
       (iii) On 25 March 1998 Mr Lowman Chow, who was an officer of the ATO, provided the respondent with a written opinion in relation to Employee Benefits Trusts (see Particular H(i) above). The opinion refers to the steps of  
       “a typical EBT” 
        (Employee Benefits Trust). The Crown will seek to prove that the matters summarised by Mr Chow are in fact indistinguishable from those placed before the Commissioner of Taxation in MHR’s application for a private ruling. 
        
        
         
         Mr Chow expressed the view that FBT liability would arise. This opinion was supported by detailed legal reasoning and reference to the opinion of a professor set out in detail in the memorandum. 
         
        
        
       (iv) An email from the respondent dated 15 April 1998 to another officer in the ATO expressed the respondent’s own views as to the tax effects of a scheme which was the subject of an application for a private ruling. The applicant in this case was not an associate of Morgan or the respondent, on the Crown case. However, the basic elements of the scheme were identical to those outlined in the MHR proposal, according to the prosecution. The respondent expressed himself as having reached a  
       “conclusion” 
        that fringe benefits tax was payable and that there were  
       “also problems with deductibility” 
       . The respondent’s reasons for each view are set out. They included express incorporation and adoption of the opinion of Mr Chow. 
        
        
       (v) The Crown also relies on an internal email from the respondent dated 1 June 1998. It is addressed to another officer within the ATO. Once again it is said to concern an application for a ruling on behalf of a  
       “promoter of [a] similar EBT scheme”, 
        not being one of the respondent’s associates. The Crown will seek to show that the circumstances of that “competitor” scheme are indistinguishable from those of the MHR scheme. 
        
        
       (vi) At various dates in 1998 the respondent is said to have assisted in the issuance of several rulings favourable to taxpayers on both the deductibility and FBT issues (Particulars H (iv) – (vii)). 
        
        
       (vii) This Court was informed that the Crown will seek to establish that 74 taxpayers were given favourable private rulings due to the respondent’s intervention. It is said that the information on which each ruling was given was identical in substance. In each instance the ruling was favourable to the taxpayer as regards the deductibility and FBT issues. The rulings enabled the taxpayers to claim the avoidance of tax, this in effect being the actual risk to which the Revenue was subjected by virtue of the respondent’s conduct. 
        
        
       (viii) There is also evidence to the effect that these particular rulings favourable to taxpayers had a certain “precedential” effect, at least in favour of persons associated with particular schemes for which favourable rulings emerged. If necessary, the tax advantages claimed or obtained by these persons are also part of the  
       “actual risk to the revenue” 
        case that the prosecution will seek to prove. 
        
        
       Sully J’s reasons 
       
      
    69 The learned primary judge first addressed and rejected a stay application based on a concatenation of alleged and mainly procedural deficits. These were complaints about absence of particulars, duplicity within the s29D count, unmanageability of the Crown case, failure to identify evidence, decisions not to call key witnesses, delay and problems of admissibility of vital evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    70 This part of his Honour’s reasons has only peripheral relevance to this appeal. There is nothing in the nature of a notice of contention whereby the respondent contends that the order for a permanent stay should be upheld on bases other than those ultimately accepted by the primary judge. 
     
      
       
      
    71 But before I pass from this section of his Honour’s reasons I record that the judge observed that the Crown Prosecutor, Mr Hastings SC, effectively pinned the Crown case to the particulars and evidence detailed in the Crown Case Statement. His Honour rejected the submission that a trial in accordance with that case was unmanageable. 
     
      
       
      
    72 The second and ultimately dispositive part of the judge’s reasons began by referring to the caselaw about the concept of defrauding. Passages from Peters and Kastratovic were cited.  
     
      
       
      
    73 Sully J described the evolution of the s29D count as “a history of unfortunate vacillation”. However, he stated the true question in the application to be whether the charge as finally formulated was foredoomed to fail. 
     
      
       
      
    74 The judge construed the present charge as requiring proof of actual or real risk to the revenue, “being a risk unqualified by notions of lost opportunities of whatsoever kind”. In other words, this was not to be determined on the basis of the principles discussed in Petroulias (No 1) at [63]ff under the heading Opportunity lost. As indicated, this reading of the count correctly understood the way that the prosecution now intends to run its case. 
     
      
       
      
    75 His Honour said that the two judgments of the Court of Appeal required proof in the present situation that it was at least arguable that the relevant rulings were wrong. He continued: 
     
      
       
        
         
         What does “wrong” mean in such a context? I should have thought that it cannot sensibly mean something other than wrong in law. I think further, that the notion must be one of a ruling arguably wrong in law at the time at which the ruling issued. 
         
        
        
         
         What does that conclusion entail in terms of the doing of justice in the projected trial? I think it entails a number of things, leaving aside of course, the further but discrete questions of dishonest means and dishonest intent. 
         
        
        
         
         Firstly, and obviously, it entails that the Crown must be able to establish that at the time of the issue of the relevant rulings, there was on foot a real dispute as to the correctness in law of the substance of the rulings. That seems to me to raise a question of fact; and I accept for present purposes that the Crown is in a position to adduce evidenced which it would be proper to leave to the jury on the point. 
         
        
        
        But where, it must then be asked, is the jury to go from there? To prove no more than that the rulings were controversial within the Taxation Office does not seem to me, just as it did not seem to Simpson J, to prove that the rulings were arguably wrong in law. Such a conclusion could not be reached on any rational basis that did not entail a critical and informed look at the substance of the competing views about the correctness in law of the rulings; and, moreover, an objective critical and informed look. 
        
        
         
         The question thus posed is, obviously I should have thought, a question of law for the trial Judge, and not a question of fact for the jury. That consideration seems to me to raise a very troubling prospect in connection with the projected trial. That prospect can be put in the form of the question: what is the trial Judge to direct the jury upon the particular aspect of the proofs necessary to make out the Crown case? 
         
        
        
         
         It would be relatively straightforward to direct the jury as to their need to make the obvious findings of foundational facts: that is to say, are they satisfied that at the time when each of the relevant rulings was issued, there was within the Taxation Office genuine controversy as to the correctness in law of the rulings? 
         
        
        
         
         The only way in which I can see that the trial Judge might then move forward in the directions to the jury, would be for the Judge to instruct the jurors that they must proceed upon the footing that, if they should find those foundational facts in the affirmative and to the requisite standard, then they were directed as a matter of law that the arguments in favour of incorrectness were at least arguably correct in law. 
         
        
        
         
         That does not seem to me to be a sustainable approach, for the reason that it does not tell the jury, with the authority of the Court, what some relevant aspect of the law actually is. It is, of course, always possible that a trial Judge will misdirect a jury upon some relevant matter of law. When that happens, and the Court of Criminal Appeal is persuaded to intervene, the necessary correction is administered, broadly speaking, upon the basis either that the Judge has misconceived what the relevant law actually is; or that he has correctly discerned the law, but has misapplied it in its directed application to the possible jury findings of fact. 
         
        
        
         
         In the present case, the trial Judge is to be faced with a requirement, not to instruct the jury as to the actual state of the relevant law; but to form an opinion as to what the law might be supposed to have been at the relevant time, so as to proceed to a further conclusion that the relevant contra arguments were arguably correct; and then to instruct the jury that the opinion of the Judge upon that highly controversial question is to become their opinion. 
         
        
        
         
         I have considered whether the conundrum might be resolved by the calling of expert evidence. It seems to me, however, that the provisions of the  
         Evidence Act 
          (supra) are to the contrary, for those provisions are directed to the proof of questions of fact. There is a specific exception in the case of foreign law: s 174; but even that exception does not extend to the admission of allegedly expert evidence as to the correct application to the relevant facts of the particular case of the foreign law as proved by the permitted means. 
         
        
        
         
         I have kept in mind throughout this discussion the observation of the Chief Justice that important public interests are involved in the applicant’s prosecution. I have been similarly mindful, too, of his Honour’s reminder that it is not for a trial Judge to settle, or to seek to influence the formulation of, or otherwise to dictate the form of, a proposed count in an indictment. 
         
        
        
         
         Because of those considerations I am, to speak frankly, reluctant to stay the proposed proceedings on the projected first count. But the more I have thought about the practical problems as I have been discussing them, the more I have come to the conclusion this is a case in which a stay should be ordered. 
         
        
        
         
         It seems to me that it cannot be correct in principle to allow a trial to proceed, when something essential to the proof of the Crown case entails the making of a value judgment which raises neither a true issue of fact for the jury, nor a true question of law for the Judge. It is regrettable that the situation of the present matter has come to such a pass; but in my opinion that is the case, and, given the troublesome history to date of the formulation of the s 29D charge, it seems to me that it is time to say, with whatever feeling of dissatisfaction, that enough is enough. 
         
        
        
         
         I order therefore that the proceedings on the proposed count based on s 29D of the  
         Commonwealth Crimes Act 
          be stayed permanently 
         . 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    76 It may be observed that this did not address the issue earlier stated by the judge as to whether the charge was foredoomed to fail. The nub of the dispositive reasoning was that a fair or just trial could not take place because of the inability to direct the jury that the “arguments in favour of incorrectness [of the private rulings] were at least arguably correct in law”. 
     
      
       
        
       Issues in the appeal 
        
       
      
    77 The appellant submits that the prosecution of the s29D count should not have been stayed permanently on the grounds applied by Sully J or at all. It is submitted that the judge failed to apply the “foredoomed to failure” test enunciated earlier in his reasons. It is further submitted that the passage set out above relating to the “conundrum” involved in proof that the private rulings were wrong or arguably wrong disclosed a number of particular errors. The issue did not, as his Honour stated, entail “the making of a value judgment which raises neither a true issue of fact for the jury, nor a true question of law for the judge”. 78 The Crown further submitted that there was ample material capable of establishing the “arguably wrong” element of the Crown case and/or informing the judicial mind to put it in a position to instruct the jury as to the true legal position. I have chosen the word “material” advisedly, so as not to pre-empt the question whether evidence is required on this issue.  
     
      
       
      
    79 In this Court, as below, the parties addressed the question whether the particular matter in issue is one of evidence, requiring proof and judicial instruction to the jury; or one of law, requiring judicial instruction simpliciter. 
     
      
       
      
    80 Each side put as an opening gambit the preferred submission that the issue as to the private rulings being “arguably wrong” was one of law. Here the paths diverged. According to the Crown, it followed that it was merely a question of coming up with the correct direction for the jury. This Court was invited to offer guidance to the trial judge. The appellant submitted that there was nothing peculiarly difficult about the problem: it certainly did not justify a permanent stay. 
     
      
       
      
    81 The respondent’s preferred position was also that the “arguably wrong” issue was one of law. But the ensuing problem, as identified by Mr Temby QC representing the respondent, was that the law would bring itself into disrepute if a judge told a jury that any legal matter was “arguable”. The authority of the court giving directions on other matters such as onus and standard of proof, jury unanimity etc would in some way be undermined by revealing that a state of “arguability” attended any legal matter. 
     
      
       
      
    82 I should say at once that this proposition strikes me as quite untenable. Jury directions usually relate to matters where the law is clear or where, if it is not, the lack of clarity has no relevance to the issues to be tried. In the latter situation the judge does his or her best and the directions will be subjected to appellate correction if legally erroneous. It does not follow that a trial judge cannot direct that a matter of fact or law is debatable, arguable or uncertain if it is relevant to give such an instruction. In any event, the idea that a proposition is capable of more than one answer is something frequently encountered in both life and the law. It is one that a properly instructed jury is well able to assess if it is necessary to do so. 83 It was alternatively submitted on behalf of the appellant that the Crown could establish that the rulings were “arguably wrong” by relying on the evidence of the Chow memorandum and the other material referred to above. That material reveals the opinion of officers within the ATO that, with respect to schemes said to be similar to those addressed by the respondent, the respondent’s private rulings were wrong, or at least arguably so, as regards both the deductibility and FBT issues. These documents are also said to show that the respondent himself held that view, communicating it to more junior officers in the ATO and applying it to ensure that “competitor” schemes were given rulings adverse to the taxpayer on the two tax issues. 
     
      
       
      
    84 This submission led to debate as to whether the material was capable of supporting these propositions. The respondent submitted that the material rose no higher than evidencing discussion within the ATO, what Sully J described as “no more than that the rulings were controversial within the Taxation Office”.  
     
      
       
        
       The “arguably wrong” issues 
        
       
      
    85 Section 170BB of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
         170BB Effect of private rulings on tax other than withholding tax  
          
          
         (1) In this section:  
          
          
         ""final tax"" has the same meaning as in section 170BA.  
          
          
         (2) Expressions used in this section have the same meanings as in Part IVAA of the Taxation Administration Act 1953. 
          
          
         (3) Subject to sections 170BC, 170BG and 170BH, if:  
          
          
           
           (a) there is a private ruling on the way in which an income tax law applies to a person in respect of a year of income in relation to an arrangement (  
           ruled way  
           ); and  
           
          
          
           
           (b) that law applies to that person in respect of that year in relation to that arrangement in a different way; and  
           
          
          
           
           (c) the amount of final tax under an assessment in relation to that person would (apart from this section and section 170BC) exceed what it would have been if that law applied in the ruled way;  
           
          
          
         the assessment and amount of final tax must be what they would be if that law applied in the ruled way.  
          
          
         (4) Subsection (3) applies to an assessment whether or not in respect of the year of income in paragraphs (3)(a) and (b).  
         
        
        
       
      
    86 The “binding” force of a private ruling and the manner in which it can act to the detriment of the Revenue was described in the following terms by Simpson J in her first judgment: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         15 Although there appear to be no specific provisions to this effect, I was told, without dissent, that a private ruling made in accordance with Part IVAA is regarded as binding on the Commissioner, and, indeed, in the evidence rulings were at times referred to as “private binding rulings” or “PBR’s”. The Commissioner abides by a convention to give effect to a private ruling made under the Part. The effect of that, as I understand it, is that, provided the factual circumstances are as specified in the application, the Commissioner is precluded, or regards himself as precluded, from challenging a person who acts in accordance with a ruling. Where the ruling is favourable to the applicant, the Commissioner is bound to treat any tax in question as not payable. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         16 As I understand Part IVAA, it allows for an assessment on behalf of the Commissioner of the applicability of taxation law; it is an interpretation of the operations of those laws, given in advance, to enable the person seeking the ruling to enter into arrangements with a degree of confidence about his/her/its taxation exposure. It is not conclusive in the sense that a curial adjudication is conclusive, but is an expression of the Commissioner’s view of the effect of taxation law in relation to the particular set of facts and circumstances outlined in the application. It is not intended to confer on the taxpayer any benefit except certainty, and it certainly is not intended to operate as an exemption from tax properly payable. A ruling does not alter the effect of taxation laws, but rather acts as a predictor of the outcome of a hypothetical adjudication.  
         
        
        
         
         17 A ruling is individual: that is, it applies to the particular taxpayer who makes the application, in relation to the particular set of circumstances set out in the application and in the year of taxation specified. Rulings do, however, have some precedent effect. The ATO maintains records of the rulings given, and officers asked to give a ruling to one taxpayer will have regard to previous rulings in relation to comparable cases. But a ruling in one case does not bind the Commissioner to make a similar ruling in a similar, or even identical, case, and a taxpayer making an application can have no legitimate expectation that an earlier ruling in a different case will be followed. 
          
         
        
       
      
    87 Particulars A(ii), N(i) and (ii) (set out above) endeavour to capture these aspects of private rulings. Private rulings themselves point to the legislative provisions that explain the extent to which the ruling is “legally binding on the Commissioner” (see explanatory notes to Notice of Private Ruling issued on 5 May 1998 (AB 207)). 
     
      
       
      
    88 A ruling that is incontrovertibly correct in its statement and application of the tax law could not be the instrument of defrauding the revenue, regardless of the dishonesty of the ATO officer involved. As Simpson J put it ([2002] NSWSC 1190 at [43]): 
     
      
       
        
         
         It cannot be said that a ruling which  
         correctly  
         acknowledges that, in a particular set of circumstances, a taxpayer is not liable for the imposition of a particular tax, confers any benefit upon that taxpayer, or any corresponding disadvantage upon the Commonwealth. 
         
        
       
      
    89 For the purpose of the s29D charge now proffered, the search is for a way of determining whether there was anything of value in the Commissioner’s rights to assess and recover tax as affected by the rulings and the way rulings operate in law. If the true legal position at the time was that nothing touching the revenue was lost by issuing the rulings then the charge is not capable of being made out and should be withdrawn from the jury. This would be so whether or not Particular N(v) were included. 
     
      
       
      
    90 When the proceedings were first before Simpson J the s29D count spoke in terms of “assisting taxpayers to [endeavour to] avoid the payment of tax”. 
     
      
       
      
    91 The Particulars at the time averred (in par H) that the accused “facilitated the issue of favourable (rulings) to taxpayers using the …scheme knowing the rulings were contrary to the view and policy of the ATO” (see [2002] NSWSC 1190 at [24]). [Contrast Particular H in its current form, which speaks of the respondent “knowing that the (rulings) were contrary to his view of the ATO policy”.] 
     
      
       
      
    92 Simpson J recorded that senior counsel for the Crown resisted any suggestion that it would be necessary also for the Crown to establish that the rulings were at least arguably wrong. Counsel nevertheless contended before her Honour that evidence to that effect was available if required (id at [39]). 
     
      
       
      
    93 At that stage, the count was framed in a way that make it necessary that the Crown establish that tax was in fact payable and was in fact avoided by the accused’s dishonest actions. This deficit, as pointed out by Simpson J and the Court of Appeal, led to the first of the count’s reformulations. 
     
      
       
      
    94 By the time the matter had proceeded to the Court of Appeal the count had been redrafted. Indeed, for a while it seemed that it would be further recast as an Opportunity lost variant, sometimes referred to as within the third category of the passage in the judgment of Toohey and Gaudron JJ set out above. Much of the reasoning in Petroulias (No 1) was directed at that variant, which was then the focus of Crown attention. 
     
      
       
      
    95 The Court of Appeal was at some pains to explain why something other than proof that the rulings were “arguably wrong” would suffice if the count charged imperilment of the Opportunity lost variety (see esp Petroulias (No 1) at [59], [71] – [74]). It is however fallacious to read this as adoption of an “arguably wrong” test as regards a charge that was never before the Court of Appeal. No such test was endorsed (see at [62], [64]). In Petroulias (No 2) the Court was primarily addressing an opportunity lost case. The Court was not engaged in redrafting the indictment nor in the task of considering the adequacy of the evidence to commit for trial. A fortiori, it was not involved in the exercise that confronted Sully J. 
     
      
       
      
    96 Now that the count has reached its “final” form it is useful to remind oneself that the relevant matter for ultimate proof is whether the respondent’s conduct in causing the private rulings to issue “put the revenue of the Commonwealth at risk”. This allegation of the actus reus is itself a gloss on s29D (albeit well supported by authority). It is potentially misleading to gloss the gloss by focussing on an “arguably wrong” test.  
     
      
       
      
    97 However, the “arguably wrong” issue must be addressed, for two reasons. The first stems from the proposition I stated earlier, that an incontrovertibly correct ruling could not be an event that puts the revenue at risk. To say that only arguably incorrect rulings have this consequence is an attempt to capture this idea. I perceive that this may be the thinking behind Particular N(v).  
     
      
       
      
    98 The second and possibly different way in which some kind of arguability issue intrudes is that the Crown has elected to make it part of the case, through Particular N(v). This may have been unnecessary (see par [58] above). But so long as the particular remains as an aggravating feature of the conduct charged it will require attention at trial, not necessarily by way of express jury direction. 
     
      
       
      
    99 It may be dangerous or misleading to use the same label (“arguably correct”) in these two senses, at least without confirming the prosecution’s intention in averring Particular N(v) as an aggravating feature and also confirming the meaning sought to be advanced by the Crown in this particular. 
     
      
       
      
    100 If all that is involved is arguability of the first type then it seems to me that one is only dealing with whether the count may go to the jury. If the ruling is incontrovertibly correct in law in both its tax aspects there is simply nothing capable of making out the Crown case on the s29D charge. The count should therefore be withdrawn from the jury. But, absent this situation appearing to the trial judge, the count should simply go to the jury according to its terms, without concern about directing the jury to find the rulings were “arguably wrong” (itself a mere particular). 
     
      
       
      
    101 If, however, an allegation that the rulings were arguably wrong is intended as an aggravating feature of the Crown case (ie if the Crown wants to use the concept otherwise than just in the first sense I have proposed) then an additional issue will be thrown up at the trial. How (if at all) is the jury to be instructed in this particular matter? Is it really another way of looking at the first type of arguability issue? 
     
      
       
      
    102 I return to these latter questions below. 
     
      
       
      
    103 It is pertinent to observe that the trial is yet to commence. This appeal does not exist to give preliminary advice as to evidentiary rulings. It is the defence that has assumed the high burden of seeking to establish irremediable abuse of process. The relevant category, on the reasoning of Sully J, is abuse of the nature of irremediable prejudice precluding a fair trial (Jago v District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23). 
     
      
       
      
    104 The High Court has frequently cautioned against too ready a disposition to grant permanent stays in criminal matters. Recently in Subramaniam v The Queen (2004) 79 ALJR 116 the Court said at 122[25]: 
     
      
       
        
         
         In  
         Jago v District Court (NSW) 
          Brennan J cautioned against too heavy a disposition to grant stays: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           “The reasons for granting stay orders, which are as good as certificates of immunity, would be difficult of explanation for they would be largely discretionary. If permanent stay orders were to become commonplace, it would not be long before courts would forfeit public confidence. The granting of orders for permanent stays would inspire cynicism, if not suspicion, in the public mind.” 
           
          
         
        
        
       
      
    105 Sully J did not have to decide what directions to give the jury. Nor does this Court. Naturally, any directions will have to adapt to the case as it develops in the evidence and submissions of counsel. This said, I think it is incumbent that this Court come off the fence on which the primary judge rested when posing his either/or “conundrum”.  
     
      
       
      
    106 It is productive first to go to the evidence to consider whether it is capable of supporting the particular charge. If it is, then one major plank of the stay conundrum is removed.  
     
      
       
      
    107 That evidence shows that there was, to say the least, uncertainty about the tax effects of employee benefit trust schemes throughout the time of the private rulings issued through the respondent. The application of the law relating to deductibility and FBT to these schemes was a matter of discussion within the ATO. On a clearly available view of the evidence, the ATO (to the respondent’s knowledge) had certainly not given up the ghost on these matters. Taxpayers were also apparently uncertain about the issues, evidenced by the many applications for private rulings on these very matters. 
     
      
       
      
    108 Key uncertainties were whether this type of scheme had each of the two benefits of tax deductibility of employer contributions and freedom from FBT. Mr Chow and the respondent thought not, on available readings of the respondent’s email of 15 April 1998 and of the proposals in his emails of 15 April and 1 June 1998 to give taxpayer-adverse rulings to “competitor” schemes. The legal reasons for such outcomes were canvassed in the memoranda, with citation of statute and caselaw. 
     
      
       
      
    109 This was more than an internal ATO debate about the response to give applicants for private rulings. The arguments adverse to the taxpayers’ interests that were canvassed in the internal memoranda were about the then current state of the law, its application to the facts hypothesised, and whether the ATO should accept the taxpayer-favourable views advanced by prospective “Rulees”. In my view, the documents are also evidence (if evidence is required) that the rulings issued at the respondent’s instigation had a tax impact in the sense contended for in Particulars A(ii), N(i) and N(ii). 110 If it is established that the respondent caused the issuance of the private rulings favourable to associate taxpayers on the deductibility and FBT matters, he was arming the “Rulees” with the practical and legal advantages conferred by s170BB and described by Simpson J in the passage set out above. For favoured Rulees, matters that were debatable or doubtful achieved the status of being “legally binding on the Commissioner”, with favourable tax consequences that the jury could easily conclude likely to happen. For those Rulees, the ATO was henceforth prejudiced in its capacity to otherwise act without restriction to assess and recover any tax payable (cf Particular N(iv)).  
     
      
       
      
    111 This material or evidence is capable of supporting the offence charged unless the rulings were incontrovertibly correct when issued. It is material capable of showing that the opinion was held within the ATO at the relevant time (ie, throughout 1998) that schemes arguably similar to those in question did not carry income tax deductibility for employer contributions and did carry FBT liabilities. The legal chapter and verse on FBT is set out in the email of 25 March 1998, the contents of which the respondent adopted in his email of 15 April 1998 (cf Lustre Hosiery Ltd v York (1935) 54 CLR 314). Given that perception or belief, there was in my view ample evidence or material that the ATO was giving up something of value in issuing taxpaper-favourable rulings. 
     
      
       
      
    112 If a jury accepts the evidence that the “competitor” schemes were indistinguishable as regards either or both of their deductibility or FBT aspects, the respondent’s stated opinion that these had adverse tax consequences in those two aspects is also available as evidence or material out of the respondent’s own mouth that the rulings he was procuring in support of “favoured” taxpayers did not represent the true tax position at the time.  
     
      
       
      
    113 It will ultimately be a matter for the jury to decide if there was the necessary imperilment of the revenue. In my view, the material that has been identified indicates that it would be open for a properly instructed jury to be satisfied of this. For this reason the charge is not foredoomed to failure. In other words, the rulings were “arguably wrong” in at least the first of the two ways that this issue intrudes into the case. I prefer to state the matter negatively: since the rulings were not incontrovertibly correct (on this evidence and the legal principles to which it points), the count is not foredoomed.114 If, however, Particular N(v) states an additional part of the positive Crown case it will throw up the question whether and how the jury are to be directed on an allegation that something was “arguably wrong” (in law). This particular matter vexed the primary judge. It is not easy of resolution. 
     
      
       
       Was a permanent stay justified? 
        
       
      
    115 Sully J in the lengthy passage explaining his reasons for a permanent stay posed a conundrum. He adverted (somewhat tentatively) to evidentiary difficulties on the one hand and difficulties or uncertainties touching possible legal directions on the other. He appeared to conclude that expert evidence might not be admissible as to whether the private rulings were “arguably wrong”. (No such evidence was led at committal, so far as I am aware. None is foreshadowed in the Crown Case Statement.) Sully J also concluded that the problem was not “a true question of law for the Judge”. The ultimate issue was described as “a value judgment”, with the further implication that the difficulties were insoluble and that the trial could not take place in a manner that was fair and just.116 The appellant submits that this “conundrum” overstated the extent of the difficulty, which cannot at this point of time be characterised as an irremediable impediment to a fair trial. The judge erred in describing the ultimate issue as a “value judgment”, as if that were a legally impermissible category of reference. Many legal decisions could be so described (cf Evidence Act, ss130, 137, 138). So too would jury decisions about want of reasonable care, for example. 
     
      
       
      
    117 The appellant further submits that the problems confronting the trial judge were not of such a degree that the extraordinary remedy of a permanent stay was called for. The evidence was capable of establishing the requisite species of imperilment of revenue. It would be incumbent on the trial judge to assist the jury in addressing the ultimate actus reus issue about the actual or potential impact of the private rulings issued at the respondent’s instigation to the allegedly favoured taxpayers. 
     
      
       
      
    118 I accept the submissions summarised in the previous two paragraphs. The complexity of a trial cannot be the touchstone of whether the trial takes place at all. Civil and criminal jury trials may involve complex scientific, medical or accounting issues. Procedures may require adaptation to assist in proof and understanding of the true underlying issues. Recent developments in the law of expert evidence have emphasised the need for demystification and the importance of ensuring that the tribunal of fact is not baffled by science. Opinion evidence must demonstrate its assumptions in a manner that makes the opinion ultimately contestable (Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705).  
     
      
       
        
       How should the jury be directed in the circumstances? 
       
      
    119 The need to consider the broad scope of appropriate directions remains, since the primary judge expressed concern on the matter in the context of a Crown case that includes particular N(v). 
     
      
       
      
    120 The parties were agreed before us that it was open to the trial judge to direct the jury that the private rulings favourable to taxpayers were (in their words) “arguably wrong” when issued. I have already explained that this formulation may cover two separate areas and have concluded that the count is not to be withheld from the jury because the rulings were incontrovertibly correct. 
     
      
       
      
    121 What remains as regards directions needing to be given stemming from Particular N(v)? Ex hypothesi the trial judge will have satisfied himself that the rulings were not incontrovertibly correct in law when issued, this satisfaction stemming from considering the evidence and the legal materials (see further below). Merely because N(v) is a particular of the Crown case does not however oblige the judge to direct the jury on the specific matter in the sense of inviting them to find arguability in law. If that issue is itself one of law, then the judge should direct the jury appropriately, not necessarily in those terms.  
     
      
       
      
    122 [As the Chief Justice and Hunt AJA point out], such a direction may well be subject to various permutations and combinations of the factual matters. The more usual form of directions to a jury – and the infinitely safer one – is to define the issue which the jury must determine, then explain to them the arguments of both parties in relation to the relevant factual material, and then conclude that, if the Crown has satisfied them that it has established that particular issue, they may move on to the next issue. None of this, it seems to me, requires the jury having to be instructed that they have to decide whether the rulings were “arguably wrong” as distinct from having to be instructed as to how they imperilled the revenue through the particular private rulings and the legal and practical effects of such rulings. 
     
      
       
      
    123 I do not accept Mr Temby’s submission that the matter is answered in a favour of a direction in law by pointing to the complexity of the issues involved. There are pockets of caselaw where this factor may have contributed to the recognition of a specific universal rule (for example, as regards the “materiality” factor in perjury and false swearing: see R v Davies (1993) 7 SASR 373 at 388-394, R v Cassell (1998) 45 NSWLR 325). No authority supports the creation of a new category for taxation matters. Tax fraud trials have been part of the legal landscape for many years. A properly instructed jury is able to understand the legal tax principle said to have been dishonestly violated and to form its own opinion as to whether the requisite fraudulent conduct has occurred. 
     
      
       
      
    124 But the present situation is different, in my view. The matter to be determined is whether the private rulings were, in the language of Particular N(v), “arguably wrong” (in law) when issued. In the specific context of FBT this matter can be stated thus: was it open in law at the time for the ATO to argue that employees were “associates” within the legal provisions and principles stated by Mr Chow in his Initial Opinion of 25 March 1998 as adopted and reinforced by the respondent’s views stated in his email of 15 April 1998? 
     
      
       
      
    125 This concept of being “legally arguable” or open is, in my view, a matter of law. It does not matter that the question is asked about an identified time in the past (here, relevantly, before Essenbourne was decided). Accordingly, it is something that the trial judge (if satisfied as to such “arguability”) should direct the jury with his authority as the arbiter of matters legal. In the final analysis, it is no different from telling the jury that if facts A, B and C are established it is open for the jury to find X. Here “X” is that the revenue was put as risk by the rulings (if they were made as alleged). 
     
      
       
      
    126 It seems to me that a mixed question of fact and law is involved (see also Petroulias (No 2) at [46]). 
     
      
       
      
    127 Whether or not a particular transaction has particular tax consequences depends on locating the applicable law (statute and general law) and correctly applying it to the essential elements of the transaction. Minds may differ as to the legal consequences, but that is an inevitable aspect of a legal system administered by human agents. This does not relieve a judge from deciding, identifying and applying the relevant law to legal questions. It is not the jury’s competence or task. If the judge errs, correction is at hand through the agency of the Court of Criminal Appeal and the High Court. Subject to the proviso, legal error in admitting or excluding evidence or in directing a jury will be corrected by appellate processes.  
     
      
       
      
    128 The judge’s role is to give necessary and helpful legal directions to the jury. The distinction between matters of fact and matters of law is not always clear. It is, however, well established that the judicial duty encompasses directing the jury about relevant statutory and common law principles. That duty extends necessarily to relating those directions to the facts available to be found by the jury. 
     
      
       
      
    129 The law understands that some legal propositions can be stated with certainty whilst others cannot. Matters may change over time, such that what is certain in one era may be problematical in another. To give an example: when Sir Matthew Hale’s History of the Pleas of the Crown was published in 1736, the common law was quite clear that a husband could not be guilty of raping his wife. The situation was arguable in the 1980s, but became clear again (to the opposite effect) after 1991 in light of The Queen v L (1991) 174 CLR 379 and Regina v R [1992] 1 AC 599. 
     
      
       
      
    130 An expert witness or a judge who is called upon to form a view about the certain or uncertain state of the law at a particular time in history, or its application in law to particular facts, may need to inform himself or herself by reading caselaw, legal digests, textbooks, legal encyclopaedias and law journals. Some may have sufficient legal experience in the matter at hand to trust their own “judgment” on the matter. Either way, the legal expert will often have to apply that knowledge to a particular set of proven or hypothetical facts. Such application is itself a legal function, because it is law that answers issues of relevance and capacity to reach certain conclusions. 
     
      
       
      
    131 A judge can therefore direct a jury that a statute or contract means X. If relevant, the judge can also direct the jury that the relevant law on the subject is either A or B, with the consequence that when applied to a situation or contract the result is X (or X or Y as the case may be). An analogy is the situation where the jury is told that it is “legally open” for them to decide A or B, but not C. 
     
      
       
      
    132 Not every application of a legal standard to a particular problem involves a question of law. But the issue whether a particular tax outcome was available, a fortiori arguable, is a matter of law (see generally Vetter v Lake Macquarie City Council (2000) 202 CLR 439 at 450[24]). Mr Chow’s discussion about whether, on the assumed facts, an employee is arguably an “associate”, with FBT consequences, appears to me to entail a sharp legal issue. It is not quite so clear with the deductibility issue because factual inferences of intent may be open, although I perceive that identical fact scenarios were provided on behalf of all applicant “Rulees”. 
     
      
       
      
    133 I have already indicated that the putative vice of the respondent’s private tax rulings was that they restricted the Commissioner’s capacity to act against the taxpayers concerned otherwise than as represented in the rulings (cf Petroulias (No 1) at [64]). Viewed this way, the risk or imperilment was the tying of the Commissioner’s hands in 1998, restricting his capacity to contend against favoured “Rulees” that the situation was other than as represented in their rulings. 
     
      
       
      
    134 It follows from what I have already written that it would be open to the trial judge to inform himself of the state of tax law as it stood when the rulings were issued. If that state of law permitted the Commissioner genuinely to advance a tax outcome in either or both of two tax issues otherwise than as embodied in the taxpayer-favoured rulings promoted by the respondent, then the judge could so direct the jury. The jury would then be directed that, if the factual elements of the Crown case were established, it would be open for them to find the necessary imperilment of the revenue of the Commonwealth. This is the ultimate fact in issue (along with dishonesty). 
     
      
       
      
    135 This approach avoids using “arguably wrong” as part of the direction to the jury. But it does mean that the “aggravated” Crown case goes to the jury if the judge has the requisite satisfaction that an aggravated case as alleged is open in law and on the facts. If it is, the judge may craft a direction addressing the elements of the count itself. 
     
      
       
      
    136 As indicated above, the ATO internal emails and memoranda summarised above are capable of being read as containing admissions by the respondent that are at least arguably consistent in 1998 with “the law” applied to the facts hypothesised as the judge may be persuaded to find it. Indeed, the judge may be assisted by the “chapter and verse” about the critical issue of the meaning of “associate” in s 26AAB(14)(a)(iv) of the Income Tax Assessment Act in the Chow memorandum, apparently adopted as correct by the respondent. 
     
      
       
      
    137 The judge may also draw assistance from case law both before and after the rulings in question (see further below as to Essenbourne). Of course, everyone knows that it is easy to be wise after the event, even in matters legal. Some cases apply settled law, some others settle the law, others unsettle the law. In the present case the critical point of time is when the rulings were issued, because they are the events said to have put revenue at risk. It also needs to be borne constantly in mind that the relevant imperilment under the present formulation of the count is the prejudice to the capacity of the ATO to act contrary to the position of the rulings against “Rulees” who received the favourable rulings. That prejudice stemmed from the law and practice touching private rulings. It existed unless the rulings were incontrovertibly correct when given. 
     
      
       
      
    138 I have come down on the legal side of the fence in the sense that I consider it to be a matter for the trial judge to make up his or her mind on the legal issue as I have sought to explain it. But the legal issue is a very narrow one: there are critical and associated factual issues that must be left to the jury, along with the ultimate issue of finding the matters averred in the count beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
       
      
    139 This does not mean that the judge can necessarily avoid explaining to the jury the legal issues canvassed in the ATO emails, especially the Chow opinion. An understanding of these matters may be important in evaluating the respondent’s role in procuring the rulings as well as assessing the separate dishonesty factor. This will not however entail asking the jury to form their own view about the correspondence between the rulings and the true tax position at the time. 
     
      
       
       Essenbourne  
       and later decisions of the Federal Court 
        
       
      
    140 Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCA 1577, 51 ATR 629 and later decisions including Walstern v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 1428, 54 ATR 423, Spotlight Stores Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 650, 55 ATR 745 and PrideCraft Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 339, (2005) ATC 4001 might put an end to the “arguability” of certain propositions for the future. It may be going too far to say that these cases show that the position advanced by the ATO to the Federal Court in those cases was “arguable”, whether or not it was accepted. But it would be fallacious to infer that an ATO-adverse decision in the Court established that the propositions there advanced by the Commissioner were untenable and unarguable then or at an earlier point of time.141 Essenbourne is a decision of Kiefel J in the Federal Court of Australia. Coincidentally it was handed down the day after Simpson J made the order granting leave to appeal with respect to the original order to commit for trial (Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCA 1577, 51 ATR 629). The decision was not taken on appeal. The present parties have always accepted that it must be taken to be incontrovertibly correct as to what it decides, but they have disagreed as to its application to the particular matter at issue. 
     
      
       
      
    142 In her second judgment Simpson J referred to the impact of Essenbourne in the following terms ([2003] NSWSC 106 at [7]): 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          [U]nless and until another taxpayer seeks to litigate another relevantly similar case, the judgment of Kiefel J states the law on the efficacy of the schemes and the liabilities to taxation of taxpayers implementing arrangements of a relevantly similar type. That, of course, does not have the same degree of finality as a decision of the High Court at the end of the available appellate process. Nevertheless, as the law presently stands, as stated by Kiefel J, the arrangements the subject of the private rulings in question being essentially and relevantly similar to the arrangements in  
         Essenbourne 
         , no tax is payable by the taxpayers in question, and the Commonwealth has been deprived of nothing of value. The most that could be said is that the Commonwealth does not have the opportunity to litigate the efficacy of the arrangements. But what does that amount to in the light of the decision of Kiefel J? In order further to litigate such a scheme, it would be necessary for the Commissioner to levy tax on a taxpayer (either by disallowing a claimed income tax deduction, or by requiring the payment of fringe benefits tax); for the taxpayer to commence proceedings; for the Commissioner to persuade the judge (or an appellate court) that  
         Essenbourne 
          was wrongly decided and that, in the circumstances, tax was payable. Although it is complicated by the fact that  
         Essenbourne 
          was partly settled by negotiation, given that the Commissioner opted not to challenge that decision, it seems unlikely that the opportunity to litigate a scheme or arrangement of the same kind is of any real value. 
          
         
        
       
       
      
    143 This conclusion strongly influenced Simpson J in her decision to quash the decision to commit for trial on the s29D charge as formulated at the time (see [2003] NSWSC 106 at [9]). 
     
      
       
      
    144 The Court of Appeal held that Simpson J had overstated Essenbourne’s impact. The Court nevertheless had regard to Essenbourne in the exercise of its discretion as to the remedy flowing from a conclusion that the committing magistrate had committed an error of law (cf Justices Act, ss 109-110). But it did not treat Essenbourne as having direct evidentiary impact. 
     
      
       
      
    145 The matter was complicated by an erroneous submission by the claimant Wills (the informant) in the hearing of Petroulias (No 1). This in turn led to the second hearing in the Court of Appeal (see (2003) 58 NSWLR 598 at 609[42]-[47], 624[33]). The upshot was that the Chief Justice ultimately addressed the Essenbourne issue as follows (Petroulias (No 2) at 624[40]-[49]: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         40 It was the Opponent who presented  
         Essenbourne 
          as a matter to which her Honour should have regard on the exercise of the discretion. This Court is also entitled to do so. As I said in par [84] of the previous judgment, no submission to the contrary was made. I do not resile from the conclusion that  
         Essenbourne 
          indicates that there was an arguable case on the fringe benefits tax issue. I also concluded at [84] that  
         Essenbourne 
          establishes that the deductibility issue was “strongly arguable”. In view of the subsequent submissions, I would withdraw the word “strongly” but reaffirm the basic proposition. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
         41 Mr Clelland contends, as Mr Richter contended before Simpson J, that the issue of deductibility was always open for determination by a court on the evidence in a particular case. The submissions in this Court focus on that part of the exchange with Simpson J quoted above, which refers back to earlier consideration that issues of deductibility may depend on the facts of the particular case. It was submitted that par [1] of the Private Ruling, tendered in the proceedings as representative of other rulings, has a conditional quality about it. The application of the ruling depends upon the facts of a particular case.  
         
        
        
         
         42 I do not regard the submissions of Mr Hastings before Simpson J, with respect to the effect of different factual situations, as constituting a proposition from which he sought to resile on the appeal. It can be readily accepted that a claim for deductibility may be rejected on different grounds depending on the facts.  
         
        
        
         
         43 For example, one of the matters that may affect the outcome of a claim for deductibility in a particular case is identified in par [3] of the Private Ruling, quoted in par [21] of this Court’s previous decision, requiring any contributions to be ‘reasonable and not excessive’. This and other such matters can vary from case to case.  
         
        
        
         
         44 The written submissions of the Opponent referred to pars [24]-[29] and [33] of  
         Essenbourne 
           
         which were described as “findings as to the subjective intent of the taxpayer”. In those paragraphs Kiefel J was concerned with subjective elements on the issue of deductibility. These matters do turn on facts as the Opponent submitted. Mr Clelland referred the Court to the subsequent confirmation of the factual basis of this part of the decision in  
         Essenbourne 
           
         by Hill J in  
         Walstern v Commissioner of Taxation 
           
         [2003] FCA 1428 at [70]-[72].  
         
        
        
         
         45 However, that was not the only basis on which her Honour found for the Commissioner on deductibility. In pars [34]-[36] of her judgment, Kiefel J went on to deal with an alternative contention on the part of the Commissioner that the payment was of a capital nature. Her Honour concluded that the expenditure was of a capital nature. Hill J in 
          Walstern 
           
         also noted that this raised different considerations. (See at [79]-[80].) Factual issues may still arise. Mr Clelland drew particular attention to the possibility of annual contributions under the PIC scheme in contrast with the one-off nature of payments in  
         Essenbourne 
           
         and  
         Walstern 
         . 
           
         
        
        
         
         46 The proposition that the outgoing was of a capital nature remains distinctly arguable under the PIC scheme. It is a matter which par [1] of the Private Ruling could prevent the Commissioner contesting. The deductibility question is generally a question of mixed fact and law. The rulings determined that the facts submitted and assumed in the application for a ruling entitled the taxpayer, as a matter of law, to the tax treatment set out in the ruling. The Commissioner was deprived by the ruling of the opportunity to argue otherwise.  
         
        
        
         
         47 Accordingly, the Commissioner in the schemes presently before the Court, has been deprived of the opportunity of arguing that a scheme complying with the application – which was handed up to this Court – for the purpose of both ‘retaining key employees’ and ‘increasing employee productivity and profitability’ with the possibility of annual contributions, was expenditure of a capital nature. Accordingly, par [1] of the Ruling was capable of having an impact constituting the element of defrauding.  
         
        
        
         
         48 I would reach no different conclusion to that of the first judgment. Even if s110 did not require the Court to do so, the discretion under s109 should not be exercised to quash the order for committal.  
         
        
        
         
         49 The issues not resolved on the evidence before the magistrate, e.g. the arguability of the fringe benefits tax issue or both arguability and ‘genuine dispute’ or ‘genuine assertion of a position’ on deductibility are real issues which may still arise. They could arise on a reopening of the committal before the magistrate or on a  
         Basha 
          inquiry before a trial. These are choices which the Crown has yet to make. Important public interests are involved in these prosecutions. They should not be compromised by the exercise of a discretion to quash the order for committal in the circumstances of the proceedings as a whole 
          
         
        
       
      
    146 This extract from Petroulias (No 2) established that: 
     
      
       
        
       1.  
       Essenbourne 
        does not preclude the Crown  
       in limine 
        from proving that the respondent’s private rulings put the revenue at risk; and 
        
        
       2. Factual issues needing to be explored at trial may distinguish the scheme considered in  
       Essenbourne 
        and the schemes covered by the respondent’s private rulings. 
        
       
      
    147 The appellant submits that the Court of Appeal concluded that Essenbourne “established that the issues were arguable and that the primary judge was in error in reaching a different conclusion”. In my opinion, this misstates the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Petroulias (No 1) and Petroulias (No 2). 
     
      
       
      
    148 In Petroulias (No 2) the Chief Justice said that Essenbourne did not justify the conclusion that the Commissioner had lost the deductibility issue (see at [34]-[47]). But this did not entail the contrary conclusion that Essenbourne overtook the evidence at committal, removed the need to consider the impact of that evidence or prevented the trial judge from considering “arguability” at an earlier point of time. This becomes crystal clear in pars [49] and [67] of Petroulias (No 2).149 It is true that Essenbourne was not the knock-out blow that Simpson J had perceived. But it is equally true that the Court of Appeal was flagging that the Crown had to lay the groundwork at committal to show that the rulings had the requisite character as regards either or both of the deductibility or FBT arms. I would therefore reject the Crown submission that Sully J erred in failing to treat Essenbourne as “relevant and sufficient [evidence]” to warrant the accused being put on his trial (Crown Outline at par 8). 
     
      
       
        
       Disposition 
        
       
      
    150 For these reasons I would uphold the appeal and set aside the permanent stay ordered by Sully J on 21 February 2005.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Goldring DCJ in the District Court of New South Wales. The Applicant pleaded guilty on arraignment to a charge of break and enter to commit a serious indictable offence, namely stealing contrary to s112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. His Honour fixed a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on 2 April 2004, the date of his judgment, and an additional term of nine months.  
     
      
    2 The date of 1 October 2005 when the non-parole period would expire is of some significance because the Applicant was then subject to a term of imprisonment for other offences, the non-parole period for which would also expire on 1 October 2005. Subsequently, an appeal against that sentence, which had been imposed by Newman AJ in the Supreme Court, was successful in this Court and the Court amended the sentence with the effect that the non-parole period for the other offences will now expire on 1 April 2005. (See R v Lawrence [2004] NSWCCA 404). This is the subject of one of the grounds of appeal which will be considered below.  
     
      
    3 The circumstances of the offence can be briefly stated. On 1 August 2002, the Applicant broke into an apartment block in Warrawong and stole a stereo player from a flat. The occupant of the flat was a 74 year old widow who lived alone. The victim awoke and observed the intruder. In the statement of agreed facts tendered before his Honour, the victim was said to be traumatised by the incident.  
     
      
    4 With respect to the objective gravity of the offence, his Honour referred to a list of earlier offences committed by the Applicant and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is a much more serious offence because it involved breaking into the flat of an old lady early in the morning. This is a sort of crime that is disapproved of by the community because it makes people frightened and terrified, and the courts have to let the community know that people who commit those offences will be punished.” 
        
       
      
    5 His Honour found that at the time of the offence the Applicant was using heroin and was probably influenced by alcohol as well. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The use of drugs and alcohol is not an excuse for people who commit crimes but it is something that the courts must take into account when determining the sentence that is to be imposed.” 
        
       
      
    6 Goldring DCJ noted the disturbed family history of the Applicant. She is an Aborigine. Her family circumstances from childhood involved violence, parental alcoholism, sexual abuse and drinking at a very young age. His Honour had before him a good deal of detailed evidence on the personal background of the Applicant and he indicated, correctly, that it was ""almost the typical background"" that the Courts have frequently encountered with Aboriginal offenders, as noted in a number of authorities of which the most frequently cited, as did Goldring DCJ, is R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58.  
     
      
    7 With respect to the subjective case of the Applicant, his Honour referred to a report of the psychologist which he described as ""very thoughtful and helpful"", noting that the psychologist's conclusion was that Ms Lawrence has a PolySubstance Dependence with Psychological Dependence, and an Antisocial Personality Disorder. 
     
      
    8 His Honour concluded that in all of the circumstances, the non-parole period should be 18 months but he found special circumstances, he said, because of the prospects of rehabilitation. He imposed an additional term of nine months.  
     
      
    9 During the course of his remarks on sentence, his Honour referred to the other offences which have subsequently been the subject of a successful appeal. In this regard, his Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        “The Supreme Court has sentenced her to a total term of five years in prison dating from October 2002. Part of that is a fairly long parole period. She is eligible for release, subject to what the Parole Board says, on 1 October 2005, quite by chance that is a date 18 months from today.” 
        
       
      
    10 In the final paragraph of the remarks on sentence, Goldring DCJ, after imposing the sentence, noted that ""the release date for this offence will be the same release date for the other offences"".  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    11 The Applicant contends that the sentencing Judge erred in failing properly to take into account the Applicant's plea of guilty. The Applicant was originally charged with an aggravated version of the offence, with the offence for which she was in fact convicted as an alternative count. The prosecution accepted the plea of guilty to the alternative charge in full discharge of the indictment at her arraignment. The Crown did not contend that this was anything other than the first available opportunity to plead guilty. 
     
      
    12 In his remarks on sentence, Goldring DCJ referred to the plea of guilty but did not explicitly refer to the fact that he had taken it into account, nor did he quantify the benefit to the accused by reason of the utilitarian value of the plea. (See R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 419 [160].)  
     
      
    13 The Applicant submits that the sentencing Judge fell into error in failing to give proper weight to the plea of guilty and in failing to make plain the fact that, and the extent to which, the Applicant's sentence was reduced for the plea. The Crown contends that his Honour did take into account the plea and it puts forward a plausible computation that the final head sentence of 27 months happens to constitute a 25 percent discount from the sentence of 36 months. Although this is a plausible, indeed likely, reconstruction, it would have been easy for his Honour to say so.  
     
      
    14 Goldring DCJ is an experienced District Court Judge. He cannot be unaware of the line of authority on this matter, particularly Thomson and Houlton, as affirmed in R v Sharma (2002) 54 NSWLR 300. The guideline established in Thomson at 160 encouraged, but did not require, the sentencing judge to quantify any discount. It did, however, indicate that judges should explicitly state that the plea of guilty has been taken into account and added ""failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight"" (at 416 [160]).  
     
      
    15 This Court is, of course, aware of the pressures under which District Court Judges have to deliver their sentences and that it is easy not to state a fact that everybody knows is required to be taken into account. Nevertheless, the reasons given in Thomson for issuing a guideline included the need to ensure that participants in the New South Wales criminal justice system had no reason to be sceptical about whether or not the benefits of a guilty plea were in fact made available to accused. It would have been preferable, for that reason, if his Honour had mentioned that he had done so. However, in view of his Honour's long experience and the structure and length of the sentence he imposed, I am not prepared to act on the basis that his Honour failed to take into account the plea, or that he failed to give it appropriate weight. I think the likely situation is that contended for by the Crown: that his Honour commenced with a sentence of 36 months and applied a full discount. Accordingly, I would not uphold this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    16 The Applicant contends that the sentencing Judge erred in failing properly to take into account the evidence relating to the Applicant's psychological condition and the causes of, and background to, her drug dependency. The Applicant's submissions accept that the sentencing Judge made reference to her Aboriginality and to the fact that the reports before the Court indicate the significance of her background of deprivation, abuse and violence which is, unfortunately, as Goldring DCJ indicated, ""typical"" of many Aboriginal offenders. The Applicant also acknowledged that his Honour had made reference to the psychologist's report and how useful he regarded that report to be. It was also acknowledged that his Honour indicated that the substance abuse background of the Applicant was a relevant matter to be taken into account on sentence but ""was not an excuse"".  
     
      
    17 Notwithstanding these references in the judgment, it was submitted that his Honour failed to consider the impact of the Applicant's psychological condition, particularly on the weight to be given to the element of general deterrence. The Applicant referred to authorities which establish that a person suffering from an actual disability or a psychiatric or psychological condition is an offender for whom considerations of general deterrence will have less weight in sentencing. (R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81; R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255.) 
     
      
    18 It was also submitted that the sentencing Judge failed to take into account the circumstances under which the Applicant came to be addicted to drugs, and reliance was placed on the observations in R v Henry and Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at 397 [273] of Wood CJ at CL and at 410 [335]–[358] of Simpson J. 
     
      
    19 It was submitted that the sentencing Judge said nothing to indicate that the principles identified in these two lines of authority had been taken into account. It was submitted that the evidence established that the Applicant had serious psychological injury as a result of her traumatic childhood experiences. On this basis, the trial Judge should have expressly considered whether the element of general deterrence was entitled to less weight in the sentencing process.  
     
      
    20 It is well established that the weight to be given to general deterrence is less in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or severe intellectual handicap. His Honour did not expressly refer to the issue of general deterrence or indicate what weight he was giving to it. Nevertheless, his Honour is an experienced sentencing Judge who is well aware of the principles involved, including the principle that less weight is to be given to general deterrence in a case where a person is suffering from a mental disorder. 
     
      
    21 In my opinion, his Honour's reference to the relevant facts and his express reliance on the psychologist's report, albeit without setting out the detail of the report, was directed to this very matter. His Honour emphasised the value that he received from that psychologist's report. It was directed to establishing the very propositions on which the Applicant would now seek to rely. I am also of the opinion that his Honour gave the personal history and psychological condition of the Applicant considerable weight and this appears from the structure of the sentence.  
     
      
    22 In these circumstances, it is unnecessary to analyse further the detail of the psychologist's report which found the Applicant had a comorbidity of Antisocial Personality Disorder and PolySubstance Dependence with Psychological Dependence in a Controlled Environment. These two conditions are apparently to be found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Mental Disorders Manual (4th ed, 2000), generally referred to as DSM(IV). It is by no means clear to me that these particular mental conditions, notwithstanding their acknowledgement in DSM(IV) as mental conditions, are of the character which justify less weight to be given to general deterrence. 
     
      
    23 Although DSM(IV) has come to be widely used for the purposes of categorisation, it should not be assumed that because, as a result of the rather tortuous process by which DSM(IV) is compiled and amended, some kind of recognition is given, by means of affixing a label to a mental condition, that any such condition is such as to attract the sentencing principle that less weight is to be given to general deterrence. That may not be true of a particular condition. (On the limitations of DSM(IV) see Vernon v Bosley (No 1) [1997] 1 All ER 577 at 610–611; New South Wales v Seedsman [2000] NSWCA 119 at [114]–[120]; Allan Young, The Harmony of Illusions: Inventing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (1995) passim on DSM (III) and DSM (IV); Ian Freckelton “Post Traumatic Stress Disorder: A Challenge for Public and Private Health Law” (1998) 5 Journal of Law & Medicine 252; George Mendelson “Postraumatic Stress Disorder and Litigation” (1999) Australasian Forensic Psychiatry Bulletin 3; Paul R McHugh “How Psychiatry Lost its Way” (1999) 108 Commentary 32; Chris Tennant “Definition of Psychological Trauma: Psychiatric and Legal Approaches” (2003) 77 Australian Law Journal 369; D Saleeby “The Diagnostic Strengths Manual?” (2001) 46 Social Work 183; Luis A Rivas “Controversial Issues in the Diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder: A Review of the Literature” (2001) 23 Journal of Mental Health Counselling; Richard J McNally, Remembering Trauma (2003) at 118–213; Alix Spiegel “The Dictionary of Disorder” The New Yorker 3 January 2005.) 
     
      
    24 Weight will need to be given to the protection of the public in any such case. Indeed, one would have thought that element would be of particular weight in the case of a person who is said to have what a psychiatrist may classify as an Antisocial Personality Disorder. Nevertheless, as I am satisfied his Honour did give the element of general deterrence less weight than he would otherwise be entitled to give in the absence of the psychologist's report, it is not necessary to specify a view on the particular classifications involved in this case. I would not uphold this ground of appeal.

    25 The Applicant contends that the sentencing proceedings miscarried in that the state of the facts upon which the sentencing Judge acted, specifically the Applicant's release date and the length of the sentence imposed upon her in relation to another offence, has changed as a result of the decision of this Court in R v Lawrence [2004] NSWCCA 404. His Honour did in fact impose a sentence which had the effect that the non-parole period would expire at the same time as the non-parole period for the sentences which the Applicant was already serving. As noted above the decision in this Court had the effect of bringing forward that non-parole period by six months, that is to 1 April 2005.  
     
      
    26 The Applicant contends that this was not a coincidence and that his Honour intended both these periods to coincide. That that is so is suggested in the final paragraph of his Honour's remarks on sentence which, to repeat, expressly state that the ""release date for this offence will be the same release date for the other offences"".  
     
      
    27 The Crown draws attention to the fact that during the course of the remarks on sentence, his Honour also said, to repeat:  
     
      
       
        
        “She is eligible for release, subject to what the Parole Board says, on 1 October 2005,  
        quite by chance 
         that is a date 18 months from today.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    28 The Crown contends that his Honour's reference to ""quite by chance"" indicates that his Honour independently arrived at both the term and commencement date of the sentence for the offences with which he was concerned and that he intended to impose a term of 18 months as the minimum term that the Applicant must serve before being released to parole for this offence.  
     
      
    29 I would not give that weight to his Honour's reference to ""quite by chance"". The ""chance"" his Honour was there referring to was, in my opinion, the fact that he was there sentencing on 2 April 2004 which was, in fact, precisely 18 months to the day before the expiration of the then extant non-parole period.  
     
      
    30 I think it is probable that his Honour did have in mind imposing a sentence which coincided with the non-parole period for the previous offences. This had the rarely desirable consequence that, subject to the decision on grant of parole, no additional penalty by way of actual imprisonment would be imposed for the quite distinct offences the subject of these proceedings.  
     
      
    31 It is pertinent to note the fact of the substituted sentence imposed by this Court on the Applicant in the other case. That reduced the overall sentence imposed by Newman AJ from an effective head sentence of five years, with a non-parole period of three years, to an effective head sentence, of which two years had already been served, of four years and six months with a non-parole period of two years and six months. 
     
      
    32 The non-parole period, it is noted, will expire on 1 April 2005. However, the head sentence will continue until 1 April 2007. As noted above, Goldring DCJ imposed an additional term of nine months. This means that the head sentence in the present proceedings will expire on 1 July 2006, i.e., before the expiration of the head sentence for the other offence. The Applicant will, if released to parole, be subject to supervision, and at risk in the case of any further offending, for a longer period under the other sentence than under the sentence presently under consideration.  
     
      
    33 In substance, therefore, the issue before the Court is whether the non-parole period should be reduced from 18 months to 12 months so that the sentencing Judge's original intention that the expiration of the non-parole period should coincide can be given effect in the light of the subsequent judgment of this Court.  
     
      
    34 This Court may quash the sentence pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 if it is of the opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
      
    35 The Applicant contends that the sentence in this case is excessive and relies particularly on the compelling and tragic subjective case of the Applicant. Mr P Hamill SC, who appears for the Applicant, submits that the objective facts of the case do not put it high on the scale of gravity, noting the limited degree of planning, the effect of drugs and the small item of property that was actually stolen, together with the fact that the Applicant left the premises immediately upon the occupant entering the room. He also submitted that the case could have been disposed of summarily in the District Court and that the head sentence actually imposed exceeded by three months the maximum penalty that could have been imposed if the matter had been disposed of summarily. He also drew attention to the fact that the sentencing Judge would have been influenced by the then extant non-parole period imposed by Newman AJ in determining that a non-parole period of 18 months was appropriate.  
     
      
    36 In my opinion, the sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge, both the non-parole period and the additional term, was within the permissible range in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The offence was of significant gravity by reason of the home invasion element with an elderly victim living alone. The offender's considerable criminal history was such as would require condign punishment. There was no basis for a finding that this was a person unlikely to re-offend. In all the circumstances, including the subjective circumstances, and specifically the matters set out in s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, in my opinion the sentence was not excessive.  
     
      
       
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    37 None of the grounds of appeal have been made out. It would have been desirable, of course, for his Honour to emphasise that discount for the plea was in fact given and perhaps to quantify the amount of any discount. I do not doubt that his Honour fully took into account the subjective features of the Applicant. Nothing in the non-parole period or the additional term suggests that his Honour gave significant weight to the element of general deterrence. Nor is the end result excessive.  
     
      
    38 The one matter that has given me pause is whether or not this Court should reinstate his Honour's original intention that the non-parole period for the offence presently under consideration should expire at the same time as that for the other offence. If the Court were to do so, the result would be that the Applicant will not incur any additional punishment by reason of the present offence. It is an entirely unrelated offence and the circumstances are not so exceptional, and the Applicant's offending history is not such, that the Court should bring about that result.  
     
      
    39 It would, in my opinion, be open to this Court in the exercise of its discretion to intervene and reinstate his Honour's original intention. I would have been minded to do so if there had been any evidence before the District Court or in this Court indicating that the Applicant had taken significant steps to address her history of substance abuse. The Probation and Parole Service pre-sentence report before Goldring DCJ indicated there had been no such significant steps.  
     
      
    40 It is often the case that additional material is tendered in this Court indicating progress towards rehabilitation that an Applicant may have made subsequent to any pre-sentence report which was before the sentencing Judge. There is no such affidavit in this case. The Court does have before it a computer printout of the custodial history of the Applicant which indicates that on a number of occasions, including in June and October of last year, drugs were detected in a urine test.  
     
      
    41 In all of the circumstances of the case, I am not minded to intervene in order to restore what appears to have been his Honour's original intention. I am not satisfied that a lesser sentence, either in terms of the non-parole period or the additional term, is warranted in law.  
     
      
    42 In my opinion, leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed.

Cross-appeal by respondent. 
     
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
     
     
     [2005] NSWIRComm 361 
      
    1 In these proceedings, the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales appeals pursuant to s197 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 from the decision of the Chief Industrial Magistrate in Matter No 20160458 given on 3 December 2004. 
    2 The substance of the appellant's appeal goes to the question as to whether the penalty imposed by the Chief Industrial Magistrate was manifestly inadequate having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence. 
    3 The respondent has filed a cross-appeal against conviction. The grounds of appeal relied upon are: 
     
      
       
       His Honour erred in law: 
       
      
      
       
       1. In finding that Mr Coote had assumed on the system in place at the time that Mr Caroma was not inside the tumbler in circumstances where there was no evidence before his Honour that was capable of supporting such a finding (and the undisputed evidence in the case was to the contrary). 
       
      
      
       
       2. By disregarding inappropriately the undisputed and unchallenged documentary evidence of Mr Iannelli and Mr Coote that disclosed a safe system in place prior to the injury of the victim. 
       
      
      
       
       3. In failing to appreciate that the required standard of proof in the case was proof beyond reasonable doubt. 
       
      
      
       
       4. In finding expressly or implicitly that the evidence was capable of proving the allegation to the required standard when no evidence was adduced at all in respect of: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (i) whether only Mr Coote was authorised, entitled and physically capable of starting the potato tumbler, which he did; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (ii) whether accordingly there was any need or practical use for training to be extended to workers other than Mr Coote in respect of the safe manner of switching the potato tumbler on and off; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (iii) whether Mr Coote intentionally or recklessly injured the victim in the circumstances of this case where the undisputed documentary evidence was that he first instructed the victim to enter the tumbler and then switched the tumbler on, regardless of or countermanding the safe systems that were in place to his knowledge; and/or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (iv) whether Mr Coote knew and deliberately failed to adhere to the safe systems in place (which would have avoided the injury) but that such failure or refusal on Mr Coote's part to adhere to the safe systems in place in this instance directly gave rise to the injury; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         and in circumstances where each of the above inferences were reasonably possible on the undisputed documentary evidence of the case and were required to be addressed by the tribunal of fact in this case and where no evidence was adduced to negate such inferences by the prosecution. 
         
        
       
      
    4 The substantive proceedings before the Chief Industrial Magistrate involved two summons prosecutions. The first, Matter No 20292717/03/2, involved an offence charged against Dromore Fresh Produce Pty Limited (Dromore) alleging an offence pursuant to s16(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983. The information laid stated that Dromore, being an employer, failed to ensure that persons not in it's employment and in particular Mr Wagner Caroma, were not exposed to risk to their health or safety arising from the conduct of Dromore's undertaking at its place of work, being Dromore Station. 
    5 The failures particularised with respect to Dromore went to systems of work, instruction, training, supervision and information in relation to the plant in question identified as a vegetable washer machine. 
    6 The second prosecution was Matter No 20160458/04, the subject of the current appeal proceedings. That matter involved an offence charged against the respondent Mr Amer Kanawaty as a Director of Kanwa Nominees Pty Limited (in liquidation) alleging an offence pursuant to s15(1) and s50 of the Act. The information laid pleaded the alleged offence: 
     
      
       
       At all material times, the Defendant was a Director concerned in the management of Kanwa Nominees Pty Ltd (ACN 080 604 753) (""Kanwa""), a corporation, which did, on 4 June 2001 at Dromore Station, Monaro Highway, Cooma in the State of New South Wales (""Dromore Station""), contravene section 15(1) of the  
       Occupational Health and Safety Act 
        (""Act"") in that being an employer, it did fail to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of its employees, and in particular, Mr Wagner Caroma (""Mr Caroma""). 
       
      
      
       
       The Defendant, being a Director of Kanwa and concerned in the management of Kanwa is deemed to have contravened section 15(1) of the Act by force of section 50(1) of the Act. 
       
      
    7 The offence was particularised as follows: 
     
      
       
       1. On the said date, at the said site, the Defendant, being a Director concerned in the management of Kanwa, an employer, failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of its employees and in particular, Mr Caroma, in that: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) it failed to provide or maintain plant and systems of work which were safe and without risks to health in that: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           (i) an employee was able to climb into the tumbler of a vegetable washing machine (""the machine"") operated by Kanwa employees at the premises of Dromore Station; 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           (ii) the machine operated by employees of Kanwa was able to be turned on whilst an employee was in the tumbler of the machine; 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           (iii) there was no system for detecting if there was an employee inside of the tumbler before it was turned on. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) it failed to provide such information, instruction, training and supervision as was necessary to ensure the safety of its employees, in particular, Mr Caroma in that: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           (i) it failed to instruct and train employees as to the safe and proper use of the machine; 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           (ii) it failed to adequately supervise its employees, such that an employee could climb into the tumbler of the machine and the machine be turned on whilst a person was inside the tumbler of the machine. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (c) it failed to take such steps as are necessary to make available in connection with the use of any plant at the place of work adequate information about the use for which the plant is designed and about any conditions necessary to ensure that when put to that use the plant will be safe and without risks to health in that: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           (i) it failed to provide any information to employees to: 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (a) prevent that machine being turned on whilst there was a person in the tumbler; 
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (b) ensure that persons checked that there was no employee or other person inside the tumbler before turning the machine on. 
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    8 There was no material difference, save as to non-employees with respect to Dromore, between the offences particularised as between the two defendants. That is because, as it often the case, the offences arose out of the same factual matrix. 
    9 Both defendants entered a plea of not guilty before the Chief Industrial Magistrate and both were represented by the same solicitor in the hearing before his Honour. Both defendants were convicted in relation to their respective offences. Dromore was fined $22,500 and Mr Kanawaty, as a director of Kanwa, was fined $3000. 
    10 The appeal filed is only in relation to Mr Kanawaty. Likewise, the cross-appeal is so limited. 
    11 Before turning to the substance of the appeal, it is relevant to detail the factual background of the relationship between Dromore, Kanwa Nominees Pty Limited and Mr Kanawaty. 
    12 The defendant Dromore operates a vegetable growing business at Dromore Station near Cooma in New South Wales. Dromore contracted with Kanwa Nominees Pty Limited (in liquidation) (Kanwa) to undertake work for it from time to time, which included harvesting and packing its crop. To do that, Kanwa predominantly employed casual itinerant labour. Nominated employees of Kanwa were appointed as supervisors at a particular place of work to oversee the itinerant work force. On 4 June 2001, one such employee was Mr Douglas Audley-Coote, generally known, as we understand, as Mr Coote. 
    13 Also employed by Kanwa on 4 June 2001 at Dromore Station was Mr Wagner Caroma. His job involved packing and sorting vegetables under the supervision of Mr Coote. 
    14 As a director of Kanwa, the respondent/cross appellant apparently visited the worksite every day to ensure the work contracted was being carried out. In short, he undertook a general oversight of his supervisors and employees. 
    15 In June 2001, the vegetable washer machine was being used to wash potatoes. The photographs confirm his Honour's observations. The vegetable washing machine and its operation was described by his Honour as follows: 
     
      
       
       The inspector's report disclosed the vegetable washing machine was approximately 2.5 metres above ground level and access to the work and maintenance platforms was by means of a permanent ladder. The vegetable washing machine consists of a series of belt conveyors, a control panel and a rectangular steel container open at the top, in which a still cylinder was installed. The cylinder was approximately one metre in diameter and approximately 3.8 metres long and was constructed on metal rods spaced apart. The spacing allows water and dirt to pass through it. It rotates continually when the power source is activated. 
        
        
       Mr Iannelli (Manager for Dromore) informed the inspector that when the machine is in operation the potatoes or carrots travel along the conveyor belts to where the workers select and sort the vegetables into the rotating cylinder. Once inside this cylinder water passes through and washes the vegetables, the product then comes out the other end of the cylinder and is taken along another conveyor for sorting and packing. 
        
        
       The opening from the conveyor into the cylinder was 880 millimetres wide and approximately 360 millimetres in height. Access to this opening can only be gained by climbing on to the conveyor belt from the work platform. Access into this cylinder was further restricted by two 100 millimetres water pipes running across the opening. 
        
        
       The control panel operating this machine was approximately 23 metres from the accident location. A mushroom type emergency button was fitted to the control panel and all switches were identified as to their use and function. The power source for this machine was electricity. 
       
      
      
       
       The normal process of cleaning the tumbler is done once or twice a year. The machine in normal use is self cleaning. To clean the tumbler it is removed from its position by a forklift and is then moved on rollers. It was not normal practice to climb inside the tumbler of the machine to clean it out. ... 
       
      
    16 The accident giving rise to the offence involved Mr Caroma. On 4 June 2001, while working at Dromore Station, Mr Caroma climbed inside the tumbler machine. As his Honour described: 
     
      
       
       ... Whilst Mr Caroma was inside the tumbler, Mr Coote started the potato washing section of the plant, which included the machine and the tumbler inside the machine. Mr Coote turned the machine off immediately and tightened the drive chains, as the machine had previously experienced problems with the drive chains and sliding or jumping cogs. Mr Coote took approximately ten minutes to tighten the drive chains. Mr Coote then restarted the machine. Mr Coote believed that the drive chain was still too loose, so he stopped the machine and again readjusted the drive chain for a period of approximately three minutes. Mr Coote again restarted the machine. Mr Coote walked to the machine to inspect it and the washing plant. Mr Coote then noticed Mr Caroma in the tumbler of the machine. Mr Coote went to machine control panel and stopped the machine and the potato washing section of the plant. Mr Coote then called for help. Mr Caroma sustained bruising and a broken rib. 
       
      
    17 Evidence of representations made by Mr Caroma to Inspector Constable on 6 June 2001, some two days after the accident, disclosed that Mr Caroma was directed to go inside the barrel of the machine by a person he knew as 'John Coops'. It was not disputed that the person Mr Caroma identified was Mr Coote. As his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
       ... Mr Caroma's statement is corroborated to some extent by Mr Coote as he instructed Mr Caroma to clean the rollers and the dirt section at the base of the tumbler. ... 
       
      
    18 It should be noted at this point that his Honour admitted statements from Ishaq Mohammadi, Antonio Iannelli, Wagner Caroma and Douglas Audley-Coote pursuant to s62(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) following notice given by the prosecutor as required by s67 of the Evidence Act. The basis of the notice given and the statements admitted was that all four persons were persons the prosecutor stated were unavailable to give evidence on the basis that it had not been possible to locate them in order to serve them with a subpoena. 
    19 While the respondent's counsel objected to the admissibility of the statements before his Honour, that is not a matter specifically pleaded by the respondent in the cross-appeal.  
    Leave to appeal20 The prosecutor has sought leave to appeal pursuant to s197 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (the Act). After some consideration, we are inclined to grant leave. We do so primarily because there are issues arising in this matter in relation to sentencing on appeal that warrant our consideration, going as they do to the appellant's contention that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate and, in turn, to the proper administration of justice. 
    21 In relation to the cross-appeal, s53(1) of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides: 
     
      
       
       Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by a Local Court, otherwise than with respect to an environmental offence, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the conviction or sentence on a ground that involves: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) a question of fact, or 
       
      
      
       
       (b) a question of mixed law and fact, 
       
      
      
       
       but only by leave of the Supreme Court. 
       
      
    22 Leave is required in relation to the cross-appeal.  
    23 On that point, we are not persuaded that leave to appeal should be granted to the respondent with respect to the cross-appeal. To the extent that the respondent simply contends that his Honour 'erred in law', we do not agree. Overall, the cross-appeal lacks any real issue of law or principle and no public interest issue properly arises. 
    24 To start with, the respondent cites as a ground of appeal that his Honour 'failed to appreciate that the required standard of proof in the case was proof beyond reasonable doubt'. Beyond that assertion, the respondent does not identify any relevant legal or factual error made by his Honour relevant to this point. In his judgment, his Honour stated at p6: 
     
      
       
       I am satisfied to the required standard that the particulars as alleged had been made out against both Dromore and Kanwa. 
       
      
    25 As was stated by the majority in Drake Personnel Limited t/a Drake Industrial v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Ch'ng) (1999) 90 IR 432 at 459: 
     
      
       
       The determination of whether an offence is proven according to the correct criminal standard is undoubtedly a fundamental feature of a criminal trial and the application of the wrong standard of proof would constitute a fundamental flaw in the trial: see  
       Thomas v The Queen 
        (1960) 102 CLR 584 at 593. However, it does not follow that a criminal trial is fundamentally flawed because the standard which is applied has not been expressly stated in the reasons for decision. In our view, there can be no doubt in proceedings of this kind what the appropriate standard of proof is, that the Chief Industrial Magistrate applied that standard or that the parties were in any doubt that the correct standard was being applied ... whilst it may be preferable for a judicial officer to state the standard of proof which has been applied, in our opinion there is no error of law in this case in failing to do so. 
       
      
    26 We would concur with the view expressed. Additionally, for further re-affirmation on this point, see R v Winner (1995) 79 A Crim R 528 at 529 - 530: 
     
      
       
       ... It is not self evident that, in instructing himself or herself, a judge must express all of the matters which necessarily have to be stated to a jury unfamiliar with even the basic principles of the law. For example, it would not seem to be necessary for the judge to expressly refer, at least at any length, to rudimentary and uncontested principles, such as on the onus and burden of proof. It might be assumed that this is known and applied, in the absence of an indication that a mistake has occurred. ... 
       
      
    27 In a similar vein, in R v Timu [2002] NSWCCA 421 Sperling J (Buddin J agreeing) dismissed a ground of appeal averring that the sentencing judge had not applied the correct onus and standard of proof in finding the facts upon which the sentence was to be passed. In doing so, his Honour said at [25]: 
     
      
       
       In relation to disputed facts going to aggravation of the offence, the burden of proof was on the prosecution and the standard of proof was proof beyond reasonable doubt :  
       Olbrich 
        (1999) 199 CLR 270. The trial judge did not state those principles. However, it cannot be doubted that a judge of  
       Neild 
        DCJ's experience intended to apply them. It follows that his Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the factual matters in dispute. 
       
      
    28 We also refer to the approach recently adopted by the Chief Justice (with whom Mason P and Handley JA agreed) in Powercoal Pty Ltd and Anor v Industrial Relations Commission of NSW & Anor (2005) NSWCA 345 at [71] as follows: 
     
      
       
       That in some parts of its judgment the Full Bench uses language that is not in terms the language of beyond reasonable doubt does not appear to me to be of any particular significance in the context of the judgment as a whole. No doubt there will be cases in which it is appropriate to conclude that the invocation of the beyond reasonable doubt standard was a mere invocation and that the Court did no more than pay lip service to the principle. (See, e.g.  
       Harling v Hall  
       (1997) 94 A Crim R 437 at [8];  
       Lions v Taylor  
       (1999) WASCA 86 at [10] and [19].) This is not such a case. Considering the judgment as a whole, the Full Bench did, in my opinion, apply the criminal standard of proof. 
       
      
    29 We consider that, when consideration is given to the whole of the judgment of the Chief Industrial Magistrate (and, in particular, to his statement set out in paragraph [24] above), his Honour did apply the criminal standard of proof although he did not specifically define what he meant by 'required standard'. Further, the Chief Industrial Magistrate has many years of experience in dealing with criminal prosecutions, sitting alone. We are confident that, when his Honour asserted in his judgment he was 'satisfied to the required standard', he intended to and did apply the criminal standard of proof. 
    Considerations as to the cross-appeal going to the respondent's conviction 
    30 We turn to the other grounds of appeal relied upon in the respondent's cross-appeal that have been set out above. They all turn on issues of fact in relation to the evidence adduced and the conclusions able to be properly drawn by his Honour in determining that the offence against Kanwa and thereby the respondent was established. 
    31 As is evidenced by reference to those grounds of appeal above, the respondent focuses, wrongly in our view, on the circumstances of the accident rather than on the real nub of an offence under s15(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983, that is, the risk to the health and safety of the respondent's employees, particularly Mr Caroma. As the agreed facts disclosed, there was no issue before his Honour that: 
     
      
       
       (i) Kanwa was an employer; 
       
      
      
       
       (ii) Mr Caroma was an employee; 
       
      
      
       
       (iii) the respondent/cross appellant was a director of Kanwa; and  
       
      
      
       
       (iv) the accident involving Mr Caroma happened at Kanwa's place of work. 
       
      
    32 Further, there was no dispute before his Honour that Mr Caroma was inside the vegetable washing machine when it was turned on and he was injured as a consequence. Ultimately, the only element of the offence left for his Honour to determine was whether there was a causal link between the failures particularised and the risk to health and safety. 
    33 The evidence relied upon by the prosecutor to establish that causal nexus were a number of statements/representations made by relevant persons, they being Ishaq Mohammadi, Antonio Iannelli, Wagner Caroma and Douglas Coote. Mr Iannelli was, at the relevant time, the Manager of Dromore. Mr Coote was engaged on behalf of Kanwa in supervising it's employees at Dromore Station on the day and Mr Caroma and Mr Mohammadi were employees of Kanwa. In addition to Mr Caroma and Mr Coote, Mr Mohammadi was present on 4 June 2001 in the vicinity of the vegetable washing machine. He assisted in rescuing Mr Caroma. 
    34 All four people were interviewed by Inspectors of WorkCover shortly after the accident. Inspector Franke, the prosecutor in these proceedings, interviewed Mr Mohammadi and Mr Iannelli on 20 June 2001 at Dromore Station. Mr Iannelli signed a record of that interview. Mr Mohammadi initialled the handwritten record of his interview written by Inspector Franke in his notebook. 
    35 Inspector Constable of WorkCover interviewed Mr Caroma at Canberra Hospital on 6 June 2001, two days after the accident. He made notes of that interview in his notebook. Inspector Constable interviewed Mr Coote at Dromore Station on 20 June 2001. Subsequently, none of the four were able to be located in order to subpoena them to give direct evidence based on their prior representations. In accordance with the provisions of s67 of the Evidence Act, notice was given to admit the representations made in accordance with s62(2) of the Evidence Act.  
    36 We observe no appellable defect in his Honour's reasoning in admitting the statements for the reasons detailed by him. 
    37 Critically, the oral representations made by Mr Caroma to Inspector Constable shortly after the accident included representations to the following effect: 
     
      
       
       (i) Caroma was directed to go inside the barrel of the machine by a person known to him as 'John Coops'. 
       
      
      
       
       (ii) Caroma was directed to clean the inside of the barrel of the machine. 
       
      
      
       
       (iii) Caroma had climbed inside the barrel of the machine and cleaned the barrel in this manner on a number of occasions previously. 
       
      
      
       
       (iv) Caroma estimated that it takes about 2 minutes to remove the rocks and stalks from the tumbler of the machine. 
       
      
      
       
       (v) Caroma was inside the barrel of the machine when it was suddenly switched on. 
       
      
      
       
       (vi) Caroma was not aware of any system to isolate the machine so that it could not be turned on while a person was inside the tumbler of the machine. 
       
      
    38 Inspector Constable was cross-examined as to the representations made by Mr Caroma as recorded in his notebook. He confirmed his conversation with Mr Caroma and he was not shaken in cross-examination. 
    39 As earlier stated, it is not in issue that reference to 'Mr Coops' by Mr Caroma was reference to Mr Coote. 
    40 In relevant and significant respects, the oral representations made by Mr Coote to Inspector Constable corroborated the representations made by Mr Caroma. Those representations included: 
     
      
       
       (i) Coote's position was that of foreman. His duties include supervising the pickers, irrigation and harvesting of the crop. 
       
      
      
       
       (ii) Coote was also employed as a foreman by Kanwa. His duties included supervising the staff. He stated that the property, machinery and building are owned by Dromore and the workers are employed by Kanwa. 
       
      
      
       
       (iii) Coote has been employed in these positions since 1995. 
       
      
      
       
       (iv) On 4 June 2001, Coote was setting up the plant and the vegetable washer ('machine') for a run of potatoes. 
       
      
      
       
       (v) On 4 June 2001, Coote instructed Wagner Caroma ('Caroma') to clean the rollers and the dirt section at the base of the tumbler of the machine. Three other employees, known to Coote as Joe Gun, Charlie Chami and Adnau Chami were working nearby. 
       
      
      
       
       (vi) Coote then started the potato packing section of the plant. He checked the packing plant to ensure that it was in working order. 
       
      
      
       
       (vii) Coote then started the potato washing section of the plant ('washing plant'), which included the tumbler of the machine. He stated that he had previously experienced problems with the drive chains. On this occasion, the drive chains were sliding or jumping cogs, so he turned the machine off immediately. 
       
      
      
       
       (viii) Coote then tightened the drive chains which took approximately 10 minutes. 
       
      
      
       
       (ix) Coote restarted the washing plant. The drive chain was still too loose so he immediately stopped the machine again to re-adjust the drive chain, which took approximately three minutes. 
       
      
      
       
       (x) Coote then walked up to inspect the washing plant. He saw Caroma in the tumbler of the machine. 
       
      
    41 In addition, the Notice given under s67 of the Evidence Act with respect to Mr Coote also included the following: 
     
      
       
       In accordance with section 5(b) of the  
       Evidence Regulation 
        2000 (NSW), the substance of all other relevant representations made by the person who made that previous representation are as follows: 
       
      
      
       
       1. Inspector Martin Constable asked 'Was there any instructions that staff were not to climb into the tumbler?' 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Coote answered 'No, it was only done once or twice a year, it was not normal procedure.' 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       2. Coote stated that it was not normal practice to climb inside the tumbler of the machine to clean it out. 
       
      
      
       
       3. Coote stated that he did not know if there was any reason for Caroma to be inside the tumbler. 
       
      
    42 Inspector Constable was also cross-examined as to the representations made to him by Mr Coote and recorded in his notebook. He adhered to the substance of those representations and his evidence on those matters was not undermined. 
    43 In all the circumstances, his Honour was entitled to accept the veracity of the representations made to Inspector Constable by Mr Caroma and Mr Coote. Taken together, the representations of Mr Caroma and Mr Coote establish that, as Mr Caroma's supervisor, he directed Mr Caroma to 'clean the rollers and the dirt section at the base of the tumbler of the machine'. While Mr Coote could give no reason why Mr Caroma would be inside the tumbler, he acknowledged there were no instructions to staff not to do so and that 'it was only done once or twice a year, it was not normal procedure'. 
    44 Further, as Mr Caroma represented, it was 'Mr Coops' (that being Mr Coote) who 'told me to get in and clean it out. I have done it lots of times', 
    45 Clearly, his Honour accepted that evidence without qualification. He was entitled to do that. Significantly, he did so against the background of the absolute nature of the duty cast by s15(1) on employees and the need only to be satisfied with respect to the one remaining element of the offence, that being the causal nexus between the particularised breach and the risk to safety. 
    46 His Honour did hear direct evidence from the respondent/cross appellant. Mr Kanawaty confirmed Mr Cootes role to supervise the workers, including Mr Caroma, who were involved in the cleaning and packing of vegetables. Mr Kanawaty also stated that he left the training of the workers to Mr Coote and other supervisors. 
    47 As reference to the offence details set out above reveals, the particularised breach alleged failures going to the provision of plant and systems of work, particularly as to the operation of the vegetable washer as well as instruction, training and supervision in relation to the safe operation of the vegetable washer. There was also a particularised failure going to a failure to provide adequate information about the safe use of the vegetable washer.  
    48 Beyond the above considerations, it is apparent his Honour had sufficient evidence to satisfy himself in relation to the other breach failures particularised. It is convenient, we believe, to consider them separately as follows: 
    (i) The defendant failed to provide or maintain plant and systems of work which were safe and without risks to health.49 On the evidence before his Honour, there was no doubt that the system of work in place at the time of the accident was not sufficiently or properly assessed and maintained to ensure an employee was not able to climb into the tumbler of the vegetable washing machine. As his Honour's description makes clear and the photographs tendered attest, the machine was large and accessible to employees. Access to the cylindrical tumbler was possible. Further, as both Mr Coote and Mr Caroma confirmed, it was necessary to clean the machine. In his statement, Mr Iannelli, on behalf of Dromore, said that the tumbler was self-cleaning as 'water is continually pumped through it'.  
    50 Even accepting what Mr Iannelli said to be correct, the evidence before his Honour was of a piece of machinery that, in its operation, carried with it risks to safety. Mr Iannelli described the tumbler component of the machine as follows: 
     
      
       
       Its a round barrel approximately 10 to 12 feet long and about 3 feet in diameter and is constructed of steel tubes spaced about 3/8 inch apart. 
       
      
    51 As the supervisor for Kanwa on the day, Mr Coote acknowledged that: 
     
      
       
       (i) he instructed Mr Caroma to clean the rollers; and 
       
      
      
       
       (ii) there were no instructions to staff not to climb inside the roller and 'it was only done once or twice a year, it was not normal procedure'.  
       
      
    52 Further, as is apparent by what occurred, the system of work in place at the time included no steps or process to ensure the machine was not able to be turned on while an employee was in the tumbler of the machine and there was no system in place to ensure there was no employee inside the tumbler before it was turned on. Clearly, given the nature of the machine and the directions to 'clean the rollers' given to Mr Caroma by Mr Coote, there should have been. Absent such a system, the risk to safety in the operation of the machine, including the cleaning of the tumbler, was apparent. 
    53 On any view, such a system of work was manifestly inadequate as far as ensuring the operation of the machine was safe and without risk to health. 
    54 Given all of the above evidence before his Honour and having regard to the absolute nature of the obligation cast on employees under s15(1) of the Act, his Honour was correct in being satisfied that the causal nexus between failure (i) as particularised and the risk to safety was established. 
    (ii) The defendant failed to provide such information, instruction, training and supervision as was necessary to ensure the safety of its employees, in particular, Mr Caroma.55 In his judgment, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
       Mr Iannelli thought that Kanwa had carried out safety induction training for its persons at the premises, highlighting the hazards of the machine and/or the automated plant. Mr Caroma stated he received no training. Mr Coote states that no instructions were given to staff not to clean inside the tumbler. At the same time he stated it was not normal practice to climb inside the tumbler of the machine to clean it out. Mr Kanawaty said he left the training of the workers to Mr Coote and other supervisors. 
        
        
       It is the absolute obligation under the Act for the employer to eliminate all potential hazards at work. Although an unusual act for an employee to gain access to such a confined dangerous space there were simple steps available to the employers at the site Dromore and Kanwa to eliminate such a risk particularly, through training and supervision of its workforce, most of whom were itinerant workers. (sic) 
       
      
    56 Those findings of his Honour as to training and supervision arise from the representations made by Mr Caroma and Mr Coote to Inspector Constable. Further, the notice given under s67 of the Evidence Act detailed the following oral representations made by Mr Coote to Inspector Constable: 
     
      
       
       (i) Prior to the accident on 4 June 2001, the system used to ensure that all staff were clear of the washing plant before it started was that Coote would ask whether everybody was clear before starting the washing plant.  
       
      
     
     
      
       
       (ii) Normally the sorters, being persons who worked on the washing plant, would be in position before starting the washing plant. On 4 June 2001, due to the problems caused by the drive chains and the cold weather, Coote started the washing plant before the sorters arrived on the bus.  
       
      
     
     
      
       
       (iii) The system after the accident is that Coote ensures that everyone acknowledges that they are clear before starting the washing plant. He then starts and stops the washing plant and calls again to ensure everything is alright. He then restarts the washing plant.  
       
      
     
     
      
       
       (iv) Coote stated that the workers are given on the job training regarding the washing plant and that the same person is in the same place on the plant. He stated that they took great pride in their quality and workmanship.  
       
      
    57 The inadequacy of training, instruction and supervision in relation to the vegetable washing machine was exemplified in the evidence of the respondent before his Honour as follows: 
     
      
       
       Q. What I want to suggest to you is that Mr Coote was responsible for instructing Mr Caroma as to all the work he was required to do during the time that he was working at Dromore? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Are you able to assist me in telling me what instructions or what systems you put in place to ensure that people like Mr Caroma were not able to climb into the tumbler of the vegetable washing machine? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Well all the workers, they're being controlled by the foreman which is Mr Coote and a lot of signs was over there for not to go in machines and stuff like that. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Is that all that was done? 
       
      
      
       
       A. There was a lot of safety there which is not my machine. I'm just a contractor. You know the machine were there 12 years ago. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. But my question was, can you tell ... 
       
      
      
       
       A. We told them what to do and we show them how to do the job and we told them not to go where places not supposed to go. We explain to them everything before they call and start the job. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Was that all that was done? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Yes. 
        
       Q. You weren't present during any training that Mr Caroma may have been given in respect of the ... 
       
      
      
       
       A. When Mr Caroma got the job, I interviewed him and I gave him a job and I show him everything he had to do then I gave him to Mr Coote for every job, then he, Mr Coote, looked after him. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You left all of that to Mr Coote? 
       
      
      
       
       A. That's right, yeah. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And maybe the other foremen or supervisors, I think you said there were three or four others. 
       
      
      
       
       A. Yes, yep. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. So you can't tell me what training he was given? 
       
      
      
       
       A. No training. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. He wasn't given any training? 
       
      
      
       
       A. What training? He was shown what to do, he cut broccoli, we show him how to do - cut the broccoli, that's the training we give him. It's just a matter of common sense. 
       
      
    58 Given the representations made by Mr Caroma and Mr Coote as well as the direct evidence of Mr Kanawaty, his Honour was entitled to conclude that the instruction, training and supervision of Mr Caroma was inadequate in relation to the safe operation of the vegetable washing machine. That Mr Caroma was able to climb into the tumbler of the machine and that it was turned on while he was in it is unequivocal evidence of the absence of adequate training and instruction. If training and instruction had been adequate, Mr Caroma would have been instructed in clear terms not to climb into the tumbler for cleaning purposes. It is simply insufficient as far as discharging responsibility to provide a workplace free of risks to safety for Mr Coote to say that it was not 'normal practice' to climb inside the tumbler of the machine to clean it out. There is no evidence to suggest that Mr Caroma was in the tumbler for any other reason except to carry out Mr Coote's direction to clean the rollers and the dirt section at the base of the tumbler. That he chose to do it in the way that he did, unusual as it may be, (as he had done before) is a reflection of the inadequacy of the instruction and training given to him. As was said in Genner Constructions Pty Limited v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (2001) 110 IR 71 at 57: 
     
      
       
       The extent and standard of training provided by employers to their employees to ensure satisfaction with the requirements of the Act will depend upon the nature of, and circumstances under which, work is performed. It will not, therefore, necessarily require the provision of classroom-based instruction or the provision of substantial work manuals. However, in all cases, adequate training will necessarily involve the provision of such information and instruction as will fully equip employees to safely perform work which they are expected to undertake, including the provision of training as to all contingencies arising out of or relating to the performance of such work. In short, the employer must educate the employee to deal with the full range circumstances which may arise in the performance of work, including eventualities which are more unusual in character. Such education should involve processes designed to ensure that employees have fully understood the training afforded to them (and re-training employees, where necessary, to ensure the continued sufficiency of such education).  
       
      
    59 Following the instruction to Mr Caroma to clean the rollers and the base of the tumbler, it was, in the circumstances, the responsibility of Mr Coote to properly supervise Mr Caroma to ensure the job was done safely and without risk. Clearly that was not done, otherwise Mr Caroma would not have climbed into the tumbler or, if he had, Mr Coote would have ensured there was a system in place to check on the whereabouts of Mr Caroma to satisfy himself Mr Caroma had exited from the tumbler before he turned it on. That was clearly not done and Mr Caroma was exposed to the risk to safety resulting in the injuries he sustained.  
    60 It was raised by the cross-appellant that, in considering whether this particular failure had been established beyond reasonable doubt, it was open to the Chief Industrial Magistrate to consider as an alternative hypothesis that Mr Coote deliberately turned the vegetable washer on knowing Mr Caroma was inside it. Such an act, it was said, would 'not manifest a breach of the Act, but criminal liability attaching to the person who did it'. 
    61 This was an issue raised before his Honour at first instance which he rejected, rightly in our view. As his Honour said in the context in which he considered that issue: 
     
      
       
       Mr Coote added normally the sorters, being persons who worked on the washing plant, would be in their positions before starting the plant. However on this day due to the problems caused by the drive chains and the cold weather Mr Coote started the washing plant before the sorters had arrived. The system put in place after the accident is that Mr Coote ensures that everyone acknowledges that they are clear before he starts the washing plant. He then starts and stops the washing plant and calls again to ensure everything is all right. He then restarts the washing plant. This simple procedure now in use would have prevented the incident on the day.  
       
      
     
     
      
       
       Mr Caroma stated it took two minutes to clean the tumbler.  
       Given the difficulties on this day it would not be a perverse act but rather a situation of Mr Coote assuming on the system in place at the time that Mr Caroma was not inside the tumbler.  
       (emphasis added) 
       
      
    62 We are satisfied such a conclusion was, on the evidence, quite properly open to his Honour. Moreover, it was, in our view, absent any evidence to the contrary, an inescapable conclusion. 
    63 Given all of the above, we are satisfied there is no appellable error in his Honour's finding that particular (b) had been established beyond reasonable doubt.  
    (iii) The defendant failed to take such steps as are necessary to make available in connection with the use of any plant at the place of work adequate information about the use for which the plant is designed and about any conditions necessary to ensure that when put to that use the plant will be safe and without risks to health. 
    64 The same considerations apply as detailed in relation to particular (b) as to those matters upon which his Honour could be satisfied in finding that particular (c) had been established beyond reasonable doubt. 
    The appellant's appeal65 The appellant's contention as to the manifest inadequacy of the penalty imposed on the respondent commences by a comparison of the fine imposed on Dromore ($22,500) when compared with the fine imposed on Mr Kanawaty ($3000). 
    66 The basis of the alleged 'manifest inadequacy' of the penalty imposed was due, it was submitted, to 'his Honour giving too much weight to subjective factors'. Further, it was said, the disparity between the fines imposed on Dromore when compared with the respondent 'do not accurately reflect any claimed differences in the level of culpability of the respective defendants'. 
    67 We have to say, reference to his Honour's judgment sheds no light on what the appellant relies upon when it is asserted his Honour 'gave too much weight to subjective factors'. Equally, there is no indication in his Honour's judgment as to what assessment, if any, was made as to the relative culpability of the two defendants before him. It is instructive, we believe, to set out his Honour's remarks on sentencing including his findings in relation to Kanwa and Mr Kanawaty as a director of Kanwa. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
       I am satisfied to the required standard that the particulars as alleged had been made out against both Dromore and Kanwa. Consequently, Mr Kanawaty is deemed pursuant to s50 to have contravened s15(1) of the Act. Mr Kanawaty was personally involved in the daily operation of Kanwa at Dromore Station. He engaged itinerant workers and was under a duty to ensure they were fully trained and supervised. This he failed to do. As demonstrated by the simple precaution taken after the incident there were reasonably practical precautions available to prevent this incident. Accordingly the defence provided by s53 of the Act is not made out.  
        
        
       It was agreed if I found the offences proven I should proceed to sentence. Both defendants have no prior record in this jurisdiction. Mr Kanawaty is a man in his early fifties. Steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence of the breach. In such circumstances each defendant will receive a ten percent discount for subjective features.  
       
      
      
       
       The nature and gravity of the offences fall within the medium range of matters coming before this Court. This case emphasises the importance of proper training, instruction and supervision around machinery with dangerous parts.  
        
        
       The maximum penalty for a breach of s15(1) and/or 16(1) of 1983 by a corporation is $550,000. The maximum penalty for an individual is $55,000. This Court has a jurisdictional limit of $55,000.  
       
      
     
     
      
       
       In all the circumstances applying the principles of sentencing applicable in this jurisdiction Dromore is convicted and fined $22,500. Mr Kanawaty is convicted and fined $3,000. In both cases the defendants are to pay the prosecutor's costs and disbursements as agreed or assessed. The monies are to be paid to the Downing Centre Local Court within 28 days. There was a moiety of the fines to the prosecutor.  
       
      
    68 As his Honour's judgment reads, the reference to 'subjective features' and his assessment of a discount was applied to both defendants equally. That is a matter clearly within his Honour's sentencing discretion and there is nothing to which our attention has been drawn that suggests such an assessment, applied equally to both defendants, was an error on his Honour's part. 
    69 However, counsel for the appellant also challenges the judgment at first instance based upon an inadequate assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence committed by the respondent. Counsel for the appellant pointed to the active role of Mr Kanawaty, as a director of Kanwa, in the day to day activities of the company. He was, it was contended, the alter ego of Kanwa. He visited the worksite on a daily basis and, by his own account, acknowledged Mr Caroma had received no structured training or instruction and that, generally speaking, it was 'just a matter of common sense'.  
    70 Based on that evidence, it was said, Mr Kanawaty's culpability was much greater than his Honour had assessed given the penalty imposed and his Honour's assessment that the offences fell 'within the medium range of objective seriousness'. 
    71 Notwithstanding those matters to which our attention was drawn, there is no analysis undertaken by his Honour of the respondent's role in the overall management of the workplace. 
    72 The appellant properly conceded that it could not sustain the appeal merely upon the level of the penalty fixed for the respondent when compared with the penalty for Dromore unless it could be demonstrated that the factors referred to in the previous paragraph warranted a different approach to penalty. It is difficult to see how the appellant can challenge his Honour's finding that the nature and gravity of the offences fall within the medium range of matters coming before this Court for one defendant only. If that was an error on his Honour's part, it must follow that such an error would impact on the sentencing outcome for Dromore as much as for the respondent. In the absence of any appeal in relation to Dromore, the correct approach must be that the penalty in relation to Dromore should be treated as being sound, (even if we may have formed a different view ourselves). 
    73 His Honour was mindful of the significant disparity in the maximum penalty provisions between the two defendants. In the case of Dromore it was $550,000 with a jurisdictional limit of $55,000. In relation to Dromore, the maximum penalty remained at $550,000 notwithstanding his Honour's jurisdictional limit. As was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115 at 123: 
     
      
       
       The result of true construction of the statutory provisions in New South Wales is that, what has been prescribed is a jurisdictional maximum and not a maximum penalty for any offence triable within that jurisdiction. In other words, where the maximum applicable penalty is lower because the charge has been prosecuted within the limited summary jurisdiction of the Local Court, that court should impose a penalty reflecting the objective seriousness of the offence, tempered if appropriate by subjective circumstances, taking care only not to exceed the maximum jurisdictional limit. 
       
      
    74 The need for such an approach in relation to Dromore was not applicable to Mr Kanawaty as a director of Kanwa. 
    75 It should be noted that the financial position of the respondent does not explain the level of penalty set. There is nothing to be gleaned from his Honour's judgment as to the extent, if any, of material placed before the Court as to the respective financial position of the defendants. Certainly, s6 of the Fines Act 1996 requires the Court to consider the financial means of a defendant on the basis of information reasonably and practicably available. 
    76 There is nothing in his Honour's judgment to suggest the ability to pay was a factor to be specifically considered by his Honour. As was said by the Full Bench in WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v Jian Chen and Obing Pty Limited t/as Old But New [2004] NSWIRComm 247:  
     
      
       
       [51] ... where a defendant desires to plead incapacity to pay as a determinative issue in the imposition of penalty, it behoves the defendant to discharge the onus that such a submission invokes by placing before the Court all of the information it relies upon in support of that submission in order for the Court to give that information proper consideration in the exercise of its sentencing discretion. 
       
      
    77 In our view, his Honour was required to consider the respective culpabilities of the respondent and Dromore in assessing penalties. He failed to do so, particularly in relation to the contribution of the respondent. This raises the difficult question of what should be done as to this issue on appeal. Kanwa, and thereby Mr Kanawaty, may well have a more direct culpability given the role of it's employees in the day to day operations involving the vegetable washing machine. There seems to have been an abject failure in Kanwa to provide safety measures for its employees. On the other hand, it must be said, the workplace was principally controlled by Dromore with Kanwa acting as a labour hire company in the provision of labour to undertake certain tasks. Dromore did have it's own employees on site and, on the day of the accident, Dromore employees worked in the area where the accident occurred. According to Mr Iannelli, the Manager of Dromore, his job was to 'manage the place to the best of my ability'. It would also appear that Mr Coote had dual employment responsibilities as between Dromore and Kanwa. The oral representations made by Mr Coote to Inspector Constable disclosed as follows: 
     
      
       
       Q. Who employs you? 
       
      
      
       
       A. I am employed by Dromore Fresh Produce Pty Ltd and Kanwa Nominees. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. What is the arrangement with your employment? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Fifty per cent of my wage is paid by each company. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. What is your position with Dromore Fresh Produce? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Foreman, I supervise the irrigation and harvesting of the crop and the pickers. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. What is your position with Kanwa Nominees? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Foreman, I supervise the staff. Dromore own the property, machinery and building, Kanwa Nominees employ the workers. 
       
      
      
     Certainly Mr Kanawaty confirmed that Kanwa engaged Mr Coote in a supervisory role.  
      
    78 Additional to all of the above, it has to be remembered that this is a Crown appeal. It is well established in approaching the re-determination of sentence at an appellate level an attitude of restraint must be exercised and the relevance of double jeopardy in the defendant being sentenced on a second occasion must be recognised and taken into account. That principle was expressed by Kirby J in Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 340 as follows: 
     
      
       
       For reasons of legal history and policy, the position of Crown appeals against sentence has long been regarded, in Australia and elsewhere, as being in a class somewhat different from that of an appeal against sentence by a convicted offender. When first introduced, Crown appeals were considered to cut across 'time honoured concepts' of the administration of criminal justice in common law legal systems. For this reason it has sometimes been said that, as a 'matter of principle', such appeals should be a comparative rarity. The attitude of restraint reflected in such remarks has often been justified on the basis that a Crown appeal against sentence puts the prisoner in jeopardy of punishment for a second time, a feature that is ordinarily missing from an appeal, or application for leave to appeal, brought by those who have been sentenced. The consequence is that where the Crown appeals, it is normally obliged to demonstrate very clearly the error of which it complains. The further consequence is that, where such demonstration succeeds, it is conventional for the appellate court to impose a substituted sentence towards the lower end of the range of available sentences. This convention tends to add an additional restraint upon interference, given the strong resistance that exists against appellate 'tinkering' with sentences.  
       
      
    79 The above considerations as enunciated by Kirby J were considered by the Full Bench of the Court in WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Buggy) v Weathertex Pty Limited (2003) 127 IR 60 at [55] as follows: 
     
      
       
        It is well established that an appellate court in re-sentencing, or deciding whether to re-sentence an offender, should have regard to the principle of double jeopardy. The application of the principle of double jeopardy provides for an imposition of a sentence that is somewhat less than the sentence the appellate court considers should have been imposed at first instance ( 
       R v Allpass 
        at 562), or at the lower range of available sentences:  
       Dinsdale v The Queen 
        at 341;  
       Profab Industries Pty Ltd 
       . 
       
      
    80 Reference by Kirby J in Dinsdale above to ""the strong resistance that exists against appellate 'tinkering' with sentences"" was recently reaffirmed by the High Court in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 (18 May 2005) at [27] - [28] as follows: 
     
      
       
        ... As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.  
       
      
     
     
      
       
       The proceedings in the Court of Criminal Appeal being a prosecution appeal, brought pursuant to s 5D of the  
       Criminal Appeal Act 
        1912 (NSW), it was, of course, necessary for the prosecution to show error in the sentence passed below - either specific error or manifest inadequacy. As the whole Court pointed out in  
       Lowndes v The Queen 
       , a court of criminal appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion. 
       
      
    81 We accept that his Honour erred at first instance in the penalty imposed with respect to Mr Kanawaty. Taking into account all that we have considered, including the principles relating to double jeopardy, we are not persuaded that we should intervene to vary the penalty imposed on appeal. While the appellant may be able to demonstrate an error in one respect, the Court has a residual discretion on appeal not to alter the sentence even if error is found. For the reasons we have given, we propose to exercise that residual discretion and not interfere with the penalty imposed with respect to Mr Kanawaty. 
    82 Accordingly, we order as follows:  
    (1) As to the appeal: 
     
      
       
       (i) Leave to appeal granted; 
       
      
      
       
       (ii) Appeal upheld; 
        
       (iii) The penalty given by the Chief Industrial Magistrate in Matter No. 20160458 is not varied; 
       
      
      
       
       (iv) The respondent is fined the amount of $3,000 with a moiety thereof to the Prosecutor. 
       
      
    (2) As to the cross-appeal: 
     
      
       
       (i) Leave to appeal refused; 
       
      
      
       
       (ii) Appeal dismissed. 
       
      
      
     (3) Each party to pay their own costs of the appeal and cross-appeal.

      DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS v NATHALIE CHRESTA 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions of New South Wales in respect of the decision of a Local Court magistrate made on 26 July 2004 dismissing a charge brought against the defendant, Miss Nathalie Chresta, for a breach of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) (Road Rules) Regulation 1999, which regulation incorporates into the law of New South Wales the Australian Road Rules. The regulation is made under the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999.  
     
      
    2 The appeal is brought as of right under s 56 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001. Such an appeal may be brought ""only on a ground that involves a question of law alone"". On determining such an appeal, the Court may set aside the order made by the magistrate and make such other order as it thinks just. 
     
      
    3 The magistrate in dismissing the charge acquitted the defendant. The magistrate had held a prima facie case against the defendant on the charge brought against her. That charge is referred to in the Court attendance notice, which is annexure “A” to the affidavit of Rodney Vincent Paul, solicitor, sworn 11 November 2004. 
     
      
    4 The details of the offence there shown allege that the defendant did ""drive using hand-held phone"". (Police officers gave evidence before the magistrate that they observed the defendant holding a mobile phone to her ear whilst the vehicle was in motion.) 
     
      
    5 The defendant gave evidence to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. Well I notice that I seem to have conflicting view with the officers in regards to the time span that I should have held a phone next to my phone and as I was saying in my statement, I did have the phone in my hand merely to switch it off so my son wouldn't wake up. That may have looked for a moment like I did talk on the phone but I actually didn't and I tried to get invoice, a detailed invoice from my phone company which shows that I didn't go - do any outgoing calls. They don't have any records of incoming calls. I can't prove that side. What I can prove is that my phone has a speaker function, which requires me to just press one button, and then I can just leave it untouched. So I never really have the need to put the phone next to my ear for longer than really a second. I'm not using the phone in the car to speak.”  
        
       
        
      
    6 The defendant gave evidence of the hand movements she had been making, what hand she had used, that she had not been talking; she referred to her friend sitting in the seat next to her and her phone ringing in the back which was at the friend's feet:  
     
      
       
        
        “I asked her to get the phone out and she was fiddling around with it and it was ringing and I didn't want my son to get out, to wake up so I took the phone from her and switched it off. It was a new phone so I wasn't quite sure of what to do myself.""  
        
       
      
    7 She referred to her checking the phone to ensure that it was off by raising it to her ear.  
     
      
    8 In cross-examination her evidence was not in any substantial respect shaken. The magistrate, after hearing from the parties as to the appropriate definition of the term ""use"", refined the question before him to ascertaining whether it was a use of the phone to turn it off. Examination was made before the magistrate of various dictionary definitions of “use”.  
     
      
    9 The magistrate then said after Miss Chresta said:  
     
      
       
        
        ""Your Honour may I have an opportunity to talk?” “HIS HONOUR: I do not know that you are going to need to Ma'am. The bottom line is if I am still quibbling here with these definitions the onus is on the prosecution to prove their case against you beyond a reasonable doubt. What the police saw certainly entitled them to stop you. I do not have any quibble with that. It really comes down to the definition section, which is so broad. But use, I think, reading through all these definitions in the Macquarie Concise Dictionary certainly tends to go to the word ""to operate"" and ""to put into effect"". Putting into effect here I do not know that turning it off can be said to put it into effect. There seems to be a positive connotation from the words in all these various definitions and until and unless the Act is made a little bit more specific so far as you are not to handle, you know, a mobile phone while vehicle is in motion or something like that. I just cannot be positive that that is what is contained here so, subject to whatever else you want to say sergeant, I think I am going to have to dismiss it. PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour. I can't offer anything further to the Court at this stage your Honour. HIS HONOUR: I do not think I can say any more than I already have. The definition is - or the word in the section is so broad that I cannot be satisfied that the actions here which are totally consistent with what the police saw and entitle them to pull her over but we also cannot argue with what she says because they were not in the car and she certainly did deny it at the time. SO THE INFORMATION HAS TO BE DISMISSED. So that is it Ma'am. You are free to go. ” 
        
       
      
    10 The offence is constituted by a breach of the Regulations so far as they adopt the Australian Road Rules and in particular Road Rule 300.  
     
      
    11 Road Rule 300 provides 300(1): 
     
      
       
        
        “The driver of a vehicle (except an emergency vehicle or police vehicle) must not use a hand-held mobile phone while the vehicle is moving or is stationary but not parked unless the driver is exempt from this rule under another law of this jurisdiction.” 
        
       
       
        
          
        
       
      
    12 The Australian Road Rules contain a dictionary of definitions. None of them assists with the definition of ""use"". It is apparent that no exemption under another law of this jurisdiction is here applicable. The relevant rule is contained in Part 18 of the Road Rules headed Miscellaneous Road Rules and in Division 1 headed Miscellaneous Rules For Drivers. Those rules contain rules dealing with the duty of a driver involved in a crash, the duty not to drive on a path or nature strip or traffic island, make unnecessary noise or smoke, securing an insecure or overhanging load, the necessity to remove fallen things from the road, to keep control of a towed vehicle, regulation of towing with a tow line, the necessity to have more control of the vehicle, the requirement to abstain from driving with a person in the trailer, not to have a telephone receiver or device whilst the vehicle is in motion... There are also rules in Division 2 for people in charge of animals. 
     
      
    13 It becomes difficult in that context to say, other than as has the prosecution in a written submission, that there is a general intent behind the rules to achieve safety. This gives little assistance, however, in considering the particular purpose in rule 300. In argument various situations were described with a view to testing how wide the term ""use"" might be. It was accepted that to use the phone otherwise than as an instrument of communication might well not be within the definition.  
     
      
    14 The distraction, to which the safety requirement said to be behind the rule might apply, would occur in the receiving and making of communications but, of course, that is not the only way hand-held mobile phones may be used. They may be used nowadays, not only as message-sending devices, but also as cameras for the purpose of photography, music playing devices, calendars or calculators, they may have all manner of functions, but they are still popularly described, even when those other functions or uses are being resorted to, as hand-held mobile phones. 
     
      
    15 It was accepted that the simple use of the phone as, eg, a bludgeon to deal with some insect or pest, would not be within Rule 300, although, on one view of it, it might produce a situation equally if not more unsafe than a use to communicate.  
     
      
    16 It was submitted that if one turns to dictionaries one would see various uses of the term ""use"" such that the DPP contends the mere operation of the mobile phone for the purpose of turning it on or off would be a use of the mobile phone, although the checking of it that it was turned off would perhaps be less likely to be so considered. 
     
      
    17 The word ""use"" is notoriously wide in its ambit and on occasions varying in its application, however I accept the submission made that its occurrence in Australian Road Rule 300 is to be construed as meaning that the operation of, by hand of a hand-held mobile phone while the vehicle is moving, is to be treated as an offence under the Road Rules and the Regulation.  
     
      
    18 I accept that the purpose of the legislation is, at least, to proscribe the operation of the communication function or the device to give the potential for such function and to proscribe that use of the device as involves the removal of a driver's proper attention from the road and the hand or hands from the safe operation of the vehicle. 
     
      
    19 It is notable that on the web site of the RTA are references to ""breaches with a mobile phone in your hand"" and the ""stopping in a safe place if you need to make a call or retrieve a message"". There is also a reference to it being illegal to ""drive or operate a vehicle while using a hand-held mobile phone"". The site says, ""Talking, sending or receiving text messages, playing games or taking phone calls are illegal when using a hand-held phone and these functions appear to be regarded as functions that are included in the use for communication of the phone, i.e. for the reception or non-reception of calls. These latter two functions are initiated by actions required to turn the phone on and off i.e. to make it operational or non-operational. 
     
      
    20 So far as what the RTA might say on their web site about these functions is concerned, of course that is not an aid to construction of the term “use” in the Australian Road Rules. It does, however, illustrate how much wider the word ""use"" might be more popularly thought to be than simply restricted to the uses of the device to make oral person-to-person communications. But, what is shown on the web site is consistent with the Director’s submission, which I hold is correct, that whilst driving, to turn the phone on or off is a use, which is within the section. It is an operation of the phone. It would be even more an operation if communications were to be made or received.  
     
      
    21 It is not necessary for me to have regard to the numerous modern authorities as to the construing of penal statutes since in my view the use of the word ""use"" here is quite clear.  
     
      
    22 I have, therefore, come to the view that the magistrate erred in law. However, s 59 of the Act provides that I might make any such other order as the Court thinks just in the circumstances.  
     
      
    23 This is an appeal against an acquittal. The magistrate's findings make it perfectly clear that the magistrate did not regard the action of the defendant, who gave evidence of those actions and whose evidence was accepted, as displaying any real degree of culpability such that she should receive any penalty under the provisions of the Act and/or the Regulations. 
     
      
    24 I do not see that there is any interest to be served by remitting the matter to the magistrate or setting aside the acquittal. In my view the appropriate course, which is the course for which the Director has elected, is that I publish these reasons as to why the magistrate's determination of the ambit of the offence was incorrect, confirming that the ambit is sufficiently wide to include the use of the hand held phone by turning it on or off or operating it, including by sending text, telephone or other messages or receiving them through it, or operating from it any of its functions to communicate as might serve to distract the driver from having both hands and full attention engaged upon the task of driving. 
     
      
    25 In these circumstances, I decline to make the order sought in paragraph 1 of the summons. I make an order in terms of paragraph 2 of the summons. I note that the Director does not seek costs.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act, as a result of the Respondent's failure to give evidence in accordance with an undertaking, which he had given at the time when he was sentenced.  
     
      
       
      FACTS 
       
      
    2 The Respondent was involved in a serious offence of armed robbery which took place at the Abruzzi club on 6 August 2001 after it had closed for the night. There were allegedly four persons involved: DV, SY, the Respondent and another person, whom I shall refer to by the initial A since he is waiting trial. It was the Crown case that the offenders were armed with replica pistols and a crowbar, and that staff members who were still present in the premises were tied up, threatened with the replica pistols, and kicked. A sum of $55,000 was stolen from the safe and various sums were taken from the cupboard where staff kept their belongings.  
     
      
    3 Arising out of these events the Respondent was charged with one count of robbery while armed with an offensive weapon, and with 2 counts of assault. Two offences of larceny in relation to the property that was stolen from the staff were taken into account on a Form 1. On 10 April 2003 the respondent admitted his involvement and named his co-offenders in the course of an electronically recorded interview with police. On 15 May 2003 he signed an undertaking to give evidence against the man A.  
     
      
    4 On 23 May 2003 he appeared before Judge Sides QC in the District Court for sentence, adhered to the plea of guilty, which he had offered in the Local Court, and confirmed his undertaking to give evidence against A. He was sentenced in relation to the armed robbery count, taking into account the Form 1 matters, to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years, each to date from 30 October 2001. In relation to the assault counts he was sentenced to concurrent terms of 3 months and 6 months respectively. The sentences were backdated to the time that he was arrested and taken into custody.  
     
      
    5 In sentencing the Respondent his Honour noted the undertaking, but indicated that he found that the quality and usefulness of the respondent's evidence would be limited. He found that he was entitled to some leniency, although the discount, which was not quantified, would be less than that for DV who had provided the information which had identified the offenders.  
     
      
    6 The Crown successfully appealed to this Court against the leniency of the sentence for the armed robbery offence: R v SY and Anor [2003] NSWCCA 291. The sentence was increased on 15 October 2003 to one involving imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. Whealy J (with whom Ipp JA and Howie J agreed), observed at [71]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, an appropriate head sentence for the armed robbery in the case of each respondent was, prior to discount for plea and assistance, a term of imprisonment for eight years.” 
        
       
      
    7 His Honour also said at [75]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to the respondent KS it is appropriate that a discount for early plea and limited assistance be recognised and applied. I agree with the sentencing judge’s assessment of the low level of assistance likely to be provided in relation to evidence to be given at the trial of [A]. The resultant discount and the application of discretionary considerations, having regard to the fact that this is a Crown appeal, are sufficient to reduce the head sentence to a term of imprisonment for five years.” 
        
       
      
    8 On 29 November 2004 the alleged co-offender, A, appeared in the District Court for trial. As a result of inexplicable but gross mismanagement it was learned that the Respondent and A had each been transported to Court in the same prison van and had then been held in the same cell.  
     
      
    9 The Respondent informed the Crown that he was no longer prepared to give evidence in accordance with his undertaking. He was called as a witness and testified, contrary to his ERISP, that the fourth offender had not been A, but had in fact been a Vietnamese man named “Tran”. 
     
      
    10 Although leave was given to the Crown to cross-examine him, he adhered to his evidence in chief, asserting that he had lied in his ERISP, and in his evidence when he had appeared for sentence, by transposing A for Tran. He explained that he had done this out of revenge, since he had believed that A had been sleeping with his girlfriend. 
     
      
    11 He indicated that his previous anger in this regard had been dissipated once he had learned that his girlfriend had become a prostitute.12 He conceded that he had not told police or his solicitor of the change in his position until 29 November, and said that while he had seen A that day they had not discussed his evidence. He also denied that there had been a discussion in the prison, of which SY, the co-offender, had given evidence, about giving a false version of an Asian male being the fourth participant.  
     
      
    13 There was evidence from each of DV and SY asserting that A had been one of the offenders. Notwithstanding this evidence the jury were unable to reach a unanimous verdict and they were discharged. A faces re-trial on 26 April 2005. 
     
      
    14 The Respondent has provided an affidavit in relation to the Crown appeal in which he has asserted, inter alia, that during 2003 messages had been passed to him trying to get him not to give evidence in the trial, which he did his best to ignore. He then said that when he was taken to the Court for the trial of A, he was placed in a van at Silverwater Correctional Centre in which A was already seated. They apparently sat together during their trip to the Court and he was thereafter placed in the same cell on the first day of the trial. 15 The Respondent said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was quite alarmed. I am aware what happens to people who give evidence against other inmates. You are classified as a dog and you are fair game, not only for the inmate you are giving evidence against and their friends, but for everyone else in the gaol as well. I was very scared that I would become the victim of violence, probably on an ongoing basis. I had survived I felt to that point because I was in a lower security gaol, no one knew my connection as a potential Crown witness and by that stage, quite frankly, I thought myself I would not be called on to give any evidence as so much time had passed.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      He continued: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “As well as being afraid, I felt that no one was watching out for my safety or interests. I was vulnerable and unprotected. I felt I was being treated without the least degree of respect or concern by the Prosecution.” 
        
       
      
    16 The current appeal is brought under s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which provides: 
     
      
       
      “5DA Appeal by Crown against reduced sentence for assistance to authorities 
       
      (1) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence imposed on a person that was reduced because the person undertook to assist law enforcement authorities if the person fails wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking. 
       
      (2) On an appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal may, if it is satisfied that the person has failed wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking, vary the sentence and impose such sentence as it thinks fit. 
       
      (3) A reference in subsection (1) to a sentence imposed on a person includes a reference to a sentence that was varied or imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
       
       
        
       
      
    17 The purpose of the section is clear, namely to allow the Court to intervene where an offender, who has received the benefit of a discount, reneges on an undertaking to give evidence for the Prosecution in accordance with his statement to police, either by refusing to give evidence at all or by departing from his earlier statement. Where there is a departure of that kind it is not necessary for this Court to determine which version is true: R v Walters and Watkins (1994) 33 NSWLR 612 at 616. 
     
      
    18 There has been an obvious failure by the respondent to abide by his undertaking, or to give the assistance for which he received a discount, and the Crown has accordingly established a prima facie basis for invoking an exercise of s 5DA: R v Bagnell and Russell NSWCCA 10 June 1994 at 6, and R v J (1992) 64 A Crim R 441 at 442. 19 The ability of the Crown to invoke this section is a very important part of the criminal justice system. Persons who give undertakings and who receive the benefit of those undertakings by way of a discounted sentence can, subject to exceptional circumstances, expect to have their sentences increased if they renege on their undertaking to give evidence. The departure from an undertaking of that kind is not to be regarded lightly and it will normally justify appellate intervention.  
     
      
    20 In R v Hocking [2000] NSWCCA 339, Ireland J observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “32 Where a person undertakes to assist the authorities by giving evidence for the Crown at a pending trial and is treated leniently on sentence in consequence but fails to give such evidence, s 5DA has application. 
        
       
       
        
        33 The purpose of the section is not punitive but is directed towards enabling this Court in an appropriate case, and to an appropriate extent, to intervene to adjust or correct a sentence where a sentencing process can be seen, with benefit of hindsight, to have miscarried by reason of the circumstances set out in the section: see  
        R v David Robert O'Brien 
         (NSWCCA, unreported, 10 June 1993, per Gleeson CJ). 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        36 The enactment of s 442B of the  
        Crimes Act, 1900 
        , 
          
        and its successor, s 23 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 
        , has provided an important tool in the administration of justice. This Court should be vigilant to ensure the imposition of a sentence which, so far as possible, excises the discount which the respondent received.” 
        
       
      
    21 The Court does retain a discretion not to intervene: R v O’Brien NSWCCA 10 June 1993 and R v Hammond (2002) 121 A Crim R 1 per Bell J at [14], and it is this discretion which the Respondent seeks to invoke, even though he acknowledged being aware, when he first appeared for sentence, that in the event of him failing to give evidence in accordance with his undertaking, he risked facing review by a higher court.  
     
      
    22 Three matters are relied upon by the Respondent, as justifying a favourable exercise of this discretion. 
     
      
       
      The Transport of the Respondent and A in the same van, and the holding of them in the same cell 
       
      
    23 No satisfactory explanation has been given, nor could it be given, for this serious lapse in custodial arrangements. The imperative to avoid such a situation attracted the attention of this Court in Bagnell and Russell, where Studdert J (with whom Newman J and I agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The circumstances of these two cases illustrate a need for a review of procedures where a witness who is in custody is going to give evidence against another offender. Under no circumstances should such a witness be permitted to travel in the same van to the place of trial as that other offender nor should he be kept in the same cell as that other offender. The need for the witness in such circumstances to be protected from the influence of other prisoners must be recognised so far as is practicable.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour also noted: 
       
       
        
        “Any person who offers to give evidence against a co-offender must appreciate that there is an attendant risk that he will be subjected to pressure not to give such evidence and to threats as to what may happen to himself or members of his family if he gives the evidence. These are circumstances which are taken into account in the extension of leniency in the sentencing process in recognition of an undertaking to assist the authorities. However, a witness who offers assistance in circumstances such as existed when these two respondents offered their assistance is entitled to expect that the authorities will adopt reasonable measures to protect the witness and if need be his family. The unchallenged evidence reviewed above brings me to the conclusion that the authorities failed to do what might reasonably have been expected of them in the circumstances facing each of these respondents and their family members.” 
        
       
      
    24 These observations are equally applicable to the present case. The Crown, however, has pointed to two circumstances which it argues provide an answer. First, there was here some independent evidence from a co-offender to the effect that the Respondent had engaged in prior discussions with A, and with other co-offenders, to the effect that he would not adhere to his undertaking, and would nominate another person in lieu of A.  
     
      
    25 Secondly, in the affidavit which was provided to the Court today there was no suggestion by the Respondent of any actual, that is express, threat made to him either in the prison van, or in the cell, by the man A, requiring him to change his evidence.26 Each proposition has some force, since it is important that a person in the position of the present Respondent not take advantage of a situation which did not actually place him under any feeling of pressure, or otherwise seek to manipulate the giving of an undertaking so as to escape any penalty in the event of his failure to comply with it.27 However, it seems to me that the case must be viewed against the reality of the position in which a potential witness, who is in custody finds himself if he is placed in the immediate vicinity of the accused. In circumstances such as that it seems to me that very little needs to be said by way of express threat.28 The implicit presence of a threat is obvious and the potential witness is in a situation where he has no control over his immediate safety, it being a matter which, so far as he can see, has not been properly addressed by those who are his immediate custodians. In those circumstances it appears to me that it would be entirely understandable if the Respondent felt under a considerable degree of pressure such that he might well wish to renege from the undertaking. 
     
      
       
      Delay 
       
      
    29 The Respondent next relied upon the time which has elapsed in the hearing of this appeal. He gave his undertaking on 13 May 2003, he was sentenced on 23 May 2003, and the Crown appeal was determined on 15 October 2003, leading to an increase in his sentence. He was not called to give evidence against A until December 2004, and the second Crown appeal was filed on 13 January 2005. He is now potentially facing re-sentence for a third time, that is, in March 2005 for an offence that was committed on 6 August 2001. In the meantime, his parole release eligibility date passed on 29 October 2004.  
     
      
       
      Discount to be forfeited 
       
      
    30 The Crown submitted that it should be assumed that the Respondent was given a discount for his plea and undertaking of 37.5%, that is, eight years reduced to 5 years. The discount for the plea on that basis have fallen within a range of between 15 and 25%, leaving a discount for assistance of between 12.5% and 22.5%, resulting in the head sentence being reduced, for that factor, by a period of between 12 months and 21.5 months, in round terms.  
     
      
    31 The Respondent did not accept this approach, contending that the notional starting point of 8 years would have been discounted by factors additional to that of assistance, including allowances for double jeopardy, for the plea, and for remorse and contrition, which in accordance with the observations of Spigelman CJ in R v Thompson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 388 at [62] may have resulted in a discount in excess of 25%.  
     
      
    32 Further, it was submitted that the allowance for assistance needed to be subdivided into past and future assistance, it only being the allowance for the last of these factors that should be lost on a s 5DA appeal.  
     
      
    33 While it was accepted that the value of the past assistance may not have been great, since the police already had information from others as to the identity of the offenders, nevertheless, it was argued, the contents of his ERISP were placed before the jury in so far as the terms of it were used as a basis for his cross-examination. 
     
      
    34 In that regard reference was made to R v El-Sayed (2003) 57 NSWLR 659, a case where the co-offender had been tried and convicted before the s 5DA appeal could be heard, in which Simpson J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “47. In considering what sentence should be imposed, however, I am of the view that some credit should be allowed to the respondent for his prior willingness to assist, but this is very limited indeed. Of more significance is the result of that willingness. Although the respondent did not honour his undertaking, and undoubtedly made a very poor witness, the fact that he had given information meant that, pursuant to s38 of the  
        Evidence Act 
        , his information was put before the jury. Whether it had any effect on the result is a matter on which this court should not speculate. Nevertheless, Krishna was convicted of three of the four charges on which he was indicted.” 
        
       
      
    35 However in R v Waqa  [2004] NSWCCA 405, Dunford J (with whom Simpson and Hidden JJ agreed) said that El-Sayed was not authority for a proposition that an allowance should always be made where an offender had failed to honour his undertaking, yet his statement had become admissible as evidence in the trial of another offender. As his Honour appropriately noted, each case must be determined “on its own facts”. 
     
      
    36 Finally, in support of the proposition that the discount for future assistance which had been given was likely to have been relatively small, attention was drawn to the conclusion of the sentencing judge that the Respondent's evidence before him had not been credible in a number of respects, and that any assistance which he might give in the forthcoming trial was likely to be quite limited, and to the acceptance of that assessment by this Court in the earlier appeal. 
     
      
    37 There is a good deal of merit in these submissions, particularly in so far as the purpose of a s 5DA appeal is not to punish a non-co operating offender, but to redress the situation where he or she has received a discount for future assistance which was not then delivered. 
     
      
    38 It is impossible in this case to determine precisely by what factor the sentence otherwise considered appropriate was reduced for this matter. All that can be safely assumed is that there was some discount for future assistance, which was in all probability relatively small, having regard to the assessment by the sentencing Judge, and by this Court on the prior appeal, as to its limited value.39 It may also be observed that having given inconsistent versions on oath in the sentencing proceedings and in the last trial, and being at risk of prosecution for false swearing, the Respondent’s evidence at any future trial would be worthless, so that the Crown would be properly entitled to regard him as an unreliable witness whom it would not be obliged to call.40 Each of the three matters identified, in particular the first, is a factor properly to be taken into account in the exercise of the Court’s discretion whether to intervene in this case.41 The Director of Public Prosecutions and the Correctional Authorities have a positive obligation to liaise in relation to prison inmates who are required by the Crown to give evidence in criminal trials. If there is not a protocol in place to achieve that result, then it should be put into place immediately so as to avoid any further bungle of this kind. It is not to be overlooked that a failure of this kind may not only jeopardise the outcome of the trial in respect of which the witness is required, but it may also become the occasion of a serious assault on the witness with potential consequences for his well being and for the state which may well have broadened its duty of care. 42 However, what is in my mind more persuasive and in favour of the Court declining to intervene is the circumstance that the Respondent has now served a period of approximately four and a half months since the expiry of his parole release eligibility date.43 It is evident from the material which has been provided from the Parole Board that the Respondent has behaved himself well in custody and has responded to therapeutic programmes so far as they have been made available to him. The current report is favourable for his release on suitable conditions for rehabilitation and counselling and it seems likely that it is the fact of the current Crown appeal which has, at least in part, been responsible for his continued detention.44 Given what would be a relatively small adjustment if the Court was to intervene to reverse the discount for the assistance which was promised but was not delivered, I am of the view that such adjustment would be so small as to amount to impermissible tinkering.45 It seems to me that the Respondent has been punished to some additional extent by reason of the time which he has spent in custody since 29 October 2004. Further, assuming perhaps a maximum allowance of 10% for this factor, the resulting adjustment in the head sentence and the non parole period would be insufficient to warrant appellate intervention. Accordingly, although I am firmly of the view that s 5DA should not be watered down in its application, I am equally satisfied that the present case is one where, in the exercise of its discretion, the Court should decline to intervene.46 I propose, accordingly, that the Crown appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    47 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.48 BUDDIN J: I also agree49 TOBIAS JA: The order of the Court will be as Wood CJ at CL proposes.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: On 10 March 2004 Jason Abhinay Sundar (the applicant) pleaded guilty to the charge that on 23 January 2003 at Cabramatta in the State of New South Wales, he did rob Rowan Pettigrew of his Health Care Card the property of Rowan Pettigrew in circumstances of aggravation, namely, at the time of the robbery he did use corporal violence on Rowan Pettigrew. The charge was preferred pursuant to s 95(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carried a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The sentencing judge, Judge Maguire, sentenced the applicant on 28 June 2004 to a term of five years imprisonment to commence on 28 March 2003 and expire on 27 March 2008. His Honour set a non-parole period of three years to commence on the same date and to expire on 27 March 2006. It is against that sentence that the applicant seeks leave to appeal to this Court. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    3 A statement of facts was tendered before the sentencing judge without objection and is set out in full in the remarks on sentence. I set out a summary of those facts taken from the Crown's written submissions (omitting footnotes): 
     
      
       
        
        ""5. The Applicant and another man, Sreng Taing, believed that the victim had ransacked the bedroom of Taing's mother on New Year's Eve 2002 and stolen some of Taing's sister's property including cash, jewellery and a mobile telephone. On 23 January 2003, the Applicant, who was in a relationship with Taing's sister, lured the victim from a drug intervention service centre in Cabramatta across the street to the backyard of a nearby set of units. The victim then saw Sreng Taing approaching and became worried. He tried to escape through a gap in the fence. Taing yelled ' 
        Grab him 
        ' and the Applicant tackled the victim to the ground and grabbed him by the hair. Both the Applicant and Taing hit and kneed the victim. The victim received a blow to the head and looked up to see that the Applicant had his wallet. The Applicant removed the victim's health care card and in effect warned him that he had one week in which to return the stolen property. Both offenders walked off. The Applicant left the wallet, but kep the health care card, which had the victim's address on it. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The victim returned to the drug centre and reported the matter. One of the staff members noticed that his clothes were covered in blood. An ambulance was called and the ambulance officer noted that the victim had multiple abrasions and swelling to his head. 
        
       
       
        
        7. He was taken to hospital suffering from grazing to the back of his head, multiple abrasions, dried blood in his nostrils and grazing to the forehead. He had also suffered stab wounds inflicted in the attack by Taing using a pocket knife that were sutured at the hospital, but these did not form part of the Crown case against the applicant. 
        
       
       
        
        8. The Applicant approached police as they were apprehending Taing on 7 February 2003 and later that day went to the police station and took part in an ERISP interview. He admitted his part in the matter and stated that he wanted to confront the victim over the stolen property and that he and Taing had ' 
        planned that if they saw Pettigrew they were  
        "" 
        going to make him remember what he did 
        "" '. He said that he let the victim runaway through a fence and that he was screaming out for help. He tackled the victim to the ground and ' 
        slapped him around a bit 
        '. He said that after he obtained the health care card, he told the victim that he was getting his address ' 
        because I may come and pay a visit at your house just to see if you come through with your side of the deal 
        '. "" 
        
       
      
    4 The applicant was originally charged with aggravated robbery in company with wounding to which he pleaded not guilty. He then pleaded guilty on 10 March 2004 to the subject charge that being the first occasion that that charge had been preferred by the Crown as an alternative count.  
     
      
       
      The subjective features of the applicant's case 
       
      
    5 The applicant did not give evidence on the sentencing hearing and a report by clinical psychologist Ms Katie Seidler dated 11 May 2004 largely constituted his subjective case. 
     
      
    6 The report stated that during his interview with Ms Seidler, the applicant was ""both scattered and tangential"" and was ""grandiose and odd in his presentation"". He informed Ms Seidler that his family had emigrated from Fiji to Australia and that his parents had run various family businesses. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was 31 at the time of sentence and single. He had no previous criminal history to speak of. Although he had been convicted of a number of offences in local courts, they all related to driving offences. 
     
      
    8 Although the applicant had consumed alcohol in his teens and indulged in a variety drugs (including long term use of cannabis to the time of his arrest) and weekend use of amphetamines, since being in custody he reported that his physical and mental condition had improved. He denied being addicted to drugs and was assessed as being of average verbal intelligence and above intellectual intelligence. 
     
      
    9 Ms Seidler at [31] of her report stated in summary form her conclusions: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In summary, Mr Sundar reported a concerning psychological history suggestive of psychosis and depression. In particular, this period of psychological instability appears to have coincided with the death of his mother, the failure of his businesses and the escalation in his drug use. It is unclear how based in reality Mr Sundar's history is and it is suggested that, on the basis of his presentation, Mr Sundar is grandiose and possibly somewhat delusional."" 
        
       
       
      The sentencing judge's remarks 
       
      
    10 As I have already observed, the Crown did not suggest either that the applicant knew that his co-offender was armed with a knife or that there had been any agreement between them that the victim would be wounded as part of the joint criminal enterprise. The sentencing judge referred to the ""relatively minor record"" of the applicant as relating to break, enter and steal, drug and driving offences. However, the particulars of his previous convictions dated 2 March 2005 do not, as already noted, include anything but five driving offences between September 1993 and February 2002. In any event, as the sentencing judge observed,  
     
      
       
        
        ""significantly he has no prior record of violence."" 
        
       
      
    11 The sentencing judge then set out the subjective matters to which I have referred which he said he had taken into account. In particular, he set out in extenso the report of Ms Seidler. His Honour concluded that the applicant's admissions to the police provided the prosecution with a case ""that otherwise scarcely existed"".  
     
      
    12 The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant was contrite and that what happened was not originally intended as a robbery but merely as an exercise intended to frighten Mr Pettigrew. He noted that a guilty plea had been entered in response to an indictment on a less serious charge and had been accepted by the Crown and had been taken into account by him on the question of sentence. He also noted the applicant's assistance to authorities which entitled him to a ""significant discount"". He then said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The community takes a serious view of crimes such as this and expects appropriate punishment. I perceive the need for deterrence. I am mindful of the guideline decision in  
        Henry 
        "" 
        
       
       
      being a reference to  
      R v Henry  
      (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at 380. 
       
      
    13 Being mindful of the principle of parity, the sentencing judge considered that the offence committed by the applicant's co-offender did not bear the same gravity as that committed by the applicant. In this respect his co-offender had been charged with malicious wounding in respect of which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for seven years. He was sentenced by his Honour to a term of three years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months. I should interpose that strictly speaking the principles of parity did not arise as the offenders were charged with different offences. Nevertheless the corporal violence committed by the applicant upon Mr Pettigrew was in my opinion of significantly less seriousness than that inflicted by his co-offender who struck the victim three times to the left side of his body and back with a knife. On the other hand, the corporal violence inflicted by the applicant (and his co-offender) was that he had ""hit and kneed him"". Of course, the other difference between the two offences was that the applicant had robbed Mr Pettigrew of his Health Care Card. It should be observed that, although he went through Mr Pettigrew's wallet, he took nothing else from it. 
     
      
    14 After indicating that he had taken into account the provisions of s 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act), his Honour said that in the present case rehabilitation loomed large. He considered that, given supervision, the applicant might well be helped to become a better citizen and would therefore benefit from an extended period of supervision which he regarded as amounting to special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Act. 
     
      
       
      Ground One – the sentencing judge had insufficient regard to the applicant's plea of guilty 
       
       
      Ground Two – the sentencing judge had insufficient regard to the evidence of the applicant's admissions and assistance to police 
       
      
    15 The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge did not make mention of the timeliness, nor the utilitarian value, of the applicant's plea of guilty. It was thus submitted that his Honour fell into error in not doing so given the difficulty of otherwise divining from the Remarks on Sentence what discount had in fact been attributed by his Honour to the plea.  
     
      
    16 The sentencing judge's reference to Henry relates to the Chief Justice's opinion (at 380 [165]) that sentences for an offence which had the characteristics identified by him in [162] of his judgment should generally fall between four and five years for the full term. Those seven characteristics in question which, if present, would justify a sentence within the range referred to, were as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) young offender with no or little criminal history; 
       
      (ii) weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; 
       
      (iii) limited degree of planning; 
       
      (iv) limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; 
       
      (v) victim in a vulnerable position such as shop keeper or taxi driver; 
       
      (vi) small amount taken; 
       
      (vii) plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. 
       
      
    17 It is now accepted doctrine that the seventh characteristic identified by the Chief Justice refers to a late plea (R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [30]) in respect of which the guideline range in Henry has been taken as having allowed a discount of only 10%. 
     
      
    18 The applicant therefore submitted that, in contrast to the seventh characteristic in Henry, where the plea of guilty has limited significance due to a strong Crown case and is to be taken as a late plea, in the present case the applicant's plea had a significant amount of utilitarian value because, as the sentencing judge observed, his admissions to the police provided the prosecution with a case that otherwise scarcely existed and be pleaded as soon as the Crown preferred the lesser or alternative charge.  
     
      
    19 So far as the applicant's guilty plea was concerned in terms of its utilitarian value, it was submitted that if one assumes (as one must) that the plea of guilty in Henry would result in a 10% discount for utility, in the present case the applicant was entitled to an additional 15% taking him to the top of the range enunciated in R v Thompson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 of 25%. It was further submitted that the applicant was entitled to a discount in the order of 10% for contrition alone (as distinct from the discount for assistance and admissions) which would result in an overall 25% reduction in the Henry guideline resulting in a range of sentence (before consideration of other mitigating factors) of three years to three years nine months. Assuming the sentencing judge discounted the sentence imposed by 30% for utility, contrition and assistance, this represented a starting point of seven years which, it was submitted, was manifestly excessive in the circumstances.  
     
      
    20 The applicant further submitted that, although the sentencing judge stated that the applicant was entitled to a ""significant discount"" for his assistance to the authorities, the severity of the sentence imposed did not reflect such a discount. Furthermore, it was submitted that his Honour did not have regard to the provisions of s 23 of the Act which required regard to be had to ""the usefulness of the offender's assistance"" (s 23(2)(b)), ""the truthfulness, completeness or reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender"" (s 23(2)(c)) and ""the likelihood that the offender will commit further offences after release"" (s 23(2)(j)). 
     
      
    21 The Crown submitted that a plea of guilty at the first opportunity available to a lesser count offered by the Crown did not lead automatically to the maximum discount for the utilitarian value of the plea: see R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 per Hodgson JA at [5] and [6]; R v SY & Anor [2003] NSWCCA 291 per Howie J (with whom Ipp JA and Whealy J agreed) at [86]-[87]. 
     
      
    22 It is not entirely clear from the evidence in the present case whether, to adopt what Howie J said in SY at [86], this case is an occasion where the nature of the bargain struck between the applicant and the Crown indicates that the former could not reasonably have been expected to have pleaded guilty before the opportunity was presented for him to plead to the less serious charge. Nevertheless the charge to which the applicant pleaded not guilty was that of aggravated robbery in company with wounding. The Crown conceded that the applicant was unaware that his co-offender was armed with a knife and that there was no agreement that the co-offender would wound the victim as part of any joint criminal enterprise. In these circumstances, it seems to me that in all probability the applicant did plead guilty at the first opportunity to a lesser offence in circumstances where he could not reasonably have been expected to plead guilty to the more serious offence with which he was originally charged and to which he had pleaded not guilty. Accordingly, it behoved the sentencing judge to look at the situation realistically, as Howie J noted in SY, in determining the value of the plea on a utilitarian basis. 
     
      
    23 The problem, of course, is that a reading of the Remarks on Sentence does not assist in determining the extent to which the sentencing judge allowed for the utilitarian value of the plea. However, given a head sentence of five years' imprisonment, which is the top of the range, referred to in Henry, the extent of the discount could not have been significant. As in my opinion the applicant's plea should be regarded as an early plea, he was entitled to a discount exceeding 10%. 
     
      
    24 Although, as I have pointed out, sentencing judges are not obliged to state the amount of the discount, nevertheless they are encouraged to do so lest it be concluded that inadequate weight was given to the plea. As to the applicant's admissions and assistance to the police, the sentencing judge accepted that his assistance to the authorities entitled him to a ""significant discount"" as his admissions to the police provided the prosecution ""with a case that otherwise scarcely existed"".  
     
      
    25 The Crown submitted that, on the authority of R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603, it could not necessarily be said that in the present case the applicant ""voluntarily"" came forward in circumstances where otherwise his criminality would not have been detected. It further submitted that the police had approached his co-offender and were taking him away and the applicant may well have feared that his co-offender would have revealed both his identity and his participation in the offence. It is therefore submitted that it is clear that the applicant did not approach the authorities ""out of the blue"" through a ""guilty conscience"". 
     
      
    26 The problem with the foregoing submissions is that they appear to have been rejected by the sentencing judge. As I have observed, his Honour considered that the applicant's admissions to the police provided the prosecution with a case that otherwise scarcely existed. He therefore considered that his assistance to the authorities entitled him to a significant discount. Having made those findings, as well as a finding that the applicant was contrite and that what happened was not originally intended as a robbery but merely as an exercise to frighten the victim, it is difficult to appreciate the extent to which his Honour provided the significant discounts to which he said the applicant was entitled given that he imposed a head sentence of five years.  
     
      
    27 In my opinion, the sentence so imposed by his Honour reflects a failure to provide the discounts to which his Honour accepted the applicant was in fact entitled. It follows that the sentencing discretion exercise by his Honour miscarried. 
     
      
       
      Ground Three – the sentencing judge erred in an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence 
       
      
    28 This ground overlaps to a significant degree with the first two grounds. The Crown submitted that the guideline judgment in Henry was applicable to the subject offence and indicated that a full term of four to five years' imprisonment was appropriate as a starting point for what it submitted was a late plea of guilty for the commonly recurring case identified in the guideline. The Crown further submitted that the present case was aggravated in two respects. The first was that the actual violence used was considerable. It was submitted that the applicant tackled the victim to the ground and grabbed him by the hair whereupon he was grabbed by both offenders who hit and kneed him. As a consequence, he suffered multiple abrasions, swelling to his face, a bloodied nose and a grazed forehead. Secondly, it was submitted that there was significant degree of planning in that the victim was identified by the applicant outside the drug centre and ""lured"" away by him to another location. Finally, it was submitted that the taking of Mr Pettigrew's Health Care Card was significant because it had his address on it and in fact that was the reason the applicant took it. In any event, although of little, if any, value to anyone else (including the applicant), it was of value to its owner. 
     
      
    29 The sentencing judge described the offence to which the applicant's co-offender had pleaded guilty as a ""nasty crime"" but not one as serious as that committed by the applicant. He reflected this consideration in imposing a sentence of three years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months upon the co-offender. Although the applicant tackled Mr Pettigrew, grabbed him by the hair and then, in company with the co-offender hit and kneed him, that was the extent of the corporal violence he visited upon the victim. On the other hand, as I have already observed, his co-offender, as well as grabbing the victim, and then hitting and kneeing him, produced a knife and stabbed him three times. It is difficult in these circumstances when considering the respective objective seriousness of the offences committed by each offender to justify the comment that the offence committed by the applicant's co-offender was not as serious as that of the applicant at least so far as the element of violence was concerned. That is not to say that the applicant's conduct was not objectively serious: only that that of his co-offender exceeded it. 
     
      
    30 Of course, the major difference between the two offences is that the applicant robbed the victim of his Health Care Card. It was that action (which his Honour found was not planned) that attracted the offence of robbery. But one must be careful in the particular circumstances of this case not to use the word ""robbery"" in a pejorative sense. As I have noted, the sentencing judge accepted that what happened was not originally intended as a robbery but merely an exercise intended to frighten the victim.  
     
      
    31 In light of the foregoing observations, one can contrast the present circumstances with the seven characteristics identified by the Chief Justice in Henry as generally justifying a head sentence of between four and five years: 
     
      
       
      (i) Although the applicant was not young (being 30 years old at the time of the offence) he had no relevant criminal history; 
       
       
      (ii) As far as the applicant was concerned, no weapon was involved; 
       
       
      (iii) Although there was a limited degree of planning to frighten the victim, there was no plan to rob him; 
       
       
      (iv) So far as the applicant was concerned, there was limited actual violence inflicted by him upon the victim; 
       
       
      (v) The victim was not in a vulnerable position such as a shop keeper or taxi driver; 
       
       
      (vi) No money was taken from the victim, only his Health Care Card which was no doubt replaceable; 
       
       
      (vii) The applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and the significance of that plea was not limited by a strong Crown case. 
       
      
    32 It was made clear by the Chief Justice in Henry (at 381, [169]) that both aggravating and mitigating factors may justify a sentence below or above the range of between four and five years which was to be the starting point in a case which attracted the seven characteristics he had identified.  
     
      
    33 In the present case the sentencing judge has imposed a term of five years in circumstances where nearly all of the seven characteristics, which would otherwise justify a starting sentence of four to five years, are missing. The Crown points to only two aggravating features, namely, that actual violence was inflicted by the applicant and that there was a significant degree of planning. It is true that actual violence was used but not correct that there was a significant degree of planning in terms of the robbery. The sentencing judge's finding was to the contrary.  
     
      
    34 In my opinion, the objective seriousness of the subject offence is not as great as that the subject of the guideline judgment in Henry. In these circumstances, it is clear to me that the head sentence of five years' imprisonment was manifestly excessive. It must therefore be quashed.  
     
      
       
      Re-sentencing the applicant 
       
      
    35 This finding requires the Court to re-sentence the applicant. Given the considerations to which I have referred, in my opinion an appropriate head sentence would be three years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. I would therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
     (1) Leave to appeal granted; 
     
      
     (2) Appeal allowed and the sentence imposed on the applicant by Judge Maguire on 28 June 2004 be quashed; 
     
      
     (3) In lieu of the sentence imposed by Judge Maguire, the applicant be sentenced to a term of three years' imprisonment to commence on 28 March 2003 and expire on 27 March 2006 with a non-parole period of two years to commence on 28 March 2003 and expire on 27 March 2005; (4) Direct that the applicant be released to parole on the expiry of the non-parole period on 27 March 2005.

     Judgment 
      
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I will ask Grove J to give the first judgment. 
    2 GROVE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Ducker ADCJ at Lismore District Court on 29 May 2003. On 26 May 2003 the applicant was to be presented for trial at that court on an indictment charging that he attempted to strangle Debera Bell with intent to murder her contrary to s 29 of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the prescribed maximum penalty is twenty five years imprisonment. On arraignment the applicant pleaded guilty and his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment of four years with a non parole period of two years and six months. The earliest date of eligibility of the applicant for release is 28 November 2005.  
     
      
    3 The facts of the offence were put before the Court in an agreed statement signed by the Crown Prosecutor. The content of that statement was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Michael Bell and Debera Bell were involved in a defacto relationship for about 13 years. As a result of the relationship, they have two children, Keira Bell (born 6/5/90) and Jacob Bell (born 10/7/92). Both parties still reside in the same house however they have been separated for about 18 months. 
        
       
       
        
        Since the breakdown of the relationship, there have been a number of ongoing problems between Michael Bell and Debera Bell. The problems have related to Debera Bell frequently being absent from home for Army Reserve training, family law issues and child support issues. 
        
       
       
        
        About 4.45pm on Tuesday 21 May 2002, Debera Bell rang Michael Bell at his work requesting he mind their children for the evening whist she attend Army Reserve training at Lismore. Debera Bell then arrived at Michael Bell’s work place at about 5.10pm where an argument took place over him still being at work. Debera Bell then conveyed Michael Bell home with a heated argument occurring along the way. 
        
       
       
        
        After arriving at home, Michael Bell drove the children to the Casino RSM (sic) Club, where he purchased a carton of VB full strength beer stubbies. Debera Bell left a short time later for her training. 
        
       
       
        
        Debera Bell returned home about 10pm the same night. Michael Bell upon seeing her arrive slammed the front door shut. Debera Bell entered the house and went to her bedroom, which is in the middle of the premises where she started to get undressed. Michael Bell walked into the room a number of times where he attempted to bait Debera Bell into an argument. 
        
       
       
        
        On a number of occasions, Michael Bell held his hands out in front of his body and then moved them towards her as if he was going to touch her and then he said, ‘That would be an assault’. This occurred a number of times before Debera Bell decided to contact police. Debera Bell then pushed past Michael Bell and walked into the kitchen/dining room area of the house where she picked up the phone and dialled ‘000’. Prior to speaking to the operator, Michael Bell grabbed Debera Bell’s hand, which was holding the phone, and he forced the received back onto the hook. 
        
       
       
        
        Michael Bell then grabbed Debera Bell around the throat using both hands and exerted pressure to force Debera Bell to the floor. 
        
       
       
        
        Michael Bell then sat on Debera Bell’s chest and continued choking her, adjusting his grip so that his thumbs blocked off the trachea below the voice box, thereby not allowing her to breathe. 
        
       
       
        
        According to Michael Bell, he was choking Debera Bell in the method he had been trained when serving in the Army Reserve, and in order to choke her to death. After an estimated 10 to 15 seconds of Michael Bell choking Debera Bell, Michael Bell stated that Debera Bell’s face starting turning blue. 
        
       
       
        
        At that time, their 11-year-old son Jacob heard the commotion and came running into the kitchen area, screaming for Michael Bell to cease the assault. Michael Bell at this time ceased his assault upon Debera Bell by letting go of her throat. Debera Bell then managed to get up off the floor and she went back to her bedroom where she started crying uncontrollably. Michael Bell then contacted police via ‘000’ where he stated, ‘I want to be charged’ and he agreed that he had assaulted his wife. 
        
       
       
        
        Police attended at about 11pm where they were met by Michael Bell at the front of the house. Michael Bell at this time stated that he had tried to kill his wife by choking her. Police entered the house and located Debera Bell in her bedroom still crying uncontrollably. 
        
       
       
        
        Police then placed Michael Bell under arrest and cautioned him. Attending ambulance officers treated Debera Bell. 
        
       
       
        
        Michael Bell was subsequently conveyed to Casino Police Station where he was submitted to custody requirements. Michael Bell was then electronically interviewed in relation to the matter, during which time he stated he had thought of killing the victim earlier that afternoon and had dreamt of it, the previous night. Michael Bell stated he had intended to choke Debera Bell to death and fully knew what he was doing, having formerly been trained in weaponless techniques during his 26 years of Army service. Michael Bell indicated that the reason why he ceased the assault was because of the intervention of Jacob. Michael Bell also stated that he is suffering post traumatic stress disorder arising from unsuccessfully performing CPR on a drowning child in Casino in 2001. Michael Bell indicated this may have partially acted on his mind at the time of the incident, however, he was aware what he was doing and the likely outcome. 
        
       
       
        
        Michael Bell was then charged with the matters now before the Court. In relation to the incident, Debera Bell suffered soreness to the neck and throat areas, a minor graze next to her left eye and a lump to the back of the head. Michael Bell suffered no injuries.” 
        
       
      
    4 This morning there has been tendered to the Court an affidavit by a solicitor now acting for the applicant who did not act for him at the proceedings below. That affidavit exhibits a letter to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions suggesting that examination of papers appears to indicate that a statement made by the victim had not been served. There is no response to that letter other than the supply of a statement apparently made on 1 July 2002, in the course of which the victim is recorded as stating that she did not believe now that the applicant was trying to kill her and she expressed some views about what charges might be brought against him. Of course, by that time the applicant had been charged with the offence to which he ultimately pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    5 It might also be observed in passing that a Victim Impact Statement made on 28 May 2003, that is to say about nine months after the statement to which I have just made reference, included remarks by the victim in which she affirms that she thought that the applicant was going to kill her. More important, for the purposes of these proceedings, are the matters set out in the agreed statement of facts which includes repeated admissions by the applicant that it was, indeed, his intention at the time to kill the victim. 
     
      
    6 The applicant’s prior record included a conviction for assaulting a female recorded at Grafton Petty Sessions in December 1984. The victim was the applicant’s former wife. The facts of this offence were before the learned sentencing judge, who observed that it was a matter of “some concern”. At the relevant time he was restrained by a court order from not approaching his wife, however, he saw her enter a home in the company of another man and he entered and assaulted her by punching her in the face three or four times and twisting her arm up her back. As she tried to flee he jammed her fingers in a door. He was released on recognizance to be of good behaviour for twelve months and he kept that recognizance. 
     
      
    7 The Crown Prosecutor has drawn attention to the subsequent imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for six months at Casino Local Court for contravening an apprehended domestic violence order which was in place in favour of Debera Bell. The breach had occurred about two months before the applicant was before the Court on the current matter. The sentence would have been served concurrently with part of the sentence imposed by Ducker ADCJ. 
     
      
    8 Two grounds of appeal are relied upon on behalf of the applicant. The first contends that: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour did not take further into account aspects relevant to the decision in ( 
        R v Ellis 
         1986 6 NSWLR 603)”. 
        
       
      
    9 In Ellis, Street CJ (with whom Hunt and Allen JJ agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “When the conviction follows upon a plea of guilty, that itself is the result of a voluntary disclosure of guilt by the person concerned, a further element of leniency enters into the sentencing decision. Where it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, then a considerable element of leniency should properly be extended by the sentencing judge. It is part of the police of the criminal law to encourage a guilty person to come forward and disclose both the fact of an offence having been committed and confession of guilt of that offence. 
        
       
       
        
        The leniency that follows a confession of guilt in the form of a plea of guilty is a well recognised part of the body of principles that cover sentencing. Although less well recognised, because less frequently encountered, the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned”. 
        
       
      
    10 With reference to those remarks McHugh J in Ryan v The Queen 2001 206 CLR 267 @ 272 observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Thus, according to  
        Ellis 
        , the degree of leniency to be shown for the disclosure of unknown offences will vary according to (1) the likelihood that the offences would have been discovered by the authorities; and (2) the likelihood that the offences could have been proven beyond reasonable doubt in a court without the disclosure”. 
        
       
      
    11 The second element of McHugh J’s observation is pertinent to the present case. As the sentencing judge observed, it was the forthrightness of the applicant in disclosing, and repeatedly disclosing, his homicidal intention, which enabled the Crown to advance a case charging the more serious rather than a lesser offence which could have been proved by the objective circumstances and without the disclosure.  
     
      
    12 However, the issue raised by the ground is whether his Honour’s assessment of sentence appropriately reflected the degree of leniency to which the applicant was entitled, having regard to his confessional concession. His Honour made express reference to what he found was the likelihood that the applicant would have been charged with a lesser offence but for the revelation of his express intention, and in that context said: 
     
      
       
        
        “His plea of guilty, I think, should benefit him with considerable leniency”. 
        
       
       
      He also assessed the applicant’s conduct in this regard as a positive demonstration of remorse. It is true, as submitted, that his Honour made no specific reference to what was said in  
      Ellis 
       but I do not regard this as a matter for criticism. The primary purpose of remarks on sentence is to enable an offender to understand the reasons why the sentence is being passed, and to record those reasons. The recitation of authority by a sentencing judge offers a secondary contribution to those purposes. The issue is whether his Honour took into account requisite matters in his assessment of sentence and his remarks reveal that he did. This ground is not made out. 
       
      
    13 The second ground asserts that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    14 Counsel for the applicant summarized some relevant factual findings by the sentencing judge. The injuries sustained by the victim appeared to have been of a transient kind and are described in the extract of agreed facts above set out. Once he had desisted from the attack the applicant acted swiftly to get help and contacted the police. By the time he appeared for sentence the parties had gone to live in different towns. 
     
      
    15 His Honour paid considerable attention to a detailed psychiatric report which observed the applicant’s history of becoming increasingly distressed, depressed, frustrated and despairing and the effect upon his ability to cope with these things of an experience in 2001 when he had failed to revive a drowned child whom he had sought to rescue from a pond close to his home. The child, to whom he had administered CPR, was later found to have a broken rib, and although he had been told that he was not responsible for this he was stressed by thoughts that he was in fact responsible. The psychiatrist, Dr Delaforce observed, “by nature he is a man predisposed to experiencing excessive guilt”. However, his Honour noted that he did not totally share the doctor’s confidence that there would be no other such emotional event as that which had him before the Court.  
     
      
    16 As the specification of the sentence shows, his Honour departed from the statutory formula in favour of the applicant as a consequence of his finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    17 The ultimate question therefore is whether the sentence was manifestly excessive. The offence was extremely serious having regard to its intentional homicidal element and what the applicant was entitled to was some leniency for his voluntary disclosure of his intention, but that does not extinguish his responsibility for commission of that crime and reduce it to something less. What he was entitled to, as was observed in relation to the first ground, was a measure of leniency by reason of his disclosure. I do not perceive that a sentence of four years imprisonment for attempting to strangle another with intent to kill, giving full weight to all favourable subjective circumstances, to be manifestly excessive. The imposition reflects a sound exercise of discretionary sentencing judgment. 
     
      
    18 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on him by her Honour Judge Hock in the District Court sitting in Sydney. 
     
      
    2 The Applicant had pleaded guilty to three charges: 
     
      
    · One count of robbery armed with a dangerous weapon: Crimes Act 1900, s97(2), maximum penalty imprisonment for 25 years. 
     
      
    · One count of discharge firearm in a public place: Crimes Act 1900, s93G(1)(b), maximum penalty imprisonment for 10 years. 
     
      
    · One count of take and drive conveyance without consent of owner: Crimes Act 1900, s154A, maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years. 
     
      
    3 A further three associated offences were taken into account on a Form 1, namely robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon and custody of a firearm in a public place.  
     
      
    4 The Applicant pleaded guilty to all charges at the Bidura Children’s Court on 13 January 2004. Her Honour imposed fixed terms of imprisonment of three years and 12 months, respectively, for Counts 2 and 3, and a term of imprisonment of six years and six months with a non-parole period of three years and six months on Count 1, taking into account the Form 1 offences. All sentences were concurrent, to commence on 24 September 2003. The non-parole period was ordered to be served in a Juvenile Detention Centre. 
     
      
    5 The Applicant was sentenced at the same time as a juvenile co-offender, BH, who pleaded guilty to exactly the same charges, with the same matters to be taken into account on the Form 1. The only issue raised on this application is an issue of parity.  
     
      
    6 Ms A Francis, who appeared for the Applicant, submitted that her Honour erred in imposing sentences on the Applicant identical to those she imposed on the co-offender. Ms Francis submitted that although the objective gravity of the offence was the same in each case, the subjective features of the Applicant were much stronger than those of his co-offender and, accordingly, sentences in identical terms gave rise to a legitimate sense of grievance and offended the parity principle.  
     
      
    7 The factual background of the offences was set out by her Honour in her remarks on sentence in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “… at about 2.40am on Wednesday 24 September 2003 the offenders, both aged seventeen entered the Orchard Tavern, licensed premises at Chatswood. [SB] was in possession of a loaded silver .22 calibre pistol. [BH] was armed with a knife. [SB] had his face disguised with a balaclava and [BH] wore a baseball cap and a yellow bandanna. 
        
       
       
        
        The offenders went into the main bar area of the tavern. One of them yelled out ‘Get down on the floor, get on the floor, this is a robbery’. The gun was brandished by [SB] and held at the back of the head of the security officer Mr Pohe. There were about five staff members and approximately ten customers in the area, who immediately dropped to the floor as instructed. The manager Mr Michael Kirk was taken at gunpoint to the safe by [SB] who filled the bag with coins and notes. He then asked where the rest of the money was and was told it was in the poker machines in the gaming area. They moved to that area and on the way [SB] took a surveillance tape which recorded the events. I have viewed that tape. 
        
       
       
        
        In the gaming area a number of poker machines were opened by Mr Kirk and the money collected by [SB]. At some stage [BH] took the gun and held it at the back of the barman, Mr Benjamin Smith’s head almost touching it, thereby forcing him to open the till and remove the money. This is the first matter on the Form one. During the robbery a Mr J Kim was robbed at knifepoint of a mobile phone. This is the second matter on the Form one. As they left the premises [BH] discharged one round from the pistol and the bullet lodged in the ceiling. This is the second charge. 
        
       
       
        
        While the robbery had been in progress, unbeknown to the offenders, staff members and patrons had managed to alert the police who were present in Orchard Street when the two offenders left the tavern. They tried to make their escape in a car which had been stolen from Homebush after 10.50pm on 23 September 2003. This is the third charge.” 
        
       
      
    8 Her Honour identified a range of relevant factors concerning the objective gravity of the offence in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Aggravating features of the first offence are the large number of people terrorised and placed in fear of their lives, the fact that the weapon was loaded and discharged, the fact that the robbery was committed in company and the evidence of planning involved, including the use of a stolen car. In addition, both offenders were on probation at the time of the commission of these offences which is a further aggravating feature in each case.” 
        
       
      
    9 Her Honour also observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am completely unimpressed by the submission that is was unlikely that the discharge of the weapon into the ceiling would have hurt anyone. To take a weapon, loaded with eight rounds indicates a preparedness to use it as did in fact eventuate, with fortunately no injury to any civilian. Similarly [BH's] evidence that he was scared and did his best to keep the people calm displays in my view an astonishing lack of insight into his responsibility for exposing innocent members of the public to what research has found, unsurprisingly, to be perceived as a serious life threatening incident which not infrequently results in grave and continuing psychological consequences for the victims.” 
        
       
      
    10 As it is the comparative significance of the subjective features which are the focus of this appeal, I will set out in full her Honour’s consideration of those subjective features: 
     
      
       
        
        “I turn to consider matters subjective to each offender. [BH's] date of birth is 23 July 1986 and he is therefore now seventeen years and nine months old. He had only turned seventeen two months before he committed these offences. He is the fourth of seven children, all of whom live in the family home with their mother and father. His family is supportive of him and he is the only child who has had problems with the law. These appear to have begun at about age thirteen when he began to smoke cannabis. His use escalated to daily smoking by age fourteen and fifteen. He progressed to using amphetamines and Ecstasy. His schooling suffered and he was asked to leave several high schools because of his disruptive behaviour. Dr Olav Nielssen forensic psychiatrist assessed his intelligence to be in the normal range. His psychiatric diagnosis was that the offender had conduct disorder, substance abuse disorder and pathological gambling. He assessed the offender to be ‘capable of participating in learning based rehabilitation programs and education. Further counselling for substance abuse and gambling and also to promote personal maturity is recommended. His prospects of adapting to a law abiding way of life are also likely to be improved by vocational training whilst in custody’. Dr Nielssen also expressed the opinion that [BH’s] prognosis was guarded in view of his record. The offender said in evidence, which I accept, that he was affected by alcohol and cannabis at the time of this offence. I do not however accept his evidence that he did not know how serious these matters were at the time he committed these offences. 
        
       
       
        
        In respect of the criminal histories of each offender, it is difficult to accurately determine all the offences for which each offender has been dealt with previously as they have been dealt with by the Children’s Court. However, it is clear on the material before me that [BH] has been involved with the Department of Juvenile Justice since 2000 when he was only thirteen years old. He was first remanded in a detention centre in 2002 at age fifteen. He left the country whilst subject to a probation order and unfortunately it seems his family deliberately misinformed the juvenile justice officers as to his plans. The Department was not expecting him back until December 2003 and his supervision was suspended. Clearly he came back earlier than expected and these events in September 2003 brought him to the attention of the authorities yet again. His response to custody since his arrest has been poor. However, the background report of his juvenile justice officer is not entirely bleak. He expressed this opinion at p 6. ‘Given [BH's] personality and leadership qualities he has the potential and the ability to succeed should he focus on pro-social goals’. 
        
       
       
        
        Turning now to [SB]; he was born on 9 March 1986 and was therefore seventeen and a half at the time of this offence and is now over eighteen. He too comes from a close and supportive family and he is the youngest of four children. He was educated to year nine and also had difficulties making the transition to high school He was working as a panel beater prior to being remanded in custody and his employer said he was a hard worker and that he would have a job available to him once he was released. Like his co-offender, [SB] has a history of substance abuse. He began smoking marijuana at the age of fourteen and progressed to ecstasy at age fifteen. About a month before these offences he began to use crystal methamphetamine (ice) on a daily basis. He said in evidence, which I accept, he was affected by this drug at the time of the robbery. Since being remanded in custody his conduct could fairly be described as exemplary. He is studying for Year ten and has attended all classes that he possibly can and has made excellent progress. 
        
       
       
        
        I heard from his juvenile justice officer Mr Cornell that he has recognised when he needs assistance with anger management and has referred himself for counselling when he feels stressed. Mr Cornell said in evidence that [SB’s] unit manager described him as a leader and a mentor to younger boys. He has been willing to participate in individual and group counselling to address his offending behaviour, for example drug use, gambling and negative peer group. His psychologist said ‘His willingness to address these issues demonstrates a level of responsibility for his actions and a motivation to change his lifestyle to one that is free of drugs and crime (see p 5 of the Juvenile Justice background report). He has also re-embraced his religion from which he derives guidance and comfort. 
        
       
       
        
        His involvement with the Department of Juvenile Justice dates back to July 2001. Over the two year period before he committed this offence he had been subject to several orders for intervention of the service including probation and community service orders. Prior to his present incarceration he recognised that his response to supervision had been poor. As previously noted this is in marked contrast to his present attitude to the assistance available to him.” 
        
       
      
    11 Her Honour also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the case of the offender [BH] the special circumstances are the availability of appropriate services and programs in the juvenile justice system and his potential for leadership if he avails himself of this opportunity. While at this stage in my view his prospects for rehabilitation are more guarded than [SB’s] he should be given a further opportunity to avail himself of the intensive assistance provided by the juvenile justice system. Such a course is in the interest of the community and the offender. I have hesitated in [BH’s] case due to the ambivalent reports prepared in respect of him and his disruptive conduct from time to time so far. Should he choose not to take advantage of this course and becomes a disruptive influence in the juvenile justice system rather than using his personal qualities for good, he must anticipate that the power to remove him under s 28 of the  
        Children (Detention Centre Act  
        1987) to which counsel drew my attention would be exercised.” 
        
       
      
    12 Her Honour also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I find special circumstances in each case, namely the offender’s age and the likelihood that each would benefit from a longer period of supervision to foster his rehabilitation.” 
        
       
      
    13 Ms A Francis submitted that the sentencing judge did not make any distinction between the objective criminality of the offenders and, in that regard, the Applicant did not contend that the sentencing judge fell into error. However, her Honour’s findings that BH had responded poorly since his arrest was in direct contrast with the Applicant’s rehabilitation and change in attitude. Ms Francis submitted that the sentencing judge did not explain why the subjective features which she found in the case of the Applicant, but not in the case of the co-offender, did not lead to a greater degree of leniency, particularly with respect to the imposition of a non-parole period. Ms Francis submitted that a number of provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which were applicable to the Applicant were not applicable to the co-offender particularly: 
     
      
       
        
        “21A(3) … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) the offender is unlikely to re-offend, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (h) the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender’s age or otherwise, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the offender has shown remorse for the offence by making reparation for any injury, loss or damage or in any other matter, … ” 
          
         
        
       
      
    14 On this basis the Applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance with the consequence that the exercise of discretion by her Honour miscarried and that this Court should intervene. 
     
      
    15 The Crown in its submissions drew particular attention to her Honour’s express recognition that the progress of the two offenders towards rehabilitation was not identical. The Crown emphasised that her Honour did, however, equate their future prospects in the following passage which, I repeat: 
     
      
       
        
        “While at this stage in my view (the co-offender’s) prospects are more guarded than (the Applicant’s) he should be given a further opportunity to avail himself of the intensive assistance provided by the juvenile justice system.” 
        
       
      
    16 The Crown also drew attention to the fact that there was the Juvenile Justice Background Report relevantly indicating that at an earlier time the co-offender’s response to the supervision was positive, that he had made some attempts to stay out of trouble and that he appeared to have recognised difficulties created for him and was ready to address the issues. The Crown also drew attention to the fact that in the past, i.e. before the current custodial period, the Applicant had not shown consistently positive responses to a process of supervision. 
     
      
    17 The Crown submitted that all of the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 did apply to both offenders, but that they applied in somewhat different ways. Specifically, the Crown submitted that the co-offender did have reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, although his progress in that regard may not have been as advanced as that of the Applicant. The Court, the Crown submitted, must be concerned with promoting future rehabilitation of the offender as s3A(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 sets out. This factor is particularly significant when offences are committed by juveniles (R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112). 
     
      
    18 The Crown submitted that the most important subjective feature in the present case was the youth of both offenders. It submitted that the differences in their rehabilitative prospects were not such as to warrant different sentences. The Applicant’s past progress towards rehabilitation whilst in custody did not, it was submitted, necessarily offset the co-offender’s potential to achieve rehabilitation. 
     
      
    19 In my opinion, her Honour outlined the relevant issues in considerable detail. Her reasons are factually correct and reasonably balanced. However, she did equate the prospects of rehabilitation of the two co-offenders in general terms. 
     
      
    20 The two particularly significant elements in the exercise of the discretion, going to the subjective features of the two offenders, were those identified by Ms Francis, particularly s21A(3)(g) and s21A(3)(h). The third matter to which Ms Francis referred was the manifestation of remorse in s21A(3)(i). I do not see that there is any material difference between the two offenders in this respect. 
     
      
    21 It was open to her Honour to find that each of the offenders was unlikely to re-offend and that each of the offenders had good prospects of rehabilitation. It is true that, at least with respect to the immediately preceding period, the Applicant had shown a greater responsiveness to his offending history, and one could say that, on the basis of that experience alone, he had manifested up to that point of time a degree of rehabilitation that had not been manifest by the co-offender. As the Crown pointed out, with respect to a previous period, the situation of the two co-offenders was, in fact, the reverse, i.e. the co-offender had shown greater prospects of rehabilitation than the Applicant. In neither case did such prospects as were then displayed prove to be accurate, as the offences now before the Court indicate. 
     
      
    22 The process of making a predictive judgment about future offending and prospects of rehabilitation is always a difficult one. The judgment that her Honour made, that in that respect the two offenders were to be assessed on a basis of comparative equality was, in my opinion, a judgment that was open to her Honour to make. In those circumstances, I do not believe that the parity principle has been offended or that the Applicant now before the Court has a legitimate sense of grievance in accordance with the authorities. 
     
      
    23 In my opinion leave to appeal should be granted, but the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    24 GROVE J: I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice and the reasons which he has given. 
     
      
    25 BELL J: I also agree.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed in the District Court by Sorby DCJ. 
     
      
    2 The applicant had pleaded guilty to a number of charges when presented in the Local Court and he was committed for sentence. Due to technical irregularities some matters were the subject of re-presentment on indictment but the applicant had effectively admitted his guilt at the earliest opportunity. 
     
      
    3 The first set of charges dealt with on committal for sentence arose out of his participation in a robbery at the Victoria Hotel, Annandale shortly after 1 am on 24 February 2002. The substantive charges were robbery in company (the victim being Mr Colin Hindmarch) and assault (the victim being Mr Alan McIlveen). Taken into account on a Form 1 were four further charges namely robbery in company of Mr McIlveen, assault with intent to rob Leslie Brock; assault with intent to rob Kate Brock, and assault of Leslie Brock. 
     
      
    4 The applicant and an unidentified co-offender entered the hotel, which was closed, but there were then present staff members and some friends of theirs. The offenders claimed to be armed with a gun but it does not appear that a gun was produced. Nevertheless, under the constraints of such representation, Mr Hindmarch was forced to hand over cash holdings of the hotel amounting to over $40,000. 
     
      
    5 The assault of Mr McIlveen followed his compliance with a direction to empty his pockets, during which he produced a set of car keys. The applicant repeatedly asked him where the car was and Mr McIlveen responded on each occasion that it was at Randwick. These responses were met by the applicant punching him about the head and in the face with a closed fist. 
     
      
    6 On the Form 1 matters, the charge of robbery in company of Mr McIlveen involved taking his watch and about $100 in cash. The assaults with intent to rob each of Leslie and Kate Brock involved corporal violence and demands that the victims give up everything they had. It would appear that before taking anything, the offenders became distracted by the larger loot available from the cash holdings of the hotel, which included poker machine receipts and the contents of an automatic teller machine.  
     
      
    7 The assault on Leslie Brock scheduled in the Form 1 occurred as the applicant punched and slapped him and then kicked him in the stomach, extracting a response that he would say nothing to police. Mr Brock was a barman employed at the hotel. 
     
      
    8 The second set of charges arose out of events shortly after 10 pm on 3 June 2002 at the Smithfield Tavern, Smithfield. The first count charged armed robbery of Nadene Heaphy. She was an assistant manager at the tavern. The weapon involved was a replica pistol and the amount taken was just over $4,250. The charge alleging that the applicant allowed himself to be carried in a stolen car related to his escape from the scene. Pursuant to the Form 1 procedure a further charge of armed robbery at the same place and on the same date was asked by the applicant to be taken into account. The victim in that case was Mr Sommer Lewis and the amount involved $129.70. Mr Lewis was employed at the tavern as a gaming attendant and he performed bar service and cash payment of poker machine winnings to patrons.  
     
      
    9 The applicant, one Ricardo Fisher and an unidentified third male entered the tavern. The applicant was armed with the replica firearm and Fisher had a 30 cm bladed knife.  
     
      
    10 Unsurprisingly, the events thereafter became somewhat confused as one of the customers had been able to make an exit from the tavern and waved down a passing police officer. This was Senior Constable Abernathy whose ordinary duty was as a police dog handler but, commendably, he entered the tavern in response to the request for help. The applicant and Fisher had removed a quantity of cash but the appearance of Senior Constable Abernathy caused Fisher to flee to a car park. By this time the third male also armed with a knife was waiting. The stolen motor vehicle in which the applicant rode was there.  
     
      
    11 While the constable was seeking to deal with Fisher and the third offender, the applicant, armed with the pistol, had forced two employees into a rear office and obtained money from a safe. He then proceeded to the area where they had no doubt left the car for the purpose of enabling escape. The struggle between police officer and offenders was not static and at one stage the unidentified male threw a knife, which Senior Constable Abernathy evaded by moving himself out of the path of the weapon. In the meantime, other police had been summoned and Fisher was taken into custody but the applicant and the unidentified offender escaped in the stolen motor vehicle. 
     
      
    12 In the course of time police received information from members of the public identifying the applicant as one of the offenders and scientific investigation of the getaway car, which had been abandoned, located a fingerprint of the applicant.  
     
      
    13 The applicant was arrested on 20 November 2002 and execution of a search warrant at his home located a number of items which could be connected with the robbery at the tavern. Upon interview the applicant made full admissions regarding his and Fisher’s involvement in the offence. The applicant has remained in custody since 20 November 2002.  
     
      
    14 The learned sentencing judge structured his impositions as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) On the first charge, robbery in company at Annandale, and taking into account the offences on both the Forms 1, imprisonment for seven years and six months commencing on 20 November 2003 with a non parole period of five years commencing on the same date and expiring on 19 November 2008; 
       
      (b) On the charge of assaulting Mr McIlveen to a fixed term of imprisonment commencing on 20 November 2002 (the date on which the applicant was taken into custody) and expiring on 19 November 2003. 
       
      Thus the sentence on the first charge commenced at the conclusion of the sentence imposed on this charge; 
       
      (c) On count 1, the robbery at Smithfield Tavern, to a fixed term of imprisonment for five years commencing on 20 November 2003 and expiring on 19 November 2008. This term is therefore concurrent with the non parole period set in relation to the first charge abovementioned; 
       
      (d) On the second count of the indictment for being carried in a stolen conveyance, to a fixed term of imprisonment for six months commencing on 20 November 2002 and expiring on 19 May 2003. This term is hence concurrent with the first six months of sentence imposed for the assault of Mr McIlveen. 
       
      
    15 The effective sentence for all these matters became a total of eight years six months imprisonment with a non parole period of six years, dating from 20 November 2002. The argument in support of the application was presented under four grounds. Ground 1 was expressed: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour erred by failing to set a non parole period in relation to the charge of armed robbery upon the Smithfield Tavern”. 
        
       
      
    16 As senior counsel for the applicant pointed out, his Honour did not record his reasons for declining to set a non parole period in respect of the count of armed robbery at Smithfield Tavern as required by s 45(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Such omission does not invalidate the sentence: see s 45(4). 
     
      
    17 As the fixed term is exactly the same as, and to be served concurrently with, the non parole period set in respect of the sentence for the robbery at the hotel in Annandale, it is difficult to perceive what is sought to be achieved by the suggestion in the written submissions that “a non parole period was essential not just for appearances sake”. There can be no practical benefit to the applicant unless that non parole period is varied. 
     
      
    18 Touched upon in the written submissions and the specific thrust of oral submission was an argument based on parity with sentence received by Fisher. Fisher was involved with the applicant only in offences at Smithfield. He was sentenced by Armitage DCJ after pleas of guilty to three offences with one further offence taken into account on a Form 1. In common with the applicant he was charged with armed robbery of Mr Sommer Lewis (the Form 1 matter when the applicant was dealt with), and on his Form 1, a charge of armed robbery of Mrs Heaphy (a principal charge against the applicant). The two further charges against Fisher were armed robbery of John Mangarelli from whom a mobile telephone was taken during the incursion into the tavern and threatening injury to Senior Constable Abernathy with intent to avoid lawful apprehension. 
     
      
    19 The remarks on sentence of Armitage DCJ have been provided. There is recorded a sentence of two years imprisonment for the offence of using an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension (which is not suggested to refer to something different from the charge first described in the remarks as threatening injury with intent to prevent lawful apprehension). That sentence was specified to commence on 3 June 2002 and expire on 2 June 2004. On each of the offences of armed robbery imprisonment for five years cumulatively upon the sentence of two years but concurrent with each other and both commencing on 2 June 2004 were imposed. His Honour further stated that he set an overall non parole period of four years and that, subject to the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 Fisher would be released to parole on 2 June 2006. He added that in imposing “those sentences” he had taken the matter on the Form 1 into account.  
     
      
    20 Thus the argument on behalf of the applicant proceeded on the basis that Fisher received an effective sentence which might be regarded as imprisonment for seven years with a non parole period of four years. 
     
      
    21 It was contended, however, that as the applicant faced no charge in relation to avoiding apprehension by Senior Constable Abernathy, the term of two years received by Fisher should be notionally excised for the purpose of contrast, and comparison made between the sentence of five years with a “balance” non parole period of two years thus received by Fisher against the fixed term of five years received by the applicant. 
     
      
    22 That approach is tainted by artificiality in that it ignores that each sentencing judge was required to assess an appropriate sentence for each offence upon which conviction was entered and then, having regard to overall criminality, determine whether those sentences should be served concurrently or wholly or partly cumulatively: Pearce v The Queen 1998 194 CLR 610. A proposition that Fisher received a sentence of five years imprisonment with a two year non parole period for the two offences of armed robbery ignores the structure of overall sentence determined by Armitage DCJ.  
     
      
    23 The applicant, on the respective current constructions of sentences, will be kept in custody for two years longer than Fisher before becoming eligible for parole. Viewed from that perspective, the two year span represents a very lenient term to reflect the criminality of the offences at Annandale in which Fisher was not alleged to be involved. That perspective is not altered by the circumstance that the applicant was not involved in any crime arising out of an intent to prevent lawful detention by Senior Constable Abernathy.  
     
      
    24 Sorby DCJ was aware of the sentence imposed upon Fisher and specifically concluded that “parity is not relevant here”. His conclusion demonstrated no error.  
     
      
    25 Grounds 2 and 3 were: 
     
      
       
        
        “2. His Honour erred by having regard to the guidelines laid down in  
        R v Henry 
         1999 46 NSWLR 346 when sentencing the applicant in relation to the robbery upon the Victoria Hotel at Annandale. 
        
       
       
        
        3. His Honour erred by accumulating the sentence in relation to the Annandale robbery upon the sentence for the assault upon the employee of that hotel”. 
        
       
      
    26 As the submissions revealed, ground 3 focussed upon the assault on Mr McIlveen who was not, as described, an employee of the hotel but was present in the company of his girlfriend (Edith) who was such an employee. Nothing turns upon Mr McIlveen’s precise status. 
     
      
    27 In his remarks on sentence Sorby DCJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The robbery offences fit some of the factors within the guideline judgment of  
        Henry 
         and I intend to apply that guideline for the robbery offences, as a starting point in determining the sentencing”. 
        
       
      
    28 The essence of complaint is that his Honour should not have “formally fixed himself” to the guidelines in Henry when making comparisons with the facts in the case. It was submitted that the guidelines in that case do not apply to robbery in company even though the maximum penalty for armed robbery is identical. This submission was said to be supported by R v Smith 2004 144 A Crim R 577. In the judgment of Howie J, (Sperling and Hidden JJ agreeing) there appears: 
     
      
       
        
        “The guidelines laid down in the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        R v Henry 
         are not to be extended outside the range of cases in circumstances to which it was directed ….. 
        
       
       
        
        It should, however, be said that it was unnecessary and unhelpful for his Honour to refer to a guideline judgment in respect of one specific offence in relation to dealing with an offender for a completely different offence”. 
        
       
      
    29 Smith was a case where the offender had pleaded guilty to demanding money with menaces whilst the specific offence dealt with in Henry was armed robbery. Howie J’s remarks should be understood in that context and I do not perceive that his Honour was suggesting departure from the observation of Sully J (Spigelman CJ and Hidden J agreeing) in R v Stanley [2003] NSWCCA 233: 
     
      
       
        
        “….. there is, in my opinion, no reason either of principle or of logic why the considerations which are enumerated by the Chief Justice in paragraph 162 of his Honour’s judgment in  
        Henry 
         should not apply mutatis mutandis to the s 97 offence of assault in company with another and with intent to rob”. 
        
       
      
    30 A similar view was expressed by a two judge bench (Simpson J and Smart AJ) in R v Murchie 1999 108 A Crim R 482. 
     
      
    31 There was no error committed by his Honour in having reference to the guidelines articulated in Henry. 
     
      
    32 The next argument asserted that: 
     
      
       
        
        “his Honour determined that the sentence (for robbery in company at Annandale) should be aggravated for, amongst other reasons, the fact that the applicant assaulted several witnesses. He specifically referred to the fact that one of these assaults was the subject of a separate charge. It seems plain enough that the applicant was sentenced twice, at least in part, for his assault upon Mr McIlveen”. 
        
       
      
    33 The passage in his Honour’s remarks upon which this submission is founded in fact appears as a recitation of submission by the Crown concerning the level of the applicant’s culpability. In any event, the reference by his Honour to the specific charge and the Form 1 matters show that he was alert to the discriminate situation of nominated victims as distinguished from other witnesses. It is not the case that all people present in the hotel were nominated in the various charges. The material before the Court included a statement by Leslie Brock, which mentions that he was sitting at a table with “Anna, Edith, Cindy and Adam”. The lastmentioned can be identified as Mr McIlveen and the statement shows that all of those present reacted as they were being put in fear by the offenders even though all of them did not suffer physical interference. 
     
      
    34 There is no basis for concluding that the appellant was doubly sentenced by reason of the separate charges. 
     
      
    35 The third asserted error was submitted to be discernible in his Honour’s dealing with the submission that the head sentence should be set below that specified in the Henry guideline when he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, although the subjective features reveal considerable hardship and family dysfunction, they do not constitute exceptional circumstances sufficient for me to take the course she submitted that I should”.  
        
       
      
    36 It was erroneous to seek to identify exceptional circumstances for the submitted purpose. “Exceptional” indicates the application of too high a test and this argument is made good. 
     
      
    37 It remains, however, for the Court to determine whether intervention to reduce sentence should occur. Although the lastmentioned point is determined in favour of the applicant, the power of this Court to intervene is to be exercised only when a less severe sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    38 A less severe sentence is, in my opinion, not warranted in all the circumstances. The effective imposition lies well within the bounds of sound exercise of discretion. It follows that I would not sustain the fourth ground which asserts that the sentences were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    39 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    40 BELL J: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    41 BUDDIN J: I agree with Grove J.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Standing for sentence before me are Richard James Walsh and Todd Douglas Little. From the outset it should be acknowledged that the sentencing proceedings have taken an unduly long period to reach finalisation. This is a result of a combination of matters not the least being the unavailability of counsel or the Court to hear the matter at various times particularly when at one stage it was estimated that the hearing on sentence would take three weeks. There was also the difficulty, particularly in the case of Walsh, that there were matters pending in the District Court and an attempt was being made to have all outstanding matters brought before me. Adjournments were granted when sought by the Crown or the defence because the Court was informed that the offenders were not being prejudiced by the delay particularly in light of the likely length of sentences to be imposed upon them. However, I wish to indicate that I have taken into account that there has been a longer period of uncertainty for both offenders than is usually the case for those who plead guilty in this Court. 
     
      
    2 Mr Walsh is to be sentenced for offences falling into three categories: firstly the supply of amphetamine being not less than the large commercial quantity; secondly offences of dishonesty and thirdly offences relating to the possession of firearms and ammunition. Mr Little is to be sentenced for offences falling into two categories: the first being offences in relation to the manufacture and supply of amphetamine of not less than the large commercial quantity and the second offences in relation to his possession of firearms and ammunition. 
     
      
    3 Mr Walsh pleaded guilty on 9 February 2004 to a charge that between 7 March 1997 and 24 September 2001 at Terranora and Newcastle he supplied a prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine in an amount which was not less than the large commercial quantity for such drug. This is an offence contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 On 15 November 2004 Mr Walsh was again before me and on that occasion pleaded guilty to three further counts on that indictment being as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        On 24 September 2001 at Sandgate did possess a firearm namely a Smith and Wesson brand special calibre six chamber revolver, without being authorised to do so by licence or permit.. 
         
         
        On 24 September 2001 at Sandgate did possess a firearm namely a Lithgow brand .303 British calibre select fire Bren machine gun, without being authorised to do so by licence or permit. 
         
         
        On 24 September, 2001 at Sandgate did possess a prohibited weapon, namely an Australian manufactured silencer, without being authorised to do so by a permit. 
         
        
       
      
    5 The offences in relation to the firearms were breaches of s 7(1) of the Firearms Act and each carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. The offences in relation to the silencer were a breach of s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act for which the maximum penalty on conviction on indictment is imprisonment for 14 years. 
     
      
    6 On 14 February last Mr Walsh pleaded guilty to two further charges on an indictment. The first alleged that on 25 April 2000 at Medowie he did break and enter an office building with intent to commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely to steal an automatic teller machine and the contents thereof in circumstances of aggravation namely that he was in the company of other persons. 
     
      
    7 The second count on that indictment alleged that on 3 December 2000 at Tomago he stole a motor vehicle, namely a Freightliner prime mover truck and attached articulated trailer, the property of Boral Transport. 
     
      
    8 The first offence being an aggravated break and enter is an offence contrary to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. The second offence in relation to the prime mover and trailer is a breach of s 154AA(1) of the Crimes Act for which a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment is prescribed. 
     
      
    9 In addition he asked me to take into account offences on two form 1 documents in accordance with s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The first of those documents contains 25 matters relating to the offender’s possession of a large number of firearms and ammunition discovered when he was arrested on 24 September 2001. I am to take those matters into account when sentencing him on the charge in the first indictment relating to the .303 machine gun that is the third count. The other form 1 document contains 14 matters alleging his involvement in acts of dishonesty relating to the theft and disposal of motor vehicles. I am to take those matters into account when sentencing him for the offence of aggravated break and enter with intent to steal being the first count on the second indictment. 
     
      
    10 Mr Little was before me on 5 February 2004 and pleaded guilty to five counts on an indictment which contained 38 charges. The Crown thereafter determined not to proceed on the balance of the charges. The first count to which he pleaded guilty was that between 8 March 1997 and 24 September 2001 at Murwillumbah and Tweed Heads he manufactured a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, in an amount which was not less than the large commercial quantity for such drug. This is an offence contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and for which the maximum penalty prescribed is life imprisonment. 
     
      
    11 The second count was that between 8 March 1997 and 24 September 2001 at Terranora and Newcastle he supplied a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, in an amount that was not less than the large commercial quantity for such drug. This is an offence contrary to s 25(2) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act and again carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 
     
      
    12 The third count to which he pleaded guilty alleged that on 4 October 2001 at Tweed Heads he possessed a firearm namely a Daewoo 12 gauge self loading gun, without being authorised to do so by licence or permit. This is an offence contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act for which the maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 14 years. 
     
      
    13 The fourth count to which he pleaded guilty alleged that on 4 October 2001 at Tweed Heads he possessed a firearm, not being a pistol, namely a 9 mm Lithgow submachine gun that had been shortened, without being authorised to do so by licence or permit. This offence is contrary to s 62(1)(b) of the Firearms Act and for which the maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 10 years. 
     
      
    14 The fifth count to which Mr Little pleaded guilty alleged that on 4 October 2001 at Tweed Heads he possessed a prohibited weapon, namely an alloy tube silencer, without being authorised to do so by a permit. That is an offence contrary to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act for which the maximum penalty prescribed for conviction on an indictment is imprisonment for 14 years. 
     
      
    15 In addition he asked me to take into account on a form 1 19 matters each of which alleged the possession by him of an unlicensed or unregistered firearm, prohibited weapons or ammunition. These matters all arose when the firearms and other items were found on 4 October 2001 in storage sheds used by him. 
     
      
    16 Each of the offenders is to be sentenced on the basis of an agreed statement of facts. Apart from some photographs of weapons and other items, no other material was placed before me to prove the allegations made by the Crown. It is unnecessary to set out the facts in full and I summarise briefly the material contained in the statements tendered. 
     
      
    17 The offences for which Mr Walsh is to be sentenced arose from his involvement with the Newcastle Chapter of the Nomad Outlaw Motor Cycle Club. He joined that organisation in 1995. Up until this time he had apparently been living as an honest and worthwhile member of the community and carried on a legitimate business as a concreter. The members of the Club, or a large majority of them, were users of methylamphetamine supplied to them by a member of the Club named Johnny Skyrus. This person was in business with another member of the Club, Tony Vizl, who supplied Skyrus with pure drug that he then cut and sold to his customers. At some stage Mr Walsh began to assist Skyrus in the distribution of the methylamphetamine, which was generally referred to by members of the Club as “gas”. 
     
      
    18 In March 1997 Skyrus was killed in a motorcycle accident and Mr Walsh took over his role in the distribution of the drug. He obtained his supplies from Vizl, who by that stage was living in Queensland. With the assistance of his defacto partner, Melinda Love, he began to distribute the drug to members of the Club and other persons in the Newcastle area. 
     
      
    19 By March 1998 Ms Love was carrying out the day-to-day business of cutting the drug and selling it. Involved in the distribution were two persons, Paul and Anne Chapman. Ms Chapman, who was initially employed as a cleaner in the premises kept by Walsh and Love, began to assist Ms Love by testing the quality of the amphetamine so that Ms Love could determine whether she had the right proportion of pure drug and cutting agent. Her husband, Paul Chapman was used by Mr Walsh as a courier of the drug, including obtaining the pure drug from Mr Little in northern New South Wales, and for other criminal activities. 
     
      
    20 However, following a dispute between Mr Walsh and Chapman, the latter was replaced as courier by a man named Quinnell, an associate of the offender Little. On 15 May 2001 Mr Quinnell died in a motor vehicle accident and thereafter Mr Walsh himself collected the pure methylamphetamine that he required for his business. For this purpose he would drive a hire car some eight hours to Mr Little’s premises and immediately return to Newcastle with the drug. He was usually accompanied by a member of the Club or some other associate on this journey. 
     
      
    21 Mr Walsh had commenced to obtain his methylamphetamine solely from Mr Little in September 1999. The agreed facts are that between that time and 24 September 2001, Mr Little had manufactured and supplied to Mr Walsh 19 kilograms of methylamphetamine at a price of somewhere between $50,000 and $60,000 per pound. 
     
      
    22 On 16 January 2001 Paul Chapman was arrested for an armed robbery offence. While in custody on this charge he contacted police and provided them with information as to the criminal activities of Mr Walsh, Ms Love and other persons with whom he had come into contact through them. From this time, that is March 2001, until 24 September 2001 police were investigating Mr Walsh, Ms Love and their associates by using telephone intercepts, surveillance, listening devices and controlled purchases of drugs by Ms Chapman. 
     
      
    23 On the morning of 23 September Mr Walsh was arrested on the Pacific Highway at Murwillumbah shortly after having left Mr Little’s property. Police found 510 grams of methylamphetamine hidden in the panel of the driver’s door of the vehicle. When analysed it was found to be 77.6% pure. Shortly after the arrest police executed a search warrant at his home in Maryland and found items used in the distribution of methylamphetamine. Ms Love was arrested and almost immediately began to assist police by telling them what she knew about Mr Walsh’s activities and her part in them. She informed police of a rented storage unit used by Mr Walsh in which police found a large number of firearms and weapons. 
     
      
    24 The agreed facts indicate that during the period of his involvement in supplying methylamphetamine after the death of Mr Skyrus until his arrest, Mr Walsh and Ms Love supplied drugs to about 75 customers. Mr Walsh accepts for the purposes of sentencing that between March 1997 and September 2001 he purchased about 50 kilograms of pure methylamphetamine and as a result supplied about 450 kilograms of the drug to members of the Nomads and other associates of him and Ms Love. The seriousness of this offending can be appreciated when it is noted that the large commercial quantity for methylamphetamine is 1 kilogram. 
     
      
    25 In relation to the two matters on the second indictment that is aggravated break and enter and larceny of a motor vehicle and the form 1 matters relating to offences of dishonesty there was also an agreed statement of facts tendered. Again for present purposes it is necessary only to briefly summarise them. During the period when Mr Walsh was involved in his business of supplying amphetamine, he was also conducting an apparently legitimate business of concreting and excavating. However, as a result of information supplied by Chapman to police, they became aware that Mr Walsh had organised the theft of a number of vehicles in the course of carrying out his legitimate business activities. 
     
      
    26 The first count on the second indictment concerns the attempt by Mr Walsh and others, including Chapman, to steal an automatic teller machine from premises used by a real estate agency. Sometime between 19 and 22 April 2000 in order to carry out this enterprise Mr Walsh organised the theft of two trucks, one with a crane mounted on it. The theft of these vehicles gives rise to two of the matters on the form 1. Shortly after the second vehicle was stolen Chapman met up with the offender Walsh and another person for the purpose of stealing the ATM. Chapman was driving one of the stolen trucks, Mr Walsh was using his own vehicle and a man named Griffin was driving the stolen truck with the crane attached. Griffin reversed the truck into the premises smashing the teller machine and destroying much of the furniture in the office. Mr Chapman with the help of another person pulled the ATM to the front of the premises so that it could be hoisted with the crane on to the stolen truck. However, during the course of this manoeuvre the ATM fell from the sling. No doubt fearing that police had been notified, they left the scene in Mr Walsh’s vehicle abandoning the ATM and the two stolen trucks outside the real estate office. At the time of the attempted theft of the ATM it contained $53,000 in cash. 
     
      
    27 The offences on the form 1 were committed between March 1999 and November 2000. They involved the theft of trucks by persons associated with Mr Walsh and at his direction so that he could use them in his business or use parts of the stolen vehicles to replace damaged parts in his own vehicles. There are also offences concerned with obtaining insurance money for vehicles on the basis that they had been stolen whereas in truth Mr Walsh had arranged for the vehicles to be taken by an associate. The stolen vehicles were altered in order to disguise their appearance involving at times the vehicle being resprayed and identifying numbers removed. There is also a charge relating to the theft of a wheel chair used by Mr Walsh when he was recovering after a motor vehicle accident. 
     
      
    28 In relation to Mr Little I have already made reference to the fact that he was manufacturing methylamphetamine at his property in the north of NSW and supplying it to Mr Walsh who would distribute it with the assistance of Ms Love in the Newcastle area. It should be noted that although Mr Walsh and Ms Love were in a business of supplying amphetamine from March 1997, they did not utilise the services of Mr Little until September 1999. But from Christmas 1999 until September 2001, when they were both arrested, Mr Little was the sole supplier to Mr Walsh. 
     
      
    29 I have already noted that Mr Walsh was arrested on 23 September 2001 shortly after picking up a quantity of drug from Mr Little. Mr Little was arrested at his property in Terranora in the early hours of the next day, that is 24 September. Located at those premises were items related to the manufacture of methylamphetamine including precursors of the drug, 590 grams of methylamphetamine, over $145,000 in cash and a loaded semi-automatic handgun with a silencer. Police also searched a storage shed used by Mr Little at Tweed Heads and found that it contained a number of firearms. There were also 4 bags of Sudafed tablets weighing 11.5 kilograms from which about 3 kilograms of pseudoephedrine, a precursor in the manufacture of methylamphetamine, could be obtained. 
     
      
    30 Police also searched storage sheds in Murwillumbah where they found large amounts of chemicals for the manufacture of methylamphetamine, scientific glassware and other items required for the manufacture of drugs in large quantities. There was DNA material found in these premises that matched the DNA of Mr Little. Police also seized a number of objects containing residues and liquids that related to the various stages in the production of methylamphetamine. The contents of these premises revealed that Mr Little was conducting a laboratory for the manufacture of methylamphetamine. 
     
      
    31 It has been estimated that from September 1999 to September 2001 he manufactured 19 kilograms of methylamphetamine for Mr Walsh for which he was paid about $2,500,000. 
     
      
    32 I will now deal with the offenders’ subjective matters. Mr Walsh is aged 33 years and has no prior convictions of any kind. I am prepared to sentence him on the basis that before he joined the Nomads in 1995 he was an honest and productive member of the community. His subjective case is largely found in a psychological report prepared by Ms Robilliard the contents of which are based upon her interview with him and the results she obtained from various tests she administered to him. There is, however, little in that report which assists Mr Walsh in light of the seriousness of the criminal conduct in which he was involved over the years from 1997 to 2001. 
     
      
    33 However, the report indicates that Mr Walsh began using amphetamine in 1997 shortly after the death of Johnny Skyrus. He used the drug, he said, in order to be able to work long hours during the week and to engage in club activities on the weekends. He told the psychologist that he estimated he was using $5,000 to $6,000 worth of amphetamine per week in the period prior to his arrest. He also reported that over the same period he was subject to a “voracious gambling habit” as a result of which it was not unusual for him to lose between $10,000 and $20,000 on a weekend of gambling in Sydney or in Queensland. 
     
      
    34 An intelligence test administered by the psychologist revealed that he was in the Below Average range. Personality testing showed that he was depressed but otherwise there is no evidence to suggest there is any brain injury as a result of his prolonged drug usage. Although the report sets out Mr Walsh’s background in some detail, there is nothing in this material that, in my view, has any relevance to a determination of the sentence to be imposed upon him. 
     
      
    35 Mr Walsh told the psychologist that since his arrest he has become drug free and is profoundly remorseful for his criminal conduct. He says that he deeply regrets that he ever began using drugs or that he joined a motorcycle club. He is apparently determined to use his time in custody productively and I accept that he has been undertaking courses in Anger Management, Drug and Alcohol Education and Peer Support. Apparently he has the benefit of strong family support. 
     
      
    36 Mr Little is aged 38 years. His criminal record contains mainly traffic matters and minor assaults dealt with in the Local Court. It can be disregarded for present purposes and I am prepared to sentence him on the basis that he is generally of good character as is asserted in testimonials that have been placed before the Court in his support. He did not give evidence before me and the subjective matters relevant to sentencing arise largely from reports prepared by a psychologist and by a general practitioner who has at times treated Mr Little. 
     
      
    37 There is, in my view, nothing in his background of significance in sentencing him for the offences for which he is before the Court. There is certainly nothing that in anyway explains his decision to embark upon a criminal career as a drug manufacturer or that indicates his criminal responsibility for that activity is in any way diminished. It may well be the case that experiences he suffered as a child or as an adolescent at least contributed to his use of drugs later in life in order to ameliorate the psychological effects of those experiences upon him. But once it is accepted, as I do, that he was himself a user of illegal drugs of the type he was manufacturing, these matters in his past assume little importance having regard to the seriousness of his conduct with which I am concerned. He told the psychologist that because of depression following the death of a friend about six months before his arrest he was abusing drugs and alcohol to a greater degree than he had in the past. He was also, like Mr Walsh, apparently a heavy gambler. 
     
      
    38 He told the psychologist that he was at the time of his arrest intending to open a shop selling motorbikes and had been lent a large amount of money from friends for that purpose. He stated that since his arrest he has no longer been using drugs on a regular basis and that his general health had improved markedly as a result. Psychological testing reveals that he has traits of depression and anxiety in his personality. The latter manifests itself in somatic complaints and over-reactive conditions. The psychologist concluded that, while Mr Little found support in his lifestyle as a member of a motorcycle club, it also led to him indulging in drugs and alcohol to a degree that threatened his health. 
     
      
    39 Mr Little has apparently made a commitment to improve himself while in gaol and has attended a number of courses during the period that he has been on remand. He hopes that he might obtain skills to assist him in operating a business selling motorbikes when he is eventually released. The psychologist expresses the view that he might be assisted by further counselling both in custody and after his release to parole. 
     
      
    40 Dr Buckland, a general practitioner, provided two reports mainly concerned with Mr Little’s fear of confined places, as a result of an incident in his late teens, and his almost obsessive concern about his physical health. The first report notes that Mr Little had made 70 visits to the prison health service between September 2001 and July 2004. He suffers from severe asthma and other ailments such as sleep apnoea and a chronic cough. Investigations carried out of other complaints he has made as to pain in various areas of his body have not revealed any physiological cause. It seems that many of his complaints arise from his anxiety disorder. The second and later report of Dr Buckland indicates that this disorder may have resulted in other disturbed conduct by the offender while on remand including paranoid thoughts. Whether these later incidents are a result of increased anxiety as the date for sentencing approached or indicate that there is some more substantial disorder present is a matter of conjecture at this time. 
     
      
    41 This material of course is relevant to a submission that prison may be more burdensome for Mr Little because of his anxiety disorder and its effect upon him and, therefore, that some mitigation should be made of the otherwise appropriate sentence. Of course the weight that can be given to such a matter depends upon the seriousness of the conduct for which punishment is to be imposed and the importance of other sentencing considerations such as denunciation and general deterrence. In my view it can be given little weight in the present case. 
     
      
    42 It is not difficult to appreciate the seriousness of the conduct in which both offenders were engaged for a significant period of time. It was basically a commercial criminal enterprise regardless of the fact that they were both drug users to a very substantial degree. The maximum penalty faced by both of them is life imprisonment and this in itself indicates the seriousness with which this type of conduct is considered by Parliament, the courts and decent members of society. 
     
      
    43 In the case of Mr Walsh a realistic assessment of the objective gravity of his conduct requires very serious consideration being given to imposing the maximum penalty notwithstanding that it is the harshest sentence that is available to the courts of this State. This is not simply because of the amount of drug involved in the offence, which was very great indeed, but because of the commercial nature of the enterprise and the period over which it was conducted. It is rare in my experience for a criminal at the top of the hierarchy of a drug supply organisation to come before the courts. The organisation over which the offender Walsh presided was not particularly large and there were not many tiers between him and the users he supplied. It could be described as a family business but it was a very profitable one and a very criminal one. 
     
      
    44 I do not know of any case of supplying amphetamine as serious as this. Certainly in the cases, to which the Crown has referred me, the amounts of drug supplied are a mere fraction of that in the present case. As I have already noted Mr Walsh’s offence was a continuing one over a period of more than four years. The only case that may be comparable is R v Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2 a Crown appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court. I do not know whether there is any great assistance to be gained by comparing that case and those presently before me, so different are the facts. But Kalache might be taken as being the most serious case of this type of offence to come before the courts. 
     
      
    45 The offender in that case was the head of a network of supplying and manufacturing of drugs far more extensive and insidious than that controlled by Mr Walsh. He was also involved in the distribution of a range of unlawful substances including cocaine and cannabis and was financing drug manufacturing plants. The period over which Kalache was offending was about 2 years and it seems that he was supplying drugs at a much larger volume than Mr Walsh, but of course over a considerably lesser period of time. There were also two aggravating factors that are not present in Mr Walsh’s case: Kalache was not a user of drugs and he had a criminal record for similar activity. Indeed some of the offences for which he was sentenced were committed while he was on parole. 
     
      
    46 In allowing the Crown appeal, Mr Justice Sully at [111] indicated that an offence involved the supply of 20 kilograms of methylamphetamine was, in Mr Kalache’s case one that “must entail, at the very least, the giving of serious consideration to the imposition of the statutory maximum penalty”, that is life imprisonment. Sully J went on to find that on the facts of that case life imprisonment should have been imposed upon Kalache for that offence. However, because it was a Crown appeal, his Honour proposed that the sentence should not be life imprisonment but one totalling 23 years. Mr Justice Hulme would have allowed the Crown appeal and sentenced Kalache to life imprisonment for that offence notwithstanding the principles of double jeopardy that normally apply on a Crown appeal against sentence. Justice Hidden agreed with Mr Justice Sully. The sentence imposed for the supply of 20 kilograms of methylamphetamine was 23 years with a non-parole period of 20 years. It should be noted, of course, that was a sentence imposed on a Crown appeal and was a sentence that was reduced by reasons of double jeopardy. 
     
      
    47 As I have indicated there are matters that can distinguish the offender Kalache from both of the offenders before me. They are principally his criminal record, the extent of the network that he operated and the fact that he was not himself a user of drugs. The sheer enormity of the amount of drug supplied by Mr Walsh, his role in that distribution and the period over which the distribution took place indicates to me that a life sentence would have been warranted having regard only to the objective seriousness of his conduct and the harm occasioned to the community in general and those to whom he supplied in particular. Denunciation of this grossly criminal conduct and general deterrence alone would make that sentence an appropriate one. 
     
      
    48 However, the Crown has submitted that a life sentence is not warranted for either of the offenders. In the case of Mr Walsh that concession is based upon the following matters: that the offender was a user of the drug, that he had no prior convictions and the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. In the case of Mr Little the Crown bases the concession on the fact that he has no previous record for drug-related offences and the utilitarian value of the plea. There is, however, evidence before me that he was also a user of drugs. 
     
      
    49 Of course, I am not bound by the Crown’s concessions but the fact that I am informed that it is made on instructions received from the Director of Public Prosecutions is highly significant and has been highly persuasive. In my view in the case of Mr Walsh the most significant factor calling for leniency is the very substantial utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. I come to this view notwithstanding the opinions expressed by the members of the Court in Kalache about the weight to be given to the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty in a case where the offending is so serious that it otherwise calls for the maximum. In the present case the fact that both offenders pleaded guilty meant that this Court was saved the cost and effort of conducting a trial expected to take up to six months and involving a number of accused persons. As a result of the pleas of guilty, a number of very short trials took place and the time taken to dispose of the matters could be measured in days rather than months. However, in each case it was not an early plea and a discount of about 15 per cent would be appropriate. 
     
      
    50 In Mr Walsh’s case, had the offence been one to which s 61(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act applied I would have felt myself obliged by the terms of that section to have imposed a life sentence on him notwithstanding any Crown concession and notwithstanding the plea of guilty. But in the present case I am prepared to accept the Director’s concession and for the reasons that the concession was made that a sentence other than life imprisonment does fulfil the purpose of sentencing in the protection of the public. I do so despite some very substantial initial misgivings. I also take into account what evidence there is of Mr Walsh’s remorse and contrition for his criminal conduct while a member of the Nomads. I want to make it perfectly clear that had it not been for the plea of guilty I would have imposed upon him a sentence of imprisonment for life. 
     
      
    51 But having determined that the three factors relied upon by the Director and evidence of remorse allow me to impose a sentence on Mr Walsh of less than life imprisonment, I do not intend to give those factors substantial weight in determining the appropriate determinate sentence to impose upon him. They have mitigated the sentence from life imprisonment. If I took them into account again as reducing the objective seriousness of the offence or as justifying a further discount of the appropriate sentence, they would be given disproportionate weight by double counting. I make it perfectly clear that in Mr Walsh’s case in respect of the offence of supply I am giving no further discount for the plea of guilty. The fact that he was a user of drugs and that he had no prior criminal record when he joined the motorcycle club are, however, relevant to a finding that he may be rehabilitated. 
     
      
    52 In Mr Walsh’s case I have considered the matters of aggravation set out in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Two of those matters seem to be relevant: that the offence involved a series of criminal acts and that it was organised criminal activity. The Crown submitted that there was a third matter of aggravation being that the offence was committed in disregard of public safety. However, the supply of prohibited drugs is an offence premised on the basis that such conduct is carried out in disregard of public safety and that factor cannot be a separate matter of aggravation: see R v McMillan [2005] NSWCCA 28. I have already referred to the matters in mitigation arising from the plea, his lack of record and good character. I cannot form any view about his likelihood of re-offending such was the seriousness of his conduct over the period of the offending. I assume that, if on his release he avoids drugs, gambling and the Nomads, he may again live the life of a worthwhile citizen. The problem with making predictions about his future conduct is frankly the length of time he will be in custody before he will be eligible for release. I do not deny, however, that he has good prospects for rehabilitation on the material presently before me. 
     
      
    53 In addition to his criminal conduct in the supply of drugs, Mr Walsh was also engaged in serious crimes against property and he had a large number of firearms in his possession. The offence in relation to the attempt to steal the ATM machine is itself an offence warranting a substantial prison sentence even without taking into account the matters on the form 1. The firearms and associated offences are also serious and would standing alone require the imposition of significant gaol sentence regardless of the purpose for which he had them in his possession. The simple fact is that for a period of over four years and presumably by reason of his immunity as a member of the Nomads, Mr Walsh believed that he was above the law and could act with impunity. 
     
      
    54 The Crown submitted that at least partly cumulative sentences should be imposed for the three groups of offences represented by the charges before the court. That is a submission that would normally have considerable merit notwithstanding that all the offences arose from the one period of criminality. Whether it should be acceded to in the present case really depends upon an assessment of whether the appropriate sentence for the supply offence leaves any room for cumulation, partially or otherwise, of sentences for the other offences. 
     
      
    55 The difficulty in sentencing Mr Walsh is not in determining how long the sentence should be to reflect the total criminality before me but that any such sentence would in effect be the equivalent of a life sentence or be a sentence so crushing that there would be little difference in reality between the sentence imposed and life imprisonment. 
     
      
    56 This problem was recognised by the Court of Criminal Appeal recently in R v Folbigg [2005] NSWCCA 23. The Court held that although the sentencing judge had determined not to impose a “life meaning life” sentence on the offender, the sentence imposed in effect amounted to a life sentence because of its length. In that case the sentence imposed at first instance would have meant that the offender could not have been released to parole until she was aged 66 and, had she been required to serve the total sentence without parole, she would not have been released until she was aged 77. The court held that the sentences were therefore excessive. 
     
      
    57 In the case of Mr Walsh a sentence appropriate to denunciate his conduct as a person operating a commercial business involving the supply of 450 kilograms of amphetamine over a period of four and a half years could well have the same result as did the sentence imposed upon Ms Folbigg: the sentence would be too close to a life sentence and not sufficiently give effect to the concession made by the director and accepted by me that such a sentence was not appropriate. But it must be a sentence that truly reflects the enormity of the criminal activity in which he was involved in distributing such a large amount of drug over such a lengthy period of time. I will moderate the sentence to sufficiently distinguish it from a life sentence. However I cannot reduce it to such a degree that I can appropriately make the sentences for the property and firearms offences even partially cumulative. To impose a sentence which does not accurately reflect the seriousness of the supply offence would reduce its denunciatory and deterrent effect. I do not intend to reduce the otherwise appropriate sentence simply so that it can appear that I am punishing him for other offences by imposing cumulative or partially accumulative sentences upon it. 
     
      
    58 I understand that if sentences are made concurrent it appears that the offender is getting “the other offences for free”. Generally speaking the failure to cumulate sentences for separate and serious criminal offences will result in a sentence that is manifestly inadequate. I am also appreciative of the fact that I can reduce the otherwise appropriate sentence for an offence because I am ordering that the sentence for another offence be served cumulatively upon it: see Johnson v The Queen (2004) 205 ALR 346. However I do not believe that course would be an appropriate one to adopt in the present case. Put simply any sentence that would appropriately punish the offence of supply leaves no room for any further punishment for other offences committed by the offender regardless of how serious they might be. 
     
      
    59 If I am wrong in my assessment of the appropriate sentence for the supply offence, then it should be understood that the sentence I imposed for that offence is the total sentence I would have imposed to reflect the total criminality before me limited by the consideration referred to in Folbigg. I should also note that it appears from the statistics that no sentence of more than imprisonment for 10 years has been imposed for this type of offence. This is notwithstanding that the maximum penalty is life imprisonment. But as I have already noted there does not appear to have been a case, except Kalache, approaching anywhere near the seriousness of the offence committed by Mr Walsh. The sentence I intend to impose is well outside the range of sentences that have been imposed for that reason. 
     
      
    60 In Mr Little’s case I doubt that I would have found that the offence warranted a life sentence even had there been no concession to that effect by the Director. This is not in any way to under value the seriousness of his criminality in setting up a commercial business in manufacturing amphetamine for supply. The amount supplied to Mr Walsh is 19 times the quantity that brings a manufacture within the large commercial quantity and exposes the offender to a life sentence. The business was operating over a period of two years. The criminality of the person who manufactures a drug so that it can be distributed is probably greater, generally speaking, than the person who distributes the drug. This is because the manufacturer has created the evil that is then spread into the community. His criminality is similar to the person who imports drugs into the community from abroad. 
     
      
    61 As with Mr Walsh, I know of no other case where the offence before the court was so serious. Although it may not have been in the worst category of offence so as to warrant life imprisonment it was only just outside that category. The aggravating features are obvious and I have already referred to the mitigating factors. I am willing to make the same assumptions I made in the case of Mr Walsh that Mr Little is unlikely to offend if he avoids those circumstances that are said to account for the present offending and further that, as far as I can see into the distant future, he has good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    62 I have already indicated that he should receive a discount of 15 per cent on each offence for the utilitarian value of his plea. I am willing to accept that he was at the relevant time a user of the drug but he was in the business of manufacturing methylamphetamine on a commercial basis. It was an offence which was serious both by reason of the amount of drug involved, the period of time over which the offence was committed, and the sophisticated nature of the operation. In my view it is one that comes towards the top of the range notwithstanding those matters which I have mentioned by way of mitigation. 
     
      
    63 I have already noted the range of sentences imposed for the supply offence with which Mr Little has been charged. The same comment applies with respect to the manufacturing offence: there appears to be no case approaching the seriousness of that committed by Mr Little other than Kalache. There are only two cases recorded in the JIRS statistics for an offence of manufacturing a large commercial quantity of amphetamine and they cannot assist in determining the range. In respect of the offence of knowingly take part in the manufacture of a large commercial quantity the highest sentence appears to be one of 10 years. Again the sentence I intend to impose on Mr Little is well outside that range because I do not believe there is any offence in that range that approaches the seriousness of the present offence. In so far as some of those cases may have arisen from the Kalache enterprise, the sentences would have been infected by parity with the manifestly inadequate sentence imposed upon the principal. 
     
      
    64 In neither case are there special circumstances warranting a reduction in the non-parole period. I accept that there is material in the subjective cases of both offenders that might in an appropriate case give rise to a finding of special circumstances where a longer parole period was warranted than would have been provided by the statutory formula. But the sentences I am about to impose will be so lengthy that the normal proportion between the non-parole period and the term of the overall sentence results in a parole period that is more than adequate for rehabilitative purposes. There is no other consideration that would warrant a reduction in the non-parole period. I have reached this view notwithstanding the evidence as to Mr Little’s anxiety disorder and the consequences for him of a long term of prison confinement. 
     
      
    65 I appreciate that the sentences to be imposed on both men are more than are sometimes imposed on a person convicted of one or more murders. But Parliament has determined that there can be cases involving the supply or manufacturing of drugs that are so heinous that they are as serious as murder and justify the harshest sentence that can be imposed. I note in passing that the only offences for which any person receives the maximum penalty prescribed seems to be murder or the importation of drugs. Would-be manufacturers and suppliers of methylamphetamine should take note that they are not immune from such a sentence in an appropriate case. 
     
      
    66 In Mr Little’s case, as in the case of Mr Walsh, the drug offences are so serious and the sentences must be of such a length to punish that criminality that there is no room to impose cumulative sentences for the other matters notwithstanding their seriousness. 
     
      
    67 Both offenders are convicted. In respect of each of the offences other than the supply of prohibited drug in respect to Mr Walsh I have deducted 15 per cent on account of the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    68 Mr Little in respect of the offence of manufacturing a prohibited drug you are sentenced to imprisonment for 22 years to commence from 24 September 2001. There is to be a non-parole period of 16 years 6 months that is to commence on the same date and to expire on 23 March 2018 the date upon which you are eligible to be released to parole. 
     
      
    69 In respect of the offence relating to the possession of the submachine gun, being count 19, and taking into account the matters on the form 1 you are sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years and 6 months to commence on 24 September 2001 and to expire on 23 March 2005. 
     
      
    70 In respect of the other offences to which you pleaded guilty in each case you are sentenced to a fixed term of 15 months to commence on 24 September 2001 and that expired on 22 December 2002. 
     
      
    71 Mr Walsh on the offence of supplying prohibited drugs you are sentenced to imprisonment for 32 years. That sentence is to date from 23 September 2001. There is to be a non-parole period of 24 years which is to date from the same date and is to expire on 22 September 2025 and you are eligible to be released to parole on that date. 
     
      
    72 In respect of the offence of aggravated break and steal and taking into account the matters on the form 1 you are sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years 9 months to commence from 23 September 2001. I specify a non-parole period of 5 years to commence on the same date and to expire on 22 September 2006. 
     
      
    73 In respect of the larceny offence you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 2 months to date from 23 September 2001 and that expired on 22 November 2003. 
     
      
    74 In respect of the offence of possession of the .303 machine gun and taking into account the matters on the form 1 you are sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years 6 months from 23 September 2001 and to expire on 22 March 2005. I have imposed a fixed term by reason of the sentences otherwise imposed upon you 
     
      
    75 In respect of the two remaining offences, that is the possession of the revolver and the possession of the silencer you are sentenced to a fixed term of 15 months to commence on 23 September 2001 and that expired on 22 December 2002. 
     
      
    76 The parties agreed that I should dismiss two summary offences which are referred in a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. This is a procedural step merely to dispose of these matters which were minor offences of being in possession of drugs at Murwillumbah and Terranora on the day of Mr Little’s arrest. Therefore these two summary offences set out in the certificate are dismissed.

      2003/155 REGINA v TODD DOUGLAS LITTLE 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Mr Little is before me as a result of a sentence I imposed upon him on 28 February of this year. On that day I sentenced Mr Little for a number of offences, the principal one being an offence of manufacturing a prohibited drug. This was the first count on an indictment containing a number of counts in respect of which Mr Little pleaded guilty and for which he was to be sentenced by me.  
     
      
    2 As I have indicated, the first count on that indictment was the offence of manufacturing a prohibited drug, being methylamphetamine, and being not less than a large commercial quantity for that drug. It was an offence that carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  
     
      
    3 The second count on that indictment is an offence which is related to the first and was one of supplying a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, and also an amount that was not less than the large commercial quantity for that drug. The drug which was the subject of the second count was the same as the subject of the first count; in other words, the Crown's allegation, accepted by Mr Little, was that over a period of time set out in the manufacturing count he had manufactured methylamphetamine which he then supplied to a person by the name of Walsh.  
     
      
    4 In sentencing Mr Little I omitted to sentence him for the offence of supply. This was an oversight on my part simply because the centre of attention by the Crown in its submissions and the counsel appearing for Mr Little at the sentencing hearing was upon the manufacture offence. This is obviously because the criminality for which Mr Little had to be sentenced was found mainly in that charge rather than the supply charge. 
     
      
    5 I sentenced Mr Little to imprisonment for twenty-two years from 24 September 2001 and set a-non parole period of sixteen years and six months. That is a period which will expire on 23 March 2018. It was never suggested by the Crown in its written submissions that there should be any sentence imposed upon Mr Little for the supply offence that was cumulative to the offence for manufacture. A submission was made that a cumulative sentence should be imposed in respect of other offences for which Mr Little was to be sentenced. However, as the matter turned out, with the application of proper sentencing principles I made no sentence cumulative upon the sentence for the manufacture of the prohibited drug. 
     
      
    6 Although the criminality of Mr Little in respect of the supply of the prohibited drug manufactured by him is closely related to the criminality of the manufacture offence, in fact they are not the same offences, nor do they have any overlapping elements such as the decision in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 that would apply. It seems to me to be a case where the offence of supply should be punished by the very same sentence that was imposed for the manufacture. As I say, those two offences were part and parcel of the same criminality, the manufacturing offence being committed in order to supply the methylamphetamine manufactured by Mr Little.  
     
      
    7 Therefore, in order to deal with all offences that were before the Court for which Mr Little stood to be sentenced, in respect of the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, Mr Little is sentenced to imprisonment for twenty-two years to commence from 24 September 2001 with a non-parole period of 16 years and six months as specified in relation to that sentence. That non-parole period is to commence on the same date as the head sentence and to expire on 23 March 2018. On that date Mr Little will be eligible to be released to parole both in relation to the manufacture prohibited drug charge and supply prohibited drug charge.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BRYSON JA: The applicant Brett David Kershaw applies for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him by his Honour Judge Sides Q.C. in the District Court at Campbelltown on Friday 26 March 2004. On 3 November 2003 the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge on indictment that on 2 December 2002 at Tahmoor he had sexual intercourse with Karina Kershaw without her consent and knowing she was not consenting. Mrs Kershaw and the applicant were married in or about 1987 and they are still married. Under s.61I of the Crimes Act 1900 the maximum penalty for the offence charged is imprisonment for fourteen years. The proceedings were listed for trial at Campbelltown on 3 November 2003 but the applicant pleaded guilty when indicted. The learned Judge heard evidence and proceedings relating to the plea of guilty on several days including 12 March 2004. On 26 March 2004 his Honour made Remarks on Sentence and sentenced the applicant to five years’ imprisonment, which commenced on 26 March 2004, with a non-parole period of two and a half years so that eligibility for parole is to commence on 25 September 2006. When sentencing the applicant the learned Judge took into account a further offence on a Form 1 document under s.32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 of contravening an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO). The ground of appeal is that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    2 This is the first custodial sentence to be imposed on the applicant. The applicant had several previous convictions, including Children’s Court matters and motoring offences, which are not of present significance. Presently significant is a conviction for common assault against Mrs Kershaw at Picton Local Court on 27 July 1998; on this occasion the applicant entered into a Recognizance to be of good behaviour for twelve months, to accept the supervision of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service, and to attend Anger Management counselling as directed.  
     
      
    3 A Statement of Agreed Facts was admitted in evidence. The Agreed Facts may be summarised for present purpose as follows. Mrs Kershaw (39 years old), and Mr Kershaw (39 years old) have been married for about 16 years. In 2002 they lived together at 27 Straun Street, Tahmoor with their one daughter, Samara Kershaw who was then aged eight years old. Mrs Kershaw started sleeping on a mattress in the lounge-room after an argument on Thursday 28 November 2002. On Sunday 1 December 2002 Mr and Mrs Kershaw and their eight-year-old daughter were at home. There were arguments between the applicant and Mrs Kershaw through the afternoon and evening. During the evening the applicant pushed Mrs Kershaw really hard; she stumbled back and was upset, and she rang the police who attended and removed the applicant from the house, and obtained a Telephone Interim AVO. That night Mrs Kershaw slept on the mattress in the lounge-room and the applicant spent the night elsewhere.  
     
      
    4 The AVO had effect for 14 days and was accompanied by a Summons returnable at the Local Court of Moss Vale on 5 December 2002. The AVO contained standard orders restraining intimidating conduct and other conduct directed against Mrs Kershaw as the protected person, and additional orders restraining the applicant from entering premises where Mrs Kershaw resided or worked, specifically naming the house at 27 Struan Street, Tahmoor, whilst under the influence of alcohol, with some further supplementary restraints. That is to say, the applicant was not restrained against being at the house, but was restrained against being at the house or approaching Mrs Kershaw when under the influence of alcohol, liquor and/or illicit drugs. 5 The applicant returned to the house on the morning of 2 December 2002, and complained about Mrs Kershaw’s calling the police and obtaining the AVO. The applicant walked to the main bedroom, but returned shortly afterwards naked. Mrs Kershaw told him that she was not willing to have sex with him and was not going to change her mind about the AVO. He pulled back the doona and lay on top of her. She struggled, resisted and screamed, but she stopped screaming when she realised that their daughter who was sleeping in the nearby room might wake up; she continued to protest but the applicant proceeded to force intercourse on her. He then went to the bedroom. After a while Mrs Kershaw got up, got their daughter ready for school and made the child’s lunch in the kitchen. The applicant came to the kitchen and spoke to Mrs Kershaw again; and arguments continued. Mrs Kershaw left the house about 9.20 am, took their daughter to school and then went to Wollondilly Family Services at Tahmoor, where she complained to staff and later to police, who arranged for her to be medically examined. She returned to the house with their daughter about 9.15 pm. The applicant was there, arguments resumed, Mrs Kershaw called the police who arrived and arrested the applicant. On that night there was a lengthy electronically recorded interview in which the applicant denied Mrs Kershaw’s complaints. Later the police obtained DNA testing. 6 In the proceedings on sentence the applicant gave evidence which showed that he still had a relationship with Mrs Kershaw, that his primary focus in the relationship was to care for their daughter, and also to see Mrs Kershaw, and that he lived separately at Windang but visited Mrs Kershaw and their daughter sometimes once or twice a week, sometimes once a fortnight. A sexual relationship between the applicant and Mrs Kershaw continued; and arguments and disagreements continued, mostly revolving around their daughter or money, in a manner the applicant described as “fiery;” but the arguments did not involve physical force or threats of violence. The applicant had undertaken counselling and said that he reacted to disagreements by removing himself from the house and leaving. 7 Mrs Kershaw gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence and confirmed significant aspects of the applicant’s evidence, including the continuance of their sexual relationship on an occasional basis, and the applicant’s improvements in managing his anger. Her evidence showed that they met perhaps once every two weeks: usually the applicant visited Mrs Kershaw and their daughter at Tahmoor but sometimes Mrs Kershaw and their daughter travelled to Windang to see the applicant. The following appears in the oral evidence of Mrs Kershaw: (t9/28-30) 
     
      
       
        
        Q. How would you describe the relationship between the two of you at the moment? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It still has its ups and downs. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      … 
       
       
        
        Q. You heard Mr Kershaw also say that there’s times when you still have disagreements? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is that true? Do you still have disagreements? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes we do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And I think you heard him say that sometimes your arguments get a little bit fiery? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes we [are] both very verbal. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You also heard Mr Kershaw say that now, if he thinks [that things] are getting out of control, he removes himself from wherever you are when the argument is occurring. Would you agree with that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes I would. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And I think the nature of the allegations and what happened around these events was some threats of physical violence as well as the actual physical violence perpetrated on you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Has anything like that happened since these allegations arose? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. I think actually it’s changed since Brett has completed the course. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What areas have you noted are changing? 
        
       
       
        
        A. More to do with Brett’s anger, the fact that if a situation had got to the levels that it used to get to Brett wouldn’t have done the things that he does. Like now he would leave and he’s – I can’t really put it into a word but he just handles the situation totally different. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you think maybe the best thing is that you both live apart now? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No not really. I actually think the course has actually helped more than anything in my view. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you still have feelings for him? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes I do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re aware that it’s a very serious offence? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes I do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And there’s every possibility that a full-time custodial sentence may be imposed. What effect do you think such a course of action might have on your family? 
        
       
       
        
        A. As for my daughter it would be very devastating and the consequences of it would be left up to me to explain to her why her father isn’t around because I’ve never denied her the chance to pick up the phone whenever she felt like it and rang him and that could be you know three times in a day on a Saturday if that’s what she felt like, if there was something specific she wanted to tell her father I’d let her pick up the phone and ring him and talk to him, all the things that have occurred at school I’ve allowed her when she’s come from school to actually pick up the phone and tell him and I feel that the consequence of all this is going to fall back onto me.  
        
       
       
      Mrs Kershaw agreed that home life was more stable since the applicant moved out. 
       
      
    8 Although it was not precisely stated by either the applicant or Mrs Kershaw, their evidence tends to suggest that they had continued seeing each other throughout the whole period between the offence and the proceedings on sentence.9 The applicant consulted a Psychologist, Keith Dawes, whose report was in evidence. The report dated 5 December 2003 is extensive and includes a psychometric assessment based on the IPAT self-administering anxiety questionnaire (which appears to me to have revealed nothing remarkable) and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (this again appears to me to have revealed nothing remarkable). I note that Mr Dawes’ assessment under the heading “Criminality” was:  
     
      
       
        
        Mr Kershaw scores at the higher end of the control “non-prisoner” population, and at the lower end of the prisoner population (mean 15.57, standard deviation 5.18). He is unlikely to be a repeat offender if he can resolve his marital arrangements. 
        
       
      
    10 In the course of his clinical evaluation of the applicant’s relationship with Mrs Kershaw, Mr Dawes reported, among other things,  
     
      
       
        
        5. Mr Kershaw said that his wife has had a prolonged physical relationship with a male co-worker from her place of employment. This has been discussed with him by his family Doctor, Dr Challender of Tahmoor, and has been subject to intense couples counselling by Ms Judy Green Psychologist of Lakesland. Some seven years ago the couple attended marital counselling with a Counsellor from the Wollondilly Family Services. 
        
       
       
        
        6. While in North Queensland, Karina Kershaw had him charged with assault and he was required to attend an Anger Management course conducted by the Queensland Corrective Services. 
        
       
       
        
        7. Currently, Mr Kershaw receives very many telephone messages from his wife ranging from message pleading for him to “come home” to “outright hostile vindictive” messages. It is not unusual for him to receive these messages in the middle of the night. 
        
       
      
    11 Mr Dawes’ opinion and recommendations were these:  
     
      
       
        
        Opinion 
        
       
       
        
        Brett Kershaw is a man who had entered into a marriage without effective marital relationship skills to a woman with similar deficits. This is a co-dependent relationship; it is based on untenable expectations. It appears that each’s expectations have not been met and that they remain together because of their daughter, but more likely because of quite dysfunctional needs. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Kershaw knows that he has breached his AVO conditions by sexually assaulting his wife and expects to be given an appropriate sentence. I agree with him, yet I find it difficult to think that he may receive a sentence that may disrupt many of his future arrangements, because of his inability to find a solution to his domestic conflict. 
        
       
       
        
        The crisis that has arisen from the matters before this Court has given rise to some intense thinking for Mr Kershaw. He has yet to reach a resolution on how to proceed in his life.  
        
       
       
        
        Recommendations 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Kershaw needs a series of individual consultations with a qualified counsellor to assist him to reach a series of decisions that will strengthen his resolve in regard to his familial relationships. 
        
       
      
    12 A pre-sentence report dated 11 March 2004 by Ms Kathryn Baudinette, a Probation and Parole Officer, was also in evidence. History and review in this report include reference to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service of the applicant while on a one-year supervised Recognizance in 1998 on conviction for an assault on Mrs Kershaw, in the course of which he completed an Anger Management Programme run by the Queensland Department of Community Corrections. The report said: “ANGER MANAGEMENT The offender completed an eighteen-week Domestic Violence Programme run by ‘Lifecare’ and also participated in some one-to-one counselling. While Mr Kershaw’s attendance was good, no significant attitudinal changes were noted.” Under SUMMARY AND SENTENCING OPTIONS Ms Baudinette reported:  
     
      
       
        
        Mr Kershaw appears to have problems of management particularly when under the influence of alcohol, as testified by his criminal record. Whilst he has completed a small amount of one to one counselling and a domestic violence programme, it would appear that these therapeutic measures were not enough to effect a significant change in attitude. It is, therefore, considered that further therapeutic intervention would be a necessary adjunct to either a community-based or a custodial sentence. 
        
       
      
    13 In the course of submissions before the learned Judge it was accepted on behalf of the Crown that the applicant’s evidence showed true expressions of remorse. 
     
      
    14 On appeal Senior Counsel for the applicant contended that the applicant had never committed such an offence as that for which he is now sentenced, and had never been to prison before. It was further contended, correctly, that the applicant was remorseful and contrite for his conduct and its impact upon Mrs Kershaw, and that the Crown accepted that this was so. The learned Judge referred in the course of his reasons to there being some evidence of contrition, albeit belated, and said that this would be reflected in the sentence imposed. The words used by the learned Judge show however that in his Honour’s appraisal the significance of contrition was qualified because of the time at which it emerged, after some early denials of the offence. It seems unlikely that the element of contrition had any large part in the learned Judge’s determination of sentence. 15 Counsel contended that remorse was a significant mitigating factor and further contended: 
     
      
       
        
        The fact that [Mrs Kershaw] had continued her relationship with the applicant strongly supports the inference that she accepted that he was remorseful. It would not make sense for her continuing to see the applicant, and engage in sexual activity with him, if she thought anything to the contrary. This is particularly so in light of the difficulties she experienced with sexual activity and the sensitivity that the applicant was required to accord to her in such situations. 
        
       
       
      Counsel also submitted that“[t]o say that [the evidence of contrition] was ‘belated’ flies in the face of [Mrs Kershaw’s] attitude.”  
       
      
    16 It was also contended that the reduction of ten per cent expressed by the learned Judge to be made for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty was very meagre, and in his submissions counsel contended “Saving [Mrs Kershaw], in a case such as this, from the need to give evidence at trial was particularly worthy of a greater level of discount.” Counsel also referred to what was said to be an anomaly in seeing what effect was produced by the discount of ten per cent which the learned Judge decided to apply: it was contended that, after applying the ten per cent discount, the sentence imposed on the applicant would indicate that the Trial Judge had imposed a head sentence of 5 years 6 months and 20 days which was an unusually odd figure for a starting point.  
     
      
    17 It is true that a recalculation of the sentence adopted by his Honour on the assumption that it was reached by applying a ten per cent discount to some period of time which had been the notional starting point produces a rather odd and unlikely figure as the starting point; but this line of reasoning is not an available critique of the learned Judge’s reasoning, as there might well have been some higher starting point, there was room for an allowance for contrition and for other mitigating factors to which the learned Judge referred; and in any event the attribution of mathematical precision to this discretionary process is spurious. The exercise is not a mathematical exercise, and it would usually be correct to interpret a reference to a percentage discount as a reference to the order of discount rather than to a mathematically precise discount. It is not in my opinion correct to treat a discount of ten per cent for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty as meagre; ten per cent is quite a significant discount to make in a sentence of imprisonment, and in all reason the prospect of obtaining such a discount ought to have a significant part in attaining utilitarian values for the community at large, and also for the interests of persons who are in a position to make pleas of guilty. Over all, the learned Judge’s reasoning and conclusion show ample room for the allowance of a discount which was appropriate. 
     
      
    18 Counsel also made observations on the learned Judge’s treatment of the effect of Anger Management counselling upon the applicant’s attitude. Observations on this subject in the Remarks on Sentence include reference to the Pre-sentence Report dealing with the eighteen-week Domestic Violence Programme run by Lifecare. The learned Judge said (Remarks on Sentence 8-9)  
     
      
       
        
        The pre-sentence report observes, in connection with that course and counselling, that the Offender's attendance was good, but 'no significant attitudinal changes were noted.' 
         
         
        In contrast, the evidence given by the Offender and the victim painted a different picture in connection with what he had derived from the counselling and the Life Care Facing Up Program. In his evidence the Offender said that it had taught him about the underlying causes of anger and how to view oneself and that it was not okay to use emotions against others. He contrasted it with the anger management course that he had done after the 1998 offence. He said that course was designed to identify triggers to anger and to teach one how to respond. The more recent programs had taught him about emotional control and acting out. He said in evidence that he and the victim still had disagreements, sometimes fiery ones, but he now walks away. The victim gave evidence that, since the offence, the Offender had completed the course and the Offender handles situations differently than in the past. He walks away. Unfortunately this part of their evidence was not tested by cross-examination based on question and answer 146 to 148 of the ERISP interview or the opinion of the Probation Officer. 
        
       
      
    19 The learned Judge went on to review passages in the Ms Baudinette’s report relating to the applicant’s attitude to his relationship with Mrs Kershaw, the applicant’s assertion at times that he had no recollection of the offence, and the dysfunctional nature of the applicant’s relationship with Mrs Kershaw; and said: (Remarks on Sentence 10)  
     
      
       
        
        ...the fact that [the relationship] is being maintained in some form is of concern in connection with his prospects of rehabilitation. In the past the Offender had the benefit of anger management programs, but the violence continued. Although the Offender and the victim painted a picture of significant change since the completion of the recent programs this is in the context of charges not yet being finalised and in marked contrast to the independent opinion of the Probation Officer. I note Mr Dawes is of the opinion that the Offender is unlikely to be a repeat offender if he can resolve his marital arrangements. 
        
       
      
    20 The learned Judge then went on to refer, extensively, to the objective seriousness of the offence, in the course of which his Honour said: (Remarks on Sentence 11-12)  
     
      
       
        
        His criminality is in no way lessened because the victim was his wife. In my view his criminality is aggravated because of that fact. He knew what impact the crime would have on her, that he had breached the trust and respect that existed between them in the past. With that knowledge he proceeded with the crime. This should be viewed in the context of the dysfunctional relationship. The crime was committed in the victim's own house, where she was entitled to feel free from such violation. There is no evidence that the Offender was affected by liquor at the time of the offence. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In all the circumstances I am not persuaded that his prospects of rehabilitation are any better that good. I am not persuaded that it is unlikely that he will re-offend. That proposition does not mean that I make a finding that he will re-offend. 
        
       
      
    21 It was contended that the learned Judge took a harsh view in the finding that the continuation of the applicant and Mrs Kershaw’s relationship is of concern in connection with prospects of rehabilitation. Counsel referred to passages in the evidence of Mrs Kershaw which appear to show, quite clearly, that she has a favourable view of the future of the relationship and of the applicant’s future conduct. 
     
      
    22 It is plain that the learned Judge in his assessment of the prospects of rehabilitation and of the significance of the relationship did not follow or adopt the interpretation made by Mrs Kershaw. I do not have the advantages which the learned Judge had of seeing the applicant and Mrs Kershaw and of hearing their evidence given orally. Mrs Kershaw’s understandings and expectations about the future should not have a prominent part in a sentencing decision. This is not a field of decision of which complainants in Mrs Kershaw’s position can take control. Her interpretation follows her experience over some years of their unsatisfactory relationship, involving an earlier conviction for assault followed by Anger Management counselling, complete disregard of an AVO and a serious crime committed against her, and it is in no way remarkable that the learned Judge took an altogether different view to hers. The Judge had before him Mr Dawes’ interpretation: “This is a co-dependent relationship; it is based on untenable expectations.” 
     
      
    23 Counsel for the applicant made observations on the learned Judge’s statement that “… his criminality is aggravated because of that fact” [i.e. that the victim was his wife]. It was submitted that his Honour was in error in regarding this as aggravating the gravity of the offence. In my view, the learned Judge expressed as well as it reasonably might be expressed an aggravating circumstance of the offence which it is difficult to define, and the force of his Honour’s conclusion is not reasonably open to observations about supposed anomalies when contrasted with commission of a crime in other places than in a home or against other persons than a person within a domestic relationship. Counsel referred to R v. Comert [2004] NSWCCA 125 and to observations by Sully J at 21-24 and Hidden and Hislop JJ at 29 about the circumstances of a reference in that case to the offence having been committed in the complainant’s own home. Those observations were not to uniform effect; they related to the case then under consideration and were not intended to establish and do not establish any general principle.  
     
      
    24 In cases involving domestic violence it happens from time to time that a complainant is shown to have a forgiving and optimistic attitude about violence in the relationship which it is difficult for others to understand or share. The sentencing process is not and of course should not be in the hands of complainants, and the merciful or relenting attitude of a complainant does not reduce the gravity of the offence and does not have much effect on the interest of justice in imposing an appropriate sentence. Cf R v. Glen (unreported, NSWCCA, 19 December 1994) per Simpson J.  
     
      
    25 It is clear that the learned Judge took a severe view of the gravity of the offence, and this was justified by the facts of the offence. The sentence imposed, while recognisably severe, was not in my opinion disproportionate to the offence itself. The maximum penalty prescribed by statute is high, there was a prior conviction for assaulting the same complainant, the offence was committed after undergoing supervision and counselling under a Recognizance, and a breach of an AVO occurred and was taken into account. The applicant responded to the AVO with aggressive violence. An AVO is an important measure to secure peace order and safety for the community and its members, and conduct in breach of an AVO merits punishment. 
     
      
    26 The sentence was recognisably severe, but in my opinion was not so severe as to show that the discretion to determine the sentence was affected by some error, or to show that it was manifestly excessive. In my opinion there is no ground for appellate intervention. 27 In my opinion the Court of Criminal Appeal should make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to Appeal granted. 
       
       
      (2) Appeal dismissed.

      Offences and sentence 
       
      On 18 December 2003 the applicant pleaded guilty to four counts of steal a motor vehicle under s154AA(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900. The offences occurred on 1 March 2003, 23 March 2003, 3 May 2003 and 11 May 2003. The maximum penalty for each offence is 10 years imprisonment. 
       
      
    4 On 21 June 2004 the applicant came before his Honour Delaney DCJ for sentence. The sentences imposed by his Honour were: 
     
      
       
      (i) For the offence of 1 March 2003 – a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to commence 21 June 2004 and to expire on 20 December 2005. 
       
       
      (ii) For the offence of 23 March 2003 – a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to commence on 21 December 2004 and to expire on 20 June 2006. 
       
       
      (iii) For the offence of 3 May 2003 – a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to commence on 21 June 2005 and to expire on 20 December 2006. 
       
       
      (iv) In respect of the offence of 11 May 2003 – a non-parole period of 18 months imprisonment to commence on 20 September 2005 and to expire on 20 March 2007 with a parole period of 12 months to commence on 21 March 2007 and expire on 20 March 2008. 
       
       
      In summary the applicant was sentenced to a total period of imprisonment of 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months. 
       
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    5 Because of the way in which the appeal was argued, it is necessary to set out briefly the factual circumstances surrounding each offence. 
     
      
    6 On Saturday 1 March 2003 the applicant attended the Asquith and Johnson Car Dealership. She there test drove a Peugeot 406 coupe. In order to do so she carefully dressed herself in a business suit and produced a driver’s licence in a false name, Samantha Maree Jones. The false licence bore the applicant’s photograph. The applicant persuaded the salesman to allow her to take the Peugeot for a test drive. She did not return it. The value of the Peugeot was approximately $60,000. 
     
      
    7 On 23 March 2003 the applicant attended a Lexus car dealership in Church Street, Parramatta. Dressed in a similar fashion and using the same false name and licence, she test-drove a Lexus IS300 sedan. She did not return it. The vehicle was valued at $66,000.  
     
      
    8 On 3 May 2003 the applicant attended New Rowley Motors at 393 Pacific Highway, Artarmon and test-drove a Jaguar Sovereign saloon. Again she used a false name and a false licence. The vehicle was not returned. The Jaguar was valued at approximately $60,000. 
     
      
    9 On 11 May 2003 the applicant attended the Audi Centre Car Dealership at 49-53 Church Street, Parramatta and test-drove an Audi All Road station wagon. As with all of the other offences, the applicant wore a business suit, provided a false story as to why she intended to buy the car, used a false name and licence, test drove the Audi and did not return it. The value of the Audi was approximately $88,900. 
     
      
    10 The Peugeot and Audi were made available to the applicant’s de facto husband, Jason Palinko, who exchanged parts of the stolen vehicles with damaged vehicles of similar make so as to “rebirth” an apparently undamaged vehicle. It was while the applicant was a passenger in the “rebirthed” Peugeot that she was arrested for the motor vehicle thefts on 18 July 2003. The two stolen vehicles, which were used in the “rebirthing” procedure, were destroyed. The parts, which were not used in the “rebirthing” activity, were sold and otherwise disposed of. The applicant entered a plea of guilty to the four offences on 18 December 2003, which was accepted as the earliest point in time that she could reasonably do so.  
     
      
    11 The applicant gave evidence in the sentencing procedures. The effect of that evidence was that she had stolen the Jaguar and Lexus motor vehicles because she had always wanted to drive such expensive vehicles but knew she could not afford to do so. Having driven each vehicle for some hours she then panicked and abandoned it with its keys and was unable to advise the court further as to what happened to each vehicle. His Honour did not accept that evidence. His Honour was not told what had happened to those vehicles. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    12 His Honour analysed in considerable detail the statements which had been obtained from the various salesmen, who had been duped by the applicant, in relation to the theft of each vehicle. These statements formed part of the agreed facts which were before his Honour. Having done so his Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have reached the conclusion from a consideration of the evidence of the offender, a comparison of the statements, that in relation to the manner in which these offences were carried out, they showed concentration, memory, judgment and logical and rational thought on the part of the offender, together with a studied patience and cunning to persuade the car salesmen to part with their vehicles despite in some of the cases their clear directions not to permit a person to take the cars in the circumstances, without going with the person taking them.” (ROS 5) 
        
       
      
    13 His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “One of the reasons that I have outlined in the detail which I have, the statements made by the car salesmen is to indicate that by the method of speaking to the car salesmen, her mode of dress and appearance, and the careful way in which she waited for the opportunity to be able to take the vehicle on her own were all matters which I have taken into account in determining the extent of the criminality of this case.” (ROS 14) 
        
       
      
    14 It had been submitted on behalf of the applicant that at the time when the offences took place she was suffering from post natal depression (her child having been born approximately ten months before) and that in some fashion she was not fully responsible for her actions. His Honour rejected that submission: 
     
      
       
        
        “These facts are in my opinion, inconsistent with any claim to be depressed or upset or concerned when, in the situations that I have now outlined, the offences were committed. 
        
       
       
        
        Indeed as I have said already, I am satisfied this was a deliberate course of conduct on her part. I reject the explanation that she has given about the way in which she disposed of the second and third vehicles. 
        
       
       
        
        In saying that, there is material which indicates that not only was she unlikely to have panicked after she had undertaken the course of deception that I have outlined but that it is unlikely that she would have just left the vehicles as she said that she did and abandon them to their fate.” (ROS 14-15) 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour noted that the applicant had no previous convictions. In relation to her plea of guilty he considered that there was real utilitarian value in it and allowed in her favour a twenty five percent discount on sentence. His Honour also had regard to the following specific subjective features. 
     
      
       
      (i) The applicant was born on 5 February 1981 and was therefore twenty-two at the time of the offences. 
       
       
      (ii) She had some problems at home in the early stages of her life, worked for approximately fourteen months after she left school and formed a relationship with Mr Palinko from the age of sixteen. 
       
       
      (iii) As a result of the relationship with Mr Palinko, the applicant gave birth to a child in July 2002. The birth of this child apparently caused difficulties between the applicant and Mr Palinko and at the time of the offences, the applicant was living with her child separately from Mr Palinko. 
       
       
      (iv) The applicant had been a reasonably heavy user of cannabis since the age of eighteen. 
       
       
      (v) At the time of the offences the applicant was in financial difficulty in that Mr Palinko was not paying regular child maintenance. She had become depressed, but had not sought any counselling or psychiatric assistance. 
       
      
    16 His Honour found that little weight should be given to the applicant’s expressions of remorse and contrition, except insofar as they were raised by the early plea of guilty. He made that finding on the basis of the way in which the offences had been committed and the applicant’s explanation as to why she stole the vehicles, the subject of counts 2 and 3. 
     
      
    17 His Honour did have specific regard to the potential hardship to which the applicant’s child would be exposed if the applicant were sentenced to a fulltime period of imprisonment. His Honour noted, however, that there were provisions for very young children to be allowed to stay with their mothers in prison in certain circumstances. While taking this matter into account, his Honour did not find that it constituted exceptional circumstances. 
     
      
    18 His Honour made reference to s21A of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act and had regard to aggravating and mitigating factors referred to therein. Specifically his Honour noted that the applicant had no criminal record and had not previously been subject to a term of imprisonment. 
     
      
    19 His Honour did find special circumstances which favoured the applicant. He identified those special circumstances as being the youth of the applicant, the need for rehabilitation to be undertaken after her release, the fact that this was her first time in custody and that she was a person of previous good character with no other convictions. His Honour also noted that the value of the vehicles stolen was well in excess of $200,000. 
     
      
    20 In fixing the sentences his Honour had specific regard to the objective seriousness of each offence (R v Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610) but also to the principle of totality in relation to all of the sentences awarded by him (R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34). It was as a result of that analysis that his Honour awarded the sentences referred to. 
     
      
       
      Appeal 
       
       
      Ground 1 – The aggregate sentence was too severe, having regard to the objective features of the offences 
       
      
    21 The submissions in support of this ground are misconceived. They depend upon an acceptance of the evidence of the applicant that she abandoned the Jaguar and Lexus (counts 2 and 3) because she panicked after she stole them and abandoned those vehicles at unknown locations in the city. Those assertions by the applicant were not accepted by his Honour. 
     
      
    22 The submission also fails to have regard to the detailed consideration which his Honour gave to the statements from salesmen, who had been deceived by the applicant, and his findings as to the relatively high level of culpability associated with each offence. Error has not been demonstrated, either in his Honour’s consideration of each individual offence or in the totality of the sentences awarded by his Honour in relation to all four offences. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – The aggregate sentence was too severe, having regard to the subjective features of the applicant 
       
      
    23 The submission in support of this ground of appeal replicates the subjective matters to which his Honour specifically referred in his remarks on sentence. The complaint made by the applicant is that his Honour did not give sufficient weight to the subjective considerations. The weight to be given to such subjective considerations is an essentially discretionary matter. Provided his Honour adequately considered those subjective matters (which he did) no error in his Honour’s approach has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    24 Although there was evidence from a psychiatrist that at the time of the offences the applicant was suffering from post-natal depression, his Honour was not obliged to find that the condition contributed to the offences. His Honour was entitled to have regard to the ingenuity exhibited by the applicant when dealing with unexpected situations which arose during the course of the commission of the offences. This was inconsistent with an inability of the applicant to think rationally. This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 – The sentencing judge should not have found that “there is no other penalty appropriate, other than a sentence of fulltime imprisonment”. 
       
      
    25 The submission in support of this ground appears to be based on a comment made by the Crown in the course of submissions before the evidence was complete that: 
     
      
       
        
        “I don’t think the court would be in appealable error at all with a suspended sentence in this matter ….” 
        
       
      
    26 It is trite to say that a sentencing judge is not bound by such a concession. The sentencing judge is obliged to make an assessment having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence and established sentencing principles. In any event this concession by the Crown was subsequently withdrawn in the course of final submissions after further evidence. 
     
      
    27 His Honour considered whether an alternative to a sentence of fulltime imprisonment was appropriate but rejected that option in a reasoned and logical way. No error has been demonstrated in his Honour’s approach to that question. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 – His Honour should have ordered the sentences to be served concurrently 
       
      
    28 The submission in support of this ground was that because the modus operandi in each offence was the same, the sentences awarded should have been served concurrently. It was also submitted that rehabilitation had already been achieved at the time of the applicant’s arrest since two months had passed since her last offence. 
     
      
    29 His Honour set out clearly his reasons for partially accumulating the sentences. He had regard to the number of offences and their seriousness. Each offence occurred on a different date and a different entity suffered damage. No error in his Honour’s reasoning in relation to accumulation has been demonstrated. Similarly, the fact that two months had passed between the applicant’s last offence and her arrest provided no basis for the submission that without the arrest her course of criminality would not have continued. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    30 As has often been stated, this is a Court of error not a court of rehearing. Unless error is demonstrated this Court does not intervene. His Honour’s findings were open to him on the evidence and his analysis was in accordance with proper sentencing principles. No error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    31 The orders which I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (ii) Appeal dismissed.

      Offences and sentence 
       
      On 29 March 2004 the applicant entered a plea of guilty at Parramatta Local Court in relation to two counts of receiving motor vehicles contrary to s188 of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900. The offences took place as to count 1, between 1 March 2003 (the date of theft) and 18 July 2003 (the date of recovery) and as to count 2, between 11 May 2003 (date of theft) and 18 July 2003 (the date of recovery). Each offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 years. 
       
      
    4 The applicant came before his Honour Delaney DCJ for sentence on 8 June 2004. The applicant adhered to his plea of guilty. His Honour sentenced the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) As to count 1, a fixed term of imprisonment for 18 months to commence on 8 June 2004 and expire on 7 December 2006. 
       
       
      (ii) As to count 2, imprisonment for 3 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 2 years, such non-parole period to commence on 8 December 2004 and expire on 7 December 2006. The parole period would commence on 8 December 2006 and expire on 7 March 2008. In effect the applicant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole of 2 years 6 months. 
       
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    5 The applicant was born on 25 August 1978 and was in a de facto relationship with Tracey Lee-Ann Scott, but at the time of the offences they were living separately. The couple had a daughter born in July 2002. The applicant’s brother-in-law was a Danny Touma. 
     
      
    6 On 2 December 2002 a Peugeot 406 coupe, which the applicant owned, was involved in a motor vehicle collision and was significantly damaged. The applicant’s comprehensive insurer paid out the finance company and allowed the applicant to keep the damaged Peugeot 406 coupe. Despite this, the applicant was considerably out of pocket as a result of the accident. 
     
      
    7 Some time after 1 March 2003, the applicant visited Tracey Scott at her Greystanes residence. On that occasion he saw a red Peugeot 406 coupe in the driveway. Ms Scott gave the vehicle to him. He suspected that the vehicle was stolen but asked no questions. 
     
      
    8 In fact the red Peugeot 406 coupe had been stolen from the Asquith and Johnson car dealership on 1 March 2003 by Ms Scott. She stole the vehicle by means of subterfuge. There was no evidence that the applicant was aware of the means by which Ms Scott stole that vehicle. 
     
      
    9 The applicant took the stolen Peugeot to his residence in Punchbowl. He then swapped compliance plates, the chassis number, engine numbers and licence plates from his damaged Peugeot to the stolen Peugeot. This required some, but not particularly extensive, mechanical work. On 11 June 2003 the applicant took the “rebirthed” red Peugeot to the RTA office at Bankstown where he renewed its registration by reference to the licence plates from the damaged Peugeot. 
     
      
    10 On 7 May 2003 Mr Touma purchased an extensively damaged Audi motor vehicle. On 11 May 2003 Ms Scott attended the Audi Centre car dealership at Church Street, Parramatta and again, using a subterfuge, stole an Audi all road station sedan from that dealership.  
     
      
    11 The applicant first saw the stolen Audi on the weekend following its theft. It was in the backyard of the Greystanes premises of Ms Scott. He suspected that it was stolen but again did not seek any details from Ms Scott. The applicant said that he decided to dismantle it, as he knew his brother-in-law, Mr Touma, needed Audi spare parts. An arrangement was made with Mr Touma for the two Audi vehicles to be brought to the same location. 
     
      
    12 The applicant stripped the following items from the stolen Audi – the front end, the bonnet, guards, one headlight, a grille, bumper bar, a radiator support, a section of the front chassis about 30 centimetres long, the air conditioner condenser and the pulleys on the front of the motor. He also removed parts of the locking mechanism and the engine control unit. He sold those parts to Mr Touma for $2,000-$3,000. He got rid of the remaining parts of the stolen Audi by cutting them up and sending the metal to a recycling yard. 
     
      
    13 On 17 January 2004 the applicant was arrested whilst in the company of Ms Scott. He was interviewed and made full admissions as to the “rebirthing” of the stolen red Peugeot and also provided the investigating police with full information concerning his actions in relation to the stolen Audi. The applicant agreed that he had engaged in this activity for monetary gain. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    14 Having reviewed the facts surrounding the offences, his Honour recorded the following subjective matters concerning the applicant. 
     
      
       
      (i) The applicant had no information concerning how Ms Scott had acquired the Peugeot and Audi. 
       
       
      (ii) He had been abusing cannabis at a heavy rate from the age of eighteen until December 2003. 
       
       
      (iii) He had been educated to year 12 standard, leaving school in 1996. Thereafter he had been in reasonably steady employment. He was working as a machine operator at the date of sentence. 
       
       
      (iv) He and Ms Scott had met in early 1997. Soon after they had commenced a relationship. Not long after the theft of the Audi they had resumed living together again. Prior to that they had been separated for six-eight months. Their daughter was aged nine months at the time of the first offence. 
       
       
      (v) Apart from a previous conviction for entering prescribed premises without lawful excuse, for which he was fined $100, the applicant had a clear record. 
       
       
      (v) The applicant had fully co-operated with the police following his arrest and had entered a plea of guilty at the first opportunity. 
       
      
    15 The applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. His Honour was not prepared to accept that part of the applicant’s evidence where he said that he did not appreciate that what he was doing was wrong and that he was not thinking of the consequences of his actions. His Honour found to the criminal standard that the applicant knew precisely what he was doing and went ahead with it knowing that it was wrong to do so and that the two vehicles had been stolen. 
     
      
    16 Because the plea of guilty had been entered at the earliest reasonable time, and having regard to the remorse and contrition that such an early plea of guilty demonstrated, his Honour allowed in favour of the applicant a discount on sentence of twenty-five percent. 
     
      
    17 In relation to rehabilitation his Honour concluded that the Probation and Parole Service report indicated that the applicant had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. The applicant would need to overcome his abuse of cannabis. His Honour did not regard that abuse as an excuse for the offences. He did, however, note the applicant’s age and lack of any serious criminal record in assessing his rehabilitation prospects. 
     
      
    18 His Honour also analysed the objective seriousness of the offences. He noted that they were two in number and occurred within two months of each other. The penalty imposed by the legislature of 12 years for such offences indicated how seriously they were regarded. Because of the element of planning which went into the “rebirthing” of the Audi, and the fact that there were two offences committed close together, his Honour assessed the level of criminality as near the middle of the range. 
     
      
    19 Due to the seriousness of the offences, his Honour concluded that a custodial sentence was required. He had regard to s3A (purposes of sentencing) and s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act when considering what periods of imprisonment were appropriate. In relation to aggravating factors, his Honour noted the value of the two cars (in excess of $100,000) and that two offences were involved. By way of mitigation his Honour had regard to the applicant’s relatively good criminal record, his previous good character, his good prospects of rehabilitation and his early plea of guilty. 
     
      
    20 His Honour decided that the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the parole period should be altered in the applicant’s favour because of his age, the fact that this would be his first time in prison, that some accumulation was being provided for in his sentences and that he would need a period of supervision upon his release to assist in his rehabilitation.  
     
      
    21 His Honour also had regard to Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 when he sought to balance the relative culpability of each offence with the requirement for totality in relation to the aggregate sentence. It was against that background that his Honour awarded the sentences referred to. 
     
      
       
      Appeal 
       
      Ground 1 – The aggregate sentence was too severe, having regard to the combined objective seriousness of the two offences 
       
      
    22 The submission in support of this ground depended upon an acceptance of the evidence of the applicant that he did not appreciate that what he was doing was wrong and that he was not thinking about the consequences of his actions. That evidence was not accepted by his Honour. 
     
      
    23 The submission fails to have regard to the detailed consideration, which his Honour gave to the objective seriousness of the offence. His Honour made specific reference to the work performed by the applicant in relation to the vehicles and the degree of planning which was involved, particularly in relation to the Audi. Error has not been demonstrated, either in his Honour’s consideration of each individual offence or the totality of the sentences awarded. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – The aggregate sentence was too severe, having regard to the subjective features 
       
      
    24 The submission in support of this ground replicated the subjective matters to which his Honour specifically referred in his remarks on sentence. The complaint by the applicant was that his Honour did not give sufficient weight to those subjective considerations. The weight to be given to subjective considerations was an essentially discretionary matter. Provided his Honour adequately considered those subjective matters (which he did) no error in his Honour’s approach has been demonstrated. No error of the kind referred to in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 has been identified. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 – The sentencing judge should not have found that “there is no other penalty appropriate, other than a sentence of fulltime imprisonment” 
       
      
    25 It was submitted that the applicant’s admissions in relation to the second offence (the Audi) were made in circumstances where there was little evidence of his guilt. (R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604). His Honour was in error in failing to have regard to this factor and in failing to increase the discount on sentence beyond twenty-five percent.  
     
      
    26 The principle in R v Ellis was fully considered in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at para 138. It was in that context that Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[140] Where the accused’s own disclosure or confession is the basis of the strong Crown case, this should be taken into account with respect to the utilitarian benefit. Indeed, such conduct should be regarded as the earliest timing for a plea.” 
        
       
       
      This extract confirms that such considerations were to be included in the utilitarian value of an early plea of guilty, for which the appropriate discount on sentence should be ten – twenty five percent. 
       
      
    27 In this case his Honour allowed the full twenty-five percent discount on sentence, which adequately took into account the help provided by the applicant by his early plea of guilty in establishing the Crown case in relation to the Audi offence.  
     
      
    28 This point was not taken before his Honour. Even if error was disclosed (which it was not) leave would be required pursuant to rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. No basis has been provided for the granting of leave. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 – The sentences in respect of the two counts of receiving should have been concurrent 
       
      
    29 It was submitted that because the two offences were closely connected in time, and there had been no repetition of the criminality after these two offences, the sentences should have been concurrent. 
     
      
    30 Although closely connected in time, the two offences involved different circumstances and victims. The first offence could perhaps be explained on the basis of the applicant’s financial need created by the damage to his Peugeot. No such explanation is available for the offence involving the Audi. This, as the applicant conceded, was carried out purely for monetary gain. It also involved more planning and organisation than the first offence. 
     
      
    31 It cannot be said that the applicant had voluntarily ceased further criminality by the time he was arrested in January 2004. Ms Scott had been arrested in July 2003. Thereafter it was well known to the applicant that investigations were taking place into her activities in relation to the Peugeot and the Audi. A strong inference was available that it was her arrest, and not remorse for the offences, which led to there being no further offences after July 2003. 
     
      
    32 Given the somewhat greater level of planning and organisation associated with the Audi offence (being the second in point of time) his Honour was entitled in point of principle to partially accumulate the two sentences. No error has been demonstrated in that approach. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    33 The orders which I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (ii) Appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: The court is in a position to give judgment and I will ask James J to give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: Michael Farah has applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court by his Honour Judge Sides QC on 19 December 2003. For an offence of supplying prohibited drugs, that is, heroin and methylamphetamine, on an ongoing basis, an offence under s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, which was committed between 18 September 2000 and 17 October 2000, his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for five years six months with a non-parole period of two years six months commencing on 23 May 2005. In sentencing the applicant for this offence Judge Sides took into account an offence of conspiring to supply heroin. For an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, heroin, an offence under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, which was committed on 14 November 2000, his Honour imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment of twelve months to commence on 23 May 2005. For an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, heroin, on 21 November 2000 his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of two years commencing on 23 May 2005. It will be observed that his Honour made all the sentences he imposed commence from the same date, 23 May 2005. 
     
      
    3 In his remarks on sentence his Honour explained why he had chosen that date as the date of commencement of the sentences and I will refer to that explanation later in this judgment. 
     
      
    4 The applicant had been arrested on 21 November 2000 and he remained in custody until 21 September 2001 when he was released on bail. There was a committal hearing and the applicant was committed for trial on charges of the three offences for which he was ultimately sentenced by Judge Sides and another offence, that on 21 November 2000 he had supplied not less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine. The date 18 August 2002 was fixed for the trial of all four charges. However, that trial date was vacated. 
     
      
    5 On 15 November 2002 the applicant was arraigned on an indictment containing all four charges. He pleaded guilty to the three charges of offences for which he was ultimately sentenced by Judge Sides and not guilty to the charge of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. 
     
      
    6 In March 2003 the applicant was tried before Moore ADCJ in a judge alone trial on the charge of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. On 25 March 2003 Judge Moore found the applicant guilty of the charge. The applicant was remanded in custody for sentence and he remained in custody until he was sentenced. The applicant was not sentenced by Judge Moore until 7 November 2003. 
     
      
    7 On 7 November 2003 Judge Moore sentenced the applicant for the offence of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine to a sentence of five and a half years with a non-parole period of three years to date from 8 June 2002. Judge Moore selected 8 June 2002 as the date from which the sentence should commence, on the grounds that the applicant had been in pre-sentence custody for two broken periods totalling one year four months twenty-two days. In fact, the two periods during which the applicant had been in custody, from 21 November 2000 to 21 September 2001 and from 25 March 2003 to 7 November 2003 the date of sentencing, totalled a period of more than one year four months twenty-two days. When Judge Sides came to sentence the applicant, Judge Sides made the sentences he imposed commence from 23 May 2005, that is from the date on which, according to Judge Sides' calculations, the non-parole period of the sentence imposed by Judge Moore would have expired, if Judge Moore, in imposing his sentence, had allowed for the total period, of the applicant's pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
    8 Judge Moore decided to disqualify himself from sentencing the applicant for the three offences to which he had pleaded guilty and the task of sentencing the applicant for those sentences devolved on Judge Sides. In his remarks on sentence Judge Sides summarised the facts of the offences and the following brief statement of the facts of the offences is derived from his Honour's statement of the facts of the offences in his remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    9 The offences were committed during an authorised controlled operation in which an undercover police officer with the assumed name Nik and an intermediary named Nasr participated. On 18 September 2000 Nik and Nasr travelled to the applicant's house where the applicant agreed to supply Nasr with drugs. The applicant supplied Nasr with 101 tablets weighing 26.1 grams, containing traces of methylamphetamine and ketamine. $5,800 provided by Nik was paid to the applicant. Later the same day the applicant supplied 50 tablets weighing 4.8 grams and containing 3.5 percent methylamphetamine to Nasr for a price of $750. Later again the same day the applicant, at a local show ground, supplied Nasr with three blocks of heroin weighing 27.8 grams and containing 56 percent heroin. 
     
      
    10 On 5 October 2000 the applicant supplied Nik directly with five tablets weighing 1.49 grams and containing four per cent methylamphetamine. Later the same day at the showground the applicant supplied Nasr with three blocks of heroin weighing eight-five grams and containing about fifty-nine per cent pure heroin for a price of $12,900, which was paid to the applicant. During this transaction the intermediary Nasr stole an amount of $2000 which Nik had provided to him for payment to the applicant and it was agreed by the applicant and Nik that in the future the applicant would deal directly with Nik.  
     
      
    11 On 17 October 2000 the applicant telephoned Nik and they agreed to meet again. At this meeting the applicant supplied Nik with 100 tablets weighing 30.2 grams and containing 4.5 per cent methylamphetamine, for which Nik paid the applicant $1500. The applicant supplied Nik with three bags of heroin weighing 74.5 grams and containing between fifty-two per cent and seventy-two per cent pure heroin, for which Nik paid the applicant $13,500. 
     
      
    12 The offences committed on 18 September 2000, 5 October 2000 and 17 October 2000 constituted the offence of supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis. In total, the applicant supplied 256 tablets of methylamphetamine and 185 grams of heroin with a high degree of purity and the applicant was paid $34,450.  
     
      
    13 The further offences for which the applicant was sentenced by Sides DCJ were committed on 4 November 2000 by the applicant supplying to Nik a small foil containing .48 grams of heroin, the degree of purity being just under sixty per cent, and on 21 November 2000 by the applicant agreeing to supply Nik with a quantity of heroin in exchange for a payment of $25,000. The applicant was arrested before any heroin was actually supplied.  
     
      
    14 In sentencing the applicant for the offence of ongoing supply, Sides DCJ took into account an offence of conspiracy to supply heroin. The evidence that this offence had been committed consisted of legally intercepted telephone conversations.  
     
      
    15 In his remarks on sentence Sides DCJ said that he considered that the crimes were objectively serious. Over a period of two and a half months the applicant had been involved, to a very significant extent, in commercial drug trafficking. His Honour found that the applicant had done so to pay debts which the life style he had been living had generated. His Honour found that the applicant had been dealing in drugs at a wholesale level; he had not been selling to ultimate users.  
     
      
    16 In his remarks on sentence his Honour noted some of the subjective features of the applicant. At the time of being sentenced the applicant was forty-one years old. He had been born in Lebanon on 23 March 1962. He had come to Australia in 1985. He married in 1987 and there were four children of the marriage, whose ages at the time the applicant was sentenced were between three years and fourteen years. For a number of years down to the time of his arrest he had carried on his own concreting business, employing up to fifteen employees. Apart from a conviction in 1994 for playing an unlawful game, the applicant had no previous criminal convictions and hence no previous convictions for drug offences. His Honour remarked that the applicant was entitled to have his good character taken into account. 
     
      
    17 When the applicant was arrested one of his legs had been broken. Up to the time he was sentenced the applicant had had four operations on his leg, including a bone graft, and at least one further operation would be required. His Honour accepted that the applicant’s mobility was restricted to some extent by the injury to his leg and that the applicant continued to experience pain from the injury. However, his Honour found that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no evidence of the injury causing him any greater hardship in a custodial setting than would be the case if he was at large in the community 
        .” 
        
       
      
    18 In his remarks on sentence his Honour said that the applicant had no problem with alcohol or drugs. However, he had become addicted to gambling and had incurred significant gambling debts. While in custody he had received some counselling for his gambling addiction and the applicant was prepared to undertake appropriate therapy to address his gambling addiction.  
     
      
    19 As regards the applicant’s pleas of guilty, his Honour found that the pleas had not been entered at the earliest opportunity. His Honour said that he would allow a discount of fifteen per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty.  
     
      
    20 His Honour considered that expressions of remorse by the applicant were belated but were, nevertheless, genuine and should be reflected in the sentences his Honour would impose. 
     
      
    21 His Honour said in his remarks on sentence that he took into account in the applicant’s favour the delay which had occurred in the sentencing of the applicant, especially the delay which had occurred after he had pleaded guilty, which had not been the applicant’s fault. 
     
      
    22 His Honour said that he took into account in favour of the applicant that on 24 October 2003 Adams J of this Court had made an order against the applicant under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act that he pay to the New South Wales Treasury the sum of $32,200, which was approximately equivalent to the total amount of money the applicant had received from committing the three offences. Adams J’s judgment is reported (New South Wales Crime Commission v Farah (2003) 142 A Crim R 108). 
     
      
    23 In his judgment Adams J said that he accepted that the applicant had not derived any benefit from the money he had received, which he had almost immediately paid over to someone else, and that the order his Honour would be making was to be regarded as part of the punishment for the applicant’s offences. At par 21 of his judgment Adams J said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that the consequence of the order that I make, which should fairly be regarded as taking from the defendant considerably more than the financial benefit he obtained from his crime, is not a mere expropriation of his ill-gotten gains but is a penalty visited upon him for engaging in criminal activity. In short, it is part of his punishment. The mere fact that the proceedings are stated to be civil proceedings is a description of their procedural character. That they are aimed at punishing and deterring criminals is clear beyond question and that they are part of the structure for enforcing the criminal law of the State is not to be disguised by procedural trappings. Accordingly, the penalty in this case should be taken into account in measuring the level of the additional punishment to which the defendant will be liable when he is sentenced for the crimes that produced the proceeds referred to in the present order”. 
        
       
      
    24 In his remarks on sentence Sides DCJ said he had been influenced by Adam J’s order in deciding to make the three sentences he imposed concurrent with each other and not, at least to some extent, cumulative. 
     
      
    25 A submission which was made on behalf of the applicant in the proceedings on sentence before Sides DCJ was that, because of the need to observe the sentencing principle of totality, his Honour should not, in sentencing the applicant, pass any sentence on the applicant such that the non-parole period of any sentence would extend beyond the non-parole period of the sentence set by Moore ADCJ. It was pointed out by counsel that the offence of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine for which the applicant had been sentenced by Moore ADCJ had been committed within the same comparatively short period of time in which the present offences had been committed. Sides DCJ rejected the particular submission which was made to him in the proceedings on sentence, on the basis that the criminality in the offence for which the applicant had been sentenced by Moore ADCJ was different from the criminality in the present offences. The criminality in the former offence had consisted of the applicant storing at his home a large quantity of methylamphetamine so as to give rise to a charge of deemed supply of the methylamphetamine. The criminality in the present offences consisted in the applicant actually selling or agreeing to sell prohibited drugs. 
     
      
    26 A number of grounds of appeal were relied on by counsel for the applicant, some more specific and some more general.  
     
      
    27 In counsel for the applicant’s oral submissions counsel informed the Court that ultimately the principal ground of appeal relied on was that the sentences imposed by Sides DCJ were manifestly excessive, after taking into account the sentence imposed by Moore ADCJ, with the matters referred to in the other grounds of appeal being relied on as supporting a conclusion that the sentences were manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    28 I will firstly refer briefly to some of the more specific grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    29 One ground of appeal was that his Honour erred in failing to allow a sufficient reduction in sentence for the applicant’s pleas of guilty. As I have recorded earlier in this judgment, his Honour found that the applicant’s pleas of guilty had not been entered at the earliest opportunity and his Honour allowed a discount of fifteen per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas. His Honour’s finding that the applicant’s pleas of guilty had not been entered at the earliest opportunity was clearly open to his Honour. The pleas had not been entered until after the applicant had been committed for trial and one trial date had been fixed and had been vacated. The discount of fifteen per cent which his Honour said he was allowing for the utilitarian value of the pleas was clearly within his Honour’s discretion. 
     
      
    30 Another specific ground of appeal was that his Honour erred in failing to make an allowance in reduction of sentence for the applicant’s medical condition. I have already referred to the part of his Honour’s remarks on sentence in which his Honour discussed the injury the applicant had suffered to his leg when he was arrested. In his written submissions counsel for the applicant compared what Sides DCJ had said in his remarks on sentence with what Moore ADCJ had said in his remarks on sentence on 7 November 2003. Moore ADCJ said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The fact of his broken leg is relevant in that it shows that he has so far had and continues to have a much harsher effect of being in gaol than does the normal run of the prison population.” 
        
       
      
    31 In his remarks Moore ADCJ said he had observed the applicant to be in pain from his leg when the applicant had appeared in court before his Honour. Moore ADCJ referred to the operations on the applicant’s leg and to a brief report from the applicant’s orthopaedic surgeon Doctor Jay Dave, which was also in evidence before Sides DCJ. In his report Doctor Jay Dave said that he had operated on the applicant’s leg and that the applicant had extensive damage to the articular surface and had developed secondary osteoarthritis. Doctor Jay Dave said the applicant needed regular review by an orthopaedic surgeon and might require removal of the screws and plates which had been inserted in his leg.  
     
      
    32 Sides DCJ was not obliged to make the same findings as Moore ADCJ. Sides DCJ’s task was to assess the evidence before him and to make his own findings. His Honour was clearly mindful of the applicant’s leg injury and, in my opinion, the findings his Honour made, which I set out earlier in this judgment, were open to his Honour. 
     
      
    33 Another specific ground of appeal was based on the applicant’s previous good character but it was accepted in oral submissions that this was really a matter to be relied on in support of the principal ground of appeal. As was pointed out by the Crown, in sentencing for offences involving dealing in substantial quantities of prohibited drugs previous good character, including a lack of any significant criminal history and even a good employment or business history, has been regarded as being of less significance than in the sentencing of offenders generally.  
     
      
    34 A further ground of appeal was that the sentencing judge had erred in failing to make a finding that the applicant had favourable prospects of rehabilitation and that the sentencing judge had, in fact, failed to make any finding about the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant there was a considerable amount of evidence before Sides DCJ on the basis of which his Honour could, and should, have made a finding that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    35 In his remarks on sentence, his Honour did make findings about a number of matters which were relevant to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation, including that he had evinced contrition, that he was a person of previous good character, that he had a good employment history and that he had an addiction to gambling but was undertaking counselling for his addiction. 
     
      
    36 In his remarks on sentence Sides DCJ said that he had taken into account the matters set out in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in the form applicable to sentencing for these offences, which included s 21A(2)(j) “the prospect of rehabilitation of the offender” and I would infer that Sides DCJ did not overlook taking into account the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation, so far as they could be determined by his Honour.  
     
      
    37 I turn to the ground of appeal that the sentences imposed by Sides DCJ, taking into account the sentence imposed by Moore ADCJ, were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    38 It is convenient to consider this ground of appeal in conjunction with two other grounds of appeal, that his Honour did not have sufficient regard to the sentencing principle of totality and that his Honour did not have sufficient regard to the punishment the applicant had already suffered from the order made by Adams J. 
     
      
    39 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that statistics of sentences imposed for offences under s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act showed that the sentence imposed on the applicant was substantially more severe than that imposed on the great majority of offenders. It was submitted that, while Sides DCJ had referred in his remarks on sentence to the sentencing principle of totality and had decided that, having regard to the principle of totality, the three sentences he was imposing should be ordered to be served concurrently with each other, his Honour had erred in not applying the principle of totality, as between the sentences he would be imposing and the sentence which had been imposed by Moore ADCJ.  
     
      
    40 As regards the order made by Adams J, it was submitted that it had been conceded by the New South Wales Crime Commission in the proceedings before Adams J that most, if not all, of the money the applicant had received in the commission of the present offences had been paid by him to someone else. Accordingly, as Adams J had stated in his judgment, the order made by his Honour was a penalty imposed on the applicant for having committed the crimes for which he was later sentenced by Sides DCJ and should, in accordance with Adams J’s judgment, be taken into account in sentencing the applicant for those offences. In his remarks on sentence Sides DCJ had merely said that he had taken into account what Adams J had said and that his decision to make the sentences he imposed concurrent with each other had been influenced by Adams J’s order and comments. 
     
      
    41 It was submitted by the Crown that the sentences, and in particular the sentence for the ongoing supply of prohibited drugs, were not manifestly excessive. The Crown pointed to the maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty years for the offence of ongoing supply, the need for deterrence in sentencing for drug offences, the fact that the heroin the applicant had supplied was of a high degree of purity, the commercial nature of the transactions the applicant had entered into and that the transactions the applicant had entered into were at a level above street level. As regards totality, it was submitted by the Crown that Sides DCJ had correctly distinguished the different sorts of criminality in the offences for which he was sentencing the applicant and the offence for which Moore ADCJ had sentenced the applicant. 
     
      
    42 Having considered the objective and subjective circumstances and having considered the submissions of the parties, I have concluded that leave to appeal should be granted and that the appeal should be allowed.  
     
      
    43 As regards totality, I consider that Sides DCJ was correct in rejecting the submission that by reason of the principle of totality he should not pass any sentence on the applicant such that the non-parole period of the sentence would extend beyond the non-parole period of the sentence set by Moore ADCJ.  
     
      
    44 I also consider that his Honour was correct in holding that the criminality in the offences for which his Honour was sentencing the applicant was different from the criminality in the offence for which the applicant had been sentenced by Moore ADCJ and that his Honour was required to pass sentences which would impose some separate, additional punishment on the applicant for those offences. 
     
      
    45 However, the fact that the criminality in the offences for which Sides DCJ was sentencing the applicant could be distinguished from the criminality in the offence for which Moore ADCJ had sentenced the applicant did not mean that the sentencing principle of totality ceased to have any application. All of the offences were drug offences committed within the same relatively short period of time, between 18 September 2000 and 21 November 2000. The offence for which the applicant was sentenced by Moore ADCJ was committed on the same day, 21 November 2000, as the last of the offences for which Sides DCJ sentenced the applicant. Even if the offences had not been so closely related in nature and time of commission, it would still have been necessary to have regard to the principle of totality in sentencing. If Moore ADCJ had sentenced the applicant, not merely for the one offence for which he did sentence the applicant but for all of the offences, which would have happened if Moore ADCJ had not disqualified himself, then Moore ADCJ, in sentencing the applicant for all of the offences, would have had to have had regard to the principle of totality in sentencing. It was fortuitous that Moore ADCJ did not sentence the applicant for the three supply offences and that it fell to Sides DCJ to sentence the applicant for those offences. In my opinion, Sides DCJ was required by the principle of totality in sentencing to have greater regard than his Honour did to the sentence imposed by Moore ADCJ, notwithstanding that the kind of criminality exhibited in that offence could be distinguished from the kind of criminality exhibited in the supply offences.  
     
      
    46 I have already quoted par 21 of Adams J’s judgment of 24 October 2003. 
     
      
    47 This application is not, of course an appeal from Adams J’s decision and I do not consider that this Court should enter into any examination of the validity of his Honour’s reasoning or conclusions. I consider that this Court should accept that his Honour concluded that the order made by his Honour was punitive and was part of the applicant’s punishment for engaging in the criminal conduct comprised in the present three offences and should be taken into account in determining the additional punishment which should be imposed on the applicant for that criminal conduct.  
     
      
    48 Taking into account all of the objective facts of the offences, the subjective features of the applicant, the sentence imposed by Moore ADCJ, the principle of totality, the order and the judgment of Adams J, the statistics kept by the Judicial Commission, the plea of guilty, the injury to the applicant’s leg and the applicant’s previous good character, I would grant leave to appeal and I would allow the appeal against sentence. I would propose that the periods of the sentences imposed by Sides DCJ be retained but, particularly to allow for the principle of totality, the commencement date of the sentences should be back-dated by a period of twelve months so that all the sentences commence on 23 May 2004, in lieu of 23 May 2005. 
     
      
    49 I would propose the following formal orders. Leave to appeal granted. Appeal against sentences allowed. Sentences imposed by Sides DCJ quashed. In lieu thereof the following sentences should be imposed.  
     
      
    50 On count 1 a sentence of imprisonment for five years six months to commence on 23 May 2004, with a non-parole period of two years six months to commence on 23 May 2004 and to expire on 22 November 2006. 
     
      
    51 On count 2 a sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months to commence on 23 May 2004 and expire on 22 May 2005.  
     
      
    52 On count 3 a sentence of imprisonment for four years to commence on 23 May 2004, with a non-parole period of two years to commence on 23 May 2004 and to expire on 22 May 2006.  
     
      
    53 The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 22 November 2006. 
     
      
    54 GROVE J: I agree with the judgment of James J and the orders he proposes. 
     
      
    55 BARR J: I also agree. 
     
      
    56 GROVE J: The orders of the Court therefore are as proposed by James J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BRYSON JA: I agree with Barr J.  
     
      
    2 BARR J: On 22 September 2004 the applicant, Allan Troy Hill, filed a notice of appeal against his conviction of a number of offences in the District Court. The offences were committed on 28 March 1998. The jury found him guilty on 29 April 1999. Since his notice of appeal was not filed until a time more than five years after the expiry of the time allowed for the filing of an appeal, the applicant must obtain an order extending the time for filing his appeal. ` 
     
      
      The case at trial 
       
      
    3 At 5:30am on 28 March 1998 a man broke into the house of the complainant and sexually assaulted her in a number of ways. The complainant noticed a strong smell of alcohol on her attacker. He kept up his assaults until he left the house at about 7am. During his attack he held a knife against the complainant’s face. The complainant took hold of the knife to try to ward off the attack and received superficial cuts to her hand. At one stage of the attack the attacker put on a condom. Eventually the complainant told her attacker that he should go because her estranged husband, whom she named, was coming to pick her up for work at 7am. The attacker asked whether he was the boyfriend with the motor bike. The complainant’s boyfriend did indeed have a motor bike. Another remark that the attacker made showed that he knew that the complainant had a certain sexual aid of a certain colour. The attacker left at about 7o’clock and the complainant immediately telephoned her husband and told him that someone had broken in and that she had been raped. He arrived at the house shortly afterwards and got in touch with the police.  
     
      
    4 During the assault the complainant felt the T-shirt worn by her attacker. She felt stripes on the shoulders and the sleeves, formed by raised pieces of material sewn on. It had a round neck. She felt his jeans. She described him as being about five foot seven and as having short, wiry, curly hair. She said that he was darked skinned and had stubble on his face.  
     
      
    5 It was the Crown case that the applicant was the attacker.  
     
      
    6 The complainant’s description of her attacker was of a man not unlike the applicant in appearance but fell a long way short of identifying him. The attacker’s clothes, by her description, were not unlike the applicant’s clothes, but she could not positively identify them. Nobody else saw the events. There were no admissions. The Crown case was circumstantial. The circumstances relied on by the Crown were as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        (a) The applicant lived in a caravan park which was situated only about 130 metres from the complainant’s house. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) At 5am the applicant left an hotel where he had been drinking and caught a taxi, which took him first to a convenience store and then to the caravan park. The driver estimated that he delivered the applicant to the caravan park at about 5:15am.  
        
       
       
        
        (c) The attack took place between about 5:30am and 7am. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The general description of the attacker matched the applicant’s height and colouring. The attacker’s clothes were not unlike the applicant’s.  
        
       
       
        
        (e) A T-shirt and jeans recovered from the applicant matched the complainant’s description of clothes worn by the attacker. 
        
       
       
        
        (f) At about 8:10am a knife owned and identified by the complainant, the missing one of a set of knives of graduated size, was found in the pocket of the applicant’s jeans. 
        
       
       
        
        (g) Also found on the applicant was box which had contained six condoms. Five only remained in the box. With the box was found a fragment from the wrapper of a condom. A second fragment was found in the complaint’s house. A third was found in a rubbish bin in the street at a place between the complaint’s house and the caravan park. Although the three fragments did not make a complete wrapper, their torn and jagged edges matched one another.  
        
       
       
        
        (h) A condom of the same type as those in the condom box was found in a rubbish bin by the door of the applicant’s caravan. DNA testing of the contents showed that it was highly probable that they came from the applicant.  
        
       
       
        
        (i) When leaving the complainant’s house, the attacker left shoe prints in the dust on the ground. The size and pattern of one of the prints matched the sole of a shoe taken from the applicant.  
        
       
      
    7 The defence case was that the applicant returned to the caravan park somewhat later than the taxi driver said, about 5:30am. He had been feeling sick and was vomiting blood. He went to his caravan and a cousin of his, Mr Stephen Button, arrived and asked for a loan. He lent Mr Button $50.00 and the two of them walked together towards the hospital to obtain treatment for the applicant. When he arrived at the hospital the applicant realised that he had no means of identifying himself, so he did not enter. Instead, he turned round and walked back towards the caravan park. On the way he came across a knife and a condom box and its contents lying on the footpath near a bush. He picked them up and put them in his pocket. He threw the fragment of wrapper into the rubbish bin in the street. It was accepted at trial that the attacker entered the complainant’s house by climbing over a painted, wooden window sill. The paint was old and oxidised. The applicant adduced expert evidence that particles of paint would have adhered to the attacker’s clothing and the applicant’s clothing bore no such particles. During the early hours of Friday, 27 March the applicant had entertained a woman at his caravan and they had had sexual intercourse. He had used the condom the police found in the bin. He did not go to the complainant’s house. He did not attack her.  
     
      
    8 There was no doubt that the attacker had committed the offences charged. The jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was the attacker and found him guilty of one count of aggravated breaking and entering and committing a sexual assault and five counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. Those counts accorded with the various ways in which the attacker had sexual intercourse with the complainant. It is unnecessary to say more about the detail of the attack.  
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    9 The applicant represented himself throughout the preparation of his application and on the hearing. He is not legally qualified. His grounds of appeal are as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        1. That I am innocent for these allegations.  
        
       
       
        
        2. That evidence was not tested (Forensic evidence – DNA) and the length of time between committal hearings gave investigators ample time to test all evidence.  
        
       
       
        
        3. The trial judge may have influenced the juries’ decision, by allowing the jury to hear evidence during the trial, evidence as such which was tested at an earlier date to be tested again during the trial.  
        
       
       
        
        4. My defensive arguments were doubted, including an alibi. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Investigation methods were lack luster, due to the disclosure of a Forensic specialist, were he disclosed that he made a judgmental call, believing they had the offender. This call as such influenced his decision to only examine evidence not to have it tested.  
        
       
       
        
        6. The case, investigation and conviction are based on circumstantial evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        7. Methods to identify the offender became secondary based on points (5 & 6). 
        
       
       
        
        8. Crucial evidence based on physical abnormalities of the offender, were investigated two and a half to three months, after it was disclosed to the investigator[s]. The time of this disclosure is crucial for the time it took to investigate the disclosure.  
        
       
      
    10 The applicant filed detailed written submissions and addressed the Court at some length, thereby raising a number of complaints not included in his notice of appeal. The grounds and the written and oral submissions were not always easy to understand, but the applicant appears to have raised the ground which it is convenient to consider first, namely that the verdicts of the jury are unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence: Criminal Appeal Act s6.  
     
      
    11 Of the circumstances relied on by the Crown, none of those set forth in para 5 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) and (h) was capable of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was the attacker. Taken together they could not prove as much. Although circumstance 5(i) was a strong piece of evidence, even it could not point exclusively to the applicant, as, for example, a fingerprint might have done, because the applicant’s shoes could not have been unique. The finding of the knife and the wrapper fragment in the applicant’s pocket, however, was powerful evidence, enough by itself to prove the applicant’s guilt. That evidence was supported by evidence of the other circumstances I have mentioned. Taken as a whole, the Crown case was virtually irresistible without some acceptable innocent explanation why the knife and the wrapper fragment were in the applicant’s pocket so soon after the attacker left the complainant’s house.  
     
      
    12 The applicant gave evidence in accordance with the case I have summarised and the question for the jury was whether the account he gave might reasonably be true. It seems to me that the jury were entitled to regard the evidence as not raising a reasonable doubt about the identity of the accused as the attacker. The account of the applicant’s vomiting blood and walking to the hospital, yet not getting treatment for such an alarming complaint merely because he lacked means of identifying himself was implausible. There was no evidence that the applicant appeared ill when spoken to by the police shortly after 8am on the morning of the attack. The story about finding the knife and the box and its contents, too, was implausible.  
     
      
    13 Mr Button also gave evidence. He had not been asked until about April 1999, about a month or a couple of weeks, as he put it, before the day on which he gave his evidence, to try to remember the events he was asked about. Understandably, he could not say exactly when things happened. He lived in a town not far distant from the place where the attack took place and called on the applicant occasionally. Early one morning he called at his caravan and borrowed fifty dollars from him. He said that the applicant was feeling unwell and said that he was going to walk to hospital. Mr Button said that he would walk with him. They walked together. When they came close to the hospital they parted company. The applicant went in the direction of the hospital and Mr Button made for the road out of town, on his way home. The jury were entitled to regard Mr Button’s evidence as not supporting the applicant at all. He might have been speaking about an event that really happened, but on a different morning. Mr Button had nothing to say about the applicant’s turning back short of the hospital or about the finding of the knife and the box.  
     
      
    14 The expert called by the defence was Professor Pailthorpe, Professor of Textile Technology at the University of New South Wales. He had been a practising textile consultant for many years and his expertise was not doubted. He had been shown photographs which police took of the window sill shortly after the attack. He noted from them that numerous paint, putty and timber fragments appeared to have been recently dislodged inside and outside the house. He looked at some samples of that material. He noticed scuff marks on the surface of the sill in paint which was old and powdery. He said that if the attacker had entered the house through that window he would have expected particles to adhere to his clothing. Such particles could be removed by washing or vacuuming. Brushing would remove the larger particles but the finer ones would remain within the weave of the garment. They would be detectable because they would adhere to adhesive tape placed on and then removed from the garment. He had examined tape-lifts made in this way by the investigating police officers and had detected no particles that might have come from the window sill. In this respect his evidence was the same as that of the investigating police officer Sergeant Salmon, who prepared the tape-lifts. Professor Pailthorpe also examined the applicant’s clothes under a microscope but saw no material on them that might have come from the window sill. He was of the opinion that the attacker might by his clothing have transferred loose material from the window sill to the sheet of the complainant’s bed. He examined tape-lifts prepared from that bed sheet but found no material of that kind.  
     
      
    15 It often happens during the course of investigations that tests that might demonstrate the presence of a person or of a particular person fail to do so. Fingerprint tests, for example, might fail to reveal the presence of the accused. But such test results do not ordinarily lead to the conclusion that the suspected person was not present. There may be many reasons why such results are inconclusive. Professor Pailthorpe’s work provides a good example. He would have expected the attacker to leave on the bed traces from the window sill, yet no such traces were found. That could not be taken as proof that the attacker did not attack the complainant on the bed. It was common ground that he did. All it shows is that results postulated by Professor Pailthorpe might happen, not that they must happen.  
     
      
    16 In my opinion the lack of any sign of fragments from the window sill on the accused’s clothes when tested by Professor Pailthorpe on or close to the day of trial was no more than evidence that the applicant might not have been the attacker. The jury were bound to take it into account together with all the other evidence in the case, but were not bound in my opinion to regard it as raising a reasonable doubt that the accused was the attacker.  
     
      
    17 The applicant made a number of complaints on appeal about the quality of the police investigation and the reporting on it. He was represented by counsel at the trial. Counsel cross-examined the principal investigating officer, Sergeant Salmon, about tests he had done. It was established that although he had collected a sample of the applicant’s pubic hair and had collected pubic hair from the complainant’s bed, he had made no comparison between hair from the applicant and hair from the bed. Although the evidence of the complainant showed that the attacker had placed his fingers in her vagina, there had been no examination of the applicant’s hands for DNA or clothes for traces of semen. There was no examination of the applicant’s underpants for DNA that might have come from the complainant. It was suggested to Sergeant Salmon that the police had made up their minds as soon as they found the knife and the wrapper fragment that the accused was the attacker and had for that reason not investigated the matter thoroughly. Sergeant Salmon disagreed, for reasons he gave. The jury no doubt considered those matters.  
     
      
    18 Defence counsel established that certain test results had not been reported. For example, fibres taken from the accused’s clothes had been compared with fibres taken from the bed and from the carpet in the complainant’s bedroom. No match was established. It was suggested that the police were not interested in reporting anything that might assist the accused, only results that might link him with the offences. No doubt the jury considered those matters also.  
     
      
    19 It does not seem to me that the material pointed to ought to have raised a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury that the accused was the attacker.  
     
      
    20 Ms Franco, a scientist from the Division of Analytical Laboratories, was called to give evidence about the probability that the applicant contributed the contents of the condom found in the bin outside his caravan. As it turned out there was no dispute about that, but Ms Franco was tested on her examination of the outside of the condom and whether if properly tested it might have revealed the presence of DNA that might have come from the complainant. The evidence showed that the condom was floating in water in the bin when the police first saw it. Ms Franco was unable to find any female DNA on the outside of the condom. Commenting upon this, she observed that the longer the object was in water the less the chance that DNA would remain on it. The evidence showed that the condom was first noticed by a police officer soon after 8am but that it was not removed until the physical evidence police arrived to carry out investigations at the caravan park after they had done their tests at the complainant’s house. The time was unclear but appears to have been after midday. If the applicant was the attacker he would have thrown the condom into the water soon after 7am, five hours before it was removed. 
     
      
    21 This is in my opinion a further example of a piece of evidence that could not assist the Crown or the defence case.  
     
      
    22 Ms Franco was criticised for delaying until just before the trial any testing of the outside of the condom. It can be assumed that it was not up to Ms Franco to decide what tests to do but to do whatever tests the police asked for, so this was an indirect comment upon the quality of the police investigation. That was no doubt one of the matters the jury considered.  
     
      
    23 None of this material seems to my mind capable of raising a reasonable doubt about the identity of the applicant as the attacker.  
     
      
    24 The applicant put a number of additional arguments on appeal about evidence adduced and not adduced at the trial. It seems appropriate to regard them as asserting that the convictions should be set aside because he did not receive a fair trial. He said that he was taken by surprise by the evidence of Sergeant Salmon, his statement not having been served at committal. It was never clear, however, how much defence counsel did know about the state of police investigations at the commencement of the trial. No evidence was adduced from defence counsel. No application was made by counsel to delay the commencement of the trial or to defer cross-examination of Sergeant Salmon until a full appreciation could be obtained of the evidence he was likely to give. There was no submission on appeal about what defence counsel could or would have done in such an event, or what he was prevented from doing or doing properly by the late service of any evidence. I think that there is no substance in this submission.  
     
      
    25 It was submitted that if his pubic hair had been compared with hair taken from the complainant’s bed he would have been proved innocent. It was submitted that the Crown did not put before the jury a videotape showing the search which police carried out at the applicant’s caravan. It was unclear to me whether the assertion was that no videotape was made or that a videotape that existed was simply not played. I would assume the latter, because by 1998 it had become usual for police to video tape such events. The submission was that the appearance of the applicant on the videotape would have shown that he had no beard. The complainant had described her attacker as a man with a stubble beard.  
     
      
    26 This is a matter that defence counsel could have dealt with at trial and I assume would have dealt with if there had been substance in it. In any event, the search was not carried out until several hours after the cessation of the attack on the complainant, and evidence that the applicant then had a smooth face would have been equally consistent with his not being the attacker and with his being the attacker but having shaved since the attack.  
     
      
    27 The applicant submitted that he was suffering from a sexual complaint at the time of the attack on the complainant. If he had been the attacker, the complainant would have caught the condition and there would have been evidence of this. No doubt the applicant could have told his counsel about that and no doubt his counsel would, if he considered the material had worth, have introduced evidence of it and an argument based upon that evidence. Understandably, counsel did not. There is no substance in the submission.  
     
      
    28 The applicant submitted that he had evidence of a count of his blood taken in April 1998, not long after these events. It was not clear to me what the relevance of such evidence would be. The applicant related it to part of his cross-examination before the jury, though I have not been able to detect any relevant cross-examination. At any rate, the evidence was not put before the Court and there is no need to deal further with the matter. 
     
      
    29 None of these complaints seem to me to have substance. They do not in combination show that the applicant did not receive a fair trial.  
     
      
       
      The delay in bringing the appeal 
       
      
    30 The applicant informed the Court that after the conviction he spoke to his barrister about an appeal and assumed that the barrister would lodge the necessary papers. He realised after some time that that had not been done and thought that since he was out of time nothing else could be done about the matter. The next thing that happened was that at the beginning of 2004 he made application under s474D Crimes Act for an order that an inquiry be held or that the matter be referred to this Court to be dealt with as an appeal. It was only when the registry informed him that he had not exhausted his rights of appeal that he decided to lodge this appeal.  
     
      
    31 These circumstances do not to my mind satisfactorily explain a delay of five years between the conviction and the lodging of the appeal against that conviction.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion  
       
      
    32 Because delay has not been satisfactorily explained and because there is no substance in any matter the applicant would wish to raise on appeal I would refuse to extend time for the filing of an appeal against conviction.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Shaw J for the crime of manslaughter for which the prescribed maximum sentence is twenty five years imprisonment. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for nine years with a non parole period of six years. In imposing that sentence his Honour took into account pursuant to the Form 1 procedure, offences of affray, possessing a loaded firearm in a public place and possession of an unauthorized firearm. Those three offences took place at Brookvale shortly after 1 am on 23 April 2001. The offence of manslaughter was committed at Hurlstone Park on 26 April 2001 between midnight and 1 am.  
     
      
    2 The victim was a youth aged eighteen years who was shot dead by a juvenile co-offender referred to as MA. The applicant was born on 8 April 1982. MA was born on 30 January 1984. They were accordingly aged nineteen and seventeen when their offences were committed. On the first day of trial MA was arraigned before Shaw J on a charge of murder to which he pleaded guilty. His Honour sentenced MA to imprisonment for thirteen years six months with a non parole period of eight years six months which was varied on Crown appeal to this Court to imprisonment for sixteen years with a non parole period of eleven years: Regina v MA [2004] NSWCCA 92. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was represented by senior counsel at the sentencing proceedings. A different member of the Inner Bar represented him in the appeal. It was acknowledged by the latter that the first ground sought to be advanced involved a proposition which was not put at first instance. I will elaborate upon this when dealing with the grounds.  
     
      
    4 The basic facts of the offence were placed before the sentencing court in a document signed by the Crown Prosecutor, counsel for the applicant and the police officer in charge of investigation. This document read: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Facts 
        
       
       
        
        On the evening of 25 April 2001 (Anzac Day) the deceased, Jai Graham JAGO, and his friend Andrew Clayton were at Grumpy’s Hotel on New Canterbury road, Hurlstone Park. Shortly before midnight the deceased and the victim left “Grumpy’s” and walked along New Canterbury Road at Hurlstone Park. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst crossing Old Canterbury Road the deceased became involved in a verbal exchange with the offender, Kadr DIAB, and the young person, (MA). At the time the accused was driving a 1963 Toyota Corona, registration number VPX386. This car is owned by the offender DIAB’s sister. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender and the young person stopped their vehicle and confronted the deceased and the victim near the intersection of Old Canterbury Road and Hanks Street. A further verbal exchange between the deceased, offender and young person took place. The deceased become involved in a physical exchange with either the offender or the young person. 
        
       
       
        
        The young person then shot the deceased, once in the chest, fatally injuring the deceased. The offender was aware of the presence of the firearm, as he purchased it. The offender was not aware that the young person would use the firearm other than to threaten. 
        
       
       
        
        After the deceased was shot he ran a short distance into Hanks Street, where he collapsed. The offender and young person returned to the vehicle and the offender drove away along Old Canterbury Road. 
        
       
       
        
        Andrew CLAYTON rendered assistance to the deceased until the arrival of Ambulance and Police. The deceased was dead on arrival at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.

        The young person later disposed of the firearm, this has not been recovered. 
        
       
       
        
        Vehicle 
        
       
       
        
        The vehicle of interest has been recovered by police. It is owned by the offender’s sister. 
        
       
       
        
        Flight 
        
       
       
        
        On the 4th of May, 2001 the offender and the young person left Australia and travelled to Lebanon. The young person remained with the offender’s family, residing with him until they both returned to Australia on the 17th of June. 
        
       
       
        
        Arrest 
        
       
       
        
        On Wednesday the 24th of April, 2002, the offender was arrested at his place of residence by investigators from Strike Force RESEN and conveyed to Bankstown Police Station. The offender, in consultation with his legal representative, participated in a short electronically recorded interview, during which he declined to answer questions. 
        
       
       
        
        Plea 
        
       
       
        
        On Friday 18 July 2003 the offender entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter. The offender, at sentence, would also like matters on a Form 1 taken into account. 
        
       
       
        
        Form 1 matters – Short facts. 
        
       
       
        
        On 23 April 2001, two days before the offence occurred, the offender DIAB was involved in an offence at Brookvale. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender and the young person drove into a garage/service station at Brookvale and an altercation occurred between the young person, the offender and a group of young men. 
        
       
       
        
        On this occasion the offender DIAB alighted from the motor vehicle and threatened these young men with the same firearm as was used in the murder of Jai Jago. DIAB held the pistol in his hand with his arm extended, pointing the weapon at several of these young men. He then returned to the vehicle and drove off at speed. 
        
       
       
        
        On the night of the murder, when the two offenders alighted from their vehicle the young person (MA) had possession of the firearm”. 
        
       
      
    5 In recording his findings concerning the applicant his Honour’s remarks were couched in terms that the “agreed facts in the case of Diab state” followed by a recitation of the first, second, third, fifth and ninth paragraphs of the document which I have set out.  
     
      
    6 The fourth paragraph was also included in his Honour’s remarks but the text was slightly different. His remarks were: 
     
      
       
        
        “The young person then shot the deceased, once in the chest, fatally injuring the deceased. The offender was aware of the presence of the firearm, the offender paid $1000.00 for the firearm and the young person was present when it was purchased. The offender was also aware that the gun was loaded. The offender was not aware that the young person would use the firearm other than to threaten”. 
        
       
      
    7 His Honour added: 
     
      
       
        
        “The pre-sentence report indicates that the offender was aware of the presence of the gun in the car on the night of 25 April. He told the author of that report, Mr Brookes, that he tried to persuade MA to leave the gun behind. The report indicates that the offender did not see MA reach for the gun, which was under the seat of the car, before MA alighted from the car to confront the deceased and first saw the gun when it was too late”. 
        
       
      
    8 In dealing with a submission concerning comparative criminality between the co-offenders, his Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, as I understand the extent of the defence submission, I accept that it is possible to characterise the extent of Diab’s criminality as less than that of his co-offender. I accept that the offender may not have known that MA had reached for the gun on alighting from the car, though he would have become aware of MA’s possession at its presentation. Accordingly, I accept that there was a lesser degree of forethought about the possibility of its use in relation to Diab”. 
        
       
      
    9 At the hearing of the appeal counsel contended that the responsibility of the applicant was encapsulated by the mere seconds between when he was aware of the presence of the pistol in MA’s hand when it was presented to the victim and its discharge almost immediately thereafter. This contention is at odds with the way in which the matter was dealt with at first instance, although it should be noted that in making this submission counsel expressly disavowed any intention to traverse the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    10 Both the Crown and the applicant’s counsel presented written outlines of submission to the sentencing judge. Part of the Crown submission was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown says it is likely that the offender believed when he alighted from the vehicle, that the young person would only use the pistol to threaten and frighten the youths, as he himself had done two days earlier at Brookvale. 
        
       
       
        
        However, allowing the younger offender to take possession of the pistol to use in such a manner, was not only totally irresponsible, but made the offender implicit in any subsequent crime, if, as it was, the pistol was discharged. 
        
       
       
        
        In the course of carrying out the agreement to use the firearm to threaten the deceased and his friend, the young person did an act, which was unlawful and dangerous, which in fact caused the death of the deceased, by discharging the firearm, killing the deceased. 
        
       
       
        
        At this time the offender was present and knowing that the young person was going to threaten the youths with the pistol, and intentionally assisted and, by his presence, encouraged the young person. The offender participated in the joint criminal enterprise”. 
        
       
      
    11 The Crown assertion that the applicant’s plea of guilty to manslaughter represented his acknowledgment of criminal responsibility on the stated basis was not a matter of controversy at the sentence hearing. This is not surprising, given what can be inferred from the applicant’s statement to Mr Brookes that he “tried to persuade MA to leave the gun behind” which would somewhat qualify what might otherwise be implied from the statement that he did not actually see MA reach for the gun from under the seat. A consideration of the offence now on a new and different basis is not warranted.  
     
      
    12 I turn to the grounds of appeal. It is convenient to deal with grounds 1 and 3 together, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “l. The sentencing judge erred in rejecting provocation as a mitigating consideration. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The absence of new evidence in the sentencing proceedings caused a miscarriage of justice”. 
        
       
      
    13 As previously indicated, it was not put to the sentencing judge that provocation was a mitigating factor in the applicant’s offence. In specific references to provisions in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the absence of subsection (3)(c) (the offender was provoked by the victim) was notable. It was not suggested that the omission was the result of inadvertence on the part of counsel.  
     
      
    14 In contrast, it was submitted on behalf of MA that the conduct of the victim was provocative towards him. That submission was rejected and his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am not satisfied that I should accept a submission that the offence resulted out of some ‘ 
        provocation 
        ’ by the deceased. That the deceased may have thrown a punch at either offender does not, in my opinion, amount to provocation of any real significance (even if, according to the submissions of the defence, this conduct need not mean legal provocation). The grossly disproportionate response of the offender MA was not the result of any act by the deceased. I make no finding of mitigation under s 21A(3)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, though the other matters relied upon by the offenders will be taken into account”. 
        
       
      
    15 In the appeal it was initially sought to support ground 1 by reference to hearsay statements of the applicant recorded by a psychologist, Mr Smith, who interviewed him on 13 August 2003 which was after he had entered his plea of guilty to manslaughter. The material included a claim or belief that “something” had been thrown at the car in which the offenders were travelling and that, after stopping and confronting the victim and his companion they were abused and “the guy swung a punch at me and missed”.  
     
      
    16 In response the Crown reminded that that other claimed evidence of provocation was tendered only in relation to MA. This was correct and, further, as above mentioned, there was no contention at the first instance proceedings that provocation was a relevant mitigating factor so far as the applicant was concerned. Ground 3 was produced as a rejoinder to what was described as the Crown’s “highly technical point”. I would not endorse that description. The Crown submission accurately represented the actual conduct of the proceedings in the trial court. 
     
      
    17 In support of ground 3, two witness statements by Ms Jane McKenzie and Mr Daniel Pedemont respectively were tendered. A ruling on whether they would be admitted was deferred to the determination of the application for leave to appeal. On that provisional basis, the content of the statements was examined. Ms McKenzie related observations of conduct by persons, identifiable as the victim and his companion, prior to any encounter with the applicant and MA. Her statement, if admitted into evidence, could not support a finding that the applicant’s crime was mitigated by provocation. Mr Pedemont’s statement does describe some physical altercation but he identified “the one who had just been punched” as the offender with a gun in his hand. This must refer to MA. His continued observation was that first the companion, and later the victim, ran away from the scene of confrontation but the latter hesitated and turned to face MA who “repositioned himself” and then shot him. 
     
      
    18 The applicant’s argument was premised solely upon a proposition, as ground 3 states, that absence of this evidence caused a miscarriage of justice. The receipt of additional evidence by this Court follows establishment of circumstances that it be of such significance that the judge may have regarded it as having a significant bearing on his decision; that the significance was not appreciated by the applicant at the time even if he knew of the relevant matter and that he had not then made it known to his legal advisers: R v Goodwin 1990 51 A Crim R 328. 
     
      
    19 It is clear, having regard to the contrast with the claim of provocation by MA, that a decision was made not to advance such a proposition on behalf of the applicant. Putting to one side any question of fulfilment of the Goodwin “tests”, where a deliberate decision as to issues to be pursued is made, there is nothing unfair, and there will be no miscarriage, in holding an accused to such a decision, even though it is conceivable (or might be thought by other advisers) that a different decision may have “worked rather better”: R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; see also Ratten v The Queen 1974 131 CLR 510 @ 517. 
     
      
    20 On any view, it is not perceptible that the absence of the material caused a miscarriage of justice, and I would reject the tender of the statements. I would add that, perusal of the content, especially that of Mr Pedemont, demonstrates an apparently sound appreciation on the part of the applicant’s representative at the sentencing hearing of what material may advantage or disadvantage the success of submissions in support of mitigation.  
     
      
    21 I would reject grounds 1 and 3. 
     
      
    22 Ground 2 complains: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentence is manifestly excessive”. 
        
       
      
    23 On the scheduled trial date, as I have indicated, MA pleaded guilty to murder and it was on the following day that the applicant pleaded guilty to manslaughter. His Honour determined that each offender would receive an overall discount of 25 percent in assessment of penalty for utilitarian and subjective factors pertaining to the pleas of guilty. It was not argued that this discount was inappropriate.  
     
      
    24 It can therefore be deduced that his Honour’s “starting point” for the applicant’s sentence was an imposition of twelve years imprisonment.  
     
      
    25 A number of subjective factors operated in the applicant’s favour. He was youthful and had no prior conviction. Although some reservation was expressed about the absence of indication that referees were aware of the details of the offence, his Honour accorded “some weight” to descriptions of the applicant as quiet, honest and respectful. The statements to the psychologist indicated “some contrition and remorse”. 
     
      
    26 A significant element in the sentence assessment was the need to reflect the seriousness of the offences on the Form 1. In addition to the summary of agreed facts set out above, there was more detail of the offences at Brookvale in the document signed by the applicant. Some detail of the offence of affray was given in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “About 1.05am on 23 April, 2003, the prisoner drove a red Nissan 200 SX coupe into the Caltex Service Station, 750 Pittwater Road, Brookvale. 
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner became involved in an argument with a male. 
        
       
       
        
        As a result the prisoner went to his motor car and produced a pistol in his right hand. The prisoner stood up, pointed the pistol at the male and said, ‘I’m going to shoot you’. 
        
       
       
        
        At the time there was about fifteen other persons standing in close proximity to the prisoner and the male. These persons took cover behind parked cars and petrol bowsers. 
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner cocked the pistol (pulling the top of the pistol to the rear, making a metal clicking sound). 
        
       
       
        
        The male retreated. The prisoner moving the pistol in the direction of the other people present, said ‘Anyone want to come forward and take it’. 
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner got into his car and drove quickly from the service station. 
        
       
       
        
        The pistol produced by the prisoner was in working order, which was purchased illegally”. 
        
       
      
    27 No challenge was offered to his Honour’s approach which he articulated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I propose to take these matters into account in line with the judgment of the Chief Justice in Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518 by taking a graver view of the objective seriousness of the manslaughter of Mr Jago than would ordinarily be the case having regard to the incident mentioned in the Form 1”. 
        
       
      
    28 In relation to these remarks counsel proposed in a written submission: 
     
      
       
        
        “This may be conceded, but their (the Form 1 matters) significance in this way was limited. They showed that the applicant’s involvement in the presentation of a loaded pistol to threaten other persons was not an isolated event. He did it himself two days before”. 
        
       
      
    29 If “limited” is intended to convey that the offences were of diminished seriousness, then the submission should be rejected. The presentation of a loaded weapon carries with it the risk of lethal consequence even if the intention is to do no more than threaten. On the facts, there were some fifteen persons put at risk at Brookvale. The proper use of the Form 1 procedure had a necessary consequence that there would be a significant and not merely nominal enhancement in the assessment of sentence for the substantive offence. 
     
      
    30 It has been observed that appropriate penalties for the crime of manslaughter vary more than in any other serious crime contained within the Crimes Act and little assistance can be derived from other cases: Regina v Elliott unreported, NSWCCA 14 February 1991. Nevertheless manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life and unlawful homicide, whatever form it takes, has always been recognized as a most serious crime: Regina v Hill 1981 3 A Crim R 397. The circumstances of the present offence involving contemplation of the use of a loaded pistol to frighten unarmed youths with an ultimate fatal consequence to one of them requires assessment of a sentence, into which must also be woven a reflection of markedly similar criminal conduct two days previously, albeit without the fatal element on that occasion. The circumstances measured against the imposition do not demonstrate error in his Honour’s exercise of sentencing discretion. I would reject the submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    31 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.

    4 The applicant was a drug dealer who had sold prohibited drugs to one Brendan McMullen. Investigating police lawfully listened to and recorded a series of telephone conversations between him and McMullen. The first of the series which is relevant to this application was a conversation the two had when the applicant telephoned McMullen on 6 December 2001. They had already had some dealings. McMullen told the applicant that he had already picked up the money. The applicant said -  
     
      
       
        
        it’s ready for ya anyway. …It’s the right thing, don’t worry, I swear to God. …You don’t have to worry about nothin’. 
        
       
      
    5 The conversation continued -  
     
      
       
        
        BM See, this guy (ind) Sidski? 
        
       
       
        
        SZ You what? 
        
       
       
        
        BM (ind), is Chuck down there? 
        
       
       
        
        SZ Is what? 
        
       
       
        
        BM Is Chucky down there? 
        
       
       
        
        SZ Truck in? 
        
       
       
        
        BM Yeah, Chucky. 
        
       
       
        
        SZ Who – is there any chucky, yeah? 
        
       
       
        
        BM Yes. ‘Cause this guy’s interested in buyin’ that too. 
        
       
       
        
        SZ Yeah, I can do – I can’t get it from my mates at the  
         
        moment… 
        
       
       
        
        BM Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        SZ …but I can get ya some from elsewhere else, don’t worry.  
        
       
       
        
        BM Yeah.  
        
       
       
        
        SZ Pretty good. 
        
       
       
        
        BM Yeah. That he’d be … 
        
       
       
        
        SZ Um … 
        
       
       
        
        BM …thinkin’ about him buyin’ in bulk, d’ya know what I mean? 
        
       
       
        
        SZ Oh, right.  
        
       
       
        
        BM Alright? 
        
       
       
        
        SZ If he wants to buy bulk I can probably go to my mates and get it, (ind) 
        
       
       
        
        BM How much d’ya reckon? 
        
       
       
        
        SZ I dunno, we’ll see what happens when you get down here. 
        
       
       
        
        BM Rightio, mate. 
        
       
       
        
        SZ See how much money he’s got to spend and see what he wants. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    6 The two men had three telephone conversations on 14 December 2001. At 2:39pm McMullen complained about the poor quality of material that had been supplied and about the probable consequences. The conversation continued -  
     
      
       
        
        SZ I’ll gonna fuckin’ bash ‘em.

        SZ Mm righto. 
        
       
       
        
        BM They won’t have a fuckin’ chin to hit. These men are fuckin’ pretty upset now eh. 
        
       
       
        
        SZ Right.  
        
       
       
        
        BM You know what I mean? I’m just at a meeting now. 
        
       
       
        
        SZ Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        BM And they – there’s ninety (90) here to grab two full ones,  
         
          
          right, they got 90 here and they got money here for five (5) chuckies. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        SZ Okay. 
        
       
       
        
        BM And they don’t know what to do, they don’t know whether to trust, who to trust, you know.

        BM Righto buddy, ring me back soon as, eh. 
        
       
       
        
        SZ Alright. 
        
       
       
        
        BM ‘Cause they’re all ready to go down tonight, they’re freakin’.  
        
       
       
        
        SZ Alright. 
        
       
      
    7 At 3pm the applicant telephoned McMullen. They spoke about the identity of those dealing with McMullen and the conversation continued -  
     
      
       
        
        BM They’re not…they’re not upset with me or you or him, right?

    9 Negotiations took place between the applicant’s legal representatives and the Crown Prosecutor. There were three charges against the applicant, relating to the supply of the large commercial quantity of cocaine, to the supply of the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine and to the supply of pseudoephedrine. An indictment signed on 21 October 2003 charged that the applicant -  
     
      
       
        
        1. Between 6 December 2001 and 18 December 2001, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, to wit, 100 grams of Pseudoephedrine; 
        
       
       
        
        2. Between 1 December 2001 and 12 December 2001, at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, did knowingly take part in the supply of an amount of a prohibited drug, to wit, 500 grams of Methylamphetamine being an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity; and 
        
       
       
        
        3. Between 6 December 2001 and 16 December 2001, at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, did knowingly take part in the supply of an amount of a prohibited drug, to wit, 1 kilogram of Cocaine being an amount which was not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.  
        
       
      
    10 There had been an offer from the applicant to plead guilty to the pseudoephedrine charge if the Crown would withdraw the others, and that offer was renewed during the week before the trial was due to commence. The Crown Prosecutor told Mr Tabchouri, the applicant’s solicitor, that the offer was unacceptable, but that if the applicant pleaded guilty to the charge of supplying the large commercial quantity of cocaine the Crown would remove the other charges from the indictment and consent to their being taken into account under the provisions of s32 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    11 On Monday 23 February 2004 the applicant appeared before Hosking QC DCJ and, I infer, his legal representative told his Honour that the two sides were negotiating. The trial was adjourned to Wednesday 25 February. On that day, as appears from the transcript of proceedings before Woods QC DCJ on 19 August 2004 and from his Honour’s judgment of 20 August 2004, the applicant entered a plea of guilty to a charge of knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely cocaine, and asked the Court to take into account in sentencing him his being knowingly concerned in the supply of amphetamine and pseudoephedrine.  
     
      
    12 Later on the applicant changed his solicitor and barrister. On 19 August 2004 his counsel moved on a Notice of Motion which had been filed seeking leave to withdraw the plea. Evidence was given by affidavit and orally. Woods QC DCJ was made aware of the text of the telephone conversations on which the Crown relied and was told something of the events which had led up to the plea. The substance of the case that was put to his Honour was as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        1. Taken at its highest, the evidence of what the applicant and McMullen said to one another was not capable of proving that the applicant had knowingly taken part in the supply of the large commercial quantity of cocaine; 
        
       
       
        
        2. The applicant did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which he had pleaded guilty; and 
        
       
       
        
        3. The applicant did not intend to admit his guilt of the charge to which he pleaded guilty.  
        
       
      
    13 There was evidence before his Honour that the terms “chuck”, “chucky” and “chuckies” refer to cocaine and that “key” meant a kilogram. The large commercial quantity of cocaine is one kilogram: see Schedule 2 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.  
     
      
    14 His Honour held that the evidence of the conversations was capable of proving that the applicant was offering to supply McMullen, for sale on to others, a kilogram of cocaine. His Honour observed that under ss3 and 6 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act there is an extended definition of the meaning of “supply”. His Honour held that whether what was said was seen as an agreement or as an offer, there was a proper legal basis for the charge. The remaining arguments depended very much on his Honour’s accepting the evidence of the applicant to the effect that he did not, when entering the plea, understand the instructions he had given to his legal advisors. His Honour rejected that evidence and the arguments based upon it.  
     
      
    15 The first ground in the application before this Court was that his Honour erred in law in his conclusion that the evidence was capable of proving the offence of which the applicant had pleaded guilty.  
     
      
    16 The offence of which the applicant pleaded guilty is a creature of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The relevant parts of the Act are as follows. By s25(2) a person who supplies, or knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.  
     
      
    17 By s3 “supply” includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things.  
     
      
    18 Section 6 is in these terms -  
     
      
       
        
        6 
          
        Meaning of “take part in” 
          
        
       
      
      
     
      
       
        
        For the purposes of this Act and the regulations, a person takes part in the cultivation or supply of a prohibited plant or the manufacture, production or supply of a prohibited drug if:  
         
         
          
          (a) the person takes, or participates in, any step, or causes any step to be taken, in the process of that cultivation, manufacture, production or supply,  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) the person provides or arranges finance for any such step in that process, or  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) the person provides the premises in which any such step in that process is taken, or suffers or permits any such step in that process to be taken in premises of which the person is the owner, lessee or occupier or in the management of which the person participates.  
          
         
        
       
      
    19 The first submission of Mr Cassidy, QC, counsel for the applicant, was that before the applicant could be properly convicted the Crown had to show that there had been an actual supply of cocaine. The word “supply” was to have its conventional meaning, unextended by the definition in s3 of the Act. Mr Cassidy QC referred to Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists (Southern Limited) [1953] 1 QB 401, a case which concerned itself with identifying the point at which, in a self-service shop, the acceptance of an offer effects the conclusion of a contract for the sale and purchase of goods.  
     
      
    20 The authority for the submission was said to be R v Deng (1996) 91 A Crim R 80. Deng appealed against her conviction of knowingly taking part in the supply of the large commercial quantity of heroin. The case against her was that she knew that a man called Huang had ten kilograms of heroin for sale and agreed to provide him with mobile telephones and pagers for the use of both of them in arranging the sale of the heroin, to introduce Huang to potential buyers and to assist him to collect money owing on sales. It was submitted by Mr Cassidy that Deng was found to have assisted Huang in attempting to supply heroin and that it was submitted on appeal that she should have been charged with supply (in its extended definition) and not with knowingly taking part in the supply. Mr Cassidy submitted that Mahoney P upheld that submission in relation to a smaller quantity of some 700 grams of heroin that Huang had succeeded in selling, and that Deng could not be correctly charged with taking part in its supply.  
     
      
    21 I think that that submission misunderstood what Mahoney P said in Deng. The appellant succeeded because the directions of the trial judge misstated the way in which the Crown had put its case. The Crown case was that Huang supplied the drug in that he attempted to sell and distribute or offer to supply the drug. However, the trial judge told the jury that they could convict the appellant if they found her to have taken part in an agreement to supply.  
     
      
    22 This Court in R v Deng did not decide that the “supply” component of a charge of knowingly taking part in a supply must be restricted in the manner now contended for. To the contrary, Hunt CJ at CL observed that this Court had previously held in R v Derbas (1993) 66 A Crim R 327 that the extended definition of “supply” was applicable where the Crown had charged the accused with knowingly taking part in supply. I agreed with his Honour’s judgment.  
     
      
    23 Mr Cassidy sought to draw support from Director of Public Prosecutions Reference No 2 of 1995 (1995) 65 SASR 508. In my opinion the case does not support his argument. All that was there decided was that where the alleged actual sale of a drug is a component in a charge of taking part in the sale of a drug, there does not need to be a completed sale. The Court had no cause to consider any extended definition of “sale”, much less “supply”.  
     
      
    24 Mr Cassidy referred to the judgments of this Court in R v Carusi and Cassar (1989) 17 NSWLR 516 and R v Chow (1987) 11 NSWLR 561. those cases were concerned with charges of conspiracy to supply a prohibited drug where the meaning of supply was, by statutory extension, an agreement to supply. R v Carusi was concerned with the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act but R v Chow with the predecessor to that Act, the Poisons Act 1966. The term “supply” was defined in the latter Act as including agreeing to supply.  
     
      
    25 In R v Chow the Crown case was that the appellant had agreed to sell or supply to one Lee and that Lee had agreed to purchase from the appellant the heroin the subject of the charge. That would have been a supply as that term was defined in the Poisons Act. Yet the appellant was charged with and convicted of conspiring to supply. The act of conspiracy was the very agreement that constituted a supply. The Court said at 570 that it would be absurd to say that the charge meant that there was an agreement between the appellant and Lee that the appellant would agree to sell or supply the heroin to Lee.  
     
      
    26 In R v Carusi and Cassar the appellant had been convicted of conspiring with another to supply a prohibited drug. The supply alleged was an agreement to supply. The charge was brought under s26 of the Act, which made it an offence to conspire with another or others to commit certain offences, including the offence of supply. The appellants took delivery of a quantity of heroin, intending to sell it at a profit, but were arrested before they could do so. They were charged and convicted of conspiring to supply. They appealed to this Court, relying on the decision in R v Chow. The appeal was dismissed. There was not present the absurdity that accompanied the conviction in Chow, because all they were charged with and convicted of was agreeing to supply. The word “supply” in that context had its ordinary, not its extended, meaning.  
     
      
    27 I do not think that either R v Chow or R v Carusi and Cassar supports Mr Cassidy’s argument. This is not a case in which conspiracy was alleged. As a matter of ordinary construction, there seems no reason why a person should not be convicted for taking or participating in any step or causing any step to be taken in the process of supply of a prohibited drug where supply is given its extended meaning. It is possible for a person so to take part in offering to supply, in keeping or having in possession for supply, in sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply or in authorising, directing, causing, suffering permitting or attempting any of those things to be done. In the present case his Honour found that the applicant knowingly concerned himself in agreeing or offering to supply the cocaine.  
     
      
    28 Of course, if found to be true, the facts alleged in the present case would prove guilt of supply, extending the meaning of that word to agreeing or offering to supply. But that gives rise to no particular difficulty. There is not the objection that there was in R v Chow. This Court observed in R v Deng that there will be cases where the facts are capable of proving supply or the knowing participation in supply. Sometimes the Crown will have to choose which offence it will charge. Sometimes it may be wise for the Crown to prefer charges in the alternative. But none of these things means that a person convicted of knowing participation on facts which would have made out supply has been wrongly convicted. There is no rule that if the facts are sufficient to make out the offence of supply the accused must be charged with that offence and not with knowingly taking part in supply.  
     
      
    29 The next submission was that a person accused of knowing participation in the supply of a prohibited drug must be a third party to the supply. The accused must be shown to have lent assistance in some relevant way to a second person, the supplier, to a third person, the receiver. An accused person cannot knowingly participate in a relevant arrangement to which the accused is a party.  
     
      
    30 Mr Cassidy was able to offer no authority for his contention. While the words “take part in” are apt to contemplate participation in the activities of another or others, they are not so confined by the definition in section 6. On the contrary, causing any step to be taken in the process of the relevant activity, whether cultivation, manufacture, production or supply, is apt to embrace the participation of a person in his own enterprise. The provision or arrangement of finance is apt to include the underwriting of the accused’s own process as much as another’s. The same may be said about the provision of premises. There is, to be sure, a certain awkwardness in describing the activities of the applicant as having knowingly taken part in his own offer or agreement to supply the cocaine, but in my opinion the language of the Act is not unduly strained thereby. I do not think that Mr Cassidy’s submission should be accepted. 31 It is convenient to deal with the next two submissions together, since they attacked his Honour’s findings of fact. It was submitted that there was no evidence upon which his Honour could find that there was a supply within the extended definition of that word. The next submission was that there was no evidence upon which his Honour could find that the supply was to be of the large commercial quantity of cocaine.  
     
      
    32 His Honour’s finding was as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        It seems to me that the material contained in Exhibit VD1B, the telephone transcripts, is capable, with (no doubt) other evidence that the Crown might have, of proving that the accused was offering to supply McMullen for on-sale to the Rebel motor cycle gang a kilogram of cocaine. Under s3 and s6 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act there is an extended definition of supply, and whether as an agreement or as an offer, it seems to me that there was a proper basis in law upon which the charge could have been made up.  
        
       
      
    33 I have set out in this judgment the text of the conversations and it seems to me that it was well open to his Honour to find, particularly when in the last of the conversations the applicant said, “Yeah I’ll get on to it”, that he was offering, if not agreeing, to supply cocaine. As to proof that he had a kilogram in mind, his Honour was entitled to have regard to the affidavit of the Crown Prosecutor, John Norman Bowers, sworn 12 May 2004, which annexed a draft statement of facts arrived at after negotiations with the applicant’s representatives. Included in that statement is the following -  
     
      
       
        
        Expert evidence confirms that a “key” is coded reference to one kilogram.  
        
       
      
    34 His Honour had in addition evidence that the applicant, having conferred with his legal advisers and having signed written instructions prepared by them, had entered a plea of guilty before Judge Hosking. 
     
      
    35 It was submitted that there had to be a nexus between whatever the applicant was shown to have done and the supply, even in its extended definition, and that in the absence of evidence that he had carried out his undertaking to make inquiries and get back to McMullen there was no evidence that he had taken a step in the supply. Making an offer was not enough. Reference was made to cases dealing with the acquisition and transport of raw chemicals and the processing of chemicals which were incapable of producing a prohibited drug, preparatory to a manufacturing process: see R v BD (2001) 128 A Crim R 28 and R v McCoy (2001) 51 NSWLR 702.  
     
      
    36 These submissions do not seem to me to be to the point. If an offer to supply or an agreement to supply constitutes a supply, it must follow that the taking of the step which constitutes the making of the agreement or offer also constitutes supply.  
     
      
    37 In my opinion the first ground in this application has not been made good.  
     
      
    38 The Court may grant leave to withdraw a plea of guilty if it appears that there has been a miscarriage of justice: R v Chiron [1980] 1 NSWLR 218; R v Ondrovcik Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 4 November 1977 unreported. Whatever the particular circumstance put forward as demonstrating that there has been a miscarriage of justice, it must be shown that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt: R v Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35. The first submission by Mr Cassidy was that the evidence could not prove the offence charged. I have already rejected that submission.  
     
      
    39 The second submission was that the applicant did not understand the charge and did not intend to plead guilty to it. A substantial body of evidence was put before his Honour about what had led up to the plea of guilty. The applicant gave evidence. So did his former barrister and solicitor and the solicitor’s clerk who had attended the applicant. The clerk was a qualified man, apparently, who was shortly after these events admitted to practise as a solicitor. The applicant admitted the general tenor of the telephone conversations but asserted that he was really playing for time and never intended to supply cocaine. If that had been true it would not have assisted the applicant, of course, but the story was so implausible that his Honour, understandably, was unprepared to give credence to the applicant’s evidence. So an attempt by the applicant to shift blame onto his advisers went nowhere.  
     
      
    40 Mr Korn, the applicant’s former barrister, gave evidence of conferences with the applicant in which the Crown evidence and the charges were discussed. Mr Korn advised the applicant and, having received his oral instructions, drafted written instructions for his signature. His evidence was that he was concerned about the state of wakefulness of the applicant and suggested to his solicitor that written instructions be prepared overnight and that the applicant be invited on the following day, when he was fresh, to sign them if he wished to do so. That is what happened.  
     
      
    41 Mr Cassidy drew attention to the difference between the form of the written instructions signed by the applicant and the form of the charge to which he pleaded guilty. The written instructions were as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        I, Sid Zaiter, acknowledge that I have had a conference with Mr Korn and Elias Tabchouri in the presence of Elie at the offices of their firm. I confirm that I have given instructions to my lawyers to enter a plea of guilty to the principal count of supply large commercial quantity of cocaine on the basis that the other two matters will be put on a schedule. I agree that I do not believe that I can adequately explain the conversation on the phone that the Crown alleges is a conversation to which I am a party and that the topic is the supply of cocaine. Since I agree that I cannot explain this conversation, it makes sense for me to enter a plea of guilty to this count. On this basis, once I enter this plea, it then becomes a question whether it is in my best interests to fight the remaining two charges. On balance I have decided it is in my best interests to agree to put the two remaining charges on a schedule. I know that the judge will take these two matters into account in fixing a sentence for the principal matter to which I will plead.  
        
       
      
    42 The applicant signed the instructions, which were dated 25 February 2004.  
     
      
    43 In giving judgment his Honour said this -  
     
      
       
        
        There is no evidence that the accused is illiterate. There is no evidence that he could not read the document, that he did not have the opportunity to read the document, that he was pressured into signing the document, or that he did not understand the document. He now says that he did not understand the document, but I reject his evidence on that point.  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    44 His Honour observed that the applicant had made no explanation of the words he used in the recorded telephone conversations other than his assertion that he did not in fact intend to supply the drug. His Honour observed that the charges at committal each asserted that between named dates at Sydney the applicant “did knowingly take part in the supply of” an amount of the drug with which the charge was concerned. There were three charges, one for cocaine, one for methylamphetamine and one for pseudoephedrine. The indictment prepared by the Crown Prosecutor after committal was put before his Honour. In each case the form of the charge used the words “did knowingly take part in the supply”.  
     
      
    45 Mr Korn and his instructing solicitor were well aware of the form of the charges outstanding against the applicant when they interviewed him and advised him. There was no evidence before his Honour that the difference between the forms of words “did knowingly take part in the supply” and “supply” was considered to be of any consequence. His Honour concluded that Mr Korn had inadvertently drafted instructions which used the word “supply” when he should have used the words “knowingly take part in supply”. That was a conclusion to which I think his Honour was entitled to come.  
     
      
    46 It seems possible that the applicant did not appreciate the distinction between the charge to which he pleaded guilty and the charge described in the instructions which he signed, but the only reasonable conclusion that his Honour could draw was that the advice to the applicant and the applicant’s instructions to his advisers were that he was guilty of the charge which the Crown was bringing against him.  
     
      
    47 His Honour rejected the submission that the applicant did not appreciate the nature of the charges, that he did not intend to admit his guilt and that he entered his plea by reason of imprudent and inappropriate advice. It has not been shown that his Honour erred in coming to those conclusions.  
     
      
    48 His Honour concluded that the reason for the application before him to withdraw the plea of guilty resulted simply from the applicant’s getting cold feet after the event. It has not been shown that this was not a conclusion reasonably open.  
     
      
    49 In my opinion this second ground had not been made good.  
     
      
    50 I would refuse leave to appeal from his Honour’s order.

      2003/45 SCRM - REGINA v Ian Robert HALL  
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT - On application to withdraw plea of Guilty. 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: On 7 July 2004, Ian Robert Hall appeared before Davidson AJ charged with the following offences: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: 
         For that he between 30 June 1998 and 9 July 1998 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did commit an offence against section 1307(1) of the Corporations Act 2001, in that he being an officer of Clifford Corporation Limited, did falsify books of Clifford Corporation Limited, which related to the affairs of that corporation, in that he created letters addressed to Mr Sid Myer dated 10 April 1998 and 21 June 1998 concerning the sale of Signature Group Australia Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Clifford Corporation Limited, which falsely stated that the dates for completion of the sale of Signature Group Australia Limited had been extended. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: 
         Further, for that he between about 28 October 1998 and 13 November 1998 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did commit an offence against section 1311(1)(a) of the Corporations Act 2001, in that contrary to section 1002G(2)(b) of the Act he did procure Leisuremark Pty Limited to sell securities, being shares in Clifford Corporation Limited whilst in possession of information concerning Clifford Corporation Limited that was not generally available, being information which a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price of the securities if it were generally available and being information which Ian Robert Hall knew, or ought reasonably to have known. 
        
       
      
    2 Mr Hall pleaded guilty to each count. He was not represented. The matter was stood over for sentence. Davidson AJ, however, was not able to complete the matter (and a companion matter involving John Barrie Loiterton). In these circumstances, submissions on sentence by Mr Hall and Mr Loiterton were fixed for hearing before me on 15 December 2004. 
     
      
    3 By 15 December 2004, Mr Craig Evans of Counsel had been retained to appear for Mr Hall. At the hearing on that day, Mr Evans announced that he had just received instructions from Mr Hall to withdraw his pleas in respect of both counts. Mr Evans was given time to clarify his instructions and consider his position. Ultimately Mr Evans sought and was given leave to withdraw as Counsel for Mr Hall. 
     
      
    4 Mr Hall thereafter appeared for himself. In the course of the hearing he altered his position. He confirmed his earlier plea in respect of count 2 (the ""insider trading"" charge). A conviction was then entered. He said, however, that he wished to seek leave to withdraw his plea in respect of count 1 (the ""falsification of books"" charge). The matter was stood over to deal with that application. A timetable was fixed for the filing of affidavits and submissions. 
     
      
    5 The application was ultimately heard over a number of days, commencing on 21 February 2005. 
     
      
       
      Setting aside a Plea. 
       
      
    6 A plea of guilty is an admission by the accused of the essential elements of the offence. It may, with leave, be withdrawn at any time before sentence (Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 334-335). In determining whether leave should be given, the Court has a discretion. The discretion must be exercised judicially. Such an application is approached ""with caution, bordering on circumspection"", recognising ""the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings"" (Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 at 122). The onus is upon the person seeking leave to demonstrate that the plea should be set aside. The circumstances in which the Court will give leave were identified in Maxwell v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 501, by Dawson and McHugh in these words: (at 511 ) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The plea of guilty must however be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt. Those circumstances include ignorance, fear, duress, mistake or even the desire to gain a technical advantage. The plea may be accompanied by a qualification indicating that the accused is unaware of its significance."" 
        
       
      
    7 The central issue is the integrity of the plea (R v Sagiv (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 at 80). Was the accused, in entering the plea, making a free and voluntary admission of the essential elements of the offence? (R v Boskovitz (unreported, NSW CCA, 19.8.96, per McInerney J at 33). The accused must be in possession of all relevant facts relied upon by the Crown to support the essential elements of the charge (Liberti (supra) at 122; Boskovitz at 33). Expressed in another way, the accused must show that the plea was entered without a genuine consciousness of guilt (R v Murphy (1965) VR 187 at 191; R v Davies (unreported, NSW CCA,16.12.93, per Badgery-Parker J at 8/9), or that there was no evidence upon which the accused could have been convicted (Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35, per Hunt CJ at CL at 37). 
     
      
    8 In discharging the onus, it is enough to secure leave that the applicant demonstrates ""an issuable question of guilt"" (R v Murphy, per Scholl J at 190-191), or a real question to be tried (R v Davies, per Badgery-Parker J at 8/9). 
     
      
       
      The Crown Case on Count 1. 
       
      
    9 Mr Hall was a Director of Clifford Corporation Limited (""Clifford Corporation""), a publicly listed company. He was also a substantial shareholder through a company, Leisuremark Pty Limited (""Leisuremark""). The Signature Group Australia Limited (""the Signature Group"") was a wholly owned subsidiary of Clifford Corporation. It conducted a business renting office space, which was sublet to tenants who were provided with facilities to enable them to conduct their businesses from such premises. 
     
      
    10 In 1997 the Clifford Corporation was the largest manufacturer of coaches and buses in Australia. However, in 1998 its trading performance declined, halving the share price during the period March to October that year. 
     
      
    11 In March 1998, a firm of accountants, Grant Thornton, was appointed as the external Auditor for the group. Messrs Chapman and Archer from that firm were given the task of carrying out the audit. 
     
      
    12 In 1997 or thereabouts, Clifford Corporation entered into negotiations with I B Your Office International Limited (""IBYO International"") to sell the Signature Group. IBYO International conducted a similar business to the Signature Group worldwide. The parties met and signed various documents, as set out in the Statement of Facts prepared by the Crown for the purposes of the sentencing hearing. The Statement of Facts, in its final form was, as I will describe, prepared in consultation with Mr Hall and Mr Evans of Counsel after the pleas of guilty had been entered. It included the following paragraphs, describing the course of negotiations in respect of the proposed sale: (Affidavit Kay Marinos 15/2/05 - EX PP) 
     
      
       
        
        ""7. In 1997 Clifford commenced negotiations with IB Your Office International Limited ('IBYO International') for the sale of Signature. Meetings between Loiterton and Uwe Brettmann ('Brettmann'), Chairman and Chief Executive of IBYO International, culminated in the signing in October 1997 of a Preliminary Agreement. In that agreement the parties agreed to the merger of Signature and IBYO International into a single entity, with the business of Signature to be acquired for the sum of USD19.68 million. 
        
       
       
        
        8. On 14 February 1998 IBYO International (by Brettman) and Clifford (by Loiterton) executed a variation to the Preliminary Agreement in Paris ('the Paris agreement'). The Paris agreement provided, among other things, that a final agreement would be entered into by 15 April 1998. It also provided that certain expenses of Clifford would become payable at specified dates, and in addition, that compensation payments would be paid to Signature on specified dates. 
        
       
       
        
        9. On 4 March 1998 Clifford announced to the Australian Stock Exchange ('ASX') its Preliminary Consolidated Results for Six Months ended 31 December 1997. The announced profit figure of $4.0 million was based on the inclusion of the above payments. 
        
       
       
        
        10. In about early April 1998 IBYO International instructed its US attorneys to act for it in relation to the Signature transaction, including the preparation of a Stock Purchase Agreement ('SPA') between IBYO International and Clifford in a format customary for US underwriters, regulators and investors. During May and June 1998, several drafts of the SPA were prepared and submitted by IBYO International's attorneys to Clifford's Sydney lawyer, Phillip Biber. 
        
       
       
        
        12. In May 1998, representatives of IBYO International co-ordinated due diligence investigations in relation to Signature. 
        
       
       
        
        13. On 2 June 1998 Clifford announced to the ASX that net profits for the group would ' 
        approximate $10.0m in the current year rising to more that $40.0m in 2001. 
        ' The $10 million profit forecast was based on amounts said to be derived from the sale of Signature. 
        
       
       
        
        14. On 13 June 1998 the offender and Loiterton travelled to San Diego to meet with IBYO International representatives to finalise the negotiations. However at a meeting of the IBYO International executives on 13 June, (not attended by the offender and Loiterton), it was agreed that the purchase of Signature would not proceed at that time, mainly because of the results of the due diligence investigation carried out on Signature. This decision was communicated to the offender and Loiterton at a further IBYO International board meeting on 14 June 1998 and is recorded in the unsigned minutes of the meeting. 
        
       
       
        
        15. It appears to have been agreed, however, that the parties would remain in negotiation with each other if Clifford could produce satisfactory accounting material."" 
        
       
      
    13 On 18 June 1998, Mr Archer, the auditor, made a request in writing to Mr Sapier (a Director and a member of the Audit Committee) for further information about the progress of the Signature sale. The auditors had not been provided with an account of what had occurred in San Diego. Specifically, nothing had been said concerning the refusal by IBYO International to proceed with the agreement to purchase the Signature Group as it was structured. 
     
      
    14 The Crown asserts that, in this context, Mr Hall manufactured certain letters which were false in order to satisfy the auditors. The letters were on the letterhead of Clifford Corporation. In each case they were signed by Mr Hall. The first bears a date 10 April 1998. It was addressed to Mr Sid Meyer (sic) of Melbourne, being the IBYO International representative in Australia. The letter was in these terms: (Exhibit 2) 
     
      
       
       ""Re: Sale of Signature Group Australia Limited 
       
       
      Just a short note to confirm our discussions and agreement to extend the completion time factors of the sale of Signature Agreement to 30th June 1998. As you know we contemplate being in San Diego for this purpose in the last half of June."" 
       
      
    15 The second letter, also addressed to Mr Meyer (sic), bears a date 21 June 1998. It was in these terms: (Exhibit 2) 
     
      
       
       ""Re: Signature Group Australia Limited Sale Agreement 
       
       
      Our arrangements extended the settlement of the sale agreement to 30th June 1998. As a result of the discussions in San Diego, I believe it would be prudent to further extend these to the date you suggested being 16th August 1998. Looking at the calendar that date falls on a Sunday, which effectively means that 17th August, would apply."" 
       
      
    16 On 6 July 1998, Mr Sapier wrote to Mr Loiterton, the Chairman of Clifford Corporation. He reminded him that a written undertaking had been given to the auditors that a report would be furnished on the status of the Signature sale. Mr Hall was the Chairman of the Audit Committee. On 8 July 1988, he provided a memorandum to Mr Loiterton, which was then used by Mr Loiterton to answer the auditors. The Statement of Facts, prepared by the Commonwealth DPP, described these events in the following terms, which are important. It was this paragraph, according to Mr Hall, which prompted him to make the present application, seeking to withdraw his plea to Count 1: 
     
      
       
        
        ""18. On 8 July 1998, the offender provided Loiterton with a memorandum that at the San Diego meetings the IBYO International executives requested that the sale be delayed. He further indicated that the IBYO International executives had informed him and Loiterton that there were 'goodwill and taxation difficulties'. Attached to that memorandum were signed copies of two letters purportedly dated 10 April and 21 June 1998 which are the subject of count 1. The letters were never received by Myer and were not created on the dates shown on them.  
        The content of the letters was also false.

    17 The Statement of Facts, in its final form, continued as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""19. Between 16 and 20 July 1998 Sapier wrote to Grant Thornton accountants and provided them with a number of documents including an internal memorandum from Loiterton dated 9 July 1998. Attached to the internal memorandum were the two fabricated letters which are the subject of count 1 on the indictment."" 
        
       
       
      Mr Hall's Case. 
       
      
    18 Count 1 was based upon s1307 of the Corporations Act 2001. That section, relevantly, is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        1307 Falsification of books 
        
       
       
        
        (1) An officer ... of a company who engages in conduct that results in the concealment, destruction, mutilation or falsification of any securities of or belonging to the company or any books affecting or relating to affairs of the company is guilty of an offence. 
        
       
      
     .... 
     
      
       
        
        (3) It is a defence to a charge arising under subsection (1) ... if the defendant proves that he, she or it acted honestly and that in all the circumstances the act or omission constituting the offence should be excused."" 
        
       
      
    19 Mr Hall does not dispute many of the elements of the charge brought under that section, although he did question how the Corporations Act 2001 could relate back to an offence supposedly committed in 1998. On that issue the Crown relied upon the transitional provisions, recently considered by Grove J in R v Frawley (NSWSC, 9 September 2004, unreported), affirmed on Appeal on 23 February 2005 ([2005] NSWCCA 66). 
     
      
    20 Mr Hall acknowledged that, as a Director, he was an officer of Clifford Corporation. He agreed that he composed the letters dated 10 April 1998 and 21 June 1998 which he signed once they were typed. He further acknowledged that the letters came within the extended definition of ""books"" in the Act, the requirement being that the Crown prove the falsification of any ""books affecting or relating to the affairs of the company"" (s1307). Mr Hall said he had no recollection of when he had written either letter, except that in each case it was some time after the date appearing on the letter. He said it was his expectation that the letters, once signed, would have been sent to Mr Myer. He was, however, not involved in their despatch. He therefore could not say why neither letter had been received by Mr Myer. 
     
      
    21 Mr Hall, however, insisted that at all times (including at the time he entered his plea), he believed that the letters were not false, save that the date was false. He acknowledged that he had backdated the letters. Mr Hall said, in his evidence, that he spoke to Mr Myer on a number of occasions on the subject of the final agreement for the sale of the Signature Group. The date originally agreed in the Paris Agreement (15 April 1998) was adjusted as a result of these discussions. It was agreed that the time would be extended to 30 June 1998. Mr Hall also said that after the San Diego meeting, when it became clear that the 30 June deadline would not be met, he again discussed with Mr Myer a further extension. The new date, agreed some time before 8 July 2001 (when he wrote to Mr Loiterton), was 16 August 1998. 
     
      
    22 In submissions, Mr Hall said that Mr Myer's testimony during the committal and other material served by the Crown (including letters sent by IBYO International), corroborated his account that there were discussions and there was agreement. Correspondence, originating from IBYO International, referred to the 30 June 1998 deadline. 
     
      
    23 Mr Hall also emphasised another matter, relevant to the alleged falsity of each letter. The indictment specified the falsity of each letter in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        Count 1: 
         ... which falsely stated that the dates for completion of the sale of Signature Group Australia Limited had been extended."" 
        
       
      
    24 Mr Hall contrasted these words with the terms of each letter. The letter of 10 April 1998 used the following phrase: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... extend the completion time factors of the sale of Signature Agreement to 30th June 1998."" 
        
       
      
    25 The letter dated 21 June 1998 had the heading ""Signature Group Australia Limited Sale Agreement"". The text incorporated the following expression: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Our arrangements extended the settlement of the sale agreement to 30th June 1998. ..."" 
        
       
      
    26 No-one, according to Mr Hall, could reasonably read either letter as referring to ""the completion of the sale"" of the Signature Group, as alleged in the indictment. The letters take up the words in the Paris Agreement, which refer to a ""final agreement"" (then due on 15 April 1998). It was that time which, by agreement, was extended in each case. It was, according to his submission, well understood by all concerned with the negotiations that the sale of the Signature Group would proceed in three stages. The first stage (""the Preliminary Agreement"" of October 1997 and the Paris Agreement (supra para 12)), were statements of intent, or agreements to agree. The second stage was the Final Agreement, defining all terms. This was to be the binding contract. It would make provision for the third stage, where each party would fulfil its obligations under the Final Agreement (""the Completion""). Title would pass upon completion. 
     
      
    27 The indictment, according to Mr Hall, speaks of the third stage, completion. The letters, in contrast, were plainly speaking of the second stage, the Final Agreement. Since they were not addressing the issue of completion of the sale of the Signature Group, it followed, in Mr Hall's submission, that they did not falsely assert anything in relation to the completion date. 
     
      
    28 Mr Hall denied the motive attributed to him by the Crown, that is that he manufactured the letters in order to satisfy the auditors. He said: (Exhibit 4, p4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""There is no evidence that I was aware of his (referring to Mr Loiterton) intended use of the memorandum as an attachment to a further memorandum to others. Loiterton was more aware of events than I was, as is evident by his own memorandum."" 
        
       
       
      The entry of the Plea. 
       
      
    29 Mr Hall, in support of his application, pointed to a number of other matters. First, he was unrepresented. He believed he understood the charge. It was his understanding that the Crown would provide him with a Statement of Facts with a view to securing his agreement. If he did not agree, he understood that the Crown would then be obliged to prove beyond reasonable doubt any fact which was adverse. He would have the opportunity of contesting that evidence and presenting his own evidence. 
     
      
    30 Secondly, Mr Hall said he believed that by his plea he was acknowledging that the letters were false, in that they were backdated. He believed, according to his evidence, that he would not be precluded from asserting that the letters otherwise accurately reflected the facts, that is, that there were discussions with Mr Myer on two occasions, and that there was agreement on each occasion to extend the time for the making of a final agreement. The letters, in any event, related to the second stage (the making of the Final Agreement), not the third stage (completion). The plea was therefore not entered with a consciousness of guilt, that is, an appreciation that the letters were false in either of these respects. 
     
      
    31 Thirdly, the pleas were entered a week after Davidson AJ handed down a reserved judgment dismissing Mr Hall's application for a stay, based upon Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292. Mr Hall said he was exhausted. He was bankrupt. He had been refused legal aid. He faced the prospect of a trial, unrepresented. In his words, he had ""had enough"". He was anxious to bring the matter to an end, putting matters which he disputed to the Court in his submissions on sentence. 
     
      
    32 Fourthly, he drew attention to the fact that, having pleaded guilty, his Honour did not enter a conviction (cf Maxwell v The Queen (supra); R v Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320; R v Vergara [1999] NSWCCA 352).  
     
      
       
      The evidence of Mr Evans. 
       
      
    33 After pleading guilty, Mr Hall approached the Bar Association seeking representation under the Association's Pro Bono Scheme. Mr Evans of Counsel was nominated, and accepted the brief. Mr Evans had recently come to the Bar. He worked closely with his pupil master, Mr Graham Turnbull, an experienced criminal advocate. Mr Evans kept notes of the conferences that he conducted with Mr Hall. Mr Hall waived any privilege he may have had in respect of such discussions and notes. 
     
      
    34 Mr Evans first received instructions towards the end of September 2004. Mr Hall provided him with several folders from a large brief served by the Crown. Mr Evans met Mr Hall on 1 October 2004, when the matter was mentioned before Davidson AJ. They spoke briefly. Mr Evans' notes of that conference included the following entry: (Exhibit 3, p35) 
     
      
       
       ""  
       * 
        Look at count 1 - offence?"" 
       
      
    35 Referring to Mr Hall's instructions, Mr Evans added these words in his notes: (Exhibit 3, p35) 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ""letters were post dated 
             
            do (you) agree that they were backdated 
             
            could have."" 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    36 The notes Mr Evans made in his conference with Mr Hall on 20 October 2004 included the following words, recording the instructions of Mr Hall: (Exhibit 3, p25) 
     
      
       
       ""  
       - 
        Letters are not false in context."" 
       
      
    37 Soon after Mr Evans had been retained, Mr Hall provided him with certain type written notes. The notes had been prepared before 26 August 2004. They outlined submissions Mr Hall intended making at a time when he believed he would be representing himself on sentence. The document referred to the terms of the indictment (""completion of the sale"") in contrast to the terms of the letters (Exhibit 2). Mr Hall's notes said this: (Exhibit 4, p2) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The letter dated 10 April 1998 refers to '... agreement to extend the completion time factors of the sale of Signature Agreement to 30th June 1998.' The only Agreement extant at or during the relevant period was the 'Preliminary Agreement' dated 8 October 1997 ... and it's 'Variation to Preliminary Agreement' dated 14 February 1998 ... . Paragraph (h) of the variation reads, 'The final agreement shall be entered into within 60 days of the date of this amendment.' It is the extension of this date that the letter refers to, not the 'settlement of the sale' as referred to in the indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        The letter dated 21 June refers to the 10 April letter as 'Our arrangements extended the settlement of the sale agreement to 30th June 1998.' Once again referring to the settlement of a document, not the settlement of the 'sale'. ..."" 
        
       
      
    38 Mr Hall added: (Exhibit 4, p3) 
     
      
       
        
        "" ... letter(s) purporting to extend that time frame or date, would  
        not 
         prima facie be false as to content."" (emphasis in original) 
        
       
      
    39 Under the heading, ""Mitigating Circumstances"", the document composed by Mr Hall said this: (Exhibit 4, p5) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It should be seen from the preceding comments that as according to section 1307 there existed a defence to the charge in that the content of the letters was not materially different from the actual circumstances that prevailed at the relevant time. In other words the content was an honest understanding of the situation and thus  
        not 
         a falsification of the books but an honest attempt to place on record my understanding. However the facts remain that the method that resulted in recording that understanding is open for rebuke. Therefore in the circumstances of the 'guilty' plea this position must be presented in the form of a mitigating circumstance, and an exceptionally strong reason for mitigating any sentence."" (emphasis in original) 
        
       
      
    40 According to Mr Evans, Mr Hall asserted that the falsity which, by his plea of guilty he acknowledged, was the backdating of the letters. The indictment implicitly made reference to the backdating. There was an obvious contrast between the letters said to be false, which were dated 10 April 1998 and 21 June 1998, and the opening words of the indictment which were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        Count 1:  
        For that he between 30 June 1998 and 9 July 1998 ... did falsify books of Clifford Corporation Limited ... in that he created letters addressed to Mr Sid Myer dated 10 April 1998 and 21 June 1998 ..."" 
        
       
      
    41 Mr Evans, in these circumstances, considered that he should explain to Mr Hall the implications of his plea of guilty. There was a need to consider whether Mr Hall wished to ""reverse his plea"" (Exhibit 3, p13). On 20 October 2004 (Exhibit 3, p15), that issue was explored, but not resolved. Mr Evans advised that the concluding words of the indictment made it plain that Mr Hall admitted that the contents of each letter were false. The concluding words were: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        Count 1:  
        ... which falsely stated that the dates for completion of the sale of Signature Group Australia Limited had been extended."" 
        
       
      
    42 A further conference was arranged for 4 November 2004, this time in the presence of Mr Turnbull of Counsel. Mr Turnbull took notes (Exhibit 7). The withdrawal of the plea to count 1 was again discussed. The notes of Mr Evans identified the problems arising from Mr Hall's assertion that the contents of each letter were true. His notes included these words: (Exhibit 3, p55) 
     
      
       
        
        ""  
        *  
        Problems are: 
         
          
          1. letters not sent 
           
          2. attached to memo (& supplied to auditors) 
           
          3. back dated 
           
          4. use of the term 'settlement'. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Crown case: 
         
         used to mislead auditor (appointed 11 March 98) 
         
         > ASX > sh'holders (created impression)"" 
        
       
      
    43 Mr Turnbull's notes, made at the same conference, included these words: (Exhibit 7, p3) 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ""  
          -  
          Why complete letters out of date - don't know. 
           
          Why do them at all - can't remember. 
           
          Advised - no prospects on that evidence."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    44 According to Mr Evans, the conference ended with instructions to proceed with negotiations with the DPP as to the facts to be placed before the sentencing Judge. He understood, at that time, that Mr Hall would not be pursuing an application to set aside his pleas. Even though Mr Hall never said that he agreed that the letters were false, or that they related to the completion rather than the Final Agreement for sale, nonetheless Mr Evans believed he understood that his plea to count 1 precluded a denial of those matters. Mr Evans thereafter spoke to the Crown. He agreed, subject to certain amendments which are not material, with the draft paragraph 18 (supra para 13), which included the following words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The letters were never received by Myer and were not created on the dates shown on them.  
        The content of the letters was also false 
        ."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    45 Agreement having been reached as to the facts, a document was provided to me, as the sentencing Judge, a short time before the hearing on 15 December 2004.  
     
      
    46 On 14 December 2004, Mr Hall again conferred with Mr Evans. He again raised the issue of whether he should apply to withdraw his pleas, referring to both counts 1 and 2. He undertook to consider the matter overnight. Mr Evans wisely said he would require written instructions. The next day, being the day of the sentence hearing, Mr Hall provided Mr Evans with written instructions that he wished to seek leave to withdraw his pleas in respect of both counts. 
     
      
       
      The Crown submissions. 
       
      
    47 The plea of guilty to count 1, according to the Crown, was an acknowledgement by Mr Hall of the following: 
     
      
    · First, that he had falsified the books of Clifford Corporation, being the letters dated 10 April 1998 and 21 June 1998; 
     
      
    · Second, that he had done so between 30 June 1998 and 9 July 1998; 
     
      
    · Third, that such letters falsely stated that the dates for completion of the sale of the Signature Group Australia Limited had been extended. 
     
      
    48 It was Mr Hall's position that, in pleading guilty, he was acknowledging no more than he had falsified the letters, in the sense that he had back-dated them. He did not appreciate, according to his testimony, that it was not open to him to question, in his submissions on sentence, the span of time during which the letters were created, or the falsity of their contents. 
     
      
    49 The Crown submitted that such evidence should be regarded as disingenuous. First, Mr Hall, although not represented, was a man of intelligence, experience and maturity, as observed by Davidson AJ in his judgment rejecting the Dietrich Application (R v Hall (unreported, 29.6.04) paras 104 and 105). 
     
      
    50 Secondly, the terms of the indictment were clear. The dates during which Mr Hall was alleged to have falsified the letters (""did falsify books ... in that he created letters ... "") were specified (""For that he between 30 June 1998 and 9 July 1998 ... did falsify ... ""). The falsity in each letter was likewise stated (""which falsely stated that the dates for completion of the sale of the Signature Group Australia Limited had been extended""). Mr Hall acknowledged that he had read the indictment. He believed he understood it. How then, the Crown asks, could he have entertained the belief that the issues of falsity, which he said that he believed he could raise on sentence, were still open? 
     
      
    51 Thirdly, the Crown submitted that the position taken by Mr Hall was so irrational as to be unbelievable. If all he was acknowledging by his plea of guilty was back-dating two letters which were accurate, where was the criminal offence? The Court would not be persuaded, according to the Crown, that Mr Hall believed that it was a criminal offence to back-date letters, even where the contents were true.  
     
      
    52 Fourthly, in answer to Mr Hall's suggestion that the letters were speaking of the Final Agreement and not the completion of the sale, the Crown submitted that, on their proper construction, the letters were dealing with the issue stated in the indictment, namely, ""the dates for completion of the sale of the Signature Group Australia Limited"", asserting that such dates had been extended. 
     
      
    53 Fifthly, the Crown pointed to the circumstances in which Mr Hall pleaded guilty. He sent a letter to the Commonwealth DPP on 29 June 2004, being the date that Davidson AJ gave judgment refusing the stay application. The letter was headed, ""Without Prejudice"". Mr Hall was facing the prospect of a long trial (in which the estimate was 14 weeks) without representation. The letter began with these words: (Affidavit Ms Marinos 15.2.05, p94, annexure ""M"") 
     
      
       
        
        ""I am the applicant/defendant relevant to matters contained in this communication. I am deeply concerned that I have acted in a manner that has resulted in criminal charges being raised against me. Whilst in one case I believe that charge has been wrongly levelled against me, I recognize the actions of mine that caused the other charges were wrong, regardless of any contributing factors at the time. In the interests of limiting both time and costs to be spent, of achieving a prompt and certain dispatch of the cases, in taking into account the prosecution case in all matters, the lack of any criminal antecedents and with the unlikelihood that I will commit or even be in the position to commit further offences I ask the prosecution to favourably consider the following."" 
        
       
      
    54 Mr Hall, at that time, was facing three sets of charges, namely: 
     
      
    · Count 3, a charge based on s999 of the Corporations Act, relating to a stock exchange announcement; 
     
      
    · Counts 4 and 5, the charges based on s1307 of the Act, alleging the falsification of the books of Clifford Corporation (then framed as two separate charges to avoid possible duplicity); 
     
      
    · The charges relating to allegations of insider trading. 
     
      
    55 In addressing count 3 (the s999 charge), Mr Hall composed elaborate submissions. He painstakingly analysed the facts. He submitted that there was no case to answer. 
     
      
    56 He then dealt with the s1307 charges, which ultimately became count 1 in the present indictment (the subject of this application). In respect of those charges he said this: (Affidavit Ms Marinos, p96/97, annexure ""M"") 
     
      
       
        
        ""(b) - COUNTS 4 and 5 
        
       
       
        
        I have always considered these to be one matter, the events relating to the charges occurring at the same time, and should be rolled into one. 
        
       
       
        
        In the event that the Crown withdraws the charge related to count 3 the defendant proposes the Crown reduces the counts 4 and 5 to one count being that of count 4 to which the  
        defendant will revise his plea to 'guilty' with a defence submission to the court at sentencing 
        . This will allow the Crown to dispatch this case without lengthy proceedings, which would involve the costs of bringing International and interstate witnesses to New South Wales or long and expensive telecommunications. 
        
       
       
        
        In the alternative to reducing the charge to one count, I plead guilty to count 4, with count 5 to be taken into account as a form, all other factors applying."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    57 The Crown pointed out that nothing was said by Mr Hall limiting the falsity which he was prepared to acknowledge. On the Crown's submission, there is simply no explanation other than a consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    58 Mr Hall said that he chose not to advert to the factual issues relating to falsity at that stage. His letter to the Director, however, foreshadowed that he intended to make his response in his submissions on sentence. 
     
      
    59 Mr Hall went on to deal with the charges relating to insider trading. He made suggestions as to the way in which the indictment might be framed, in which case he would plead guilty. 
     
      
    60 On 2 July 2004, the Director responded favourably. He accepted Mr Hall's offer. His letter was in these terms: (Affidavit Ms Marinos, p101, annexure ""O"") 
     
      
       
        
        ""The Director has carefully considered your representations and has acceded to your request that the Crown discontinue the section 999/1311  
        Corporations Act 2001 
         count and you enter pleas of guilty to the following: 
        
       
       
        
        1. a 'rolled up' offence incorporating the 2 counts under section 1307  
        Corporations Act 2001 
         offences; and 
        
       
       
        
        2. a 'rolled up' offence incorporating the 6 counts under sections 1002G(2)(b)/1311(1)(a)  
        Corporations Act 2001 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        I will have a new indictment reflecting this prepared and available to be presented to the Court on Wednesday. I will facsimile you a copy of this early next week."" 
        
       
      
    61 The matter came before Davidson AJ on 7 July 2004. Mr Hall was arraigned. He pleaded guilty to the counts framed in the way in which he had suggested. 
     
      
    62 Sixthly, the Crown submitted that Mr Hall only retracted his plea once he had received the submissions on sentence from the Crown. The submissions were sent by fax on 25 August 2004. Under the heading, ""Comparative sentences"" the Crown referred to R v Hannes 43 ACSR 508 and R v Rivkin [2003] NSWSC 447; [2004] NSWCCA 7. Both were cases dealing with offenders convicted of insider trading. The sentence in Hannes was two years and two months with a fine of $100,000. The sentence in Rivkin was a fixed term of nine months imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention with a fine of $30,000. The Crown submissions concluded with these words: (Affidavit Ms Marinos, p180, annexure ""CC"") 
     
      
       
        
        ""35) In all the circumstances the offence also warrants the imposition of an appropriate full time custodial sentence."" 
        
       
      
    63 According to the Crown on this application, Mr Hall then panicked, even though he had been told before the plea by Mr Buscombe, junior Counsel for the Crown, that a custodial sentence would be sought (Affidavit Ms Marinos, para 34). He suddenly realised that the accumulation of convictions for insider trading and an additional offence would inevitably lead to a custodial sentence. 
     
      
    64 The difficulty with this aspect of the Crown submission is that Mr Hall signified his disagreement with the Crown's proposed Statement of Facts, including the allegation of falsity, before the sentence submissions had been sent. The Crown sent Mr Hall a Draft Statement of Facts on 4 August 2004. Mr Hall responded on 20 August 2004, stating that he had been in hospital and unable to respond earlier (Affidavit Ms Marinos, p160, annexure ""Y""). On 24 August 2004, he forwarded a brief response headed, ""Accused's Position"". In respect of paragraph 18 (supra para 16), which alleged ""the content of the letters was also false"", Mr Hall said this: (Affidavit Ms Marinos, p166, annexure ""BB"") 
     
      
       
        
        ""Para 18. I disagree with parts of this paragraph on the basis that they are wrongly based conclusions."" 
        
       
      
    65 Seventh, the Crown drew attention to Mr Hall's conduct once Mr Evans of Counsel had been retained. Certainly Mr Hall raised with Mr Evans the same issues concerning falsity that he now wishes to canvass. However, by 4 November 2004, he had received advice. Those issues had been explored. Yet he then instructed Mr Evans to negotiate with the Crown on the Statement of Facts and Mr Evans did so. Mr Neil SC, for the Crown, submitted that, if there had been a genuine mistake, a misapprehension as to the nature of the plea, then you would have expected Mr Hall to have made an immediate application. He would surely have sought leave to withdraw his plea upon being told that it was not open to him to question the issues of falsity, which he had planned to canvass. 
     
      
    66 Mr Hall responded by saying that, at the time of the plea and afterwards, he was exhausted. He was grateful to have the assistance of Counsel. Mr Evans had made it plain that he had been retained in respect of the sentencing proceedings. Should Mr Hall reverse his plea, then he could no longer appear (Exhibit A, para 28). In these circumstances, Mr Hall gave instructions to negotiate with the Crown concerning the facts. He remained hopeful that some acceptable form of wording could be agreed. However, in his dealings with Mr Evans, he never accepted that the contents of the letters were false, nor that they related to completion, as opposed to the Final Agreement, as Mr Evans acknowledged in his evidence. 
     
      
    67 The following exchange during the course of submissions bears upon these issues: (T148) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HALL: What I am putting is that in order for this to proceed along [with] some deal breaker in the middle of it, all this, this particular sentence, I am putting to Mr Evans that I was in a [state] of mind to allow him to proceed, to allow this deal breaker to be left in to the last possible moment and I am putting to him that that was my position in respect of the statement of facts. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What you are really saying, and I will get you to affirm this as evidence, you are really saying that you were content for your barrister to explore what sort of a deal could be fashioned by negotiation as to the facts and than at the end of that process you would determine in your own mind whether you would proceed with the deal in its final form and you ultimately came to the view on the morning of the hearing before me on 15 December that you would not? 
        
       
       
        
        MR HALL: That's probably my position. ..."" 
        
       
      
    68 Mr Hall said that, by December 2004, when he made his application, he had, to some degree, recovered his strength. He felt he could not agree with a formulation of the facts which included that the content of each letter was false. To do so would involve him not being ""true to himself"". 
     
      
    69 Finally, the Crown drew attention to the fact that the application, when made on the morning of 15 December 2004, was an application to withdraw the pleas in respect of both counts. In the course of the morning Mr Hall again altered his position, adhering to his plea in respect of count 2 (the insider trading charge). According to the Crown, the fact that he was prepared to make an application in respect of count 2 reflects upon the genuineness of his application in respect of count 1. 
     
      
      Conclusion. 
       
      
    70 An unusual feature of this application is that Mr Hall was unrepresented. Most of the authorities concern accused who were represented and received advice before pleading guilty. Usually the issue is the quality of the advice and the comprehension of the accused. 
     
      
    71 Mr Hall is unquestionably intelligent and shrewd. The matter, however, was complex. The Crown brief was voluminous. The events said to give rise to the offences occurred in 1997 and 1998. Mr Hall was plainly at a disadvantage in not having objective advice from a lawyer. I accept that, by 7 July 2004, when he pleaded guilty, he was, to a degree, exhausted. I also accept that he found the prospect of a 14 week trial, without representation, daunting. 
     
      
    72 When Mr Hall wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth) on 29 June 2004, he plainly was of a mind to ""strike a deal"" (cf R v Damien Parkes [2004] NSWCCA 377). Can it be inferred, as the Crown has suggested, that Mr Hall clearly recognised in his letter that he was guilty of certain matters (where he offered to plead guilty), but not others, skilfully arguing his case on the charge which he believed was without substance? 
     
      
    73 Mr Hall answered the Crown by saying that, in respect of count 1, he did recognise a degree of guilt. He therefore offered to plead, believing it was his right to lay before the sentencing Judge the full circumstances, as he knew them. He did not, however, according to his testimony, understand the full implications of his plea, such that it was not open to him to traverse the essential elements of the offence, as set out in the indictment. 
     
      
    74 Determining the essential elements of an indictment, and matters that may or may not be put on sentence, is a reasonably sophisticated process for someone without legal training, even if they are intelligent. As to what Mr Hall did or did not understand, I believe some aspects are clearer than others. It is convenient to address three issues: 
     
      
    · First, Mr Hall's belief that he could, on sentence, draw the Court's attention to the text of the letters which, in his submission, were clearly speaking of the final agreement, not the completion of the sale, as alleged in the indictment. 
     
      
    · Secondly, whether Mr Hall, by his plea, was conceding not only that the letters were back-dated but (as alleged in the indictment) that the documents were created between 29 June 1998 and 9 July 1998? 
     
      
    · Thirdly, whether Mr Hall, by his plea, was acknowledging that the contents of the letters were false? 
     
      
       
      Final Agreement or Completion? 
       
      
    75 I accept the Crown's assertion that, by his plea of guilty, Mr Hall acknowledged that the two letters (in the words of the indictment): 
     
      
       
        
        ""... falsely stated that the dates for completion of the sale of Signature Group Australia Limited had been extended."" 
        
       
      
    76 It was therefore not open to Mr Hall, on sentence, to suggest that the letters were dealing with something other than the completion of the sale of Signature Group Australia Limited. 
     
      
    77 I am persuaded, however, that Mr Hall, at the time he entered his plea to count 1, did not appreciate that implication. I have formed that view for a number of reasons. First, the construction put on the letters of 10 April 1998 and 21 June 1998 by Mr Hall is certainly arguable. Indeed, I prefer his construction to that advanced by the Crown. I have not examined the terms of the Preliminary Agreement of October 1997, or the variation to that Agreement of 14 February 1998 (the Paris Agreement). The Agreements were not tendered. Their essential terms were, nonetheless, described by the Crown in the Statement of Facts (supra para 12). They were, as Mr Hall asserted, essentially agreements to agree, fixing a time frame within which the parties were to formulate the final agreement. They were, perhaps, a little more complicated than that, in that they also made provision for the payment of certain expenses, according to a timetable, where the dates were specified. 
     
      
    78 The Paris Agreement provided that the Final Agreement should be entered within 60 days (by 15 April 1998). The first letter carried a date shortly before that deadline (10 April 1998). It referred to ""discussions and agreement to extend the completion time factors of the sale of Signature Agreement to 30 June 1998"". It referred to the planned excursion to San Diego (which later took place in mid June 1998) in which Messrs Loiterton and Hall hoped to finalise and sign the Final Agreement. It is therefore not unreasonable to construe this letter as extending the date set by the Paris Agreement, rather than the completion of the sale of Signature Group Australia Limited. 
     
      
    79 The second letter, dated 21 June 1998, is even more clear. The heading was ""Signature Group Australia Limited Sale Agreement"". Again the text spoke of a Sale Agreement, such as that contemplated by the Paris Agreement. The words in the letter were: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Our arrangements extended the settlement of the sale agreement to 30 June 1998 ... "" 
        
       
      
    80 The memo of Mr Hall to Mr Loiterton on 8 July 1998, to which he attached the two letters, contained a jumble of words, sometimes referring to ""settlement"" (which may suggest completion) and on other occasions using words consistent with the execution of a binding contract (the Final Agreement). The memorandum, however, ended with the following words which referred to the execution of a ""final"" binding contract: (Exhibit 8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""7. We are: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) Ensuring the completion of due diligence signoff. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) Liasing with USA with the purpose of clearing all matters required to reach a final settlement document and sign off during this month. This may mean a visit by one or both of us, and also by PAB."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    81 Whether the construction put forward by Mr Hall is right or wrong, there is, in my view, a triable issue as to the construction of the letters. If the construction suggested by the Crown is wrong, then the accused could not have been convicted of falsely stating that the ""dates for completion of the sale of the Signature Group Australia Limited had been extended"" because he said no such thing.  
     
      
    82 Secondly, I do not doubt that Mr Hall was alive to this issue at the time he pleaded guilty and that he intended to make a submission drawing attention to the issue before the sentencing Judge. The speech he prepared some time before 26 August 2004 (which he later handed to Mr Evans of Counsel) (Exhibit 4) (supra para 37), developed the point at some length. 
     
      
    83 It follows that Mr Hall should be given leave to withdraw his plea. I will therefore deal only briefly with the remaining issues. 
     
      
       
      Back-dating the letters. 
       
      
    84 The second issue concerned the back-dating of the letters. My observations are impressions formed, as a matter of probability, on evidence that may be incomplete. Mr Hall's position on this issue was much less plausible. He asserted that, by his plea, he was acknowledging only that he had back-dated the letters. He had no idea when he had written the letters, except that they were back-dated. For all he knew they could have been written at the same time or at separate times. He simply could not remember. However, he did not understand that, when he pleaded guilty, he was acknowledging that he had falsified the letters during the period identified in the opening words of the indictment (""For that he between 30 June 1998 and 9 July 1998 at Sydney ... did falsify books ... in that he created letters addressed to Mr Sid Myer dated 10 April 1998 and 21 June 1998 ...""). Mr Hall thought those words referred to the time at which he sent the memorandum to Mr Loiterton (8 July 1998), attaching the letters. He added that there was no evidence that he knew that Mr Loiterton would pass his memorandum (and the attached letters) to the auditor. 
     
      
    85 There are a number of problems with such an account. First, it is difficult to accept that Mr Hall simply has no recollection of composing or signing the letters. If, as the Crown alleged, he had created both letters at the same time, back-dating one to April and the other to June, attaching them to his memorandum to Mr Loiterton, he would surely have remembered that. Yet, whilst he doubted that that had occurred, he could not rule it out. 
     
      
    86 Secondly, it is likewise difficult to accept that Mr Hall had no appreciation of the fact that Mr Loiterton would or may pass the material to the auditor. Mr Hall was the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The auditor had asked Mr Sapier, another member of the Committee, for information on the status of the Signature sale. Mr Sapier gave an undertaking in writing that a report would be furnished. It would be surprising indeed if Mr Hall, as Chairman, was ignorant of that undertaking at the time he composed his memorandum of 8 July 1998 (Exhibit 8). I believe it likely he knew and understood that his memorandum and its attachments would be passed to the auditors. He knew that an audit was in progress. He knew that an announcement had been made to the Stock Exchange concerning profits, which presupposed the consummation of the IBYO deal. He knew the importance of the deal to the Clifford Corporation. He would have understood the interest which the auditors had in the issue. 
     
      
    87 Thirdly, it is also difficult to accept the suggestion that, when the indictment spoke of ""did falsify"" the books of the Clifford Corporation (namely the letters), that Mr Hall believed that it was referring to his action in attaching the letters, which were back-dated, to the memorandum he composed to Mr Loiterton on 8 July 1998. The indictment, by its terms, was plainly referring to the falsification of the letters themselves. It identified the span of time during which that was said to have occurred (30 June 1998 to 9 July 1998). I think it likely, on that issue, that Mr Hall understood what was being said against him. 
     
      
    88 Fourthly, it is also difficult, as the Crown has submitted, to accept that Mr Hall believed it would be a criminal offence to back-date accurate letters. It was consistent with his recollection that the letters may have been back-dated a day or a week, or by several months (in the case of the letter of 10 April 1998). How could the back-dating of a letter by a day or a week, where the letter was otherwise accurate, be imagined by Mr Hall to have been a criminal offence? 
     
      
    89 I think it likely that Mr Hall, when he pleaded guilty, was acknowledging much more than the back-dating of the letters. I think he well understood that he was admitting that the letters had themselves been manufactured between 30 June 1998 and 9 July 1998, as his secretary, Ms Norris, in her testimony, had suggested. I think it likely he knew that the letters would be passed by Mr Loiterton to the auditors. The letters, which purported to be a contemporaneous record, were designed to reassure the auditors that the Final Agreement was still within grasp, and was imminent. The letters had been fabricated for that purpose. But that is not to say, necessarily, that the events which the letters purported to record (the discussions and the agreements) were necessarily false.  
     
      
       
      Were the contents accurate? 
       
      
    90 The third issue related to the content of the letters. The indictment, referring to the letters, simply said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... which falsely stated that the dates for completion of the sale of Signature Group Australia Limited had been extended."" 
        
       
      
    91 The letters, on the other hand, spoke, in each case, of discussions between Mr Hall and My Meyer (sic), and agreement to extend the time to 30 June 1998 (in the case of the first letter) and 16 August 1998 (in the case of the second). 
     
      
    92 However, the indictment left certain questions unanswered. Was it suggested that the contents of each letter were false because there had been no discussions? Was it suggested that, although there had been discussions, there had not been agreement? Alternatively, was it suggested that such agreement as had been reached was not in the terms suggested by either letter?  
     
      
    93 Mr Hall, in submissions, said there were discussions, there was agreement, and the agreement was in the terms set out in each letter. As mentioned, he said that the evidence of Mr Myer at committal and other documents corroborated that assertion. I was not taken by Mr Hall to the evidence of Mr Myer, nor to those documents. On the other hand, the Crown did not suggest that Mr Hall's claim in respect of corroboration was wrong. 
     
      
    94 Even though the terms of the indictment suggested the falsity extended beyond simply the date, I am inclined to think that Mr Hall believed that he could, on sentence, suggest that discussions had taken place and agreement had been reached, extending the deadline to 30 June 1998 in one case and to 16 August 1998 in the other. Given the ambiguity in the terms of the indictment, it is not altogether clear which, if any, of these issues was foreclosed by the plea. 
     
      
       
      Orders. 
       
      
    95 I therefore make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Mr Hall be given leave to withdraw his plea of guilty in respect of count 1 in the indictment presented on 7 July 2004. 
       
       
      2. That the matter be placed in the Arraignment List before Justice Barr on Friday 1 April 2005.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HIDDEN J: The appellant, Anna Maria Centraco, was tried in the District Court upon an indictment containing three counts of obtaining either money or a financial advantage by deception, each of them an offence under s178BA of the Crimes Act. She was found guilty of all the counts and, in due course, was sentenced on each of them to imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of eighteen months, to be served concurrently. However, she had by then lodged an appeal against conviction, and on the day sentence was passed the trial judge released her on bail pending the outcome of the appeal. It is that appeal, against conviction only, which is before this Court. 
     
      
       
      The trial 
       
      
    2 The evidence in the trial was quite detailed, but for the purposes of the appeal a very broad outline of it will suffice. Between March 1999 and March 2001 the appellant was employed as a bookkeeper at Leo’s Plumbing Services, trading under the name “A1 Class Plumbing and Maintenance”, at Lurnea. The business was conducted by Mr Leo Vitagliano. The appellant had been a friend of his sister, Maria. At the trial that lady gave evidence under her married name, Maria Iacovella. 
     
      
    3 It was the Crown case that during the period of her employment the appellant defrauded the business of a substantial amount of money in three different ways, each of them represented by a count in the indictment. The first count related to a large number of cheques drawn on the business account which, it was alleged, she had cashed without Mr Vitagliano’s authority. The proceeds of those cheques were roughly $335,000. The second count related to eight cheques drawn on the business account which, it was alleged, she had deposited into her own account without her employer’s authority. The value of those cheques was about $80,000. The third count related to her completion of several wage schedules whereby a sum of about $38,000, to which she was not entitled, was paid into her own account. There was evidence from which it might be inferred that some, if not all, of the money defrauded was spent on gambling. 
     
      
    4 It was also the Crown case that on 29 March 2001, when the appellant’s fraudulent activity was suspected but before any police investigation had commenced, Mrs Iacovella phoned the appellant and told her that she should return any money she had taken from her brother. The appellant asked for time to rectify the problem and said that, if necessary, she would sell a property she owned in Balmain and shares which she held. Later that same day Mr Vitagliano and Mrs Iacovella went to the appellant’s residence. After further discussion, the appellant signed a statutory declaration in which she acknowledged owing “approximately $150,000” to “A1 Class Plumbing”, and undertook to pay it back over a period of four months or, if that could not be done, to sell the property and shares to which I have referred. 
     
      
    5 That statutory declaration was admitted into evidence over objection. It bears the date 29 March 2001 and appears to have been signed by the appellant and witnessed by Mrs Iacovella, who was a Justice of the Peace. (On the document she used her maiden name, M G Vitagliano.) It is this document which is the focus of the appeal. 
     
      
    6 As to the first count, the appellant’s case was that any cheques she cashed were cashed at Mr Vitagliano’s request and the proceeds were returned to him. As to the second count, her case was that she received each of the cheques from Mr Vitagliano, who asked her to deposit them into her account and then withdraw the funds and return them to him. This she did. She understood that he was going to claim these amounts as tax deductions, representing that the cheques had been drawn for the purchase of materials. As to the third count, it was her case that the relevant entries in the wage schedules were genuine mistakes, and in each case she paid the money back when the error was discovered. Generally, she denied having defrauded her employer in any way and said that her gambling was funded from legitimate sources. 
     
      
    7 As to the statutory declaration, the appellant’s case was that she wrote out the body of the document on Mr Vitagliano’s instructions much earlier than 29 March 2001. She could not recall when it was but thought that it would have been about January 2000. She said that Mr Vitagliano wanted her to prepare the document, in effect, as an acknowledgement of debt in relation to the cheques which he had given her to deposit into her own account (the subject of the second count). As she put it in evidence, “…he thought… if I give you these cheques you might do a runner on me, so just have something in writing.” However, she said that she refused to sign it and that Mrs Iacovella was not present at the time. She said that the signatures on the exhibit purporting to be hers were not in fact hers and, despite the appearance of the document, she denied that it had been formally executed at the end of March 2001 in the manner alleged by the Crown.  
     
      
    8 The evidence in the Crown case was partly direct, such as the evidence of Mr Vitagliano himself, and partly circumstantial. An example of the latter was evidence showing a correlation between some of the cash cheques the subject of the first count and deposits into a TAB account held by the appellant. In his summing up the trial judge explained the distinction between the two types of evidence and gave the jury a conventional direction about circumstantial evidence.  
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    9 Two grounds of appeal were argued by Mr Odgers SC, who appeared with Mr Dhanji for the appellant. Neither of them had appeared at the trial. The grounds are linked and it is convenient to deal with them together. The first ground challenges the admissibility of the statutory declaration to which I have referred, and the second ground complains that his Honour’s directions to the jury about that document were inadequate. 
     
      
    10 As I have said, the statutory declaration was objected to at the trial. That objection invoked the discretion conferred by s135 of the Evidence Act and the balancing exercise required by s137 of that Act, and was based upon the form of the document and the circumstances in which it was said to have been executed. It is not necessary to examine the basis of the objection or his Honour’s reasons for admitting the document. As will be seen, Mr Odgers did not challenge those reasons but argued that it should have been rejected on another basis. 
     
      
    11 In summing up his Honour explained the relevance of the statutory declaration in this way; 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown puts that statutory declaration, so it is alleged, before you, as part of the circumstantial evidence in the Crown case. You will see what the declaration says that Ms Centraco has agreed that it is her printed handwriting on it that says she owes $150,000 to Mr Vitagliano.  
        
       
       
        
        If you were to say we accept that this was given in the way that Mr Vitagliano and his sister say, that does not simply prove the Crown case on one or all of the charges. It is one piece of evidence and it is part of that circumstantial evidence that I have mentioned to you, because it does not refer to any of the items in any of the charges particularly.  
        
       
       
        
        The accused, however, has strongly attacked the Crown case on that, and the evidence of Ms Centraco was that the statutory declaration did not come into existence in the way that Mr Vitagliano and his sister say. She says that it was all part of the tax scam relating to the way in which she was putting cheques into her own account. So it seems to apply to the second charge on the indictment in that way. Although on the Crown case it is a general admission relating to each of the three charges. 
          
        
       
      
    12 In this Court Mr Odgers submitted that the document was irrelevant or, at the least, had a minimal probative value which was clearly outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant, within the meaning of s137. He pointed out that the evidence could not be related to any particular count in the indictment, noting that the amount of about $150,000 referred to in the declaration does not correspond with the amounts alleged to have been defrauded in any of the counts (although it is not far from the sum of the amounts the subject of the second and third counts, respectively $80,000 and $38,000). He also argued that there was a danger of the evidence being used impermissibly by the jury as tendency evidence, by which they might conclude the appellant’s guilt of each of the three counts simply from an admission that she had in some way obtained money improperly from her employer and recognised an obligation to return it. He noted, correctly, that the evidence had not been admitted or left to the jury as tendency evidence.  
     
      
    13 He relied, by way of analogy, upon two cases concerned with evidence said to demonstrate a consciousness of guilt, but I do not consider that either of those cases supports his argument. In R v Cook (2004) NSWCCA 52, a case in which this Court held that evidence of flight had been wrongly admitted, Simpson J at [21] – [22] reviewed the principles to be extracted from cases dealing with lies as evidence of consciousness of guilt, noting at [23] that the lie must be capable of being seen as indicating a consciousness of guilt of the specific offence with which the accused is charged. Her Honour went on to observe (at [25]) that those principles are readily adaptable to evidence of flight. However, what her Honour said at [23] must be understood in the context of the case with which she was dealing. That appellant was tried on a single count of sexual assault, and it was held that the evidence of flight should have been rejected because his flight could fairly have been attributed to a consciousness of guilt of criminality other than that charged: see her Honour’s judgment at [48]. 
     
      
    14 The other case relied upon was the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Laz [1998] 1 VR 453. That appellant had been found guilty of two counts of rape, one by digital penetration and one by penile penetration. In interviews with the police he had denied any sexual conduct with the complainant, but in evidence at the trial he admitted digital penetration, although he claimed that it had been consensual. He acknowledged that he had lied to police in the first interview, when the allegation of digital penetration had been put to him and he had denied it. The successful ground of appeal, concerning the trial judge’s directions to the jury about lies, was dealt with by the Court at 465ff. It seems that the effect of those directions was that the appellant’s denial of sexual conduct in the police interview could be used in some general and unspecified manner as evidence of consciousness of guilt. For reasons which are not presently germane, the Court held that those directions were in error. However, in passages upon which Mr Odgers relied at 466-7, the Court dealt particularly with the failure of the trial judge to distinguish between the appellant’s general denial of sexual contact and his admitted lie denying digital penetration, noting that that lie could have been relevant only to the count alleging that conduct. The case turned upon its own facts, and nothing in the judgment bears upon the question to be determined in the present case. 
     
      
    15 In exchanges with the Bench in the course of argument, several possible bases of admission of the statutory declaration were canvassed. However, in my view, the simple answer to the problem is that argued by the Crown prosecutor in this Court. In every trial of an accused on a number of counts it is necessary that each count be considered separately, but it is likely that there will be some evidence which is common to some or all of them. In the present case evidence that the appellant acknowledged indebtedness to her employer in the circumstances alleged by the Crown was relevant to all three counts. Particularly was this so given that the Crown case alleged a pattern of dishonesty over an extended period of time, the three counts merely representing the different methods employed. The evidence was available as an admission of a fact relevant to each of the counts although, of course, it could not have been determinative of any of them. Whether the amount of the acknowledged indebtedness corresponded with the amounts the subject of any one or more of the counts is not to the point. In that regard, it should be remembered that, even on the Crown case, the statutory declaration was made out before the appellant’s alleged defalcations had been formally investigated, at a time when the full extent of them might not have been known. 
     
      
    16 From the passage of the summing up quoted above it is apparent that this is precisely how the evidence was left to the jury. In particular, his Honour explained that it was relied upon by the Crown as a “general admission” in respect of the three charges, that it did not relate to any particular charge and that, of itself, it was incapable of proving any of them. Earlier in the summing up he had given an appropriate, indeed emphatic, direction about the need for separate consideration of each of the three counts. The statutory declaration was admissible for the reasons explained to the jury by his Honour and it does not appear to me that there was any danger of the jury using it impermissibly as tendency evidence. 
     
      
    17 What I have said is sufficient to dispose of the second ground of appeal concerning his Honour’s directions about the document. That ground also was founded upon the assertion that the evidence needed to be related to a particular count or counts, and that the jury needed to be warned against using it as evidence of a dishonest propensity on the part of the appellant in her dealings with her employer. For the reasons I have given, no such directions were called for and, consistently with the manner in which the evidence had been approached during the trial, none was sought. What his Honour did say about the evidence was all that was required.  
     
      
    18 In my view, neither ground of appeal is made out and the appeal should be dismissed. In that event, the appellant must be taken into custody to serve the sentences imposed upon her.

     Judgment 
      
      
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence imposed by Kinchington ADCJ at Sydney District Court. Sentence was imposed consisting of a non parole period of six months and a total term of eighteen months. Release to parole was directed on 16 March 2005. As will appear, there is some issue concerning the identity of the offence upon which the applicant was convicted.  
     
      
    2 At about 3.30 pm on 2 October 2003 the victim, a sixteen year old girl, was in an establishment called The Pavilion Arcade in George Street Sydney. She was with a group of friends and the applicant, then aged twenty, was with her sister (born 21 September 1986, whom I will refer to simply as Lisa) and a fourteen year old girl whom I will refer to as AH. Some tension apparently arose between the two groups and the victim made an insulting gesture with her finger. She then left the establishment and walked up the street to Town Hall Railway Station. The applicant and her two companions followed. The victim repeated the gesture. 
     
      
    3 Lisa ran to the victim and attacked her. She used a knife. The appellant and AH joined in the fray, although neither of them used any weapon. Eventually friends of the victim removed her from the situation and she was taken to the railway station, treated by staff there and then transported by ambulance to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. She was found to have multiple lacerations which required suture. As his Honour found, in all, she sustained fifteen lacerations to her left breast, eleven lacerations to her scalp and ten lacerations to her face. 
     
      
    4 On 15 June 2004 Lisa was arraigned before Armitage DCJ on a count in an indictment charging her with malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900. She pleaded guilty. On the same date the applicant was also arraigned before Armitage DCJ and a jury upon an indictment in identical terms. The applicant pleaded not guilty. After empanelment of the jury and some conventional directions to them by his Honour, the trial was adjourned to the following day. 
     
      
    5 Up to a relevant point the transcript of proceedings on that following day should be set out: 
     
      
       
        
        “IN THE ABSENCE OF THE JURY 
        
       
       
        
        McSPEDDEN: Thank you very much for the advantage of that adjournment. I am in a position to say that this matter is now such that it can be resolved by way of a plea to the statutory alternative to the charge on the indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        So that I would be asking that when the jury returns that the accused by rearraigned. And of course there is only the one client (sic) on the indictment, she will enter a plea, as I understand, not guilty but guilty of the statutory alternative which is malicious wounding. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: So that is what she will say, even though it is not actually on the indictment, is that right. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. Yes or she can say not guilty but guilty to malicious wounding or some suitable formulation. And that will be accepted by the Crown in full discharge of the indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Your client understands that exactly does she? 
        
       
       
        
        McSPEDDEN: She does your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: She says not guilty but guilty to malicious wounding. 
        
       
       
        
        McSPEDDEN: Yes your Honour.  
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: And that will be accepted by the Crown. 
        
       
       
        
        IN THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Ms McSpedden, as I understand it you would like your client to be rearraigned.  
        
       
       
        
        McSPEDDEN: Yes your Honour, for the indictment to be again read your Honour. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        CHARGE: For that she on 2 October 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did maliciously wound (the victim) with intent to do grievous bodily harm. 
        
       
       
        
        PLEA: Not guilty but guilty to maliciously wounding.  
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: The Crown accepts the plea of guilty to the statutory alternative in full discharge of the indictment.” 
        
       
      
    6 The reference to “statutory alternative” needs to be examined in the context of ss34 and 35 of the Crimes Act 1900: 
     
      
       
        
        “34. Where, on the trial of a person for an offence under section 33, the jury are satisfied that the accused is guilty of the wounding, or inflicting grievous bodily harm, mentioned in the indictment, but are not satisfied that the person is guilty of the intent charged therein, they may acquit the person of such intent and find the person guilty of an offence under section 35, and the person shall be liable to punishment accordingly. 
        
       
       
        
        35(1) Whosoever maliciously by any means: 
         
          
          (a) wounds any person; or 
           
          (b) inflicts grievous bodily harm upon any person, shall be liable to imprisonment for 7 years. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         (2) A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1) in the company of another person or persons. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 10 years.” 
        
       
      
    7 As the transcript above extracted shows, there was no recorded reference to the circumstance of aggravation of being in company as contemplated by s 35(2) although the facts put before the sentencing judge (Kinchington ADCJ) described the commission of the offence by the applicant in terms of she and AH joining in the attack initiated by Lisa.  
     
      
    8 In the exercise of criminal jurisdiction, endorsement on the back of the indictment is the formal record of proceedings: R v Carrion 2002 128 A Crim R 29; R v Holton [2004] NSWCCA 214. 
     
      
    9 The endorsement in relation to what occurred on 16 June 2004 before Armitage DCJ is: 
     
      
       
        
        “16 Jun 2004. Plea guilty to statutory alternative. Crown accepts in full satisfaction.” 
        
       
      
    10 It is the Crown contention that the applicant stands convicted of malicious wounding in company. There is, to say the least, ambiguity as to whether an offence contrary to s 35(1) or an aggravated offence contrary to s 35(2) was recorded by that endorsement. Had an indictment been presented charging an offence contrary to s 35(2) it would have been necessary to plead the circumstance of aggravation, namely that the offence was committed in company. The Crown does not suggest otherwise. 
     
      
    11 What the Crown does submit is that it was at all times understood by everybody, that is to say, the Judge and counsel and the applicant through her counsel, that the reference to “statutory alternative” was a reference to the alternative offence available to be charged contrary to s 35(2).  
     
      
    12 Although specification that the offence was committed “in company” was absent from the applicant’s response to arraignment, in a submission referring to a sentence imposed upon AH in the Children’s Court her counsel said: 
     
      
       
        
        “McSPEDDEN: Your Honour I wasn’t about to suggest that your Honour have regard to that for parity but to indicate to your Honour the community service I certainly wouldn’t say that she should receive 75 hours of community service but she is an older person, there are differences but the charge was the same, malicious wounding. There is the subsection 2 effect and that is because it is in company the maximum goes from seven years to ten years maximum and certainly the legislator (sic) contemplates full time custody. In the circumstances of this case your Honour without it going to the subjective matters but looking at the objective facts, in my respectful submission this would not be a matter where your Honour would find that the offence was anywhere near the higher end of the scale of seriousness for malicious wounding, in fact I would be frankly submitting it is at the lower end of the scale.” 
        
       
      
    13 Later his Honour asked about prescribed maximum penalty and was informed by counsel for Lisa that it was “twenty five years for the one my client” and referring to Katherine (as the applicant was at times called) the Crown Prosecutor said, “ten”. 
     
      
    14 It seems clear that it is correct that all present at the first instance hearing proceeded on the basis that the “statutory alternative” referred to s 35(2). There was no dispute that the applicant was in fact in company at the time of offending. 
     
      
    15 In his remarks on sentence Kinchington ADCJ recapitulated that “the maximum penalty for the offence of malicious wounding is ten years imprisonment”. Throughout his remarks whenever referring to the offence his Honour expressed it simply as “malicious wounding” without adding reference to the circumstance of aggravation that the offence was committed in company. The Crown submits that his expression should simply be treated as a “shorthand” way of expressing the aggravated form of offence. 
     
      
    16 Before this Court is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence. There has been no proceeding either in the District Court or here seeking to remove any ambiguity from the endorsement on the back of the indictment. In its present state, I am of opinion that the ambiguity has to be resolved in favour of the applicant in that the endorsement records only the conviction of the applicant of malicious wounding simpliciter which is in accord with her response to rearraignment which I repeat was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Not guilty but guilty to maliciously wounding”. 
        
       
      
    17 If a sentencing judge was required to impose sentence for an offence of malicious wounding contrary to s 35(1), there would be an inhibition upon treating a circumstance that the offence was committed in company because to do so would amount to sentencing for the more serious offence specified in s 35(2): The Queen v De Simoni 1981 147 CLR 383. That precaution will need to be borne in mind when the sentence is examined by this Court.  
     
      
    18 Despite the apparent common acceptance by those at first instance that what was involved was an offence contrary to s 35(2) carrying a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment, I consider that this court is obliged to examine the matter in accordance with the formal record endorsed on the indictment and that that endorsement must be construed to record a conviction in terms of the applicant’s plea to the arraignment and the Crown’s acceptance of it. That plea did not acknowledge the circumstance of aggravation. 
     
      
    19 On that aspect, the issue can be stated as, whether the sentence imposed is excessive for a conviction of malicious wounding contrary to s 35(1). Whether the sentence is excessive needs to be assessed in the light of the facts and there is no dispute that the applicant’s participation in the offence in fact took place while she was in the company of the other two females but what is forbidden by authority is taking the circumstance that she was so in company as a feature elevating the seriousness of her offence. 
     
      
    20 There is a discrete matter, however, raised by the applicant. She contends that she has a justifiable sense of grievance by reason of contrast between the sentence received by her and that received by her co-offender AH. Lisa, who pleaded guilty to an offence with an intentional element, was sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of five years and a total term of seven and half years. As mentioned above, the Children’s Court imposed a sentence of 75 hours community service upon AH.  
     
      
    21 The learned sentencing judge was conscious of how AH had been dealt with in the Children’s Court. He noted in his remarks on sentence that she was dealt with on “a charge of malicious wounding”. He expressed some views about the desirability of all co-offenders, if practicable, being dealt with in the same court, but I do not perceive that those comments (which his Honour was entitled to express) have intruded in the assessment of sentence. There is no indication that they did. 
     
      
    22 However, his Honour did observe that “a sentence of 75 hours community service, to my mind, is completely inadequate, and almost laughable if this were not a serious occasion”. To a submission that there should be parity between the applicant and AH he stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “To my mind the sentence imposed in the Children’s Court was so inadequate that the concept(s) of parity really do not apply to your situation.” 
        
       
      
    23 It might be noted that his Honour in referring to the submission said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The other young girl (AH) who was dealt with on a similar charge to that which you face in these proceedings” 
        
       
       
      and when referring to AH’s offence he simply described it as “malicious wounding”. Nevertheless the transcript of the Children’s Court proceedings was produced and it is headed “CHARGE Maliciously Wound in Company”. That transcript is the only documentation from the Children’s Court made available to this Court. 
       
      
    24 It was argued on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge had fallen into error in treating the sentence imposed on AH in the Children’s Court as “irrelevant” to any question of parity. Whether that submission accurately analyses his Honour’s approach depends upon what meaning is attributed to his expressions which I have set out above. To say that something does not apply is not necessarily the same thing as saying that it is irrelevant. A sentence received in the Children’s Court is not irrelevant to consideration of the situation of an adult co-offender: R v Govinden 1999 106 A Crim R 314; R v Colgan [1999] NSWCCA 292. Once relevance is accepted, it remains however to determine what effect comparison should produce in a given case. In R v Diamond CCA unreported 18 February 1993 Hunt CJ at CL (Newman J agreeing) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…. There is, in my view, a stage at which the inadequacy of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender is so grave that the sense of grievance engendered can no longer be regarded as a legitimate one”. 
        
       
      
    25 In this instance his Honour’s expressions “completely inadequate, and almost laughable” and “do not apply” can, and in my view should, be understood as denying the availability of a sense of grievance on the part of the applicant concerning the sentence received by her as compared to AH which can be classified as justifiable. 
     
      
    26 It was acknowledged in written submissions that “no complaint is made concerning his Honour’s recitation of the facts”. There was however a dispute at the hearing of the appeal concerning a Crown submission that the applicant and AH restrained the victim whilst Lisa was stabbing her. The events of the incident were, to an extent, recorded on a closed circuit television security camera and the tape therefrom was an exhibit in the proceedings. The parties invited viewing of the video and it was shown at the hearing and, as further invited, I have since repeated that viewing. 
     
      
    27 As is common with such surveillance equipment the recording is not continuous but frames are exposed and images captured at short intervals. Counsel contested whether the applicant can be seen restraining the victim as stated but it was not disputed that she joined in what was variously termed as “wrestling” or “struggling” (with the victim). I do not think that it is necessary to go beyond his Honour’s unchallenged findings that the applicant was the last to join in the assault but, when she did so, she played a meaningful part therein. He also accepted that her initial entry was to protect her sister “however you did more than protect her, you helped her in the assault upon this young girl by holding her as she was assaulted by your sister”. The assault was perpetrated by use of the knife. 
     
      
    28 The Crown Prosecutor submitted that his Honour erroneously understood the Crown to concede that of the three females charged, the culpability of the applicant was the least and that the Crown’s stance was that the culpability of the applicant and AH was equal.  
     
      
    29 Whether derived in whole or in part from a misapprehension as to Crown concession, I see no reason to approach the matter other than upon his Honour’s estimate that the least culpability rested on the applicant. It appears that the three females in the applicant’s group were sharing a handbag or carry bag and that it was AH who drew Lisa’s attention to the availability of a knife therein. That circumstance would support the conclusion concerning the applicant’s lesser responsibility. 
     
      
    30 At the sentence hearing, the Crown Prosecutor did say that fulltime custody was not the only sentencing option but there is no error in his Honour making a conclusion for himself and I see none in the conclusion that a fulltime custodial sentence ought be imposed in these circumstances. 
     
      
    31 Intervention by this Court requires a conclusion that a more lenient sentence than that imposed at first instance is warranted, s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; R v Cocking [1999] NSWCCA 311; R v Astill No 2 1992 62 A Crim R 289. 
     
      
    32 Giving full weight to subjective matters in favour of the applicant in amelioration of the objective seriousness of her offence, viewing it as contrary to s 35(1) and gauging it against a prescribed statutory maximum of seven years imprisonment, I do not consider that any lesser sentence than imprisonment consisting of six months non parole period and eighteen months total term was warranted.  
     
      
    33 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J:  This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Latham DCJ in the District Court at Sydney.  
     
      
    2 On 28 May 2003 the applicant was arraigned before her Honour upon an indictment of fifteen counts, all of which, save one, related to offences in which a young woman, CM, was nominated as the victim. The other count nominated her infant son ZM as victim. It is not presently necessary to detail the various counts. After arraignment a voir dire hearing was undertaken in connection with the Crown intention to adduce tendency or coincidence evidence from two women, whom I will refer to as JR and NF. On 2 June her Honour ruled that the evidence of those witnesses would, in substance, be admitted. 
     
      
    3 A trial before the judge and a jury commenced on 3 June. It proceeded until 17 June at which point it was indicated by the Crown Prosecutor that the calling of JR and NF was imminent. The following day counsel for the applicant sought that she be re-arraigned on a new indictment charging a single count pursuant to the now replaced s90A of the Crimes Act 1900 viz: 
     
      
       
        
        “For that she between 7 January 1995 and 31 March 1998, at Leppington in the State of New South Wales, did detain with intent to hold CM for advantage to herself.” 
        
       
      
    4 The section provided a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment unless it be proved that the victim was liberated without sustaining substantial injury in which event it would be reduced to fourteen years imprisonment. Her Honour found the proviso unproved and the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for thirteen years with a non parole period of nine years. 
     
      
    5 Two grounds were argued in support of the application - the first asserted that the sentence was manifestly excessive and the second, that her Honour erred in finding “the risk of re-offending is sufficient to outweigh the subjective features”. 
     
      
    6 With the exception of that stated in the second ground, there was no challenge to any finding made by the learned sentencing judge. Her remarks on sentence were detailed and exhibited careful analysis and reasons for her conclusions. Repetition of all those unchallenged findings need not be undertaken and they can be regarded as endorsed and incorporated herein. It is appropriate however to draw from the remarks a synopsis of the applicant’s criminal conduct. 
     
      
    7 CM was living at Riverstone in a house previously occupied by the applicant’s son. She was twenty years of age and with her resided her son then aged five months. In January 1995 the applicant brought her to live on her property in Leppington. Initially CM and her son resided in a bedroom and essentially kept to themselves. The applicant was absent for some weeks in February and March. After her return she began to assault and abuse CM almost on a daily basis. She kicked, punched and slapped her. CM was required to cook and maintain the household and deliver to the applicant whatever money she had. She was not paid for her services. The applicant cut CM’s hair and burned her clothing, photographs, identification documents and other personal belongings.  
     
      
    8 On occasions she was permitted to use the telephone but her calls were monitored by the applicant. In the course of time she was required to sleep on the floor next to the applicant’s bed. 
     
      
    9 The applicant threatened CM with violence should she attempt to leave and she inhibited physical contact by CM with her son. Not only did the applicant herself assault CM but she did so by means of command which was obeyed by her Rottweiler dog. 
     
      
    10 This virtual enslavement of CM continued over years. Specific cruelties included setting fire to a dress then being worn by CM which caused burns to her lower legs; pouring a pan of boiling water over her head causing burns to her head and upper shoulders; forcing CM to submit to having tattoos on her arms and taking her to a brothel conducted by an acquaintance of the applicant where she was told to make herself available for sexual intercourse with a client whose payment for this was taken by the applicant.  
     
      
    11 The situation terminated on 31 March 1998 when CM ran from the applicant’s house under cover of darkness and sought assistance from a neighbour who took her to the city where she boarded a bus and fled to South Australia. When she arrived there CM went to South Australian police and sought their assistance principally to retrieve her son from the applicant. This was eventually achieved.  
     
      
    12 As her Honour remarked on several occasions the tale of horror which is only sketched in the foregoing observations would strain credulity in some respects and it was for that reason that the intended evidence of JR and NF assumed such importance in the Crown case.  
     
      
    13 Each of these women had been victims of discrete offences earlier committed by the applicant and although the offences were different it was correct, as the Crown submitted in the appeal, that the offences could be regarded as being in the same genre. CM, JR and NF were unknown to each other. Although the penalties imposed in respect of offences concerning JR and NF appear surprisingly lenient, it is significant that her Honour made findings of the facts concerning the applicant’s crimes against those women, and again, those findings are not the subject of challenge. 
     
      
    14 In 1979 JR came to live at the applicant’s premises following response to a newspaper ad seeking a person to work as nanny/housekeeper/farmhand. A promised wage was not forthcoming and in fact JR continued to receive unemployment benefits which she was required to sign over to the applicant. JR was beaten and struck and lived in constant fear of the applicant. In addition to physical assaults, JR was forced by the applicant to have sexual intercourse with a number of males, including the local baker, who received JR’s “sexual services” as part payment for bread delivered to the applicant’s household. 
     
      
    15 An aspect of particular cruelty was the forced feeding of repulsive mixed items which JR was made to re-ingest when she regurgitated the mixture. As later happened with CM, JR’s hair was cut and her clothing was burned. She was also the victim of dog attacks consequent upon commands by the applicant.  
     
      
    16 The servitude of JR extended for about six months when she took the opportunity to hide in a paddock at night having been told to put out the garbage and she was able to make her way into a neighbouring farm where she sought help. This was forthcoming and she was later able to report (with her father) to police. 
     
      
    17 On 4 June 1980 the applicant was convicted on a charge of assault by a magistrate at Camden who imposed a fine of $500. Her Honour noted that the available records relating to this conviction were devoid of detail and it is therefore not known upon what facts the magistrate assessed this penalty but, as I have said, the findings made by her Honour were not attacked. 
     
      
    18 In July 1994 NF, who was acquainted with the applicant’s son, moved into the applicant’s premises, following some family discord. Initially NF had casual employment but after this was lost she commenced housekeeping for the applicant. By September 1994 the applicant had begun hitting NF and subjecting to her verbal abuse. Her hair was shaved. She was threatened with violence if she attempted to leave. Like CM she was required to sleep on the floor in the applicant’s room. NF was also the victim of attack by a Rottweiler dog following command of the applicant.  
     
      
    19 In December 1994 NF was taken out in a car, which was occupied by the applicant and another person but the car had mechanical trouble when it was in Camden. NF was sent to a shop to borrow a screwdriver. She took the opportunity to flee and obtained a lift to Campbelltown where she made contact with a person whom she knew and sought help. She was taken to Campbelltown Police Station and a statement was later taken from her.  
     
      
    20 Police arrested and charged the applicant in respect to the treatment of NF on 14 December 1994 but she remained on bail until she was dealt with on 3 March 1999 when she pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping and one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. On each of these charges the applicant was released upon entering recognizance to be of good behaviour for a period of two years. As the judge commented, an appalling delay in the disposition of the matter no doubt played some part in the ultimate assessment of penalty. It can be observed that the conduct regarding CM commenced within weeks of the applicant being charged in connection with her treatment of NF and she was at conditional liberty on bail during the whole of the time she was criminally detaining CM.  
     
      
    21 The principal thrust of submissions on behalf of the applicant in relation to the first ground was posited on the observation that collected statistics from the Judicial Commission of 113 cases of offenders convicted under s 90A demonstrated that this applicant received the highest total sentence and the highest non parole period.  
     
      
    22 Senior counsel for the applicant acknowledged the limited utility of statistics but drew attention to the circumstance that, even for the very late plea of guilty, her Honour stated that she gave a benefit of a discount of 12 percent and it follows that starting point of head sentence must have been in the order of fifteen years imprisonment. I would not quarrel with that arithmetic. 
     
      
    23 A schedule of some particular cases was provided to the Court. On its face this schedule had been extracted from a database and contained the caution that it was intended to be used as a guide and “individual cases should be read if they are to be relied upon”. Counsel directed particular attention to the cases of Knight 2002 123 A Crim R 377 and Angeles [2001] NSWCCA 515. 
     
      
    24 The short statement of facts in relation to Knight read: 
     
      
       
        
        “Being investigated for fraud – approached by female police officer when leaving a bank and asked to answer several questions – took hold of police officer and produced knife – officer cut on back of neck – held knife in to front of officer’s throat, threatening to kill her – left bank with officer and continued down road – released a short distance later. Bipolar disorder”. 
        
       
      
    25 The short statement of facts in relation to Angeles read: 
     
      
       
        
        “With co-offenders planned to kidnap wealthy student and hold him for $8 million. Angeles – involved over several weeks before offence – acted as driver – waited in car while abduction took place – present and assisted when complainant bound and moved to another location six days later – unaware of the amount of ransom demand.” 
        
       
      
    26 Both of those offenders received sentences considerably less than the applicant but as can readily be seen their actions were in no way comparable to those of the applicant. Neither at first instance nor in this Court has research revealed any case where a young woman had been kept in what amounted to slavery for a period of over three years. The seriousness of using the infant as a lever to enforce that slavery needs no emphasis.  
     
      
    27 The applicant appeared for sentence as a woman of fifty nine years with some health problems. Her Honour examined the material in relation to the applicant’s health and noted that in 1997 a Dr Ban had expressed the opinion that the applicant “had evidence of multiple potentially treatable medical conditions which were possibly clouded and exaggerated by a possible mental condition.” Her Honour concluded that much the same situation pertained at the time of sentence and no error is demonstrated. Her Honour also made reference to the psychiatric evidence from Doctors Skinner and Nielssen, which will be referred to when dealing with the second ground. I have mentioned the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty but her Honour found that the applicant had not thereby or otherwise demonstrated any contrition and she considered that the applicant lacked any insight into her offence. The structure of the sentence departed from the statutory proportion between head sentence and non parole period to the advantage of the applicant by a period of nine months.  
     
      
    28 It was acknowledged on behalf of the applicant that the facts of the offence were “unusual” but such an expression does not convey the intrinsic evil of circumstances where there was demonstrated by the applicant a callous and barbaric disregard for both the victim and her child. I do not consider the sentence has been shown to be manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    29 In support of ground 2 counsel pointed to her Honour’s remarks where she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is appropriate, therefore, to weigh the risk of dangerousness against those subjective features of the (applicant) which might otherwise call for a reduction in the penalty commensurate with the offence.” 
        
       
      
    30 Following these remarks her Honour considered the subjective circumstances of the applicant and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the result I have determined that the risk of re-offending is sufficient to outweigh the subjective features to which I have referred.” 
        
       
      
    31 The applicant had declined to be interviewed by Dr Skinner but the doctor was given access to relevant transcripts, statements and material from earlier proceedings involving the applicant. Dr Skinner diagnosed the applicant as having a severe personality disorder with anti-social and narcissistic traits. She assessed the applicant as a considerable risk to others for the foreseeable future. The applicant had acquired a report from Dr Nielssen but as her Honour noted he did not have information concerning JR and NF until after he had commenced giving evidence in the sentencing proceedings. His written report, prior to that information being available included: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is difficult to assess the risk of (the applicant) committing further similar offences, as the current charges appear to have arisen from the specific circumstances of her relationship with CM who may have been particularly vulnerable to being mistreated by (the applicant).” 
        
       
      
    32 After being apprised of the previous conduct of the applicant towards JR and NF he acknowledged: 
     
      
       
        
        “The material does show a pretty distinct pattern over a long period of time that would increase my perception of risk, particularly the way in which young people came to (the applicant’s) house.” 
        
       
      
    33 Her Honour concluded that the applicant did represent a future risk to vulnerable members of the community although she accepted that her capacity to physically assault and intimidate through threats of violence was likely to diminish with age. Having made these findings and those observations she turned to the matters to which I have already made reference. Counsel drew attention to the observation that “the principle of proportionality is now firmly established in this country”: Veen v The Queen (No 2) 1987-8 164 CLR 465 @ 472. It is also clear that the common law does not sanction preventive detention: Chester v The Queen 1988 165 CLR 611.  
     
      
    34 It is of course no novel proposition that not all principles of sentencing point in the same direction. The protection of society is a factor high in the aims of sentencing but extending a sentence for that purpose so that it amounts to preventive detention is forbidden.  
     
      
    35 I do not interpret her Honour’s remarks quoted as revealing that her assessment is tainted by misapplication of the latter concept or otherwise. 
     
      
    36 In the absence of demonstrated error, the ultimate implicit question is whether the assessment lies outside the bounds of the sound exercise of discretion. In my opinion her Honour’s assessment was well within those bounds.  
     
      
    37 I propose that leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but that appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
     1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Nicholson DCJ in the Sydney District Court.  
     
      
    2 The applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment containing two counts. The first count charged supply of the prohibited drug cocaine, his possession of 28 grams exceeding the traffickable quantity and thus attracting the statutory provisions relating to deemed supply. That offence occurred on 7 September 2001. 
     
      
    3 The second count charged supply of a prohibited drug, again cocaine, in not less than the large commercial quantity. That offence was alleged to have occurred between 5 and 8 January 2001 and was based upon an agreement to supply the drug evidenced by arrangements made by the applicant in various telephone calls, the content of which was intercepted by police. There was no actual supply save a small amount described as a “sample”. 
     
      
    4 His Honour was also asked to take into account, pursuant to the Form 1 procedure, seven further offences which can shortly be described as custody of a knife in a public place; goods in custody (cash $1,180); supply prohibited drug (cocaine); knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug (28.4 grams of cocaine); supply prohibited drug (0.7 grams of cocaine); supply prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) and supply prohibited drug (cannabis leaf). 
     
      
    5 On the first count his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for two years and three months commencing on 7 September 2001 and expiring on 6 December 2003 and, on the second count, taking the Form 1 matters into account, imprisonment for a term of six years commencing on 7 December 2003 with a non-parole period of two years and three months commencing on that date and expiring on 6 March 2006. The last mentioned date is the earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for consideration of parole. 
     
      
    6 Thus, the overall effective sentence can be described as eight years three months imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years six months. In addition to possible fines, the maximum prescribed penalties for the offences charged were, in relation to the first count, 15 years imprisonment and, for the second, imprisonment for life. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was one of a number of offenders identified as a result of an extensive police operation investigating the supply of prohibited drugs. It was said by counsel that some 40 offenders were involved. It appears that attention was directed to the applicant as a result of his contact details being listed in the mobile telephone directory of a man arrested in connection with the purchase of amphetamines. Warrants were obtained to intercept telephone services operated by the applicant. 
     
      
    8 Although in receipt of unemployment benefits he was found to be in possession of four mobile phones, three of which were the subject of intercept warrants. The applicant was heard to converse using terms which could readily be interpreted as a somewhat ineffectual code for drugs. These included expressions such as “small one, eight ball, aus, key, the nose stuff, bolivian, paperwork and charlie”. 
     
      
    9 At the first instance hearing the applicant disputed certain facts, principal among which was an assertion that he could not in fact have supplied one kilogram of cocaine, which was the large commercial quantity relative to the second count. The findings of Nicholson DCJ were that in relation to the first count the applicant was making a delivery of the cocaine in his pocket to a single purchaser or had the drugs in his possession ready to respond to a request for that amount of 28 grams. It was noted that 28 grams is about equivalent to an ounce which is a common quantity in which the drug is traded. 
     
      
    10 On the second count his Honour found that the applicant intended, provided he could “lure” the business, to broker a deal whereby he supplied $130,000 worth of cocaine, that is one kilogram thereof, with the intention of gaining for himself what he described as a brokerage. 
     
      
    11 His Honour also made important findings in relation to the seriousness of the facts revealed by matters on the Form 1. The first two matters were incidents arising out of the applicant’s arrest on 7 September 2001. The third offence was supply of cocaine between 10 August and 7 September, evidenced by some 22 intercepted telephone calls, arising out of which his Honour found that the applicant was dealing with at least nine persons offering to supply varying quantities of cocaine. He was satisfied that about 80 percent of the quantity of 107 grams was actually supplied for a sale price exceeding $8,000. 
     
      
    12 The fourth matter was a supply of 28 grams (or one ounce) between 5 and 9 July 2001. The purchaser was identified as a man known as Abed and his Honour estimated the purchase price as between $3,500 and $4,000. The fifth matter concerned the supply of 0.7 grams of cocaine sold for $200 on 4 September. His Honour considered this may have been a single deal or “sample or tester”. 
     
      
    13 The sixth matter related to events between 31 July and 29 August and involved the supply of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. His Honour found that there were at least a number of consummated deals at a price each in the order of $6,000. 
     
      
    14 The seventh matter on the Form 1 was again evidenced by the product of telephone intercepts and demonstrated supply of substantial quantities of cannabis which his Honour found ultimately involved a total sale price of something in the region of $24,000. 
     
      
    15 The submissions in support of the application have been presented on four grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) His Honour erred with respect to his assessment of the objective criminality in relation to the second count. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) His Honour erred in that the sentences should not have been wholly accumulated. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) This ground is no longer pressed. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) That the sentences imposed were, in all the circumstances manifestly excessive, and 
        
       
       
        
        (e) That the sentences imposed were, in all the circumstances, disproportionate to the sentences imposed upon co-offenders particularly with respect to the associated matters before his Honour and of James Manassa and Fernando Riggio sentenced after this offender.” 
        
       
      
    16 In relation to the first ground, it can scarcely be disputed that the offences were objectively serious. The thrust of the applicant’s submission is that a schedule of selected decisions relating to the commercial supply of cocaine, which were tendered to the sentencing judge, are said to demonstrate that a starting point of eight years imprisonment (prior to discount for plea) where there was no actual transaction, was outside the range indicated by what were described in submissions as “the authorities”. That description is itself demonstrative of misconception. 
     
      
    17 Individual cases do not provide authority. Every sentence results from an exercise of discretion. Not only did the second count in the indictment carry a potential penalty of life imprisonment but so also did the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine which was taken into account on the Form 1. 
     
      
    18 It is a settled principle that the sentence for the foundational offence (in this case the second count) should not be only slightly increased if the offences to be taken into account on the Form 1 are serious in their own right: R v Barton [2001] NSWCCA 63; R v Perese (2001) 126 A Crim R 508; Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146. A “Form 1 offence” carrying a prescribed maximum of life imprisonment must, prima facie, lie in the upper limits of any scale of seriousness. 
     
      
    19 His Honour noted that it was the Crown case that this applicant is at the upper end of drug suppliers in the Sydney Metropolitan Region and whilst he did not articulate his findings in terms of that submission, his findings obviously support the proposition that the applicant was a significant participant in criminal activity of drug trafficking nature in this city. 
     
      
    20 His Honour made no error in assessing the objective criminality of the applicant’s offence. He was expressly aware that, in relation to the second count, actual supply did not take place but, as I have indicated, he was satisfied of the intention to broker a deal of that quantity. 
     
      
    21 The second ground complains of the accumulation of the sentences. The criminal activity manifested in the first and second counts were separated in time by some eight months. Apart from involving the same drug (cocaine) there is no element of commonality in the behaviour constituting the two offences. Although it might be said that the applicant’s activity was in a sense the one business of attempting to earn money from illegal drug trafficking, I would uphold the Crown’s submission that the two offences cannot properly be characterised as part of the same criminal transaction. 
     
      
    22 It was his Honour’s duty to sentence the applicant appropriately for each offence and thereafter determine whether they should be served concurrently or cumulatively in order to arrive at an appropriate total sentence reflecting his criminality: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. 
     
      
    23 Whilst not directly raised in relation to argument in support of the ground, it can be mentioned that the applicant was not unfamiliar with the likely consequences of committing crime. Between February 1991 and February 1994 the applicant served the minimum term of a sentence imposed upon him for the crime of manslaughter. Although this crime is of a different nature from drug trafficking, the record of conviction operates to disentitle the applicant from leniency that might be given to a person who had no prior conviction. 
     
      
    24 Given the ultimate effective result of his Honour’s imposition and again noting that two of the offences for which the applicant was appearing for sentence (one taken into account on the Form 1) carried prescribed maximum sentences of life imprisonment, his Honour’s ultimate assessment in terms of totality of an effective sentence of eight years three months with a non-parole period of four years six months is such as I would describe as lenient. 
     
      
    25 For the reasons expressed above, the sentences should not be categorised as manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    26 The final ground seeks to raise matters of asserted parity. A number of offenders were dealt with for various offences arising out of the police operation. That there were links between various participants and that they were detected as a result of the same investigation, does not create a parity between the offenders, nor does that circumstance of itself give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance if different sentences are imposed. 
     
      
    27 Nicholson DCJ noted that two offenders who were brothers, Raymond and Joseph Frangieh, had been dealt with by Tupman DCJ. He found no question of parity (with this applicant) arose. He made the same finding in relation to another offender, Ahmed Al-Remmahi, who appeared upon different charges and who was given a very significant discount for assistance to authority. Another offender, Riggio, was dealt with for five offences, none of which involved a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. In a complexity of sentences he received a non-parole period of effectively four years. 
     
      
    28 Counsel made specific reference to another offender, Manassa (in whose telephone the details of contact with the applicant were found by the police) who was dealt with in February 2004 by Hosking DCJ. Manassa was dealt with for a single offence of supplying methylamphetamine on three or more occasions (ongoing supply) and for non drug related offences of dishonesty. Under the Form 1 procedure there was another matter of supplying a drug. The outcome of the proceedings against him were that he was placed upon a good behaviour bond and pursuant to the suspended sentence procedure he received an imposition.  
     
      
    29 Particular attention was directed by counsel to the two last mentioned offenders. Today we have been provided with the remarks on sentence for both Riggio and Manassa. It might be noted that Manassa had been kept in custody for an extended period prior to being sentenced by Hosking DCJ and prior to his having entered bail.  
     
      
    30 It was conceded by counsel for the applicant that it cannot be put that he has available a “strict parity claim” but it was submitted that the assessment of objective criminality and disproportionate treatment of “co-offenders”, having regard to their relative positions “in the network”, demonstrated error on the part of his Honour. 
     
      
    31 Intervention by this Court to vary sentences by reason of lack of parity emerges when there is a justifiable sense of grievance engendered by the harshness with which one co-offender is treated when compared with another. The principles do not extend to application over numerous people who, in various ways, have participated in some criminal activity. It is basic to the notion of parity that those whose sentences are being compared are co-offenders in their offence whose circumstances attract broad equality of treatment for reasons of fairness. The different roles played by participants in drug dealing almost inevitably lead to discrimination in the assessment of the objective seriousness of what each has done and, of course, in making an ultimate assessment the subjective factors appropriate to be taken into account for each individual offender must play a part.  
     
      
    32 Insofar as the submission implies by use of the expression “strict parity claim” that there is some broader basis for application of “parity” than that approved by authority, I would reject the submission: Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606; Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295. This ground is not made out. 
     
      
    33 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    34 BELL J: I agree with the orders proposed by the Presiding Judge for the reasons that his Honour gives. 
     
      
    35 BUDDIN J: I also agree. 
     
      
    36 GROVE J: The orders of the Court therefore will be, leave to appeal against sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

    1 BRYSON JA: I agree with Barr J.  
     
      
    2 BARR J: This is an appeal against conviction. The appellant was tried by a jury in the District Court and found guilty of using an offensive weapon to prevent police investigation, contrary to s33B(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    3 There is a single ground of appeal, namely that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence as to the appellant’s possession of a gun.  
     
      
    4 At 9:55pm on Monday 1 July 2002 two police officers, Constable Gewargis and Senior Constable Rahme, were patrolling Smithfield in a police vehicle. They came to a street next to Rosford Reserve. That was an area which Constable Gewargis knew was used for criminal activity, particularly for dealing in drugs. The officers came upon two Mercedes motor vehicles. One was parked by the kerb and the other, no more than twenty metres from it, was parked at right angles to it in a drive at the entrance to the reserve. The first vehicle was gold and the second blue. Each car contained a driver and three other occupants. Constable Gewargis spoke to the driver of the gold car. The driver told him that the occupants of the cars were together. As they spoke, the blue car sped away. The officers followed it and stopped it. Constable Gewargis spoke to the driver, Mr Thadanabath. Mr Thadanabath told him that he did not know the occupants of the gold car. Senior Constable Rahme inquired about the registration of the gold car and the status of Mr Thadanabath’s driving licence. Apparently those records were in order, but the officers also received over the police radio a warning that Mr Thadanabath might carry a pistol and that he was recorded as having engaged in gang and drug activity and in possessing firearms. Constable Gewargis directed the driver and the other occupants to get out of the car and stand on the footpath. They did so. Constable Rahme asked them for identification. The appellant handed him his driving licence. Constable Gewargis told Mr Thadanabath that he intended to search the car. He asked whether there was anything in it that should not be there, guns or drugs and Mr Thadanabath said that there were not. So did the appellant. The officers began searching. Constable Gewargis found a crowbar on the floor behind the driver’s seat. Mr Thadanabath said that he had been doing some work with it. The officer went to the other rear door and began searching the floor and seat. He found a fifty-dollar note. All the occupants denied knowing whose it was. Constable Gewargis stood in front of the appellant and asked him if he had anything on him that he ought not to have. The appellant took a few steps back and said “nay”. The officer directed him to turn around and, when asked why, said that he was going to search him. He tried putting his left hand onto the appellant’s back pockets but the appellant kept twisting away, preventing him from doing so. The officer thought that he was trying to hide something. He asked whether he had something on him and the appellant said “no”. The officer ran his hand down the appellant’s back and felt something hard underneath the jacket. He took hold of his right shoulder and turned him round. He lifted the back of the jacket and saw a black pistol taped to the appellant’s back. He called out to Senior Constable Rahme. The appellant took hold of the pistol in his right hand, turned and pointed it at Constable Gewargis’ stomach. The officer took hold of his right wrist with both hands and tried to wrest the pistol from his grasp. The struggle went on for some time and the appellant was subdued when the officers sprayed him with capsicum spray and struck him with a baton.  
     
      
    5 Evidence of these matters was taken before the jury, but defence counsel applied for it to be withdrawn. The submission was that the evidence was unlawfully obtained and that the trial judge ought not, in the exercise of his discretion, ought to allow it to remain before the jury. The trial judge, O’Reilly QC DCJ, gave a short judgment stating that he found no breach on the part of the police and that in any event the evidence would be admitted within the exercise of the discretion under s138 Evidence Act. On the following day his Honour gave more extensive reasons.  
     
      
    6 The first question that arises on appeal is whether there was evidence upon which his Honour could properly find that the evidence was lawfully obtained.  
     
      
    7 Constable Gewargis agreed in evidence that when he required the appellant and the other occupants of the car to alight and stand on the footpath he was arresting them. Counsel submitted at trial and on appeal that the officer had no proper cause to make that arrest.  
     
      
    8 Section 352 Crimes Act sets out circumstances in which a constable may apprehend a person without warrant. Relevantly, the section provides as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        352 
          
        Person in act of committing or having committed an offence 
          
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (1) Any constable or other person may without warrant apprehend,  
         
         
          
          (a) any person in the act of committing, or immediately after having committed, an offence punishable, whether by indictment, or on summary conviction, under any Act,  
           
          (b) any person who has committed a serious indictable offence for which the person has not been tried,  
           
          and take the person, and any property found upon the person, before an authorised Justice to be dealt with according to law.  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) Any constable may without warrant apprehend,  
         
          
          (a) any person whom the constable, with reasonable cause, suspects of having committed any such offence,  
           
          (b) any person lying, or loitering, in any highway, yard, or other place during the night, whom the constable, with reasonable cause, suspects of being about to commit any serious indictable offence,  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        and take the person, and any property found upon the person, before an authorised Justice to be dealt with according to law.  
        
       
      
    9 A serious indictable offence is an indictable offence that is punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of five years or more.  
     
      
    10 The same Act confers a power to detain and search suspects. Section 357E is as follows-  
     
      
       
        
        357E 
          
        Police may stop and search persons and vehicles 
          
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A member of the police force may stop, search and detain:  
         
         
          
          (a) any person whom he or she reasonably suspects of having or conveying any thing stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained or any thing used or intended to be used in the commission of an indictable offence, or  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) any vehicle in which he or she reasonably suspects there is any thing stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained or any thing used or intended to be used in the commission of an indictable offence.  
          
         
        
       
      
    11 The meaning of the term “reasonably suspects” which, I think, is not materially different from the expression “with reasonable cause suspects” as used in s352, was considered in R v Rondo (2001) 126 A Crim R 562. The Court of Criminal Appeal made the following statement -  
     
      
       
        
        (a) A reasonable suspicion involves less than a reasonable belief but more than a possibility. There must be something which would create in the mind of a reasonable person an apprehension or fear of one of the state of affairs covered by s357E. A reason to suspect that a fact exists is more than a reason to consider or look into the possibility of its existence. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Reasonable suspicion is not arbitrary. Some factual basis for the suspicion must be shown. A suspicion may be based on hearsay material or materials which may be inadmissible in evidence. The materials must have some probative value.  
        
       
       
        
        (c) What is important is the information in the mind of the police officer stopping the person or the vehicle or making the arrest at the time he did so. Having ascertained that information the question is whether that information afforded reasonable grounds for the suspicion which the police officer formed. In answering that question regard must be had to the source of the information and its content, seen in the light of the whole of the surrounding circumstances.  
        
       
      
    12 Constable Gewargis undoubtedly suspected that the occupants of the cars were engaged in some criminal activity. This evidence was adduced. The officer was being asked about the time when he first spoke to Mr Thadanabath.  
     
      
       
        
        Q And it is fair to say at that particular point in time the only thing then under investigation was, well effectively whether Thadanabath held a valid driver’s licence? 
        
       
       
        
        A Well I became suspicious with the answers that he was giving me because when I spoke to the driver of the gold coloured Mercedes he told me that they were together. When I spoke to Thadanabath he told me that he didn’t know the occupants of the gold coloured Mercedes. I then thought to myself: well, why would one tell me that they’re together and the other telling me that they’re not together? He’s left the scene as soon as we turned up. I felt that perhaps well he’s either hiding something or he’s trying to get out of the area because of something.  
        
       
      
      
     
      
    13 In his second judgment his Honour referred to a submission by defence counsel that the intelligence the police had about Mr Thadanabath’s criminal tendencies was not received until after the arrest and could not therefore have informed Constable Gewargis’ suspicions at that time. The submission depended upon a comparison between the recorded time of the police radio broadcast and the time of arrest as recorded by the arresting officer. His Honour appears to have accepted that submission.  
     
      
    14 One may therefore infer that his Honour proceeded to judgment upon the understanding that Constable Gewargis knew the following when he arrested the appellant - 
     
      
       
        
        1. There were two expensive cars, each containing four young occupants, parked close together at 9:55pm, well after dark, on the edge of a reserve; 
        
       
       
        
        2. Dealers in illegal drugs often did their business there;  
        
       
       
        
        3. The driver of the blue car, in which the appellant was a passenger, behaved suspiciously by driving it off at high speed while the officer was speaking to the driver of the other car; and 
        
       
       
        
        4. The two drivers gave the officer inconsistent answers: the first told him that the occupants of the two cars were together but the driver of the appellant’s car told him that he did not know who was in the first car. 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour concluded that Constable Gewargis had and was entitled to have the reasonable suspicion required for the exercise of the search and detention rights under s357E. His Honour referred to R v Rondo.  
     
      
    16 It seems to me that his Honour was entitled, applying what this Court said in R v Rondo to the facts that I have summarised, to find that Constable Gewargis reasonably suspected the appellant of having or conveying any thing unlawfully obtained or used or intended to be used in the commission of an indictable offence. Dealing in any prohibited drug would have been an indictable offence.  
     
      
    17 His Honour did not deal with the submission about the unlawfulness of the arrest, as it depended upon the power in s352, as opposed to the unlawfulness of the detention and search, dependant on the power arising from s357. It was submitted on appeal that his Honour was bound to find in all the circumstances that the arrest of the appellant was unlawful and that that unlawfulness tainted the search that followed.  
     
      
    18 I do not accept that submission. First, the evidence of what Constable Gewargis knew was in my view sufficient to ground a suspicion with reasonable cause either that the appellant had committed an offence of the kind contemplated by s352 or that he was loitering in a highway during the night about to commit a serious indictable offence. The dealing in any prohibited drug would have been a serious indictable offence. 
     
      
    19 Secondly, the power to detain under s357E arose independently of any power of arrest under s352. Even if the arrest was unlawful, that unlawfulness could not have affected the lawfulness of the detention and the search which followed. This is not a case in which an arrest led to the discovery of information or to the prompting of further inquiry which led to the revelation of unlawful activity. The discovery of the pistol strapped to the back of the appellant resulted directly from his detention and search, both of which his Honour correctly concluded were lawful. 
     
      
    20 I would dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
    21 HOEBEN J: I agree with Barr J.

      Offences and sentence 
       
       
      On 24 September 2003 the applicant pleaded guilty to six counts of break enter and steal and one count of break enter with intent to steal in the Local Court at Newcastle. When he appeared before his Honour Judge Coolahan on 26 March 2004, the applicant adhered to those pleas. 
       
      
    4 As to the offences of break enter and steal, two were committed on 22 April 2003, a third was committed between 23 and 24 April 2003, the fourth was committed on 24 April 2003, the fifth on 13 May 2003 and the sixth on 20 May 2003. The break and enter with intent offence was committed on 23 April 2003. 
     
      
    5 In addition to those seven offences, his Honour was asked to take into account a further ten matters on a Form 1. Those comprised three counts of making a false statement to a pawnbroker committed on 22, 23 and 24 April 2003, four counts of break enter and steal committed on 21 April, 1 May, 12 May and 16 May 2003 and three counts of break and enter with intent to steal committed on 30 April, 7 May and 16 May 2003. 
     
      
    6 The maximum penalty for the offence of break enter and steal (s112(1) Crimes Act 1900) is 14 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for the offence of break enter with intent to steal (s111(1) Crimes Act 1900) is 10 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for making a false statement to a pawnbroker is a fine of $5,500. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was arrested on 22 May 2003 and has remained in custody in relation to those matters since that date. On 31 March 2004 the applicant was sentenced by Coolahan DCJ as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) Second break enter and steal committed on 22 April 2003, taking into account matters on the Form 1 – imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months. The non-parole period was to commence on 21 May 2003 and expire on 20 August 2006. The parole period was to commence on 20 August 2006 and expire on 20 May 2008. 
       
       
      (ii) First break enter and steal committed on 22 April 2003 – fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to commence on 21 May 2003 and expire on 20 November 2004. 
       
       
      (iii) Break enter and steal committed between 23-24 April 2003 – fixed term of imprisonment of 21 months to commence 21 May 2003 and expire on 20 February 2005. 
       
       
      (iv) Break enter and steal committed on 24 April 2003 – fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years to commence on 21 May 2003 and expire on 20 May 2005. 
       
       
      (v) Break enter and steal committed on 13 May 2003 – fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 3 months to commence on 21 May 2003 and expire on 20 August 2005. 
       
       
      (vi) Break enter and steal committed on 20 May 2003 – fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months to commence on 21 May 2003 and expire on 20 November 2005. 
       
       
      (vii) Break and enter with intent to steal committed on 23 April 2003 – fixed term of imprisonment of 15 months to commence 21 May 2003 and expire on 20 August 2004. 
       
      
    8 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the above sentences. 
     
      
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    9 His Honour Coolahan DCJ in his remarks on sentence set out in full the statement of facts in relation to each offence prepared by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The applicant accepts the accuracy of that statement of facts. The statement is quite lengthy and for the purposes of this appeal, I set out only those facts relating to the two offences committed on 22 April 2003. These provide a sufficient indication of the nature of the other offences for which the applicant was sentenced and also cover the particular offences in relation to which submissions were made to the Court. 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the first offence committed on 22 April 2003, at about 8.30 am on that date, Terrence Crichton left his house at 96 Lake Road Wallsend to go to work. Mr Crichton returned home at about 2.30 pm that day and found that some time during the day, a window had been smashed and someone had gained entry to the house. He saw that a number of drawers in a dressing table and bedside tables had been pulled out, that wardrobe doors had been opened and drawers and a cupboard had been pulled out. As a result of the break in, a silver coloured Nikon camera with a zoom lens valued at $399 was stolen. The broken window cost $100 to have repaired.  
        
       
       
        
        On 24 April 2003, the offender attended Ready Cash Pawnbrokers at Charlestown and pawned the camera that had been stolen. (This latter transaction is one of the Form 1 matters). 
        
       
       
        
        The offender was arrested by police on 21 May 2003 and interviewed. In the course of the interview he told police that he remembered getting into the premises at this address by going through a window that he had smashed. He said that he could not remember what he stole from the premises, but did remember taking a camera. He did not specifically remember attending Ready Cash at Charlestown. 
        
       
       
        
        As to the second offence, on 22 April 2003 at about 7.45 am on that day, Mary Scott locked all the doors and windows of her house at 50 Lake Road Wallsend and left the premises. About 5.15 pm that afternoon she returned home and saw that the laundry window had been smashed, a wall unit had been moved and a quantity of DVD movies had been stolen. She also saw that a large quantity of jewellery, a Foxtel console, a DVD player, a watch and some travel bags had also been stolen. Mrs Scott told police that the value of the property stolen was in excess of $20,000. 
        
       
       
        
        On 22 April 2003, the offender attended Newcastle Pawnbrokers and pawned a number of DVD movies. On 23 April 2003 he attended Ready Cash Pawnbrokers at Charlestown and pawned a gold dress ring, a gold pendant and a gold necklace. On 26 April 2003, Mrs Scott received a telephone call from a lady who had found a jewellery box containing some jewellery and her fishing licence and Mrs Scott later retrieved the jewellery box and jewellery from an address in Hamilton and identified the items as belonging to her. They had been among the items stolen on 22 April 2003. 
        
       
       
        
        On 30 April 2003, Mrs Scott attended Ready Cash at Charlestown and identified the dress ring, the pendant and the necklace as items stolen from her on 22 April 2003. A large quantity of jewellery, the watch, the electrical equipment and the travel bags have not been recovered. Mrs Scott has informed police that the value of the property unrecovered is approximately $15,500. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender was interviewed about this matter following his arrest. He told police that he had smashed the laundry window with a brick that he had found in the garden. He recalled taking the property referred to and pawning some of it as alleged.  
        
       
       
        
        When asked where the other stolen property was he replied “It’s been sold so it can’t be recovered.” He said that he did not sell the property to any particular person.” 
        
       
       
      Subjective matters 
       
      
    10 The applicant was born on 23 November 1980 and was accordingly twenty-two at the time of the offences. He was unemployed. 
     
      
    11 Although the applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings, the ERISPs in which he participated referred to a problem with illegal drugs and that the applicant had committed the offences in order to survive. 
     
      
    12 The applicant had a criminal record involving similar offences. In November 1999 he was convicted of five counts of break enter and steal and received a prison sentence. In May 2001 he was convicted of four counts of break enter and steal and was sentenced to a further period of imprisonment. On 20 March 2002 he was convicted of two counts of break enter and steal for which he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. The applicant had been released from prison on 7 March 2003, approximately six weeks before the first of the present series of offences. He was on conditional liberty at the time of these offences.  
     
      
    13 His Honour accepted that the applicant’s plea of guilty was entered at the first available opportunity and that there was a real utilitarian value in that plea. His Honour allowed a discount of twenty five percent in relation to that plea. His Honour also found that the applicant was genuine in his expression of remorse for the offences. His Honour noted, by way of finding special circumstances, that the applicant was serving his period of imprisonment in strict protection because it was believed by other prisoners that he was a police informant. 
     
      
       
      Appeal 
       
      Ground of appeal – The sentencing judge erred in failing to adequately discount the applicant’s sentence on the basis of the applicant’s assistance to the authorities in the admission of his guilt of the offences 
       
      
    14 The applicant submitted that he admitted to all of the offences in ERISPs conducted on 21 May and 18 June 2003. The longest sentence imposed was in relation to the second offence of 22 April 2003. This offence involved the largest sum of money and included the Form 1 matters. The evidence against the applicant in relation to that offence was that the applicant had on 22-23 April 2003 pawned a number of DVDs and some jewellery. The property pawned was only part of what was taken.  
     
      
    15 The submission was that the applicant’s admissions served to make out the case against him. The same argument was also put in relation to the first offence of 22 April 2003 and a further break enter and steal offence which took place on 13 May 2003 and which was included on the Form 1. 
     
      
    16 It was submitted that without this disclosure of guilt, it might have been very difficult for the Crown to establish its case against the applicant in relation to those offences. Despite the importance of that disclosure, and the assistance thereby provided to the Crown, the sentencing judge made no reference to it in his remarks on sentence and accordingly, fell into error. 
     
      
    17 Reliance was placed on the oft quoted passage in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court has said on a number of occasions that a plea of guilty will entitle a convicted person to an element of leniency in the sentence. The degree of leniency may vary according to the degree of inevitability of conviction as it may appear to the sentencing judge, but it is always a factor to which a greater or lesser degree of weight must be given. 
        
       
       
        
        When the conviction follows upon a plea of guilty, that itself is the result of a voluntary disclosure of guilt by the person concerned, a further element of leniency enters into the sentencing decision. Where it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, then a considerable element of leniency should properly be extended by the sentencing judge. It is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage a guilty person to come forward and disclose both the fact of an offence having been committed and confession of guilt of that offence. 
        
       
       
        
        The leniency that follows a confession of guilt in the form of a plea of guilty, is a well recognised part of the body of principles that cover sentencing. Although less well recognised, because less frequently encountered, the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned.” 
        
       
       
      
    18 The applicant submitted that the admissions of guilt in relation to those offences had a value beyond remorse. His Honour erred in failing to provide a substantial discount to reflect the utility of the applicant’s assistance and in doing so, his Honour failed to appropriately recognise the public benefit in encouraging offenders to admit guilt when it cannot otherwise be established. Such error being established, this Court should intervene and re-sentence the applicant. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    19 The start point in considering sentence is to identify the objective seriousness of the offences. This his Honour did at ROS 6-7 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The facts disclose serious offences. Break, enter and steal involving private households has virtually reached epidemic proportions. All too often people who have worked hard and saved to buy equipment such as that stolen here, all too often come home to find their premises have been broken into and the items which they have worked so hard to afford have been taken. Invariably, as seems to be the case here, at least so far as some of the items are concerned, these items are taken to a pawn shop which in my view are these days no more than licensed receivers of stolen goods, pawned for a fraction of their worth and never recovered. Very often the items are not covered by insurance, but even when they are, the reality is that the general community bears the price of these crimes through increased insurance premiums. It goes without saying that for offences such as this general deterrence must loom large in the sentencing consideration.” 
        
       
      
    20 It was then necessary for his Honour to balance the aggravating features of the offences against those in mitigation. The aggravating features of these offences far outweighed those in mitigation. 
     
      
    21 The aggravating features were: 
     
      
       
      (i) The applicant had a record of previous convictions for similar offences since 1999 for which he had received sentences of imprisonment. He had only been released from prison some six weeks before the first of this series of offences. 
       
       
      (ii) Significant sums of money were involved and much of the property stolen was not recovered. 
       
       
      (iii) The offences were committed whilst the applicant was on conditional liberty. 
       
       
      (v) The offences were seventeen in number and occurred over the space of three weeks. 
       
       
      (vi) There was some element of planning, albeit not sophisticated in the offences. 
       
      
    22 These were matters which have been regarded by this Court as having a cumulative effect in enhancing the seriousness of an offence. 
     
      
       
        
        “A court should regard the seriousness of an offence contrary to s112(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
         as enhanced and reflect that enhanced seriousness in the quantum of sentence if any of the following factors are present. Necessarily, if more than one such factor is present there is a cumulative effect upon seriousness and the need for appropriate reflection. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) The offence is committed whilst the offender is at conditional liberty on bail or on parole. 
           
          (ii) The offence is the result of professional planning, organisation and execution. 
           
          (iii) The offender has a prior record particularly for like offences. 
           
          (iv) The offence is committed at premises of the elderly the sick or the disabled. 
           
          (v) The offence is accompanied by vandalism and by any other significant damage to property. 
           
          (vi) The multiplicity of offence (reflected either in the charges or matters taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to s21 of the  
          Criminal Procedure Act) 
          . In sentencing on multiple counts regard must be had to the criminality involved in each:  
          Pearce v The Queen 
           (1998) 72 ALJR 1416. 
           
          (vii) The offence is committed in a series of repeat incursions into the same premises. 
           
          (viii) The value of the stolen property to the victim, whether that value is measured in terms of money or in terms of sentimental value. 
           
          (ix) The offence was committed at a time when, absent specific knowledge on the part of the offender (a defined circumstance of aggravation –  
          Crimes Act 
           s105A(1)(f)), it was likely that the premises would be occupied, particularly at night. 
           
          (x) That actual trauma was suffered by the victim (other than the result of corporal violence, infliction of actual bodily harm or deprivation of liberty – defined circumstances of aggravation:  
          Crimes Act 
          , s105A(1)(c), (d) and (e)). 
           
          (xi) That force was used or threatened (other than by means of an offensive weapon or instrument – a defined circumstance of aggravation:  
          Crimes Act 
           s105A(1)(a)).” ( 
          Re: Attorney General’s application [No 1] under s26 of Criminal Procedure Act, R v Ponfield 
           (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 at [48] Grove J.) 
          
         
        
       
      
    23 By way of mitigation his Honour then had regard to the following matters: 
     
      
       
      (i) There was no wanton vandalism, no violence and the applicant took steps to ensure that the premises were not occupied. 
       
       
      (ii) Although some planning was involved, it was not particularly extensive. 
       
       
      (iii) The applicant’s pleas of guilty were entered at the first available opportunity. 
       
       
      (iv) The applicant had co-operated with the police and had been ready to assist them. 
       
       
      (v) The applicant had expressed genuine remorse. 
       
       
      (vi) There were special circumstances in that the applicant’s imprisonment would be served in strict protection. 
       
      
    24 His Honour allowed in the applicant’s favour a discount of twenty five percent for his early plea of guilty. His Honour arrived at the sentences after taking into account their objective seriousness and balancing the competing aggravating and mitigating factors. Subject to the particular matter raised in the appeal, no criticism could be made of his Honour’s subsequent exercise of discretion in awarding the sentences which he did. 
     
      
    25 What is said by the applicant is that it was not sufficient for his Honour to award a discount of twenty five percent for the applicant’s early plea of guilty. He should have awarded a further discount because the applicant’s admissions of guilt filled gaps in what would otherwise be a difficult Crown case. In that regard the admission of guilt should also be characterised as providing assistance to the Crown. 
     
      
    26 In order to deal with that submission it is necessary to set out how his Honour dealt with the early plea of guilty. 
     
      
       
        
        “Miss Anderson drew my attention to the fact that the offender’s pleas were entered at the first available opportunity, and I accept this to be the case. I also accept that whilst there may have been some degree of planning involved in the commission of the offences, they were unsophisticated in the sense that the offender did not wear gloves and left fingerprints behind virtually at all the crime scenes. Whilst this meant that the Crown cases against the offender were strong, had he chosen to go to trial, he may well have been entitled to separate trials which would have occupied a great deal of court time and I am, therefore, of the view that the discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas should be the maximum of twenty five percent. 
        
       
       
        
        Miss Anderson submitted that the offender was co-operative with police and ready to assist them. This seems to be the case when one looks at the transcript of his two records of interview. It does appear that whilst having a limited memory in relation to some of the offences, he was making an effort to clear the slate as it were. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst Miss Anderson submitted that I should accept that the offender was prepared to assist police, it does appear, as Mr Dalrymple submitted, that he was unwilling to name the person to whom he sold some of the goods stolen, describing him apparently only as an older wog who lived at Whitebridge.” (ROS 8-9) 
        
       
      
    27 There are two difficulties with the applicant’s submission. The first is its factual basis. It assumes that, absent the admission by the applicant, the Crown would have had a very difficult case. I do not agree. As his Honour pointed out, except in relation to the two offences on 22 April 2003 and the break enter and steal of 13 May 2003 the applicant was directly linked by fingerprints to another eleven offences. All of the offences occurred within a narrow geographical area, over a period of less than three weeks. In relation to the second offence of 22 April 2003 the applicant was directly linked to the disposal of stolen DVDs and jewellery at two separate pawnshops. The applicant’s admission of guilt in relation to that offence in particular (being the one for which he received the largest sentence) did not greatly assist the Crown and does not come within the sort of assistance contemplated by R v Ellis. 
     
      
    28 The second difficulty is a conceptual one. Even if the factual basis could be made out - that the Crown would have had considerable difficulty in proving this offence without the applicant’s admission, it seems clear that his Honour’s discount of twenty five percent for the utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty took into account matters such as this.  
     
      
    29 This is clear from R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where the accused’s own disclosure or confession is the basis of the strong Crown case, this should be taken into account with respect to the utilitarian benefit. Indeed, such conduct should be regarded as the earliest possible timing for a plea.” (para 140, Spigelman CJ) 
        
       
      
    30 The Court clearly envisaged the very situation raised in this ground of appeal as included in the ten - twenty five percent discount on sentence to be awarded for the utilitarian value of an early plea of guilty. The sort of assistance which would entitle a further discount, such as was described in R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 and R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 was the very kind of assistance which the applicant refused to provide ie, identify the receiver to whom the balance of the goods stolen from Mrs Scott had been delivered. It should also be noted that a similar argument to that raised in this appeal was considered by this Court in R v Halkias [2004] NSWCCA 429, [36]-[39] and was rejected. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    31 His Honour did not err by including in his twenty five percent discount on sentence the applicant’s co-operation in pleading guilty to the three offences specified in the applicant’s submissions. That being the case, there is no basis for this Court to interfere with his Honour’s sentences. 
     
      
    32 The orders which I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (ii) Appeal dismissed.

    2 BARR J: I agree with Hoeben J. 
     
      
    3 HOEBEN J: The applicant, Rodney Wayne Potter, seeks leave to appeal from sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Freeman in the District Court on 17 December 2003. On 26 September 2003 the applicant pleaded guilty at the Downing Centre Local Court to five counts under s249B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act that he did on specified dates between December 1999 and March 2000 corruptly receive a benefit. Three further matters under s249B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act were asked to be taken into account on a Form 1. 
     
      
    4 Each of the offences carried a maximum term of imprisonment of seven years. In relation to counts 1-4 his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 2 years to commence on 17 December 2003 and expire on 16 December 2005. The non-parole period was 9 months to commence on 17 December 2003 and expire 16 September 2004. In relation to count 5 his Honour took into account the Form 1 matters and the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months to commence on 17 September 2004 and expire on 16 March 2007. The non-parole period was 12 months to commence on 17 September 2004 and expire on 16 September 2005. The sentence on count 5 was therefore cumulative on the earlier sentences. The total non-parole period was 1 year and 9 months. 
     
      
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    5 From approximately 1993 until 2000 the applicant was Chief Steward of the Greyhound Racing Control Board (the Board) which became the Greyhound Racing Authority (the Authority). The business of the Board and then the Authority was the control and management of greyhound racing in New South Wales. His duties included ensuring that the greyhound racing industry was run fairly and the supervision of the rules associated with greyhound racing in New South Wales.  
     
      
    6 In order to understand the charges, it is necessary to set out in summary form the corrupt behaviour of the applicant in the period 1993-2000. 
     
      
    7 The Board and its successor the Authority had put in place procedures to prevent the use of performance enhancing drugs. These procedures included the practice of testing dogs which won feature races. The testing was done by taking a urine sample from the dog, securing this in a purpose designed container, sealed with individually numbered aluminium seals, and having the sample conveyed by the stewards to an analytical laboratory. It was there tested for the presence of any prohibited substance. 
     
      
    8 In addition, on each program one or sometimes two races would be randomly selected as those for which the winner would be similarly tested. The random selection of these races was achieved by placing numbered balls in a sack. A volunteer chosen at random would be asked to extract sight unseen a ball the number of which would determine the race on the program of which the winner would be tested.  
     
      
    9 The corrupt conduct of the applicant was designed to subvert these procedures. When forewarned by one of his co-conspirators that a particular dog should if possible not be tested, the applicant would hold in one corner of the sack the numbered ball corresponding to the race in which that dog was entered. Thus the ball would not be available to be withdrawn by the volunteer and the race in which the suspect dog was entered would not be one of those selected for testing. 
     
      
    10 If testing of the dog could not be avoided, eg the dog was the winner of a feature race, then the applicant would destroy the sample taken from that dog and substitute clean urine so that the subsequent testing would not identify the presence of any prohibited substance. Usually the applicant effected this exchange during the delivery of samples to the analytical laboratory.  
     
      
    11 The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) had instituted a formal investigation in December 1999 in relation to the greyhound racing industry. The conduct of the applicant as chief steward was part of the focus of this investigation. Ultimately the Commission held private and public hearings from 11 April 2000. 
     
      
    12 During the covert investigation phase by the Commission the applicant had been observed to tip out the urine sample of the dog “Injection”, while purportedly transferring it for testing on 14 December 1999. This was the offence covered by count 1.  
     
      
    13 The second count referred to a similar activity also observed by ICAC investigators. This involved a sample taken from a dog “Tiani Drive” and it occurred on 10 January 2000. 
     
      
    14 The third count was based on a legally intercepted telephone conversation between the applicant and a greyhound trainer. This occurred on 30 March 2000 and in the conversation the applicant acquiesced in the trainer’s request that the dog did not “draw them out”. This referred to the applicant ensuring that the race was not one of those selected for testing. 
     
      
    15 The fourth count involved the same trainer. A dog “Reckless Abandon” won at Wentworth Park in record equalling time. The applicant although on holidays on 18 March 2000, the day on which the dog raced, attempted to exchange the sample taken from the dog with a clean sample when he returned to work on 21 March 2000. In fact the true sample from that dog had already been removed by ICAC investigators. The true sample when tested was positive for two prohibited substances. 
     
      
    16 The fifth count involved the applicant’s relationship with a punter, who also owned a couple of dogs. In early March 2000 legally intercepted telephone calls indicated that the punter was enlisting the aid of the applicant to “cover up” for dogs on which he was willing to bet because of their likely drug-affected performances. The items on the Form 1 referred to similar exchanges of clean urine with test samples taken from drug-affected dogs. 
     
      
    17 By way of further background the applicant had first been employed as a steward in 1981. He progressed to Deputy Chief Steward in about 1991, served in that position for two years and was appointed Chief Steward in September 1993.  
     
      
    18 It is not clear when the applicant first commenced acting corruptly, but it was either in 1992 or 1993. Thereafter he continued in that behaviour until he was interviewed by ICAC investigators on 30 March 2000. The applicant estimated that urine substitutions occurred at the rate of six-ten times per year. 
     
      
    19 Over the years that this conduct took place, the applicant was paid by trainers and others either a fixed amount per race or ten percent of prize money won by the affected dogs. When interviewed by the ICAC investigators, the applicant was receiving $1,000 per month from the trainer referred to in counts 3 and 4 and $400 per month from another trainer. He had received a few thousand dollars from the punter referred to in count 5. The motivation for the corrupt behaviour was financial gain and it seems clear that the applicant had received substantial sums of money between 1992/1993 and March 2000. 
     
      
    20 When the applicant was interviewed by ICAC investigators, he was completely candid with them and co-operated fully. He also actively assisted in the ICAC investigation. This assistance included wearing a listening device and recording conversations with other persons with whom he had engaged in corrupt activities. Those conversations apparently provided valuable evidence in support of the ICAC investigation. He indicated his willingness to give evidence in relation to the prosecution of others brought about by the ICAC investigation. 
     
      
    21 His Honour accepted that the applicant entered his plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and his Honour allowed a twenty five percent discount. In relation to the applicant’s co-operation and assistance to ICAC and the Authority, his Honour found that he was entitled to a further fifty percent discount. 
     
      
    22 Although the applicant was interviewed by the ICAC investigators on 30 March 2000 he was not charged with any offence until September 2003. During that time he sought to earn a living as a self-employed gardener. As of the date when the sentences were handed down the applicant was earning approximately $500 per week from that business. 
     
      
    23 His Honour found that special circumstances did exist in relation to the applicant. He identified them as the difficulties which the applicant would confront in prison as a result of the assistance which he provided, the fact that this was his first time in prison and his very good prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour also identified a need to ensure by appropriate supervision that upon his release from prison, the applicant’s difficult financial circumstances would not lead him again into crime. 
     
      
       
      Appeal 
       
       
      Ground 1 – The learned sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the criminality of the applicant by taking into account conduct not charged 
       
      
    24 The point made in this ground is that the actual conduct with which the applicant was charged covered the period December 1999 - March 2000. On four occasions during his remarks on sentence (P.6.1, 7.4, 7.7 and 8.1) his Honour stressed the period of seven-eight years over which the applicant had been engaging in similar corrupt conduct. Counsel for the applicant made specific reference to the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “All told, the prisoner enriched himself by a substantial sum over a very long period. …The crimes are very serious indeed and the charges brought are but representative of the prisoner’s criminality.” (ROS p7) 
        
       
      
    25 It was common ground that the five charges were not presented to the court as “representative counts”. There was as such no admission that prior conduct was to be included as conduct charged representatively. (JCW (2000) 112 A Crim R 466 at [10] and [67]). 
     
      
    26 This submission did not resile from the clear admissions made by the applicant in his record of interview with ICAC, the effect of which has been summarised above. It was accepted that the applicant’s lengthy history of corrupt conduct could be taken into account when assessing the objective seriousness of the offences with which the applicant had been charged. It could also be used to demonstrate that the character and antecedents of the applicant did not show that the offences with which he had been charged were the first criminal conduct in which he had engaged (Weininger v The Queen (2003) 212 CLR 629 at [29]). The applicant’s complaint was that the extensive corrupt conduct, which had occurred before the offences with which the applicant had been charged, had been used by his Honour as a significant aggravating factor. This approach underlay the whole of his Honour’s judgment and accordingly revealed error. 
     
      
    27 It is trite law that an offender should only be sentenced for crimes with which that offender has been charged. It is also clear that his Honour’s reference to the charges being representative of the applicant’s criminality was wrong in point of fact. What is not clear is whether his Honour misused the applicant’s criminal history in the way submitted. Apart from his Honour’s unfortunate use of the phrase “representative of the prisoner’s criminality”, it is otherwise clear from the remarks on sentence that all his Honour was doing was stressing the objective seriousness of the breach of trust which underlay the offences with which the applicant had been charged. 
     
      
    28 His Honour’s use of the word “representative” occurred in the following context: 
     
      
       
        
        “All told the prisoner enriched himself by a substantial sum over a very long period. In doing so he was guilty of the gravest breach of trust; not just the trust of his employer, but that of all of the innocent owners trainers and punters, who were involved in the greyhound racing industry. His corruption put at risk public confidence in that whole industry. Some have been unjustly enriched, others, most others, have been cheated. The crimes are very serious indeed and the charges brought are but representative of the prisoner’s criminality.” (ROS 7.4) 
        
       
      
    29 Later his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “What the prisoner stands to lose is substantial. What he has done since being exposed is commendable. What he did, however, for the best part of a decade, was engage in a premeditated, persistent, prolonged corruption, involving the most egregious breach of trust. The man in charge of ensuring that an entire industry was run fairly and squarely made himself a vehicle whereby corruption of that whole system was made possible. Such a course of conduct cannot attract less than a substantial sentence.” (ROS 12.1) 
        
       
      
    30 As was properly conceded on behalf of the applicant the five matters with which he was charged and the three Form 1 matters cannot be looked at in isolation. To do so would distort the true nature of the criminality involved. They were but individual instances of a course of corrupt conduct which had lasted for seven-eight years. In order to assess the objective seriousness of that conduct, regard had to be had by the sentencing judge to the historical context in which the offences occurred. 
     
      
    31 It seems to me that that is all that his Honour did. His Honour was wrong to say that “the charges brought are but representative of the prisoner’s criminality”. His Honour, however, did not use the history of the applicant’s criminality in that way. He used it to demonstrate the seriousness of the offences with which the applicant had been charged. Despite the unfortunate use of the word “representative”, his Honour’s use of that historical material was permissible. (Veen (No 2) v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477.) This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – The learned sentencing judge erred in his approach to his assessment of the good character of the applicant before and since the commission of the offences and the demonstrated rehabilitation of the applicant 
       
      
    32 The applicant’s submission under this ground was twofold. There was a complaint that the applicant’s prior conduct had been wrongfully taken into account when assessing good character before the charges were brought and that his Honour had failed to give adequate weight to the applicant’s efforts to rehabilitate himself during the three and a half years between when his corrupt conduct had been discovered and when he had been sentenced. 
     
      
    33 What his Honour said in relation to the applicant’s character before the discovery of corrupt conduct is fully consistent with the guidance provided by the High Court in Weininger v The Queen. The absence of a criminal record meant only that his corrupt conduct had not been discovered. His Honour also had regard to the applicant’s efforts to rehabilitate himself and took this into account when assessing special circumstances. The extent to which his Honour took those rehabilitation efforts into account when assessing sentence was a matter of discretion for his Honour and no error has been revealed in his Honour’s exercise of that discretion. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 – The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account adequately or at all delay on the part of the authorities in charging the applicant 
       
      
    34 The submission made by the applicant is not that his Honour failed to have regard to the question of delay but that his Honour failed to give that consideration adequate weight. There was no dispute that the delay had been considerable, ie in excess of three years. As his Honour noted during that time the applicant, through no fault of his own, was under considerable strain waiting for the inevitable charges to be brought. Reliance was placed upon the well-known passage in R v Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 – p 519f-520A. During that period the applicant had taken substantial steps to rehabilitate himself but the beneficial results of those efforts had been lost as a result of his imprisonment. The applicant submitted that this was a major mitigating factor to which his Honour had too little regard. 
     
      
    35 As has been pointed out by this Court on many occasions: 
     
      
       
        
        “The value to be attributed to a particular feature of a case cannot be assessed without having in mind all the other features in the case, favourable and unfavourable. Sometimes a preponderance of favourable features which result in any one of them receiving less weight than it might have received in the absence of the other favourable features. An example is the credit that must be given to an offender who has provided or undertaken to provide assistance to the authorities. The legislation provides, as the common law before it provided, that there is a limit to the value that may be given to such a combination of features. The resulting penalty may not be disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence:  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         s 23(3);  
        R v Cartwright 
         (1989) 17 NSWLR 243. 
        
       
       
        
        In a similar way different features which each entitle an offender to a less severe sentence may have overlapping effects, with the result that the appropriate total allowance will be less than the sum of the parts:  
        R v Gallagher 
         (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 per Gleeson CJ at 230-234.” ( 
        R v Dibb 
         [2003] NSWCCA 117 (Barr J)). 
        
       
      
    36 In this case significant discounts were allowed by his Honour in relation to the early plea of guilty by the applicant and his assistance to ICAC and the Authority. His Honour also found special circumstances. In his remarks on sentence his Honour made specific reference to the detrimental effect of delay, particularly in relation to the applicant’s efforts to rehabilitate himself. His Honour clearly had regard to that consideration. It was a mitigating matter which overlapped with other mitigating matters, which his Honour had to balance against the overriding requirement to make sure that the sentence finally pronounced was not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    37 No error has been disclosed in his Honour’s approach to this consideration, nor in his overall exercise of discretion when having regard to all mitigating features affecting the applicant’s case. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 5 – Lesser sentences were warranted in law 
       
      
    38 The applicant’s submission under this ground is a quasi-mathematical one. If one applied a discount of twenty five percent for an early plea of guilty and fifty percent for the assistance provided by the applicant, the resulting sentence of 3 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months meant that his Honour must have used as his starting point a sentence of 8 years. This is in excess of the maximum sentence imposed for this offence – 7 years. If the correct starting sentence of 7 years is used and if one applied the discounts found by his Honour, the resulting sentence, it is submitted, would be less than that awarded. 
     
      
    39 Reliance was placed upon the following passage in his Honour’s remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Indeed, applying the discounts, to which I already referred, produced a result a few months less than the sentence I consider in all the circumstances to be appropriate.” (ROS 12.3) 
        
       
      
    40 With due respect to the careful submissions of senior counsel for the applicant, such an approach is fundamentally flawed. It fails to have regard to Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 618 at [45]. The High Court there required sentencing judges to “fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality”. 
     
      
    41 In this case it was open to his Honour to fix sentences of 2 years with a non-parole period of 9 months for counts 1-4 and a separate sentence of 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 12 months in respect of count 5, which also had regard to the three Form 1 matters. After then having regard to considerations of totality, in particular the objective seriousness of the offences, his Honour was entitled, as he did, to make the sentence in relation to count 5 cumulative on the sentences in respect of counts 1-4. 
     
      
    42 This is what his Honour did, having regard to the need for general deterrence because of the breaches of trust inherent in these offences: “Others faced with similar temptations must be fortified by knowing that the penalty for committing a breach of trust is bound to be a sentence of substantial duration (ROS 11.9) … Regretfully, I have concluded that the inbuilt leniency in such a sentence would not convey adequately the message of general deterrence, which in a case such as this must be applied by rigour.” (ROS 12.9). 
     
      
    43 Even if one applied the mathematical approach relied upon by the applicant, error is not revealed. As a start point one needs to look at the sentence imposed in respect of count 5. The head sentence of 2 years and 6 months took account of the substantial discounts found by his Honour, particularly if one had regard to the way in which those discounts should be applied, ie not by adding them together but by applying them sequentially. (R v NP [2003] NSWCCA 195 at [30] and [47]). His Honour’s starting point was therefore not in excess of the maximum 7 years provided for that offence. 
     
      
    44 The approach to sentencing in ground of appeal five implicitly involved a mechanistic approach, which not only failed to have regard to the objective seriousness of offences and the principle of totality, but also failed to have regard to the provisions of s23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In that regard I respectfully adopt the comments of Simpson J in R v NP: 
     
      
       
        
        “[49] The result of the rigorous application of what have become relatively standardised discounts (especially where a considerable discount for a plea of guilty is added to an even more considerable discount for significant assistance) can, on occasion, cause a sharp intake of breath, but that is the result of the application of correct and established legal principle. The results can appear to be disproportionate to the offence(s). Sentencing judges (as in this case) have to balance the need to impose proper punishment with the need to recognise the benefits to the criminal justice system gained by pleas of guilty and assistance to authorities. The correct balance is not always easy to achieve.  
        
       
       
        
        [50] This is where s23(3) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         1999 demands consideration, and, sometimes, application. By that subsection, a sentencing judge allowing a discount for assistance to authorities, is required, notwithstanding, to ensure that the resulting sentence is not unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence(s).  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [54] In my opinion, the extent of discounts allowed to offenders, particularly those allowed by reason of assistance to authorities, not infrequently results in a disproportionately low sentence. Section 23(3) is designed to redress any imbalance that may result. It is by reason of s23(3) that I agree with the orders proposed by Hodgson JA, notwithstanding that the rigorous application of the conclusions I have reached with respect both to the starting point of the sentences and the discount for assistance, would otherwise result in a greater reduction of the overall 
          
        sentences.” 
        
       
      
    45 No error has been demonstrated in his Honour’s application of the discounts which he assessed in respect of the applicant’s early plea of guilty and assistance to ICAC and the Authority. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    46 As his Honour appreciated, the applicant’s culpability for the offences with which he was charged was at the top of the range for this type of offence. The very person entrusted with the protection of the greyhound industry in New South Wales was subverting its integrity for financial gain. That situation had continued for seven-eight years. Many innocent persons were adversely affected by the applicant’s conduct – owners, trainers, punters and those who depended upon them. Even if error had been revealed in his Honour’s approach to the sentencing of the applicant, I am of the opinion that the sentences imposed were not excessive and would not require the intervention of this Court. 
     
      
    47 If anything, the sentences of 2 years with a non-parole period of 9 months for counts 1-4 were unduly favourable to the applicant. It was appropriate to make the sentence in relation to count 5 cumulative on the other sentences. Having regard to the objective seriousness of the offences, and the principle of totality, the ultimate result of the sentences imposed – 3 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months – does not reveal error. 
     
      
    48 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
      (2) Appeal dismissed.

      2004/70015 REGINA v Shan Shan XU 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT ON VERDICT 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: Shan Shan Xu stands charged with the murder of her son, Stephen Xu. Stephen died on 31 March 2003 at Meadowbank. He was four and a half years old. 
     
      
    2 Ms Xu has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental illness. She has, with the consent of the Crown, elected to be tried by a Judge sitting without a Jury. 
     
      
       
      Background. 
       
      
    3 Ms Xu was born on 30 November 1970 in Shanghai, China. At the time of her son's death she was 33 years old. She grew up in China, where she studied accountancy. She has a brother. He is four years younger and remains in China, as does her father. Her mother, however, emigrated to Australia in 1992. 
     
      
    4 In 1995 or thereabouts, Ms Xu married a man who was already living in Australia. She thereafter accompanied her husband to Australia, where she worked as a waitress. Her husband, however, was a gambler. After approximately three years Ms Xu and her husband agreed to separate. They then divorced. Ms Xu moved in with her mother, her only relative in Australia. Her mother rented an apartment in the city. 
     
      
    5 Ms Xu thereafter formed a relationship with a man who worked in the construction industry. She became pregnant. The pregnancy, however, put an end to the relationship. She decided, nonetheless, to keep the child. Stephen was born on 2 October 1998. Ms Xu gave up work in order to look after Stephen. 
     
      
    6 Ms Xu's mother rented space in her apartment to young travellers who would usually stay for a short time. One such traveller, Ms Denise Kiely, provided a statement. She observed Ms Xu on a daily basis, as she interacted with Stephen. It was plain to her that Ms Xu and her mother loved Stephen. She described them as a very close family. She saw nothing which would suggest that Ms Xu would harm Stephen. 
     
      
    7 Stephen was a happy and healthy child. When Ms Xu began a course at TAFE, Stephen was placed in a child care centre. However, she was not happy with the care provided. She withdrew Stephen from the centre. Thereafter, with the help of her mother, she looked after Stephen. 
     
      
    8 In late 2002, Ms Xu's mother made arrangements to take Stephen to China. She wanted him to meet his grandfather. Ms Xu remained behind. It was planned that her mother and Stephen would be away from Australia for approximately five months. 
     
      
    9 Before her mother's departure there were symptoms of mental illness afflicting Ms Xu, although they were not recognised as such. Ms Xu's mother thought that her daughter had become lazy. She appeared sluggish and without energy. She had no enthusiasm.  
     
      
    10 Whilst Stephen was with her grandmother in China, Ms Xu telephoned regularly. She wanted to speak to Stephen. She later provided doctors with a description of her isolation during this period. She felt increasingly sad and withdrawn. She was particularly sensitive to noise. She found it difficult to make decisions, even easy decisions, such as the purchases she should make at the supermarket. She had no energy. She slept more than usual. She rarely left the flat. 
     
      
    11 Ms Xu's mother gave evidence that, having been away for a number of months with Stephen, she received a disturbing telephone call from her daughter. During their conversation her daughter said that she wanted to die. 
     
      
    12 The mother returned to Australia at once with Stephen. She found her daughter utterly lacking in energy. She was ""not interested in anything"". She did not want to cook, she neglected to bathe or shower, or groom herself. She simply lay in bed all day. She continued to express thoughts of taking her own life. Alarmingly, she made the following comments to her mother in relation to Stephen: (T18) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Did she say anything about Stephen? 
         
        A. That she will want to take him with her so I won't have to look after him for the rest of my life - that me being the grandmother, I can't always look after him because I will get old."" 
        
       
      
    13 Ms Xu's mother took her daughter to see their general practitioner, Dr Silvia Wong. Dr Wong immediately spoke to the Community Mental Health Centre attached to the St Vincent's Hospital. Arrangements were made for the crisis team from that centre to visit Ms Xu that evening, accompanied by an interpreter. 
     
      
    14 Ms Xu repeated to the crisis team that she not only contemplated taking her own life, but that of her son. She reluctantly agreed to accompany them to the St Vincent's Hospital, Caritas Centre, that being an acute psychiatric unit. 
     
      
    15 Ms Xu was admitted to the Caritas Centre that evening. The hospital notes include the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ""Thoughts of killing herself and her son. 
           
          Is insight less - sees nothing wrong with this."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    16 Not surprisingly Ms Xu was characterised as a substantial risk to herself and her son. A diagnosis of psychotic depression was made. She was held as an involuntary patient. DOCS was notified, although it is not apparent what, if anything, was done by that Department to safeguard Stephen. 
     
      
    17 Within three days, that is on 24 February 2003, Ms Xu was discharged. She was said to be much brighter, although still with limited insight into her apparent depression. She said that she was happy to continue taking her medication. 
     
      
    18 The crisis team continued to visit Ms Xu at home. She appeared cheerful and denied thoughts of suicide or harm to Stephen. Ms Xu's mother reported to Dr Wong on 27 February 2003 that her daughter was much improved. 
     
      
    19 On 5 March 2002, Ms Xu was seen by the Psychiatric Registrar of the St Vincent's Hospital, Dr Rogoz. Dr Rogoz gave the following evidence concerning that examination: (T28) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... At that time she was cooperative, pleasant, smiling appropriately, no evidence of agitation in her behaviour. Her speech was normal. She reported her mood being good and there was no evidence of any psychotic symptoms. There was no thought of self harm or suicide. And so my impression was that she had a major depressive episode which was resolving on treatment."" 
        
       
      
    20 Dr Rogoz spoke to members of the crisis team. She and the team assessed Ms Xu as being at ""low risk of self harm, suicide or homicide"". A management plan was made for Ms Xu. She was to continue with her medication. She should see her general practitioner each week and be examined by the hospital in four weeks time, that is, on 1 April 2003. 
     
      
    21 Ms Xu attended upon her general practitioner the next day. There is the suggestion that her next consultation was cancelled by her doctor, which may or may not be right. However it came about, it is plain that no such consultation took place. Ms Xu did not have the weekly medical supervision which the management plan had contemplated. 
     
      
    22 On 27 March 2003, Ms Xu again presented at the St Vincent's Clinic. Dr Rogoz, however, was not conducting that clinic. The Psychiatric Registrar, who was then seeing patients, recorded that he was unclear why she had presented ahead of schedule. He directed her to continue with the treatment and present to Dr Rogoz on 1 April. Ms Xu returned home. There must be doubt as to whether she was, at that time, taking the medication that had been prescribed. 
     
      
    23 About this time, Ms Xu's mother became ill. She went to stay with a friend at Concord West whilst she recuperated. Ms Xu was therefore alone in the apartment with Stephen, apart from the boarder who came and went. 
     
      
       
      The Incident. 
       
      
    24 Ms Xu told Dr Nielssen that, on 31 March 2003, she set out from Central Railway Station with Stephen, intending to take him to one of her mother's friends who had two children. She had intended to get off the train at Rhodes station. However, she missed her stop. Instead she was carried to Meadowbank wharf.  
     
      
    25 Ms Xu said that she then decided to remain at Meadowbank. There was a park adjacent to the wharf which was quiet and pleasant. The closed circuit television maintained by the Transport Authority recorded her presence and that of Stephen from about 2.00 pm. They walked back and forth. Stephen played like any normal child of that age. 
     
      
    26 Darkness fell and they remained at the park. At about 6.41 pm the television recorded Ms Xu walking down the ramp at the Meadowbank wharf, holding Stephen's hand. There was no-one else on the wharf. At the end of the ramp she gathered Stephen in her arms and held him for some time. She then disappeared from the end of the wharf, still holding Stephen, as she stepped into the Parramatta River. 
     
      
    27 Ms Xu drifted for some time. She was observed by fishermen at the nearby Meadowbank railway bridge. They thought that she was swimming, as she moved silently through the water. 
     
      
    28 At 7.47 pm, that is, more than an hour later, a Rivercat ferry left the Homebush Bay wharf, on its way to the Meadowbank wharf. Not long after it began that journey, a passenger told a deckhand that there was someone in the water yelling for help. The Master of the vessel stopped the engine. He turned the ferry around. Ultimately, Ms Xu was assisted to climb on board. As she did so, those helping her realised that she was holding onto a child.  
     
      
    29 Attempts were immediately made to revive the child. An ambulance was called. It met the ferry at the Meadowbank wharf. Stephen was taken to Concord Hospital. However, he could not be revived. A doctor at that hospital pronounced his life extinct. 
     
      
    30 Ms Xu, when later interviewed by forensic psychiatrists in connection with this trial, said that when she jumped into the Parramatta River she did not want to kill herself or the child, although she acknowledged to Dr Nielssen that ""she was not in control"". However, when her apartment was searched by police shortly after the incident, a note was found. It was addressed to her mother, and was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ""Dear Mum, 
             
            We are not coming back home. 
             
            Please look after yourself. 
             
            Just treat it as if we'd had an accident. 
             
            I've really had enough."" 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
       
      Treatment of Ms Xu. 
       
      
    31 Ms Xu was also taken to the Concord Hospital from the Meadowbank wharf. Because of concerns as to her psychiatric state, she was transferred to Rozelle Hospital, where she became a scheduled patient. Ms Xu remained at the Rozelle Hospital for six weeks. The notes record that, upon admission, her affect was blunted. She would not speak readily about her feelings. She did say, however, that she wished to be with her son and not to wake up from sleep. 
     
      
    32 On 4 April 2003, Ms Xu was taken to the Glebe Forensic Unit by a social worker. She was allowed to view her son's body. She was visibly distraught. She found it difficult to leave, stating several times that she wished to remain with him. After a considerable time she was directed to leave. 
     
      
    33 The hospital made a diagnosis of major depressive episode with features of melancholia or anxiety or, alternatively, a major depressive episode with psychotic features. Anti-depressant medication was again prescribed. 
     
      
    34 On 23 May 2003, Ms Xu was transferred to the Caritas Unit of the St Vincent's Hospital. According to the notes she presented as cheerful although still guarded in her interaction with staff and other patients.  
     
      
    35 On 29 May 2003, however, Ms Xu absconded from the ward whilst waiting for her mother to take her out on leave. She was brought back to the unit on 3 June 2003. She was, at that time, agitated and unkempt. She said that she had been staying with friends.  
     
      
    36 The next day Ms Xu was transferred to the Cumberland Hospital. Shortly after her admission on 12 June 2003, Ms Xu was charged with the murder of her son.  
     
      
    37 The hospital notes of the Cumberland Hospital record that Ms Xu had, at that stage, little insight into her role in Stephen's death. She was diagnosed as suffering from a major depressive illness with psychotic features (in remission). Her medication was altered and her mental state then showed marked improvement to the point that the hospital no longer regarded her as being mentally ill.  
     
      
    38 On 4 February 2004, Dr Michael Giuffrida, the Director of the Forensic Unit of the Cumberland Hospital, and Dr Kavanagh, the Registrar, made an assessment of Ms Xu in these terms: (Exhibit H) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Ms Xu's mental state has fluctuated over the course of her admission. She is no longer Mentally Ill within the meaning of the NSW Mental Health Act, in that she is not frankly psychotic. She is not thought disordered or obviously delusional. On the other hand, she shows a clear impairment of judgement and insight into her illness. She is at best illogical in her reasoning about issues that are critical to her, such as her offence and the charge of murder. She is at times quite irrational in her dealings with staff and unwilling to consider reasonable advice and direction by staff."" 
        
       
      
    39 Both doctors saw the need for continuing supervision and the risk of deterioration in Ms Xu's state in the absence of such supervision. 
     
      
    40 At the time of that assessment, Ms Xu was a voluntary patient. She had been given bail in respect of the charge of murder, which was conditional upon her not seeking to discharge herself from the Bunya Unit of the Cumberland Hospital. The medical staff at the hospital did not, apparently, regard Ms Xu's voluntary status as altogether satisfactory from the viewpoint of treatment. Dr Giuffrida remarked: 
     
      
       
        
        ""She remains under close observation and her leave privileges have been withheld because of her (at times) difficult behaviour."" 
        
       
      
    41 On 12 February 2004, the DPP made an application to revoke her bail. A Local Court Magistrate, having heard that application, revoked Ms Xu's bail, whereupon she was taken into custody and transferred to the Mulawa Correctional Centre. On 26 February 2004, Ms Xu was transferred to Long Bay where she remained until 31 March 2004, the first anniversary of her son's death. On that day she was again transferred to the Mulawa Correctional Centre. 
     
      
    42 On 19 April 2004, Ms Xu was given bail. She returned to the apartment which she shared with her mother, where she has remained. 
     
      
    43 Ms Xu has, therefore, been living in the community for almost ten months. She has been under the care of a number of doctors. Two of those doctors, Dr Doutney and Dr Parmegiani, gave evidence. They described the course of her treatment and her current mental health. 
     
      
    44 I shall deal with those issues and that evidence shortly. However, it is convenient to first deal with the issue of responsibility and the plea of not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
     
      
       
      The issue of responsibility. 
       
      
    45 The circumstances in which Stephen died are not in doubt. Given the history and the terms of the note in Ms Xu's handwriting, there can be no doubt as to her intention. The issue is one of responsibility. Was the accused mentally ill at the time of these events, so as not to be responsible in law (s38 Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, 1990)? The onus is upon the accused to establish, as a matter of probability, that at the time of the commission of the offence she was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of her act; or, if she did know, not to know that what she was doing was wrong (M'Naghten's case (1843) 10 Cl and Fin 200 [8ER 718]). 
     
      
       
      The medical evidence. 
       
      
    46 On the issue of responsibility there can be no doubt. The accused was examined by a forensic psychiatrist retained by her solicitors, Dr Bruce Westmore. She was also examined at the request of the Crown by forensic psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen. Both are highly qualified and experienced practitioners. Both expressed the same view. 
     
      
    47 Dr Westmore, in his report of 20 January 2004, stated that the accumulated evidence strongly supported the mental illness defence, although at that time Ms Xu was reluctant to rely upon such a defence. 
     
      
    48 Dr Nielssen believed that, at the time of these events, Ms Xu was suffering from a major depressive illness with psychotic features, a severe form of depression which is accompanied by a loss of contact with reality. In his report of 24 June 2004 he said this:  
     
      
       
        
        ""I believe Ms Xu has the defence of mental illness open to her, as a severe depressive illness that is out of proportion to any triggering factors and requires treatment with anti-depressant medication is a disease of the brain, which produces a pattern of abnormality of mind that is recognised in law to be a disease of the mind. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Xu's illness resulted in a defect of reason in the form of a morbid appraisal of her circumstances and the future that was so severe that she believed that killing her son and committing suicide was a reasonable course of action. I believe that in her morbid state of mind she did not appreciate that her actions in endangering her son's life was morally wrong. She was also unable to reason with composure regarding the alternative courses of action open to her.""  
        
       
      
    49 Dr Nielssen examined Ms Zu again in February this year for the purposes of giving evidence. He reaffirmed his view. 
     
      
    50 I accept the evidence of Doctors Westmore and Nielssen. I find Ms Xu Not Guilty of murder by reason of mental illness. 
     
      
       
      Current mental state. 
       
      
    51 Upon entry of such a verdict, the Court may do a number of things, as set out in s39 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, 1990. It may order that the person be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit, until released by due process of law. Alternatively, the Court may make such orders as it considers appropriate, including an order for the release of the person, with or without conditions. 
     
      
    52 Where a person is detained or released subject to conditions, the jurisdiction of the Mental Health Review Tribunal is enlivened. The person then becomes a forensic patient subject to the supervision of that Tribunal. 
     
      
    53 It must be understood, however, as was recently explained by Simpson J in R v Line [2004] NSWSC 1148, that where conditions are imposed upon the release of a person, they are not imposed by way of punishment. The objective is the protection of human life, including that of the person who is the subject of the order. 
     
      
    54 It therefore becomes necessary to examine Ms Xu's present mental state and her conduct since her release on bail. 
     
      
    55 I assume that the bail given on 19 April 2004 required Ms Xu to present at the Darlinghurst Community Health Centre, which comes within the St Vincent's Hospital Mental Health Service, and to comply with the directions of that centre. Ms Xu attended the centre the day following her release (20 April 2004). The hospital notes record that she had no acute symptoms of depression or psychosis. 
     
      
    56 Ms Xu continued to attend the centre, but was unhappy with aspects of their treatment. Indeed she made a complaint. Having made the complaint, she then attended the Prince of Wales Hospital on 12 August 2004, where she saw Dr Doutney. Dr Doutney is a consultant psychiatrist and the Medical Superintendent of the Prince of Wales Mental Health Service. 
     
      
    57 On 24 August 2004 Ms Xu's mother attended the St Vincent's Hospital. She described matters which gave rise to concern. She and her daughter had been arguing for a number of days. The arguments concerned a phone call which the mother planned to make to China. One gathers that she intended to inform relatives of Stephen's death. In the course of the argument she claimed that her daughter threatened to kill her. It was a verbal exchange. There was nothing physical. The mother moved out of the apartment for a time, staying with friends. 
     
      
    58 The Psychiatric Registrar, members of the crisis team, and the police endeavoured to speak to Ms Xu. They went to her apartment. She was not at home. They spoke to her by telephone. However, she could not be persuaded to return home. An interim Apprehended Violence Order was granted against Ms Xu, on an application of the police on behalf of the mother. 
     
      
    59 However, on 2 September 2004, Ms Xu's mother reported to the hospital that her daughter was ""OK"" and that she should be allowed to chose her own doctor. Ms Xu, in the meantime, had seen Dr Doutney and was continuing to see him at monthly intervals. 
     
      
    60 Dr Nielssen dealt with this episode in the course of his evidence. The issue was whether it was symptomatic of a relapse of the mental illness or simply a difference between mother and daughter. The mother, in her evidence, acknowledged that, upon reflection, she was, at least in part, at fault. Indeed, she had apologised to her daughter. Dr Nielssen said that he viewed the incident as an understandable conflict between mother and daughter, rather than a relapse. The mother said that she was not in fear of her daughter. 
     
      
    61 In October 2004, Ms Xu also began seeing Dr Parmegiani, psychiatrist. She continued to see him approximately every two weeks, whilst still seeing Dr Doutney each month. 
     
      
    62 Dr Doutney provided a report on 10 February 2005 in which he commented upon Ms Xu's mental state in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""She does not at present show any signs of depressive or other psychiatric illness. She is always pleasant and cooperative when I see her."" 
        
       
      
    63 Dr Parmegiani's report of 9 February 2005 was in similar terms. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Overall my impression is that Ms Xu remains clinically well, and I have no reservations about her ability to reside in the general community."" 
        
       
      
    64 Dr Westmore stated that, after his consultation in December 2004, he saw no evidence of psychotic symptoms in Ms Xu, although there were some continuing symptoms of depression.  
     
      
    65 Dr Nielssen, in evidence, voiced the following opinion concerning his recent examination: (T38) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Well, at the time of the interview last Wednesday, I didn't find any active symptoms of mental illness in the form of abnormal beliefs, symptoms of psychotic illness such as perceptual disturbances and she did not appear severely depressed so I thought her current state was stable and that is also the opinion of Dr Parmegiani who has seen her more regularly. He has not seen any signs of active mental illness. He said she hasn't missed an appointment."" 
        
       
      
    66 In Dr Nielssen's view, Ms Xu did not present as a risk to herself or others, although she did require long term psychiatric care. He thought it important that she continue for a period of years to see a psychiatrist at regular intervals and take medication. Were she not to do so, she would be at risk of a relapse. 
     
      
    67 The Crown submitted that I should order that Ms Xu be detained. That would enable a thorough assessment by the Mental Health Review Tribunal and her possible release after that review. Counsel for Ms Xu argued that there was no justification for a return to custody. Conditions could be attached to Ms Xu's release which would ensure that she was provided with appropriate supervision and a timely assessment by the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 
     
      
    68 Dr Parmegiani said that, were Ms Xu to return to custody, he would expect a deterioration in her mental state. 
     
      
    69 Ms Xu has, of course, suffered a tragedy. There are, however, many encouraging signs in respect of her recovery. She has begun a course in computers at TAFE. She has undertaken driving lessons in the hope that that may assist in securing employment once this trial has been completed. She believes that she may be able to help others who are afflicted by mental illness. She has lived without incident in the community for almost a year, apart from the incident involving her mother in August 2004. So far as that incident is concerned, I accept the opinion of Dr Nielssen that the argument was a strong difference of opinion in which things were said that were better not said. It was not a relapse into mental illness. 
     
      
    70 In these circumstances, I do not believe it appropriate to return Ms Xu to custody. I therefore make the following orders. 
     
      
       
      Orders. 
       
      
    71 Shan Shan Xu, under s39 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, I order that you be released from custody, subject to the following conditions:

      2. That you live with your mother, Shu Hua (Sandy) Yu, at 107/398 Pitt Street, Sydney, or any other residence as shall be approved by the Mental Health Review Tribunal;

That you accept as your Case Manager such person as may be appointed by Sydney South Eastern Health Services and that you attend upon, or accept home visits from, your Case Manager, the Community Mental Health Service or such other health workers as your Case Manager may nominate and with such regularity as shall be determined from time to time by your Case Manager, and according to such arrangements as shall be determined by your Case Manager as to time and place of such attendance or visits; 
       
       
      4. That you attend upon your treating psychiatrist with such regularity as shall be determined from time to time by your treating psychiatrist, and according to such arrangements as shall be determined by your treating psychiatrist, as to time and place of such attendance; 
       
       
      5. That you accept such medication as shall be prescribed from time to time by your treating psychiatrist; 
       
       
      6. That you undergo such treatment as may be from time to time recommended by your treating psychiatrist, including admission to any hospital or clinic which he or she might recommend; 
       
       
      7. That you submit to examination and review by such forensic psychiatrist not being involved in your care or treatment as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may from time to time appoint, and authorise those treating you to pass on to such forensic psychiatrist all such information as he or she might request from them; 
       
       
      8. That you attend the Mental Health Review Tribunal reviews of your case, pursuant to the Mental Health Act 1990, according to arrangements as notified in advance to you, your Case Manager, and your Solicitor by the Tribunal; 
       
       
      9. That you keep the Registrar of the Tribunal notified in writing of the details of your current residential address and telephone number, and that you notify the Registrar of the Tribunal immediately, in writing, in the event of any plans to change address, and of any change of address and telephone number; and 
       
       
      10. These conditions shall remain in force until such time as the Mental Health Review Tribunal shall approve some other form of treatment and/or supervision, and subject to any order made by the prescribed authority under the Mental Health Act 1990, in which case it is a condition of your release that you comply with all and any such recommendations of the Mental Health Review Tribunal or the terms of any such order.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
       
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Black DCJ in the District Court at Lismore. On 27 February 2004 following a plea of guilty, his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for seven years with a non parole period of four years on a count of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death.  
     
      
    2 The offence occurred on 8 August 2003. Shortly before 2 am the applicant was driving a vehicle departing from the city of Lismore in which Rowena Gallen was riding as a passenger. The applicant and Ms Gallen had relatively recently formed a relationship and they lived together. On the preceding evening, the applicant had collected her from work. They went to a hotel but made a journey home in connection with spare car keys (a set had accidentally been locked into the car) but returned to the hotel and resumed drinking. The applicant consumed both beer and spirits. They were friendly with a staff member at a second hotel to which they repaired and they remained drinking after hotel closing. Shortly before the fatal incident the applicant’s vehicle had entered a 100 kph speed zone. A witness, Mr Goodman, was driving another vehicle in the same direction at a stated speed of 95 kph. He described the applicant’s vehicle as overtaking him at a speed greater than that of his vehicle of about 20 kilometres per hour. He saw the applicant’s vehicle lose control, hit a fence, and roll into a paddock turning over “at least half a dozen times”.  
     
      
    3 Mr Goodman approached the wreckage and spoke to the applicant who did not complain to him of any injury although Mr Goodman noted scratches on his face. The applicant was apparently confused and upon arrival of police and ambulance, when questioned, he said that he had been alone in the car. This was, of course, not the case and Ms Gallen was in the vehicle and died of injuries sustained in the incident.  
     
      
    4 At 2.45 am a blood sample was taken from the applicant and found to have present alcohol in a concentration of 0.208 grams per 100 millilitres and delta-9-THC 0.011 milligrams per litre and delta-9-THC acid 0.097 milligrams per litre.  
     
      
    5 Without objection there was before the learned sentencing judge a report by Dr Judith Perl, pharmacologist, relating to this analysis. She expressed the opinion that the applicant at the time of driving was under the influence of alcohol and cannabis to the extent that his driving ability would have very substantially been impaired. Her final opinion was expressed in these terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The blood concentration of delta-9-THC and delta-9-THC acid are indicative of very recent usage of cannabis and with such recent use I would certainly expect some impairment. This impairment would be at least addictive to the effect of the alcohol but may in fact have exacerbated the effects of alcohol. Nevertheless, the blood alcohol concentration would have been the primary source of impairment.” 
        
       
      
    6 His Honour found that “it is the drink that would substantially disable the driver from the proper conduct of the vehicle.” 
     
      
    7 The applicant had offered the plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and his Honour gave appropriate credit for that. It was also relevant, however, that although it arose in effect from honest recounting by the applicant, it was shown that he had ignored a specific warning from a friend who raised the issue of his ability to drive when the applicant ceased drinking but the warning was brushed aside upon the applicant’s self assessment that he could make his way home. 
     
      
    8 His Honour paid due regard to relevant subjective circumstances touching the applicant including his care for a child born of a relationship prior to that with the deceased and his generally favourable work record, most of which involved fulltime service as a member of the Army Reserve. His prior record included a conviction for high range PCA and being an unlicensed driver. These convictions were entered in 1991 when the applicant would have been aged nineteen. Other matters on his record were not of significance. Complaint was made that his Honour had observed that “the only way his previous record can be described I think is poor” was, at the least, a mis-statement. I do not doubt that any judge would have seen records which were far worse but the applicant’s record could not accurately be described as good and “poor” is an appropriate antonym of “good”.  
     
      
    9 Two grounds of appeal were presented. Ground 1 contended “the learned sentencing judge erred by imposing sentence in accordance with the terms of the repealed version of s44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999”. 
     
      
    10 His Honour announced the total term and then the non parole period. The current terms of the section referred to require first the setting of the non parole period. Such an occurrence is not a novel. In Regina v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 Spigelman CJ observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is necessary to correct the sentence imposed so it conforms with the structure required by s44 in the form in which it is applicable.  
        
       
       
        
        The Applicant submitted that by reason of this error the Court was entitled to set aside the sentence and proceed to determine the sentence which it believed should be imposed. The error that has been identified did not affect the exercise of discretion by the trial judge. The Court is able to, and should, resentence the Applicant. However, unless some other aspect of the sentence warrants the Court proceeding to sentence afresh, I would not do so. The error identified is a technical one and does not justify this Court proceeding as if his Honour’s exercise of the sentencing discretion miscarried.” 
        
       
      
    11 It follows that standing alone, the identification of such an error does not give rise to an entitlement to resentence.  
     
      
    12 The gravamen of the argument on behalf of the applicant was presented in relation to ground 2, which was simply expressed as “the sentence is manifestly excessive.”  
     
      
    13 There has been extensive analysis of the sentencing principles applicable to crimes causing unintended death or maiming arising out of dangerous driving. It can be noted that the Parliament created an aggravated form of offence and that by reason of the high concentration of alcohol in the applicant’s bloodstream at the time, his offence is in the more serious category. There is no need to recapitulate the principles which were extensively articulated in R v Jurisic 1998 45 NSWLR 209 and later in R v Whyte 2002 55 NSWLR 252.  
     
      
    14 Senior counsel for the applicant drew attention to the facts and circumstances in R v Vukic [2003] NSWCCA 13 where a number of cases were discussed providing, it was submitted, a useful context upon which to assess the severity of sentence imposed in the present case. A similar exercise was undertaken in R v Ryan [2003] NSWCCA 202.  
     
      
    15 Senior counsel for the applicant acknowledged the need for caution in comparing sentences imposed in other cases: cf R v Morgan 1993 70 A Crim R 368 but he elaborated the facts in R v Vukic in which a sentence identical to the present was imposed and it was submitted Vukic “warranted a significantly greater sentence than the applicant in the present matter.” Vukic drove in a suburban street at high speed, well in excess of applicable limit, crossed to the incorrect side of the road and killed the driver of an oncoming vehicle. His blood alcohol reading was 0.172. He had two convictions for PCA and eight speeding convictions as well as other infringements. 
     
      
    16 Reference was also made to R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 where a sentence of six and half years with a non parole period of four and half years was varied by reducing the non parole period to four years. Again, on the facts of that case it was submitted that Sutton would warrant a significantly greater sentence than the applicant. Sutton was driving in the afternoon in a country town. He was seen driving erratically. He crossed to the incorrect side of the road and killed a female cyclist. He narrowly missed another cyclist riding near her. He did not stop after the collision. He had three prior convictions for PCA, two of them “high range”. His measured blood alcohol was 0.268. 
     
      
    17 The particular case in which it was expressly submitted the result should be regarded as comparable to that which should have been in the present case was R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300 which was accurately epitomised in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentencing judge had imposed a sentence of five years with a non parole period of three years which was quashed by this Court. Mr Berg had driven a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level of 0.20 grams per 100 millilitres as well as having morphine and cannabis detected in his blood, although he would not have been affected by the latter drugs to any significant degree. His vehicle left the roadway and collided with an embankment which caused the vehicle to roll. A passenger, a woman with whom the applicant had been in a relationship for some months, died. The vehicle’s tyres had less tread depth than the legal requirement and the braking system was in poor condition. The road was wet and it was raining at the time. Mr Berg was 45 years old. He had a record for criminal offences, primarily for matters of dishonesty, which was regarded as being irrelevant. He also had a record of traffic matters including a PCA offence twenty one months before the accident. The applicant was engaged in community work, charitable work for which he had been commended by the receipt of service awards. He was said to be deeply traumatized and guilt ridden and the sentencing judge accepted that he had shown remorse. The sentencing discretion was found to have miscarried in the manner in which s21A factors were considered. This Court moved to resentence and Howie J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Wood CJ at CL agreed, determined that the appropriate sentence was one of four years with a non parole period of two years three months.” 
        
       
      
    18 It should be noted that the estimate of speed of the applicant’s vehicle was mentioned by the learned sentencing judge as being some 20 to 25 kilometres per hour faster than the estimated 95 kilometres an hour at which Mr Goodman’s vehicle was travelling. There was nothing in the material which suggested that in the overtaking manoeuvre or indeed at any time the applicant’s vehicle exceeded the speed of that being driven by Mr Goodman by more than 20 kilometres per hour. Counsel drew attention to the absence of any evidence suggesting erratic driving by the applicant prior to losing control when the vehicle had performed that manoeuvre.  
     
      
    19 It was submitted by the Crown that the offence fell within the description of “the worst type of case” given by Smart AJ in R v Vukic. The reasons for these were stated as “a combination of factors, in this case, high speed, a blood alcohol reading of more than 2.00 (sic), the recent use of cannabis exacerbating the impairment of his driving, a warning against driving, driving while unlicensed and driving an unregistered and uninsured vehicle.” 
     
      
    20 There was no evidence of the existence of traffic on this rural road other than the two vehicles which I have mentioned and the evidence did not establish that the applicant’s vehicle was travelling at a speed greater than 15 kph over the limit during an overtaking manoeuvre. Whether, in motoring parlance this can be described as a “high” speed overtaking in the circumstances is open to debate. Nevertheless, 115 kph is in terms of simple accelerated movement along a road undoubtedly a “high” speed. There were a number of offences in addition to that which is the subject of appeal dealt with by his Honour, that is say for driving the unregistered and uninsured vehicle for which convictions were entered without penalty. However, the charge of unlicensed driving was referred to the Local Court for hearing, it being the stated position of the applicant that he wished to defend that matter on the ground of, in effect, honest and reasonable mistake. The Court was informed that this matter has never come to trial but it was accordingly not open to be argued by the Crown that driving whilst unlicensed was a factor contributing towards the applicant’s being in the “worst case” category. On an overview of all the available evidence I am unpersuaded that this case is in such category. 
     
      
    21 I return to the submission that sentence in this case should be comparable with that imposed in Berg.  
     
      
    22 Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer: see Pearce v The Queen 1998 194 CLR 610 @ 624. It follows from the discretionary nature of sentencing that in any given case a sentence will be invulnerable to appellate intervention which, absent error of fact or principle, lies within the range of the sound exercise of judicial discretion.  
     
      
    23 The ultimate question in the present case is whether the imposition of a sentence of seven years imprisonment with a non parole period of four years is so outside that notional range and, Berg, given some general similarity of facts and circumstances, can be looked at for guidance. Although both the applicant and Berg had similar concentrations of alcohol as well as some drugs within their bloodstreams, the applicant’s culpability was enhanced by the unchallenged evidence of his recent use of prohibited drug.  
     
      
    24 Whilst I have already cautioned against the dangers of seeking precisely to compare one case with another, it can be observed that there are substantial similarities in some aspects of the present case with Berg. Coincidentally, both cases were dealt with at Lismore District Court and involved accidents in the Northern Rivers area. The alcohol level detected in Berg’s blood was 0.2 and traces were also found of other drugs including morphine and cannabis. However, the expert evidence in the case of Berg was that it was unlikely that he would have been affected to any significant degree by the drug other than alcohol. I have already set out Dr Perl’s opinion regarding the recent consumption of cannabis by the applicant. The report does not disclose the speed at which Berg was travelling but it was at about 1 am and the weather was poor and the tyres on the vehicle were without adequate tread pattern. Both Berg and the applicant had been in a relationship with the female passenger whose death was caused, for a brief period before the accident, although Berg and the deceased woman had not been actually living together. 
     
      
    25 Berg was initially sentenced to five years imprisonment with a non parole period of three years in contrast with the applicant who, as I have said, is sentenced to seven years imprisonment with a non parole period of four years. Berg’s sentence was reduced to what effectively amounted to imprisonment for four years with a non parole period of two years and three months. 
     
      
    26 A question therefore arises as to whether the sentence received by the applicant exceeds an established pattern of sentencing so as to invoke the intervention by this Court. 
     
      
    27 I have mentioned the analyses of cases undertaken in Vukic and Ryan. In R v Cousins [2002] NSWCCA 81 the offender was convicted of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death and also a second count of causing grievous bodily harm. He was driving a stolen motor vehicle and the evidence showed serious risk to many innocent people by a long period of erratic and dangerous driving. He had a record described as appalling. A sentence of eight years imprisonment with a non parole period of six years was effectively imposed. The aggravating features just mentioned were absent in the present case.  
     
      
    28 In R v Jaworowski (1999) 108 A Crim R 489 the offender struck a motorcyclist on a road in suburban Sydney. Tests revealed blood readings of 0.240 grams of alcohol and 0.270 grams. Less than two weeks prior to the offence the offender had been dealt with in the Local Court for high range PCA and disqualified from driving. He also had a previous similar offence. A sentence of eight years imprisonment with a non parole period of five years was the eventual outcome. 
     
      
    29 For ease of reference where sentences were imposed under previous sentencing regimes I have “translated” them into the present form of sentencing. 
     
      
    30 In R v Sen [1999] NSWCCA 199 the offender pleaded guilty to aggravated dangerous driving causing death. He had passed through a red traffic control light and testing revealed a blood alcohol content at 0.219. He was without significant prior record and was sentenced to four years imprisonment with a non parole period of two years three months.  
     
      
    31 In R v Hawkins [2002] NSWCCA 280 the offender received a sentence of five years imprisonment with a non parole period of four years. He was travelling at least 100 kph in a 70 kph area. There was erratic driving prior to the collision. He had prior PCA convictions. On this occasion his alcohol reading was 0.216.  
     
      
    32 In R v Reeves [1999] NSWCCA 269 the offender was convicted of one count of aggravated dangerous driving causing death and two counts of causing grievous bodily harm. The fatally injured victim was a seventeen year old girl. She and one other victim were pedestrians, the other was a passenger in the offender’s car. The aggravating factor was a blood alcohol concentration of at least 0.166 grams per 100 millilitres. The offender had, knowing that she should not, partaken of alcohol after having ingested prescribed medication for a psychiatric condition. The effective sentence was imprisonment for five years with a non parole period of two and half years.  
     
      
    33 In Ryan the offender drove a motor vehicle in a suburban street in Sydney at a speed variously estimated by witnesses as between not less than 90 kilometres an hour and up to 160 kilometres per hour. He collided with a stationary vehicle which was stopped in response to a red traffic control signal. The driver of that vehicle was killed. The offender left the scene. There was no involvement of alcohol or drugs. A sentence of six years imprisonment with four years non parole period was the final outcome.  
     
      
    34 Those references are by no means exhaustive even of the cases of which mention is made in Vukic and Ryan. The issue remains as I have earlier posed.  
     
      
    35 A survey of available material for comparison leads me to the conclusion that the sentence here imposed was excessive. In reaching that conclusion I consider that special regard should be paid to Berg which, as noted, has marked similarities. 
     
      
    36 For the purpose of resentence this Court has been provided with information as to the progress of the applicant whilst in prison. He has responded extremely well and has taken advantage of courses and rehabilitation which is available to him. The Court was informed that the child of whom he had care has been able to be accommodated within his family whilst he is in incarceration. 
     
      
    37 His progress towards rehabilitation appears commendable and the prospect of reoffending can be assessed as low. I would find special circumstances for reasons coordinate with those of the learned first instance sentencing judge. 
     
      
    38 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted; 
       
      (b) Appeal allowed; 
       
      (c) The sentence imposed in the District Court quashed; 
       
      (d) In lieu thereof the applicant sentenced to imprisonment to consist of a non parole period of three years commencing on 27 February 2004 and expiring on 26 February 2007, and a total sentence of imprisonment for six years commencing on 27 February 2004 and expiring on 26 February 2010; 
       
      (e) The first date of eligibility for release to parole specified as 26 February 2007; 
      
    (f) Disqualification ordered in the District Court to stand.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Few in the community would not have heard of Roger Rogerson. A witness called on the offender’s behalf in these proceedings said that the offender once joked that the media had changed his name by deed poll to “disgraced former detective Roger Caleb Rogerson”. Most members of the community would probably have an opinion as to the character of the offender and if that were based on media reports and what were claimed to be dramatisations of Mr Rogerson’s life shown on television. I would expect that those views would be overwhelmingly negative.2 However I am not sentencing Mr Rogerson for committing offences which have been depicted in those dramatisations or alleged in the media. Nor in assessing his character will I take into account material that is not properly before me. I will sentence him for the offence to which he has pleaded guilty, taking into account the matter on the Form 1 and assess the appropriate sentence based on the matters proved before me in evidence.3 When sentencing Mr Rogerson’s wife and co-offender Ann Melocco last year, I set out in some detail the principles which guided me when sentencing for an offence of give false evidence to the Police Integrity Commission. Much of what I said applies equally to this offender. The offender himself was not present when his wife was sentenced nor were many others who have come to Court today. I will therefore spend some time restating the principles which guide me, before moving to the particular circumstances of this offender.4 In common with many other offences, when sentencing for offences involving the giving of false evidence, general deterrence will usually be of prime importance. The reason for this was explained in R v Bulliman CCA unreported 25 February 1993 where Abadee J said; 
     
      
      “False evidence strikes at the whole basis of the administration of justice and indeed, it undermines the whole basis of it. Justice inevitably suffers, whatever be the motive for the making of false statements on oath and whatever be the circumstances in which the offence or offences are committed. 
       
       
      The purpose of an appropriate sentence. In this class or case it’s not only to punish the offender but to deter others and make plain that the commission of this type of offence will normally be visited with serious punishment. General deterrence is the point of importance to be particularly emphasised in this type of case.” 
      
    5 In R v Aristodemou unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 30 June 1994, the Court of Criminal Appeal provided some specific guidance as to how general deterrence is to be achieved. 
     
      
      “Any person who commits an offence of perjury or false swearing in the course of judicial proceedings, or in proceedings such as a Royal Commission or an Independent Commission Against Corruption Inquiry, should do so in the clear understanding that if his offence is detected, he will go to gaol except in particular circumstances”. 
      
    6 In R v Chad unreported 13 May 1997 the Court of Criminal Appeal reaffirmed the principle that a person convicted of giving false evidence in that case before ICAC, should receive a custodial sentence except in very particular circumstances.7 By the time of R v Chapman unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 21 May 1998 Simpson J was able to say, 
     
      
      “The issue was therefore, foreclosed. This court has firmly stated that offences of this nature will be punished by full time custodial sentences”. 
      
    8 Her Honour was there considering a Crown appeal against a sentence imposed for perjury. Her Honour continued. “Absent the extraordinary compelling circumstances” referred to by both Badgery-Parker J in Aristodemou and Chief Judge at Common Law Hunt (in Chad), a custodial sentence should have been imposed.9 This is not to say that sentences of full time custody are inevitable. In R v Fifita where the offender was of prior good character and where there had been unexplained delay in prosecuting him, the Court of Criminal Appeal reduced his sentence to time served pending the appeal.10 These expressions of principle by the Court of Criminal Appeal are helpful because as Hidden J noted in Treglia [2002] NSWCCA 338, 
     
      
      “Sentencing for the crime of perjury is a difficult exercise, for which there is little guidance on precedent. There are only a few decisions of this Court and Judicial Commission statistics are based upon a small sample.”  
      
    11 Of course in determining an appropriate sentence for lying under oath, based on other sentences imposed for similar offences, I must be careful to take into account the particular form of perjury involved. Offences of perjury can, depending on the circumstances, carry maximum penalties of fourteen years, ten years or as in the present case, five years.12 The basic principle made clear by the Court of Criminal Appeal when sentencing for offences of this nature is this: In some cases there may be extraordinary and compelling factors which justify the imposition of a sentence other than a full-time custody, but, ordinarily, a full time custodial sentence is required.13 With that principle in mind, I turn to the particular case before me today.14 Roger Rogerson appears for sentence after pleading guilty to one count of giving false evidence to the Police Integrity Commission. He gave evidence on oath that he did not know that a particular employee of Liverpool City Council was receiving bribes. But that was a lie. When sentencing him for that offence, he asked that I take into account another similar offence relating to other false evidence he gave to the Commission. He said that he could not recall being told that ICAC was interested in him, but that too was a lie. I will explain the context of those two lies in more detail shortly.15 The matter on the form one indicates that there is a need for greater weight to be given to personal deterrence and retribution than would otherwise be the case.16 Roger Rogerson and his wife were good friends of Sam Masri. Masri was the Purchasing Manager at Liverpool City Council and he was blatantly dishonest.17 As part of its ongoing work combating police corruption, in 1998 and 1999, PIC carried out an investigation into the activities of a number of people. In August 1998 PIC intercepted a conversation which indicated that corrupt activity may have been occurring at Liverpool City Council involving Mr Masri. In December 1998 a number of further conversations giving more indications of corrupt activity, were recorded. Information was therefore passed from PIC to ICAC which led to ICAC investigating the activities of Mr Masri. Listening device warrants were granted by which the private conversations of the offender could be monitored and recorded.18 On 19 March 1999, a listening device in Mr Rogerson’s home, picked up a conversation between him and Ray Johnson, a former New South Wales police officer, in which Mr Johnson told Mr Rogerson that a mutual associate, a person known as Laurie had received information from someone at ICAC, that ICAC had intercepted a telephone conversation between Mr Rogerson and Sam Masri and that “The whole thing is going to blow wide open and that it won’t be that long.” 19 The person at ICAC had told Laurie because he thought Mr Rogerson should be careful.20 During the conversation the offender explained to Mr Johnson that Sam Masri received secret commissions of ten per cent, for which if detected, he would serve a sentence of imprisonment. These of course not the exact words used, I have paraphrased them.21 A police officer then on secondment to ICAC was thought to be unlawfully divulging information about ICAC’s activities and so in March 1999, the PIC investigation was extended.22 Both Ms Melocco and the offender were summonsed to give evidence before PIC on 25 May 1999. During her evidence Ms Melocco lied. The offender was present when she did so. He was then called to give evidence. He was asked a number of questions and he also lied.23 In particular, he gave evidence to PIC that he had no recollection of anyone telling him that ICAC may have been interested in him in relation to Liverpool Council. He also gave evidence that he did not know of Sam Masri receiving secret commissions concerning the tendering processes for Liverpool Council.24 Both of these pieces of evidence given by the offender under oath were false and he knew they were false, when he gave that evidence. He had earlier been recorded speaking to Ms Melocco. The effect of that conversation was that the accused told Ms Melocco that Mr Masri, the Purchasing Manager at Liverpool City Council would demand a ten per cent secret commission.25 Counsel questioning the offender at PIC approached the issue of the offender’s knowledge of Mr Masri’s corruption from a number of different directions. On each occasion the offender maintained that he knew nothing about Mr Masri’s wrong doing. In fact in January 1999, the offender had been recording telling Ms Melocco of a conversation he had with a Mr Walden, in which they had agreed to start putting money aside for the ten per cent commission which Mr Masri required.26 All offences of lying under oath are serious but it is important to determine where in the scale of seriousness, this particular offence fits. Mr Steirn’s submission was that his client’s offence was at the lower end of the scale. He relied on a Canadian case which suggested that giving perjured evidence to protect yourself is not as serious as other forms of perjury. There are a few things I should say about that submission. The first is that I do not accept that the offender lied to protect himself. Indeed his evidence himself was that he lied to protect his wife. I do not accept that evidence either because it does not make any sense when the nature of the false evidence is considered. Simply because Ms Melocco denied any knowledge of relevant matters does not mean the offender would get her into trouble by himself admitting that he had such knowledge.27 Another aspect of Mr Steirn’s submission about the offence fitting into the lowest category of seriousness, is that the Canadian decision on which he relied is not concerned with lying to investigatory bodies such as the Police Integrity Commission. Lying to such a Commission is an offence of considerable seriousness. That commission together with other bodies such as ICAC was set up in response to genuine widespread community concern about the level of corruption amongst in the case of PIC, the Police Force of New South Wales. PIC has been given significant powers in order to attempt to deal with police corruption. One of those powers is the ability to call evidence from witnesses but PIC’s ability to do its job will be hindered if those who give evidence before it refuse to tell the truth. The effective functioning of PIC depends on witnesses' truthful evidence. As I have mentioned PIC have a fundamentally important job to perform and offences such as this, which affect its ability to perform that job, are for that reason very serious.28 Also in assessing the seriousness of the offence, I take into account that the offender had the opportunity of considering his position before lying to the Commission. This was not some spur of the moment decision which was immediately regretted. It seems that the offender was upset at being called to give evidence and had no respect for the way the Commission operated. That, plus the desire not to get Mr Masri into trouble, appears to be have been what motivated the offender’s lying.29 It is worth at this stage repeating what Badgery-Parker J said in R v Aristodemou. Although he was there speaking about ICAC, his words were entirely appropriate to the Police Integrity Commission. He said; 
     
      
      “The will of the community which led to and is manifested by the enactment of the ICAC Act, is that corruption should be eradicated from the community and that the means to produce that result should include the co-coercive and inquisitory powers conferred on ICAC by the statute. Where a person acts so as to frustrate an ICAC investigation into corruption, it would appear to me that the community would approve that he should be severely punished.” 
      
    30 The offender joined the police force as a cadet. He was sworn in as a probationary constable in 1960 and spent 24 years as a police officer. During that time he received many commendations and awards, including the Peter Mitchell Award. He achieved fame and notoriety, most obviously when he was charged with a number of serious criminal offences. He was acquitted of some of these but in 1990 he was convicted of conspiring to pervert the course of justice and sent to prison. After being placed before the police tribunal and dismissed as a police officer, in 1984, he set up an engineering business. He also started a scaffolding company, although his work in that enterprise was interrupted by time in custody. In 1999 he formed a company called Scaffco Scaffolding. Photographs were tendered which indicated that a considerable amount of work had gone into that business. However as a result of some publicity being given to the offender’s involvement in this business, ASIC conducted an investigation. It was determined the offender had been managing a corporation within five years of his release from prison. The offender’s evidence was that he did not know that he was committing an offence and it seems that the magistrate accepted that explanation, as he was released on a good behaviour bond.31 The offender was frustrated at having to resign as a director and being unable to manage his own business. The scaffolding business was therefore closed down midway through 2001.32 Since then the offender has performed various sorts of work and now describes himself as an entertainer. He was until recent illness, successful in that endeavour as well. He has also performed work doing public relations work for a fresh fruit company. 33 The offender has a had a number of physical and mental problems over the years. It is not suggested that any of them played a part in the offender’s decision to commit this offence. They are relevant however in assessing the circumstances in which the offender will serve his sentence.34 The offender suffers from high blood pressure, problems with his back and suffered a significant injury to his shoulder in February 2003, which was left him with lasting and serious dysfunction. Mentally he is depressed. The Crown suggested that this related primarily if not exclusively to the present proceedings. Whilst Dr Clark for the accused suggested that other factors were involved such as post traumatic stress disorder. The label which is ascribed to the offender’s mental condition is not as important as the consequences for him. I am satisfied that he is undergoing a great deal of stress, is significantly depressed and perhaps most importantly, these matters will not resolve themselves whilst in custody. I will take into account that a full time custodial sentence will be harder on the offender because of his mental condition.35 One of the matters which I must assess in determining the appropriate sentence on the offender concerns his character. As I have mentioned there would be few in the community who did not have an opinion on the offender’s character based on newspaper reports and television programs. Some of that material may be fact, while some may be fiction and even fantasy. I will assess the character of the offender and his prospects for rehabilitation, based on the evidence I have before me. That material indicates that the offender has done many good and worthwhile things. There is much in Mr Rogerson’s life about which he is entitled to be proud. There are many aspects of the offender’s character which are admirable and he was able to call a great deal of evidence which demonstrated the offender’s kindness towards others. He has helped friends, family and strangers. He has assisted in raising money for various charities for example the Oncology Unit at Westmead Children’s Hospital and a young girl with cerebral palsy. He has donated a considerable sum of money himself. He helps his father-in-law, his mother and even children in Swaziland through World Vision Australia. He acted bravely at times when serving as a police officer. 36 Mr Winterbottom was one of those who gave evidence as to the offender’s good character in certain respects. He accurately summed up what that evidence revealed as to Mr Rogerson’s good work. He said that the offender “gave generously of himself”. The evidence that I heard as to the good works done by Mr Rogerson, demonstrated the accuracy of that description. One particular matter which Mr Winterbottom referred to, was that Mr Rogerson donated a speaking fee and his share of the profits, amounting to some $10,000 to a charity with which Mr Winterbottom was associated. Mr Winterbottom’s evidence demonstrated that Mr Rogerson gave generously of himself, not only in giving up his time to assist others, but also in more concrete terms by giving up money, and substantial amounts at that.37 It was Mr Rogerson’s giving up of his time to assist Mr Pace, which led to him suffering his shoulder injury when the shed he was demolishing for Mr Pace collapsed and he was trapped before being rescued and taken to hospital. He is entitled to be proud of his work record too, running successful businesses until circumstances beyond his control intervened. He then in effect began a new career as a successful entertainer although as I have mentioned, he has had to give that up recently when he became ill.38 The offender is entitled to have those aspects of his character taken into account in his favour, when I assess the sentence to impose upon him. 39 He has also assisted the authorities in a particular way regarding the investigation of a serious crime. I have taken that last matter into account after considering s23 of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act. This is not only evidence relevant to his character but also entitles him to a reduction in the sentence I would otherwise have imposed, independent of that consideration.40 Although I have referred to the very impressive evidence as to the accused’s good character, it is important to remember the principles of law which I must follow where there is evidence of good character concerning some aspects of an offender’s personality, but where the offence relates to an entirely different aspect of his character. There are some similarities between the present case and that of Chad. The offender in Chad had also much to be proud of. He had displayed exemplary conduct as a police officer and as a volunteer lifesaver, had demonstrated courage and even heroism. Yet as the Court of Criminal Appeal pointed out, his offences involved dishonesty of a high order, in that he knowingly gave false evidence before ICAC. The Court said, “in those circumstances, less weight must be given to evidence of his character as a courageous and efficient police officer and life saver”.41 But I repeat, that is not to ignore those aspects of the offender’s good character which are very impressive indeed.42 When dealing with the offender’s character, the evidence is of course, not all one way. It has to be said that the offender has at times acted in a way which suggests he does not accept that he is obliged to play by the rules. The most obvious example of this is of course his conviction for conspiring to pervert the course of justice, but there are other indications of this attitude as well. Part of his work as an entertainer involves telling audiences about his experience as a police officer in which it seems from what the offender told me himself about what he did, he passes on the message that things were better in the olden days when police officers were not hamstrung, by the need to act strictly in accordance with their lawful obligations. 43 He also, as is clear from the material before me, was quite prepared to pay Mr Masri a bribe, in order to secure work for his business from Liverpool City Council. That the offender lied to the Police Integrity Commission even after having been given a chance to reflect on matters, is consistent with the way I have described this aspect of the offender’s character. 44 Since he told the lies and realised almost immediately that the authorities knew that he had lied, the offender has been in a state of uncertainty as to what would eventually happen to him. This has no doubt been a stressful period of his life. Adding to that stress was the realisation that for a lengthy period, the authorities were listening to what took place in his homes and car. It does not take much imagination to realise the effect that such revelations would have on a relationship between husband and wife.45 The offender gave evidence that once these matters were behind him he intended to move to Tasmania with his wife. He has a job lined up there and he could still perform his entertainment work, which involves shows throughout Australia.46 Although the offender told his lie in May 1999 and the authorities knew that it was a lie as soon as he told it, it was not until over three years later that he learnt that he was to be prosecuted. As the Courts have pointed out on a number of occasions, it is somewhat incongruous for the authorities to proceed at a leisurely pace in prosecuting offences such as this and then when they eventually come to Court, point out the seriousness of such offences and a need for sentences which reflect general deterrence. Such an attitude is not to be encouraged. No doubt the Police Integrity Commission wished to complete the large operation and investigation it was running before making recommendations. However, that ignores the need for criminal offences to be processed at a reasonable speed. I will not repeat what the authorities say about the effect of delay in sentencing, beyond noting that it entitles the offender to this case, to a considerable measure of leniency.47 Under s21A of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act I am required to assess whether the offender has “good prospects for rehabilitation”, the onus being on the offender to demonstrate that that situation exists.48 Part of the evidence on which the offender relied was the opinion of Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist Dr Clark. However in response to that opinion the Crown relied on an opinion of another Forensic Psychiatrist, Dr Greenberg. Dr Clark was of the opinion that the offender “was most unlikely to offend again” but Dr Greenberg disagreed.49 I note of course that the test under 21A is not whether the offender is “most unlikely” to re-offend, but whether he has good prospects for rehabilitation. With that in mind however, let me turn to some aspects of Dr Greenberg’s evidence.50 The first aspect concerns whether he took into account in assessing the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation, that the offender had been charged with other matters in South Australia. I am of the view that unless the offender is convicted of those charges, they should not be used as a predictor, of whether he is likely to offend again. It is entirely possible that the offender will be acquitted of the South Australian matters and so it is obviously unfair to him to take the fact that he has been charged in South Australia, into account in assessing his prospects for re-offending.51 It seems to me that Dr Greenberg did take the fact that he was charged into account, in coming to his opinion that Dr Clark’s opinion should not be accepted. At p9 of his first report which is exhibit G Dr Greenberg goes through a number of factors concerning the offender’s criminal history before saying this. 
     
      
      “He states very recently that he has very recently been charged again in South Australia. I am therefore of the opinion that I could not agree with the statement made in Dr Clark’s report that Mr Rogerson is most unlikely to re-offend again.” 
      
    52 The second aspect of Dr Greenberg’s opinion regarding the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation concerns the offence of managing a corporation within five years of release from prison. As I have noted the offender pleaded guilty to this charge but was released under s20 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. It seems to be accepted by the Crown in this case that that offence was committed inadvertently in the sense that the offender had no idea that it was an offence for him to manage a corporation within five years of being released from prison. That offence was therefore not a case where the offender deliberately chose to break the law. After some questioning by me Dr Greenberg concluded that his assessment of the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation would change if he was of the view that the second offence had been committed inadvertently. He would still disagree with Dr Clark’s statement. He was “most unlikely to re-offend” but as I have noted, that is not the test under 21A.53 The opinions of the psychiatrists are of course not to be ignored but ultimately it is for me to make my assessment based on such things as the offender’s attitude to this offence. The consequences which he has suffered following its commission, his plans for the future and so on.54 I also take into account that Mr Rogerson has been subject to a great deal of surveillance which did not apparently reveal that he was committing criminal offences. It is obviously important in assessing the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation, that I take into account the absence of any suggestion of the offender committing other offences despite him having been subject to extensive observations by law enforcement officers.55 I am satisfied that the offender does have good prospects for rehabilitation. Perhaps foremost in my mind in coming to that view is the deterrent aspect of what has happened to the offender since committing the offence, as well as what will happen to him once I pass sentence.56 The offender is entitled to a lower sentence because of his plea of guilty. He is entitled to a utilitarian discount but the plea of guilty is also relevant as being evidence of his remorse.57 Dealing firstly with the utilitarian benefit. I note that this is a plea entered only shortly before the offender’s trial was due to commence. It was not an early plea by any means. Although he had originally been charged with a large number of offences, there was nothing to stop the offender pleading guilty to this offence earlier than he did. It may have been that he was badly advised or it may have been that the Crown did not serve statements until late but the offender himself knew whether he was guilty or not and could have pleaded guilty at an earlier stage.58 However of course the offender is still entitled to a utilitarian discount. The trial would have been reasonably lengthy. Although the offender cannot get the benefit having pleaded guilty at an early stage, he will nevertheless get a significant and measurable utilitarian discount. I will not quantify it separately from the discount to which the offender is entitled by reason of his assistance to the authorities. Combining those two factors together means the offender’s sentence will be about twenty per cent lower than it would otherwise have been, because of his plea of guilty and his assistance.59 Also under s 21A I am to asses “whether the offender has shown remorse for the offence”. Remorse can take a number of forms. A person can be sorry for having committed an offence because they were caught and must be punished. A person can also be sorry for having committed an offence because they realise it was the wrong thing to do. There is a great deal of evidence to establish that the offender is remorseful in the first sense, to which I have referred. He has suffered a great as a result of committing the offence and will continue to suffer whilst undergoing the sentence I will shortly impose.60 Not without some hesitation I also accept the offender is remorseful in the other sense to which I referred. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he has regretted his behaviour flows not only from the consequences for him but also because he realised that lying to the Police Integrity Commission, was simply the wrong thing to do. 61 It is accepted by the Crown that the offender will have to serve any sentence of full time custody on protection. Enquiries suggest that in all probability that would be at Cooma Gaol. Cooma is some distance away from where his friends and family live in Sydney. His wife is currently serving a sentence of periodic detention and works five days a week. This will make it difficult if not impossible for her to visit the offender in Cooma Gaol, at least on a regular basis. I will take that matter into account.62 The Crown tendered material relating to the circumstances under which prisoners at Cooma Gaol serve their sentences. In contrast to what has traditionally been understood as the circumstances under which protection prisoners serve their sentences in other gaols, in Cooma it appears that the conditions of custody are not significantly harsher than those of the general prison population.63 I now turn to the issue of comparative sentences for offences such as this. Researches of Counsel have borne out what Hidden J said in Treglia. “As I noted earlier” he said , 
     
      
       
      “there are only a few decisions of this Court and judicial commission statistics are based on a small sample. It is for that reason it is perhaps more helpful to be guided by statements of principle rather than sentence imposed in other cases.”  
      
     But with that qualification I take into account Mr Steirn’s submission that the longest sentence imposed for an offence of this nature, is one of two years in the case of Irwin. Of course as the Crown points out that sentence was imposed following a Crown appeal and were it not for that circumstance, a much longer sentence could have been expected. I note also that many of the prosecution for offences of this nature are dealt with in the Local Court. I take into account that this offence is one with which the Local Court can deal in appropriate circumstances and that in the Local Court there is a two year jurisdictional limit. 64 It was Mr Stern’s submission that whilst the general principle is that fulltime custodial sentences are generally required, there were sufficiently exceptional circumstances in this case to justify a different form of sentence. He relied on a combination of factors to which I have earlier referred such as delay, the offence being at the lower end of the scale in terms of its seriousness, the offender’s mental condition, the circumstances in which a full-time period of custody would be served a Cooma Gaol and so on. I have dealt with each of those matters in these remarks on sentence. I do not consider that those factors on which Mr Stern relied do establish sufficient, exceptional circumstances. I consider that this is one of those cases where a fulltime custodial sentence is required.65 Full-time custody is required in this case because of the seriousness of the offence. The Police Integrity Commission was endeavouring to identify and weed out corruption. The Commission has the overwhelming support of the community in that task. General deterrence requires that those who are called before ICAC or PIC or other Commissions of Inquiry with investigative powers, understand that they must tell the truth and if they fail to do so, they will be severely punished. The offender must also himself be severely punished for what he has done. It was not for him to decide whether to tell the truth to PIC based on this perception of the way PIC was operated, or his attitude towards counsel asking him questions or his frustration at being called before the Commission in the first place. 66 There is a tendency sometimes in sentencing to focus on the offender and to put to one side the offence. Yet in truth the assessment of the seriousness of an offence and the need to ensure that the sentence reflects the objective criminality of an offender’s conduct is fundamental. For that reason full time custody is required.67 I will however find special circumstances. Those circumstances relate to the offender’s age and his health.68 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for two and a half years. That is to commence today. I set a non-parole period of one year, which will expire on 17 February, 2006, at which time I order that the offender be released to parole.  **********

     REGINA v Joanne Maree KILLEN 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: I have read Hidden J’s judgment in draft and have concluded that, for the reasons given by his Honour, the Crown appeal against sentence should be dismissed. I have reached that conclusion, only after considerable hesitation. The conclusion depends very much on the peculiar combination of circumstances in this case and the decision of this Court should not be regarded as lending any support to a general proposition that a person who received social security benefits to which he or she was not entitled can avoid an immediately effective custodial sentence because of a belief that the benefits were needed in order to pay for alcohol or drugs to which the person was addicted.  
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: This is an appeal by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions against a sentence passed upon the respondent, Joanne Maree Killen, in the District Court after she pleaded guilty to a charge of defrauding the Commonwealth, an offence under s29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (C’th) which carries a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment. She was sentenced to imprisonment for twenty-one months from the date on which sentence was passed, 19 August 2004, but the sentencing judge directed, pursuant to s21(1)(b) of the Act, that she be released immediately upon recognisance. The recognisance was conditioned that she be of good behaviour for the period of the sentence and accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. Pursuant to s21B of the Act, his Honour ordered her to pay reparation to the Commonwealth in the sum of $95,852.09.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 On 15 September 1987 the respondent gave birth to a daughter, and from October of that year she began to receive a sole parent pension and related benefits from the Department of Social Security, now Centrelink. Put shortly, the offence was that she continued to receive those benefits for a period of about nine years between 1992 and 2001 when the child was no longer with her, but was in the care of her parents. Not only did she fail to disclose to the department that the child was no longer in her care, she represented that she was in documents she was required to fill out for the purpose of periodic review of her entitlements. 
     
      
    4 Over the nine year period she was overpaid $102,321.86. By the time she appeared for sentence she had repaid $6,469.77, leaving the amount which I have referred to above which was ordered to be paid by way of reparation. She declined to be interviewed when she was arrested, but she had made relevant admissions to officers of Centrelink when the matter was first investigated.  
     
      
       
      Subjective Case 
       
      
    5 The respondent was thirty-nine years old at the time of sentence and is now forty. She has previous convictions, which the sentencing judge did not consider to be of any real significance for the purpose of the case at hand. In this appeal no issue was taken with that assessment. His Honour had before him a pre-sentence report, several medical reports and psychiatric reports, together with a social work report. He observed of the applicant that her life “has certainly been far from easy”.  
     
      
    6 It is unnecessary to recite in detail the background set out in those reports. For a period of about six months in her early teens she was sexually abused by her father. Although she ultimately re-established a satisfactory relationship with him, this appears to have been the source of her decline. Behavioural difficulties at school led to her expulsion just before her fifteenth birthday. Thereafter, she worked in several unskilled jobs for short periods but her employment was compromised by her escalating substance abuse. She used drugs but her major problem was her excessive use of alcohol from the age of fifteen, which developed into a severe and enduring alcohol dependence.  
     
      
    7 From the same age she embarked upon a rather sordid, promiscuous lifestyle, and had several relationships with men which were unsatisfactory and sometimes abusive. She had her daughter with her for several years before she asked her parents to take her because, as a result of her drinking, she could not adequately care for her.  
     
      
    8 Her alcoholism has had serious effects upon her health. Apart from asthma, she has hepatitis C and suffers from vitamin C deficiency. Since March 2003 she has been wheelchair bound because of peripheral neuropathy to her lower limbs secondary to small vessel vasculitis. Mr John Lyons, a mental health nurse to whom she was referred in early 2003 by her general practitioner, reported that she was suffering from “severe depression, combined with multiple long-term psychosocial issues with origins from prejudicial childhood experiences”. At the end of that year a psychiatrist, Dr Samuels, also diagnosed substance-induced persisting dementia, and after a further consultation in 2004 he thought it possible that she had the symptoms of post-traumatic stress. 
     
      
    9 It seems that she also developed a gambling problem, although the evidence about this is rather spare. She told Dr Samuels that she had been spending her Centrelink payments in gambling on poker machines and that, as a result, her rent and other bills were not being paid. For how long that had been going on is not clear. She told Mr Joseph Hillard, the author of the pre-sentence report, that her offence was “directly the result of her drinking and gambling”. That said, all of the various experts who provided reports saw her alcoholism as the central issue to be addressed and none of them referred to the gambling as a separate problem to be dealt with.  
     
      
    10 At the time of sentence, however, her future was not entirely bleak. She had had the benefit of a stable relationship for several years with a responsible man, whom she had married in March 2003. He gave evidence, and it is apparent that he had been and remained supportive of her, and had done his best to help her deal with her drinking and her health problems. While she was still drinking heavily on a daily basis, she had reduced her intake to some extent. His Honour, having described most of her life as “disorganised and dysfunctional”, observed that “her present state probably represents a period of greater stability” than she had experienced since her teenage years. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing judge’s approach 
       
      
    11 His Honour recognised the undoubted seriousness of the offence and the need for deterrence, accepting that the applicant had to establish “very special or exceptional circumstances” to avoid a full-time custodial sentence. No doubt, that expression was derived from the judgment of Carruthers AJ in R v Howe [2000] NSWCCA 405 at [13], where his Honour referred to “the long line of authority … in which it has been held that general deterrence is a predominant consideration when sentencing for offences of defrauding the revenue, and that a sentence of full-time custody is required unless there are very special circumstances or, as is sometimes said, exceptional circumstances or extraordinary circumstances”. 
     
      
    12 In the present case his Honour distinguished between frauds based on greed and those based on “a perceived need”, acknowledging that the latter still called for custodial sentences in the absence of “very special circumstances”. This was a reference to R v Purdon (NSWCCA 27 March 1997 unreported) per Hunt CJ at CL at 7. He found that the applicant’s offence was the product of perceived need, adding that it was “certainly not a case where the offender set out to create circumstances where she would be able to defraud the revenue”. He later said that the offence “represented not a deliberate decision to embark upon a criminal offence but to allow to continue, and to positively assist in the continuation of, payments to which, at one stage, the offender had been entitled but to which, upon her surrendering the care of her child to her mother, she ceased to have any entitlement”. He concluded that “ultimately, her gambling and, more particularly, her drinking addiction meant that she needed every cent she could get to feed that habit”. 
     
      
    13 It was in this, in combination with a series of other factors, that his Honour found the special circumstances justifying the course which he took. Those other factors were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) her reduced culpability arising from her severe alcoholism, which was itself “a by-product of her traumatic adolescent years”; 
        
       
       (2) her admissions in the Centrelink investigation and her plea of  
       
       guilty, entered upon her arraignment in the District Court; 
       
       (3) the absence of any relevant criminal history; 
       
        
        (4) the “parlous” state of her physical and psychological health, including her confinement to a wheelchair; 
        
       
       (5) her relative stability, with the support of her husband, at the  
       
       time of sentence; 
       
       (6) the unlikelihood of her committing further offences, certainly 
       
       of the kind under consideration. 
       
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    14 In this Court the Crown prosecutor submitted that, quite apart from the order that the respondent be released on recognisance, the sentence of imprisonment for 21 months is manifestly inadequate. However, his submissions were directed primarily to the fact that the sentence had been wholly suspended. It was argued that his Honour fell into error in classifying the offence as one driven by perceived need and that, in any event, that finding was given a significance that it did not deserve. Generally, it was argued that there were not the special circumstances justifying a disposition other than a full-time custodial sentence to be actually served. 
     
      
    15 On the question of perceived need, it true that his Honour found that the applicant had squandered the proceeds of her fraud on alcohol and gambling rather than spending them on the necessities of life. In this respect, the case is very different from R v Aller [2004] NSWCCA 378, to which reference was made by counsel for the respondent. Although the offender in that case had spent some of the proceeds of her offences on gambling, the sentencing judge found that her primary motivation was to obtain money to support her seriously disabled son. So also is it different from Purdon (supra) in which the offender had spent the money in caring for her children and buying things for the household, in the absence of adequate support from her estranged husband.  
     
      
    16 In the present case gambling appears to have been a secondary consideration. In context, I take his Honour’s reference to perceived need to be a recognition that her offences were driven by her alcoholism (as, his Honour found, had been her previous offences.) Moreover, that alcoholism was the product of the sexual abuse which she had endured when she was still an adolescent. In that sense, the notion of perceived need is directly related to the first of the six factors set out above, that is, her reduced culpability arising from her addiction. 
     
      
    17 In R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J devoted most of their judgments to the relevance of drug addiction to sentencing. What they wrote is, of course, equally applicable to alcohol addiction. Adapting the words of the Chief Judge to the present case, it could be said that the respondent’s addiction “was not a matter of personal choice but was attributable to” events for which she “was not primarily responsible”: Henry in par [273](c)(ii) (p 398). It could also be said that her alcohol abuse began when she was young, when her “ability to exercise appropriate judgment or choice was incomplete”: ibid.  
     
      
    18 The observations of Simpson J in pars [336-348] (pp 410-413), with which I respectfully agree, are also apposite. Directly on point, her Honour observed at par [336] (pp410-11): 
     
      
       
        
        In this Court, one sometimes sees cases in which drug taking stems from sexual assault or exploitation, sometimes committed when the person who turns to drugs, and who comes before the Court, is very young, and sometimes the precipitating events have occurred many years before. Drug addiction is not always the disease; it is, as often as not, a symptom of social disease.  
        
       
      
    19 Viewed in this way, the respondent’s offence could fairly be described as the product of perceived need rather than greed. This, in any event, was but one of a number of matters upon which his Honour relied to find special or exceptional circumstances, and it is important to remember that it was in the combination of those matters that he found the justification for the course which he took. Even the poor state of her health was not considered, standing alone, to be sufficient to avoid a term of actual custody, his Honour saying no more than that in that respect the case “falls close to the borderline…”.  
     
      
    20 Clearly, this is a most serious offence, involving a substantial sum of money obtained by persistent fraud over an extended period of time. The wholly suspended sentence which his Honour passed was undoubtedly a very lenient outcome. Nevertheless, it cannot be said that it was not open to his Honour to find in the evidence the exceptional circumstances warranting that disposition. This was a very sad case, given the respondent’s background. Although she now has the support of her husband, she clearly has a long way to go to deal with her alcohol addiction. Nevertheless, it was a case in which it was appropriate “for the rehabilitative aspects of sentencing to assume a more significant role than might otherwise be the case”: Henry, per Simpson J at par [344] (p412). 
     
      
    21 I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    22 Since preparing these reasons I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of James J. Of course, this case turns on its own facts and I agree with his Honour’s concluding observation. 
     
      
    23 BELL J: I agree with Hidden J

     Judgment 
     
     
      
     
     
      
    1 HUNT AJA: Mr Justice James will give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: This matter was referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal by his Honour Greg James J for a review of the sentences imposed on Ronald James Suey (whom I will refer to as “the applicant”) by her Honour Judge Morgan in the District Court on 18 September 1998. 
     
      
    3 In a trial conducted before her Honour and a jury in September 1998 the jury found the applicant guilty on all nine charges in the indictment which had been presented against him. All of the offences had been committed on the night of 29 and 30 November 1996 in a remote rural area of New South Wales. The victim of most, but not all, of the offences was a fifteen-year-old girl, whom I will refer to simply as “the complainant”. 
     
      
    4 The various charges in the indictment were:  
     
      
       
      Count 1. A charge of possessing an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely, armed robbery. This was an offence under s 33B(1)(a) of the  
      Crimes Act 
      , for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for twelve years. 
       
       
      Count 2. A charge of breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing a serious indictable offence therein being assault occasioning actual bodily harm, in circumstances of special aggravation being that the applicant was armed with an offensive weapon (a shotgun) and the applicant maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm upon the victim, who was a young man named Steven Canfell. This was an offence under s 112(3) of the  
      Crimes Act 
      , for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for twenty-five years. 
       
       
      Count 3. A charge of kidnapping under s 90A of the  
      Crimes Act 
       (since repealed) for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for twenty years. The victim of this offence was the complainant. 
       
       
      Counts 4 to 9 in the indictment were all charges of having had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting, in circumstances of aggravation, the circumstances of aggravation being that the applicant was in the company of other persons and that the complainant was under the age of sixteen years. This was an offence under s 61J of the  
      Crimes Act 
      , 
        
      for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for twenty years. 
       
      
    5 In sentencing the applicant for the various offences her Honour Judge Morgan following the sentencing practice which was commonly adopted in this State before the decision of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 of assessing the total criminality of the applicant in all the offences and reflecting that assessment in the sentence for one of the offences (“the leading sentence”) and making the sentences for all the other offences fixed terms of imprisonment concurrent with part of the leading sentence. 
     
      
    6 Her Honour selected the offence charged in the second count of the indictment of breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing a serious felony therein, in circumstances of special aggravation, as being the offence for which she would impose the leading sentence. For that offence her Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of twenty years, with a minimum term of fifteen years and an additional term of five years. For the offence charged in the first count in the indictment her Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of six years. For the offence charged in the third count in the indictment her Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of ten years. For each of the offences of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation her Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of fifteen years. 
     
      
    7 Her Honour ordered that all of the sentences commence from 17 November 1997. The applicant had been arrested on 30 November 1996 and had remained in custody up until the time he was sentenced. However, her Honour found in her remarks on sentence that the applicant’s custody up until 17 November 1997 had not been exclusively referable to the offences for which he was being sentenced by her Honour. 
     
      
    8 In her remarks on sentence her Honour stated the facts of the offences and, as the outcome of the review by this Court of her Honour’s sentences depends, to a considerable extent, on the degree of the objective gravity of the offences and there has been no challenge on this review to any of the facts stated by her Honour, I propose to incorporate in this judgment all of her Honour’s statement of the facts of the offences, substituting the expression “the complainant” for the complainant’s real name and also altering other names or expressions which would tend to identify the complainant.  
     
      
    9 At pp 2 to 8 of her Honour’s remarks on sentence her Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The facts of this case are that on about 19 November 1996 the complainant, who was then aged 15, left her home in Newcastle and went to Baan Baa to act as a nanny for the children of Mr Steven Atkin, also known as Buster Atkin, who is an old friend of her mother’s. The children were Angela, then aged 8, Steven, aged 6, and Jessica, 15 months old. It was intended that the complainant should act in this position to enable Mr Atkin to work during the cotton chipping season. 
         
        During the week prior to 29 November Mr Atkin was in Newcastle. When he returned to Baan Baa, he was accompanied by the complainant’s mother, who had come up to see her daughter and see how she was coping, and she intended to stay for a couple of days. 
         
         
        While Mr Atkin was in Newcastle the prisoner called at the house and asked to see Mr Atkin. He was told by the complainant that Buster Atkin was not there. At the same time the prisoner asked if there was any ""goey"", apparently referring to amphetamine or speed. As well, during Mr Atkin's absence in Newcastle some men arrived at the property very late at night in a Hilux utility and banged on the doors yelling out for Buster or his wife Tanya. Steven Canfell, a young man of 20 years who was also living in the house during the cotton chipping season, told them to go, as Buster was not there. 
         
         
        On Wednesday 27 November the prisoner came to the property just on dark in a white Hilux utility and spoke to Mr Atkin, who had by then returned from Newcastle. He told Mr Atkin that he wanted to buy some cannabis and that he had $500 to burn. Mr Atkin was acquainted with the accused through his former wife Tanya, who apparently had some involvement with cannabis and the supply thereof, but he had not seen or spoken to the prisoner since 1995. Mr Atkin told the prisoner he would make enquiries and to ring him on Friday the 29th to ascertain whether it was available. Mr Atkin said in evidence he had no intention of obtaining any drugs and was simply trying to get rid of the prisoner by telling him that. 
         
         
        On Friday 29 November, Mr Atkin was to drive the complainant’s mother home to Newcastle. They left the house at Baan Baa at about 10.20pm, leaving the complainant, the three children, and Steven Canfell at the house. After they left Mr Canfell went to bed, the complainant checked that the children were asleep and the house was locked, and then went to bed in the front bedroom where the youngest child Jessica was also sleeping. 
         
         
        Not long afterwards there was a loud banging on the back door. Steven Canfell went to the door carrying with him a rifle which contained one cartridge. The person at the back door was yelling out for Buster. He said he was Ronald Suey, and he wanted to see Buster. Mr Canfell could hear other people running around outside the house calling out for Buster and Tanya. Steven Canfell did not open the door but told the man outside that Buster was not there, that there were children in the house, and to go away. 
         
         
        Mr Canfell then looked up the hallway and saw the complainant coming out from the bedroom. She told him that there was someone at the front door. He motioned to her to go back into the bedroom and he moved towards the front door. He then saw the wood in the door splintering as if someone was kicking it. He then heard a gun shot and saw a flash of flame through the front door, and then felt pain in his foot. He was later treated for pellet wounds. The wounding of Mr Canfell was a circumstance of special aggravation in that offence of breaking and entering. Mr Canfell then discharged his rifle into the floor near the front door,in panic, as he said in evidence, and realising the seriousness of the situation, he jumped through a window and ran some hundreds of metres to a neighbour to summon assistance. 
         
         
        The complainant was in the bedroom when she heard the gun fire and saw flashes of flame coming from the front door. She picked up the baby, who was screaming, to comfort it. She then saw two men come into the bedroom, one a man in a black beanie who was the prisoner, and another man who she later heard called Mitchell, and whose name was Mitchell Woodhead. The prisoner was holding a shotgun and grabbed her around the neck and asked her, ""Who fired the shot?"" The other man was carrying a wooden tomahawk with which he smashed light globes in the bedroom and hallway. 
         
         
        The complainant, who was still holding the baby, was dragged from room to room through the house by the prisoner,who was looking for Canfell. The other two children were screaming and crying and she tried to comfort them by telling them everything would be all right. She was dragged outside house where she saw two other men, one younger than the other. That person was JW and the other was Leonard Talbot. The prisoner told her to hand the baby over to Angela, which she did, and she then said to the prisoner, ""Don't hurt me. I am just the nanny, don't take me away"". But she was told to, ""Shut up and get in the truck"". 
         
         
        She was forced into the Hilux utility which was then driven off by Mitchell Woodhead. Leonard Talbott was next to Woodhead, and the prisoner was next to the passenger door. The complainant was seated on the prisoner's lap. JW was in the tray of the utility. The shot gun was placed on the dashboard of the vehicle in front of her by the prisoner. 
         
         
        She said in evidence that she saw on the dashboard a digital clock which showed the time as 11.06. The vehicle was driven a couple of kilometres from Atkin's house and stopped on the side of the road. The complainant was forced out of the car, told to drop her pyjama pants and underpants, that was the clothing that she had changed into to go to bed before these men arrived. She refused, and one of the men pulled them down. She was then forced to fellate the prisoner, who was seated side-on in the driver's seat. This was the basis of the first sexual intercourse count, count 4. 
         
         
        While she was doing this she was being penetrated from behind both vaginally and anally, although she was unable to say by whom. Another man took the accused's place and she was forced to fellate him while again she was being assaulted from behind. 
         
         
        Another vehicle approached. The complainant was forced back into the motor vehicle which was then driven away down other roads until finally it was driven into a paddock and stopped some 300 metres from the road. Again she was forced from the car, her clothes were forcibly removed, and she again was forced to fellate the prisoner while he sat side on in the passenger seat. This is the basis for count 5. 
         
         
        At some stage she stopped and asked if she could be taken back to Baan Baa. Mitchell Woodhead then held a knife to her throat and told her she had three more to go. She was forced to perform fellatio on each of the other three men. Those are the acts relied upon for counts 7, 8 and 9, the accused being a participant in the joint criminal enterprise. 
         
         
        During the whole of this time she was crying and asking them not to hurt her and take her back to the children. She was told by the prisoner to climb on to the tray of the utility, and while she was sitting on the tray he forcibly had vaginal intercourse with her. This formed the basis of count 6. 
         
         
        She was then subjected to repeated sexual assaults by the men, in which her arms were held and her mouth and vagina concurrently penetrated. A final contemptible act was committed upon her whilst she was sitting on the tray when JW urinated over her, and in coarse language the prisoner abused JW for his action because they would then not be able to engage in further sexual activity. 
         
         
        The complainant's clothes were then thrown at her, she dressed, and was forced back into the utility which was driven out of the paddock. She was seated on the accused's lap and as the car was driven along the road towards Baan Baa she was forced to fellate the driver Mitchell Woodhead, and then Leonard Talbot, who was seated in the middle. 
         
         
        Shortly after this happened a police car drove past their car and then turned to follow the utility. The prisoner threw the shotgun out the window. The car continued down the road and it was stopped at a police road block. The complainant was told not to say anything, ""Or we'll shoot you"". The complainant got out of the utility and ran to the police. She was hysterical and crying uncontrollably. It took police officers some time to calm her. 
         
         
        The four men were arrested and later the prisoner declined to be interviewed. The shotgun was later recovered from the side of the road by the police and found to be loaded. In the motor vehicle police found a tomahawk, wooden club, and two knives, one of 14 centimetres long, the other a 13 centimetre double bladed knife. 
         
         
        At about 3 o'clock that morning, on the morning of 30 November, the complainant was examined by Dr Ramsay at the Narrabri Hospital. The doctor's findings noted that the complainant was upset and crying, dishevelled, and had difficulty walking. There were abrasions on her back, thigh, inner thighs, and bruises. There was dirt around her lips and a bruise on her posterior palate. Her external genitalia were very swollen and tender. There was also dirt in her vagina and anus. There were also abrasions to her perineum and the perineum skin. She said in evidence that her findings on examination were consistent with repeated forcible sexual intercourse. 
         
         
        In her statement given to police on 30 November and 1 December the complainant said she was sore, aching and tender in many parts of her body. She said that as a result of the offences committed against her she felt very embarrassed, scared, humiliated, and dirty all over. That she was having flashbacks of what happened and she was crying ""heaps"". 
         
        
       
      
    10 In her Honour’s remarks on sentence her Honour made further findings about the objective facts of the offences. She found that the applicant and the co-offenders had gone to Mr Atkin’s house on the night of 29 November 1996 with the intention of robbing him. Her Honour accepted that the offences committed against the complainant had not been pre-meditated when the offenders went to Mr Atkin’s house but that, when the complainant was taken from the house, the intention of the offenders was to sexually assault her. 
     
      
    11 Her Honour accepted a submission made by counsel for the applicant in the proceedings on sentence that the applicant was not to be regarded as having exhibited greater criminality than the other offenders. However, her Honour proceeded to say that the applicant could be considered to be one of the principals, in that it was he who had made arrangements to obtain drugs from Mr Atkin, it was he who, prior to 29 November, had made enquiries at Mr Atkin’s house, it was he who had broken into the house on 29 November, it was he who was holding the shotgun when he and Woodhead entered the house and it was he who had grabbed the complainant inside the house and had dragged her outside the house. 
     
      
    12 In her remarks on sentence her Honour referred to some of the subjective features of the applicant. At the time he was sentenced he was thirty-four years old. He had a large number of convictions in the Local Court, including convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault, for which he had received prison sentences. The applicant had conceded that he had a problem with alcohol and that he got into fights every time he drank alcohol. The applicant suffered from hepatitis C and an earlier trial before her Honour on the same charges had been aborted at an advanced stage, because of the sudden illness of the applicant from his hepatitis. 
     
      
    13 The applicant had, of course, pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. In the proceedings on sentence the applicant continued to deny that he had committed any of the offences and her Honour found that the applicant had not shown any contrition. 
     
      
    14 In the proceedings on sentence counsel for the applicant had submitted that, in accordance with the principle of parity in the sentencing of co-offenders, the sentencing judge should take into consideration the sentences imposed on the co-offenders Talbot and JW. Before referring to what her Honour said in her remarks on sentence about this submission, I will briefly outline the history of the criminal proceedings against the co-offenders. 
     
      
    15 JW who was a juvenile, pleaded guilty to the three charges preferred against him, which were of an offence under s 33B of the Crimes Act, an offence under s 89 of the Crimes Act (since repealed) of detaining a female with intent to carnally know her and an offence under 61J of aggravated sexual assault. JW was sentenced in the District Court to an effective sentence of four years with a minimum term of two years.  
     
      
    16 The co-offender Leonard Talbot pleaded guilty to the three charges which were preferred against him, of (1) breaking and entering a dwelling house in circumstances of special aggravation (2) taking away a female with intent to carnally know her and (3) having sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, the circumstances of aggravation being the same as those alleged against the applicant.  
     
      
    17 The primary sentencing judge imposed sentences on Talbot amounting to an effective sentence of seven years with a minimum term of four years. The Crown appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the sentences which had been imposed on Talbot at first instance. 
     
      
    18 As it happens, the Bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal which heard the Crown appeal included Grove J and myself, both of whom are members of the present Bench. The Court of Criminal Appeal allowed the Crown appeal against the sentences passed on Talbot and, in lieu of the sentences imposed at first instance, imposed sentences amounting to an effective sentence of ten years with a minimum term of seven years. The leading judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal was delivered by myself. The other members of the Bench Grove J and Simpson J concurred in the result of the appeal but each wrote a short separate judgment. 
     
      
    19 In his judgment Grove J stated that he considered that condign punishment for Talbot’s offences would have required even greater sentences than those which the Court of Criminal Appeal was about to impose but that it was appropriate for the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise its usual restraint when re-sentencing after a successful Crown appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    20 In a separate judgment Simpson J stated that she had agreed with the sentences proposed by me, only after some hesitation, because of her concern about whether the sentences proposed by me were adequate to punish Talbot for the level of criminality that he had displayed. 
     
      
    21 In my judgment I noted, inter alia, that Talbot had been charged with only the three offences I have referred to; that the sentencing judge had found, as the Crown had conceded in the proceedings on sentence, that Talbot had not been the ring-leader or the “leading hand” and had played a less important role in the commission of the offences than that played by Woodhead or the present applicant and that the Court of Criminal Appeal was obliged to respect those findings of the sentencing judge; that Talbot had pleaded guilty at the earliest reasonable opportunity; that he had provided assistance to the authorities by participating in an electronically recorded interview in which he had answered over 800 questions, giving detailed accounts of the acts of the co-offenders Woodhead and the applicant, who had not pleaded guilty and who were to stand trial; and that in an interview on 31 July 1997 he had undertaken to provide further assistance by giving evidence at the trial of Woodhead and the applicant. Importantly, I said that in re-sentencing Talbot the Court of Criminal Appeal should observe the principle that, in re-sentencing after a successful Crown appeal, the Court should impose a somewhat lesser sentence than it considers should have been passed in the first instance.  
     
      
    22 The co-offender Woodhead pleaded not guilty and was committed for trial but he died in custody before any trial took place. 
     
      
    23 In her remarks on sentencing the applicant Judge Morgan held that she was not bound in any way by the sentences which had been imposed on JW and Talbot. As regards JW, her Honour referred to the part of my judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal on the Crown appeal against the sentences passed on Talbot, in which I had said that JW was a child for the purposes of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act and, although in being sentenced he had been dealt with according to law, he had, nevertheless, to be sentenced in accordance with the principles stated in s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act and that, in any event, the role that JW had played in the commission of the offences was substantially less than that of any of the adult offenders. I said that the sentencing judge in sentencing Talbot had rightly rejected an attempted parity argument based on the sentence passed on JW.  
     
      
    24 As regards Talbot, her Honour Judge Morgan noted in her remarks on sentence that Talbot had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, that he had provided assistance and had undertaken to provide further assistance and that all members of the Court of Criminal Appeal, including myself, had made it clear in their judgments that they had been restrained from imposing heavier sentences on Talbot by the special considerations applying to Crown appeals. 
     
      
    25 The applicant lodged an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against his convictions and an application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on him. The grounds of appeal raised a number of issues of fact, including whether the Crown Prosecutor at the trial, defence counsel at the trial, solicitors, police officers and jurors at the trial had acted improperly. Pursuant to s 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act the Court of Criminal Appeal remitted these issues of fact for determination by a single judge of this Court, his Honour Greg James J. 
     
      
    26 A general question which then arose was whether the new evidence on which the applicant wished to rely would have to satisfy the conditions for the admissibility of evidence on an appeal as being fresh evidence. Apparently because of uncertainty about the admissibility of the new evidence on an appeal, the applicant made an application to the Supreme Court for the holding of an inquiry pursuant to pt 13A of the Crimes Act into his conviction and sentences. On 28 June 2001 Greg James J directed that such an inquiry be held and on the following day his Honour was formally appointed to conduct the inquiry.  
     
      
    27 It was, at least impliedly, a condition of any inquiry into his conviction being directed that the applicant should abandon his appeal against conviction. A formal notice of abandonment of the appeal against conviction was lodged on 8 March 2002.  
     
      
    28 An inquiry was conducted by Greg James J at various times in August 2001 and April 2002. His Honour prepared and submitted to the Chief Justice his report of the inquiry, which is dated 6 September 2002. The report is a lengthy document of 130 pages, including a number of appendices. For present purposes it is necessary to refer to only a few parts of the report. 
     
      
    29 In para 19.22 of the report his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The complainant gave evidence to the Inquiry of Suey rescuing her from an assault with a wheel brace which was to be carried out by one of the others. The evidence of Suey was that the wheel brace was being used by JW but I accept the complainant’s evidence that it was Woodhead who threatened her with the wheel brace. I do not consider the complainant’s account of the matter concerning the wheel brace cast any doubt on her general credibility particularly because it was not put to her at either trial. It is in reliance on her evidence that I refer this matter of the Court of Criminal Appeal for consideration on sentence, since her evidence in this respect raises a reasonable doubt as to the role of the applicant throughout the relevant events, as affecting the degree of his responsibility for the acts perpetrated and as to a matter of mitigation” 
        . 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    30 In para 20 of his report his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        ”Section 474(H)(2)(b) provides in part that I may refer the sentence aspect of the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal if ‘there is a reasonable doubt as to any matter that may have affected the nature or severity of the sentence’ 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence of the complainant given at the Inquiry establishes that the applicant prevented one of the co-offenders, Mitchell Woodhead from placing a wheel brace in the complainant’s vagina. This does not reduce the gravity of what happened at the Atkin home nor the character of the sexual assaults which occurred throughout the course of the night. The applicant was sentenced on the basis that he was the leader or person in control on the night. The table produced by the Director of Public Prosecutions (Appendix 5 hereto) shows the relative severity of the sentence the applicant received. His actions with respect to the wheel brace showed that he used his power over the other offenders to prevent the sexual assaults being even more serious. His role that night was a most important consideration in respect to his sentence. I therefore conclude that this matter should be the subject of a reference to the Court of Criminal Appeal”. 
        
       
      
    31 In his conclusion in para 21 of the report his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Inquiry was directed because there were a number of real questions concerning the guilt of the applicant. Those questions are set out at the commencement of this report. I have specifically found that each of those doubts or questions should be resolved adversely to the applicant. To my mind the evidence placed before the Inquiry requires me to come to that conclusion. I am satisfied there has been no miscarriage of justice and that there is no reasonable doubt as to the applicant’s guilt with respect to all nine counts. I further find that there has been no relevant error or mishap in the trial process which had any practical implication nor anything to suggest that a fair trial did not take place. 
        
       
       
        
        Accordingly:- 
        
       
       
        
        (a) I report to the Honourable the Chief Justice that I do not consider there to be any doubt or question as to the applicant’s guilt of the offences for which he was convicted; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) I refer to the Court of Criminal Appeal the matter for review of the sentences imposed on the applicant, since I am of the opinion that there is a reasonable doubt as to a matter which may have affected the nature or severity of the sentence, that is, the matter referred to at 19.22”. 
        
       
      
    32 Evidence about the wheel brace or tyre brace was given at the inquiry by the applicant and by the complainant. At pp 60 to 61 of the transcript of the inquiry the applicant gave evidence that he heard JW say, “’I’ll fuck her with this - right,’ talking about the tyre brace he had in his hands”. The applicant asserted in his evidence that he had said to JW, “What are you doing, you idiot” and that he had grabbed the tyre brace from JW. 
     
      
    33 The evidence from the complainant about the wheel brace at pp 641 to 642 of the transcript of the inquiry was:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Q. And he (the applicant) said that JW at about the time that you were on the back of the utility, JW threatened you with a tyre lever or a wheel brace? 
         
        A. To my knowledge, I remember, I remember it being Mitchell, not JW 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you recall being threatened with some kind of tyre or wheel brace? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But your recollection, it was who that did it? 
         
        A. Mitchell. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And Mr Ronald Suey then says he took the wheel brace off whoever had it and threw it into the back of the ute? 
         
        A. I think so, yes”. 
        
       
      
    34 As appears from paragraph 20 of his report, his Honour’s decision to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal was based on the evidence of the complainant and not on the evidence of the applicant. In his report his Honour made a number of unfavourable findings about the credibility of the applicant.  
     
      
    35 The present reference to this Court is to review the sentences passed on the applicant, having regard to the matter that the applicant rescued the complainant from being assaulted with the wheel brace by the co-offender Woodhead.  
     
      
    36 On this reference it was submitted by counsel for the applicant that, if the sentencing judge had known that the applicant had intervened to prevent further harm from befalling the complainant, then the sentences her Honour would have imposed would have been significantly less and that, in comparing the sentences passed on the applicant with the sentences imposed upon the two co-offenders in the light of this new evidence, the applicant would feel a justifiable sense of grievance in relation to the sentences imposed on him. 
     
      
    37 A matter raised by the Court in the course of argument during this review was whether, even on this review, the evidence about the incident with the wheel brace, in order to be admissible, would have to meet the conditions for the admissibility of evidence as fresh evidence on the hearing of an appeal. The Crown did not submit, either in written submissions or in oral submissions, that the Court should dispose of the review on the basis that the evidence about the wheel brace did not meet the conditions for the admissibility of evidence as fresh evidence and the Crown urged this Court to deal with the review on its merits. In these circumstances, I will not decide and I do not express any opinion about, whether, where a matter has been referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 474H(2)(b) of the Crimes Act for review of a sentence, new evidence can be relied on, without its having to satisfy the conditions for the admissibility of evidence as fresh evidence. For the purposes only of this review I am prepared to assume that the evidence about the wheel brace is admissible on this review. 
     
      
    38 I do not consider that either of the submissions made by counsel for the applicant should be accepted. The applicant engaged in criminal conduct which was aptly described by the sentencing judge as “appalling”. In her remarks on sentence, her Honour appropriately summarised the applicant’s criminal conduct as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The facts of this case are truly appalling. This young girl was subjected to a terrifying ordeal in which she was continuously brutally violated over a period of some two hours by men, armed with a shotgun, tomahawk, and carrying sticks, who had earlier broken into a house where she was caring for three young children, where shots had been fired and she was forced into a motor vehicle by a man carrying a shotgun. It almost beggars belief the level of criminality involved and the despicable and callous behaviour exhibited by these four men towards a fifteen year old girl that night. The effect upon her both physically and emotionally as well as the probable serious long term impact upon her is immeasurable. That I will take into account on sentence”. 
        
       
      
    39 The fact that the applicant stopped one of his co-offenders from attacking the complainant with a wheel brace merely prevented a further offence being committed against the complainant by a co-offender and did not mitigate the criminality involved in the offences for which the applicant was sentenced. 
     
      
    40 It is clear that the applicant’s act of stopping the co-offender did not stem from any remorse on his party or from any empathy with the complainant. After this incident the applicant participated in the commission of further offences against the complainant. I do not consider that, if this matter had been known to the sentencing judge, it would have affected her finding that the applicant did not show any contrition. 
     
      
    41 Notwithstanding what is said in paragraph 20 of Greg James J’s report, the applicant was not sentenced by Judge Morgan on the basis that he was the leader or the person in control on the night of the offences. Judge Morgan merely found that the applicant was “one” of the principals and explicitly stated in her remarks on sentence that the applicant was not to be regarded as having exhibited greater criminality than the other offenders. 
     
      
    42 For the reasons given by me in my judgment on the Crown appeal against the sentences passed on Talbot, some of which were repeated by Judge Morgan in her remarks on sentence in sentencing the applicant, there was no basis for any parity argument between the applicant and the juvenile JW and the additional matter now relied upon is quite insufficient to give rise to any such basis.  
     
      
    43 For the reasons given by Judge Morgan, there was, and is, no basis for any parity argument based on the sentences passed on the offender Talbot. Talbot was sentenced for only three offences. He was sentenced on the basis that he had a lesser role than the applicant in the commission of the offences. Talbot pleaded guilty at the earliest reasonable opportunity and he provided significant assistance to the authorities. He was sentenced in the Court of Criminal Appeal, after a successful Crown appeal against sentence, to sentences which were less than the Court of Criminal Appeal considered should have been imposed in the first instance. The additional matter now relied upon is quite insufficient to provide any basis for a parity argument between the applicant and the offender Talbot.  
     
      
    44 I consider that, having reviewed the sentences imposed by her Honour Judge Morgan, this Court should hold that the sentences imposed by her Honour should stand. 
     
      
    45 HUNT AJA: I agree with the order proposed by James J, for the reasons which he has given. 
     
      
    46 GROVE J: I also agree. I would reserve to an occasion when it arises the question of whether on a review pursuant to s 474H(2)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 this Court ought or should adopt the procedures and limitations applicable to the receipt of fresh evidence in an appeal or in application for leave to appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The stance adopted by the Crown in the stated interests of fairness in this instance makes a decision on that issue unnecessary. 
     
      
    47 HUNT AJA: The order of the Court is as proposed by James J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: This is an application by Shane Michael Franklin for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him by his Honour Judge Garling in the District Court at Port Macquarie on 19 March 2004 following the applicant’s plea of guilty to one count of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm on the victim, Neil Glover, at Laurieton on Anzac Day 25 April 2002. The maximum penalty for the offence prescribed by s 35(1)B of the Crimes Act 1900 is seven years imprisonment.2 His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for two and a half years with a non-parole period of one year four months, the sentence to commence from the date of sentencing. 3 His Honour prefaced his Remarks on Sentence by noting that there was some dispute and he was expressly making findings of fact, rather than just relying on what had been tendered to him. The facts as found by his Honour may be summarised as follows.4 At the time of the offence the applicant had been in a relationship with Miss Smith who, by the time of sentencing, was his wife. She had previously been in a relationship with Mr Glover but that relationship had ceased, although there had been a brief resumption of it in February 2002. She wished to continue on her relationship with the applicant and they were having discussions about it. 5 They had been to a hotel but his Honour found that the applicant was not intoxicated at the time.6 Miss Smith had gone home early to relieve a babysitter and subsequently the applicant went to her house at her invitation and was sitting on the couch with her. She rang her father but in the meantime Mr Glover had rung her from the hotel on her mobile phone and she did not wish to speak to him. Mr Glover then arrived at the premises. He was uninvited and not welcome. When the door was opened, he pushed in an aggressive manner and went into the kitchen area where Miss Smith was and was aggressive with her. The applicant went there to try and assist with no intention of assaulting Mr Glover. His Honour found that he was in fact apprehensive and a bit fearful, as Mr Glover was a much bigger man. 7 There was then an altercation during which Mr Glover pushed the applicant, who fell backwards. Miss Smith came between them. There was an altercation and she was pushed out of the way. Mr Glover was directed to leave the house, but he did not, and a fight developed.8 His Honour accepted that Mr Glover started the fight and then the applicant punched him a number of times. 9 Mr Glover fell to the ground and the applicant also went to the ground on top of the victim. The applicant kept punching the victim with both hands to his head. 10 Mr Glover was laying there, apparently unconscious. There was blood coming out of his head, his nose was bleeding and there was a cut on his head. Blood started to appear all over his forehead. Miss Smith was attempting to get the applicant off him.11 At about that stage Miss Smith's daughter came out of her bedroom screaming. Miss Smith left to attend to her and at about that stage the applicant picked up a chair from the dining room and hit the victim over the head with it. At that stage Miss Smith left. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst Glover was on the ground I didn't see him move or hit the prisoner at all. His arms were just lying there beside him.” 
        
       
      
    12 She ran to the hotel to get help and various people came. When they arrived they formed a very powerful impression that Mr Glover was extremely seriously injured. He appeared to be not breathing and choking on his own blood. Fortunately someone took action and he started breathing again. The ambulance came and they took immediate action to ensure that he was stabilised.13 Photos were tendered to his Honour which showed the applicant covered in blood in a terrible mess.14 He was taken to hospital and he was found to have sustained a head injury. He was unconscious, had fractures of his nasal bones and the anterior and lateral walls of the right maxilla sinus and fractures of the left orbital floor. Some teeth were missing.15 The injuries were complicated by concussion and loss of consciousness. He had to be intubated, paralysed and sedated whilst he was treated. He suffered an extensive beating and for some days was amnesic.16 At the time of the sentencing proceedings I understand he was still unable to remember what had happened or give an account of it.17 His Honour summarised the circumstances as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept that the prisoner was provoked to this extent. Glover was not invited. Glover was aggressive towards Miss Smith. The prisoner stepped into the situation, and I have no criticism of that. Where the criticism arises is that Glover, having gone to the floor and being helpless, was then given a fearful beating. There was no necessity for that. That was not out of fear. That beating has not been explained. The closest explanation I have is that there originally was some fear on the prisoner's part that there was a lot of adrenalin caused by the initial incidents and that for some reason, which has not been explained, he continued on striking Glover, not only with the fist, but with part of a chair I believe to be a chair leg, until he was beaten to the state I have described.” 
        
       
      
    18 His Honour noted that the plea had been entered at the earliest possible time. He noted the applicant's age and that he had two previous convictions for common assault, for which he had been fined. He noted that he had since married Miss Smith and that they had a child, that he was supporting his wife and child, was in regular employment that he had pleaded guilty and had made early admissions to police. He noted the extensive injuries to the victim and the need for personal and general deterrence. He expressed the view that as this was the applicant's third conviction for personal violence, he probably needed some assistance with anger management. He also found special circumstances.19 The grounds of appeal relied on are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The sentence is excessive having regard to the finding made by the sentencing judge that the victim of the applicant's offence “was the aggressor in all of this”. 
         
        2.The sentencing judge failed to give the applicant a specific and, it is submitted, sufficient discount on sentence for his plea of guilty. 
         
        3.The sentencing judge has given insufficient weight to the significant period of time which has elapsed since the commission of the offence and to the progress towards rehabilitation made by the applicant during that period. 
         
        4.The sentencing judge assessed the objective criminality of the applicant's conduct at too high a level and failed to give sufficient weight to several important mitigating factors. 
        
       
      
    20 Although his Honour found that the victim was the aggressor, in that he came to the house uninvited, entered in an aggressive manner, and pushed the applicant and started the altercation, it appears that it was the applicant who started throwing punches; and once he started he did not stop, even when the victim was defenceless on the floor and not retaliating. As already noted, he was, according to Miss Smith, just lying there apparently unconscious with blood coming out of his head, at which stage the applicant started hitting him with the chair leg. In other words, although the victim may have been the aggressor initially, the applicant's reaction and retaliation was grossly excessive and resulted in most serious injuries to the victim.21 In oral submissions Mr Byrne SC has submitted that the incident occurred over a very short time and that in her oral evidence Miss Smith, now Mrs Franklin, had expressed some reservation about some of the matters referred to in her statement which had been quoted by his Honour as part of his findings in his Remarks on Sentence.22 The length of time was clearly only a matter of a few minutes in any event, but the important consideration is not the length of time but the ferocity of the retaliatory attack and the injuries occasioned to the victim. Indeed, the shorter the time, the more ferocious the attack to occasion the injuries in fact suffered.23 Miss Smith's original statement was before his Honour, it was tendered by consent, and such reservations as she expressed in her oral evidence were in fact minimal and insignificant.24 In the light of the overall facts and the injuries to the applicant, in so far as there was any inconsistency, his Honour was entitled to accept, as he did, the version she gave in her initial statement.25 Although his Honour referred at the beginning of his Remarks to the plea being entered at the earliest possible time, he made no further reference to any further discount or to a notional head sentence, and it is by no means clear that he in fact allowed any discount. If one assumes that in the light of the early plea he allowed a discount of 20 to 25 per cent, that represents a starting point or notional sentence of three years one and a half months to three years four months, which is probably unlikely, although I would not regard either term as necessarily outside the range.26 Although it was conceded in R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [113] that it may not be possible or appropriate in every case to specify a discount for a plea, judges are certainly encouraged to do so, and the Guidelines set out in that case at [160] specifically include the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. A sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account... 
         
         
        2. Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of a plea on the sentence in so far as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant - contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value - but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last mentioned matter.” 
        
       
       
      The Guideline goes on to say that in some cases a single combined quantification will often be appropriate. 
      
    27 As I pointed out in R v Lynn [2004] NSWCCA 222, the purpose of identifying a discount range is to improve the transparency of the process and to alter the widespread perception that there is no benefit from an early plea: R v Thomson at [162]. See also R v Mako [2004] NSWCCA 90 at [21] and R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [16]-[17].28 It is not appropriate to merely pay lip service to allowing a discount for pleas of guilty by specifying a discount in percentage terms or by noting that a plea was entered at an early stage if the judge simply assesses what he or she regards as the appropriate sentence for the offence in the light of its objective and subjective circumstances and makes no further allowance for, or reference to, the discount. This can lead to a perception that although a discount has been specified, or a reference made to an early plea, no discount has in fact been allowed. I did for some time have some concern that this may be what in fact happened in the present case.29 Although there had been a delay in the finalisation of the matter, and the applicant had made reasonably good progress to rehabilitate in the meantime, such progress was taken into account by his Honour particularly in the finding of “special circumstances”.30 Further, it was submitted that the sentencing judge assessed the objective criminality at too high a level and failed to give sufficient weight to several important mitigating factors, particularly those specified in s 21A(3): 
     
      
       
        
        “(b) offence not part of a planned or organised criminal activity; 
         
        (c) offender provoked by the victim; 
         
        (d) offender acting under duress; 
         
        (e) no significant record of criminal convictions; 
         
        (f) a person of good character; 
         
        (g) unlikely to re-offend; 
         
        (h) good prospects of rehabilitation; 
         
        (i) shown remorse; and 
         
        (k) plea of guilty.” 
        
       
      
    31 I accept that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity and that the offender was provoked by the victim, but not past the stage when the victim was lying helpless on the floor.32 I accept that the applicant has good prospects of rehabilitation and has shown remorse and pleaded guilty, but I reject any suggestion that he was acting under duress. And in the light of his two previous convictions for assault, I would reject that he had no significant record of criminal convictions or was a person of good character.33 As to whether he is unlikely to re-offend, this must be regarded as doubtful unless he learns to control his anger.34 These relevant mitigating factors, as I have indicated, are however counter-balanced by a number of aggravating factors under s 21A(2), including: 
     
      
       
        
        “(b) the actual use of violence; 
         
        (c) the use of a chair leg as a weapon; 
         
        (d) his record of previous convictions; and 
         
        (f) that the injury and harm suffered by the victim was substantial.” 
        
       
      
    35 The primary object of the criminal law is to protect citizens from physical harm at the hands of others, and crimes of personal violence, particularly when they involve serious injury, are regarded as abhorrent.36 If one considers a notional starting point of three years - and I would not regard anything less as adequate - a head sentence of two and a half years represents a discount for the early plea of 17 per cent, which is perhaps a little low; but if one takes a starting point of three years and four months, which I would not regard as outside the range, a head sentence of two and a half years represents a discount of 25 per cent. In any event, in the light of his Honour's finding of special circumstances, he reduced the non-parole period to approximately 53 per cent of the head sentence, whereas 37 I would regard anything less than 60 per cent as unduly lenient.38 Finally, the sentence imposed is well within the relevant statistics for this offence kept by the Judicial Commission.39 For these reasons I am not satisfied that the sentence is excessive or that a lesser sentence is warranted in law. I therefore propose that leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.40 BELL J: I agree.41 DUNFORD J: The order of the Court will be as I have indicated.

    1 SULLY J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 KIRBY J: Daryl Shane Oliver (the applicant) filed a late Notice in which he seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Patten DCJ on 2 May 2003. Mr Oliver pleaded guilty to two counts, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: 
         Break enter and steal from premises at Victory Parade, Truscott, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that he was in company (s112(2) Crimes Act 1900) (maximum penalty: 20 years imprisonment). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2:  
        Break enter and steal from premises at Neera Road, Umina (s112(1) Crimes Act 1900) (maximum penalty: 14 years imprisonment). 
        
       
      
    3 The applicant asked his Honour to take into account, when sentencing on the first count, a further five offences on a Form 1. The Form 1 offences were as follows (rearranged in chronological order to better understand the criminality involved): 
     
      
       
        
        1. 2 May 2002: 
         Possess housebreaking implements (s114(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900) (punishable summarily by a maximum of 2 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $11,000, and on indictment, by 7 years imprisonment); 
        
       
       
        
        2. 3 June 2002 
        : Being found in premises with intent to commit an indictable offence (s546B Crimes Act 1900) (punishable by a maximum of 6 months imprisonment and/or a fine of $440); 
        
       
       
        
        3. 4 June 2002: 
         Possess housebreaking implements; 
        
       
       
        
        4. 3 July 2002 
         (being the date of the arrest in respect of Count 1): Possess prohibited drug, cannabis (1.1 grams) (contrary to s10(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985) (maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $2,200); 
        
       
       
        
        5. 5 July 2002: 
         Fail to appear upon bail undertaking (s51(1) Bail Act 1978) (maximum penalty imprisonment for 3 years and/or $3,300 fine). 
        
       
      
    4 Patten DCJ imposed the following sentence in respect of these offences: 
     
      
       
        
        On Count 1 
        , taking account of the matters on the Form 1, imprisonment for 5 years from 15.8.02 to 14.8.07, with a non-parole period of 3 years from 15.8.02 to 14.8.05. 
        
       
       
        
        On Count 2 
        , a fixed term of 3 years concurrent from 15.08.02 to 14.08.05. 
        
       
      
    5 Mr Oliver lodged a Notice of Intention to Apply for Leave to Appeal a short time after the sentence was imposed. The notice expired on 4 November 2003. A co-offender in respect of Count 1 was sentenced on 28 May 2004. On 15 September 2004 an application for leave was filed. When the appeal was argued, the Court granted an extension of time for the filing of the notice seeking leave to appeal.  
     
      
    6 A Notice of Appeal was filed raising a number of grounds of appeal. However, only one ground was pressed, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1: 
         The sentencing Judge erred in the determination of the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. 
        
       
      
    7 Before dealing with that ground, I should describe the circumstances in which the offences were committed. 
     
      
      Count 1: Break enter and steal at Tascott. 
       
      
    8 His Honour's remarks on sentence do not make findings of fact in respect of either offence. However, the circumstances in which the offences were committed were not in doubt. The Crown tendered a short summary in respect of each count, and a number of statements. 
     
      
    9 In respect of Count 1, on 3 July 2002 the applicant met Christopher Shaw and a Ms Kolk at the Woy Woy railway station. They then drove in Ms Kolk's vehicle to a suburban home in Victory Parade, Tascott. The premises were then unoccupied. Watched by a neighbour, Mr Oliver and his companions entered the premises by means of breaking a window and removing a flyscreen. Thereafter they carried back and forth to the waiting vehicle a number of items including a television, a DVD player, a computer and printer. 
     
      
    10 The neighbour alerted the police. The Police came immediately. They intercepted the vehicle laden with the stolen goods. Each of the occupants, including Mr Oliver, was arrested. Mr Oliver was also found to have a small quantity of cannabis in his possession, which gave rise to one of the matters on the Form 1. When questioned by the police, he denied any wrongdoing. He told a fantastic story about having been picked up by the other two, not knowing what they were up to. He clearly thought better of that story and shortly after entered a plea of guilty. The property, apart from $150 in cash and a DVD player, was recovered. 
     
      
       
      Count 2: Break enter and steal at Umina. 
       
      
    11 The Statement of Facts, tendered before the sentencing Judge without objection, included the following description of the circumstances in which the offence giving rise to the second count was committed: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Between 4.40pm and 6pm on Sunday the 6th July, 2002, the Accused and an unknown Co-Accused have driven into Neera Road, Umina Breach in a blue Suzuki 4 Wheel drive registration number OZK.650. The Accused has borrowed this vehicle from the registered owner. The Accused and his Co-Accused have gone to the rear back glass window of 85 Neera Road, Umina where they have smashed the window. The Accused and Co-Accused have then entered the premises via this smashed glass window and proceeded to steal one Beam Pentium II computer hard drive tower, a Diamond View Computer monitor, set of Encore Speakers, a Logitech computer mouse and keyboard, one Nokia 51101 mobile phone, Samsung DVD player, forty five DVD movies and one double bed doona cover to the value of approximately $4,000. The Accused and Co-Accused have then left the location after (being) startled by a neighbour."" 
        
       
      
    12 A statement in those terms would support the more serious offence of break enter and steal in circumstances of aggravation, namely, being in company (s112(2)). However, the charge against Mr Oliver was brought under s112(1) and the matter should be approached upon that basis. The computer, but not all the attachments, was recovered. The value of the property not recovered was estimated to be approximately $3,000. 
     
      
    13 Both offences were committed whilst the applicant was on bail, which the learned sentencing Judge recognised was a matter of serious aggravation. 
     
      
       
      The subjective circumstances of Mr Oliver. 
       
      
    14 The applicant was born on 3 June 1973. He is aged 31 years. His parents separated when he was a baby. However, his mother married again. He formed a close relationship with his stepfather, who died when he was 13. He told the Probation and Parole Service that he got on well with his mother and that he was well cared for throughout his childhood. 
     
      
    15 After a basic eduction Mr Oliver began work as a bricklayer's labourer. In his early years he abused alcohol and drugs. One gathers, nonetheless, that he managed to remain in work and out of trouble. He had one minor criminal conviction in 1992 in respect of which he received a small fine.  
     
      
    16 Unfortunately, at the age of 24 years, the applicant became addicted to heroin. He rapidly accumulated a significant criminal record, mainly for offences of dishonesty. In 1997 he was charged with stealing, receiving, and the possession of a prohibited drug. He was ordered to serve 200 hours community service. He was also required to enter a recognisance. A year later he was charged with larceny. Again he was dealt with leniently. An order was made for home detention for a period of 6 months.  
     
      
    17 Within a matter of days, he again offended. The order was ultimately revoked by the Parole Board and Mr Oliver was required to serve all but a week of the 6 months fixed in the original order. At the same time he was charged with a further series of offences, including 4 counts of break enter and steal, two counts of larceny, receiving and obtaining money by deception. A term of imprisonment of 2 years, with a minimum term of 18 months was imposed in respect of the more serious of these offences. Lesser concurrent terms were imposed in respect of the remaining offences. 
     
      
    18 Shortly after Mr Oliver was released he again offended. On 10 July 2000 he was sentenced for multiple offences of dishonesty (break enter and steal, goods in custody, obtaining benefits by deception and receiving). A term of 16 months imprisonment was imposed with a non parole period of 12 months. 
     
      
    19 Mr Oliver gave evidence on sentence. In substance, he suggested that he was at the cross roads. He said that he had had enough. He recognised the need to address his heroin addiction. He had recently formed a relationship with a woman who was assisting him in giving up drugs. He had been in custody since his arrest on 15 August 2002. He had remained ""clean"", that is, drug free, since that time. He had undertaken a number of courses in gaol. He expressed contrition.  
     
      
    20 Mr Oliver's mother provided a brief statement. She described the applicant's fiancée as ""the best thing to happen to him in a long time, as she is really good for him"". 
     
      
    21 Mr Oliver, in his evidence, suggested that the relationship was of three months duration. His fiancée, in a separate statement, gave a somewhat different timetable. She said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Daryl and I met five years ago through mutual friends. We have been going out for one and a half years. Eight months ago Daryl asked me to marry him and I accepted."" 
        
       
      
    22 When speaking of three months, Mr Oliver may have been referring to the time that he and his fiancée had been living together before his arrest. Plainly his offending conduct occurred during the currency of their relationship. The relationship, although important to his rehabilitation, cannot be regarded as the complete answer to his drug problem. The answer must come from within him. 
     
      
    23 His Honour, nonetheless, found special circumstances, believing it to be important to the applicant's rehabilitation that he should have the benefit of a longer than usual period of supervision. 
     
      
    24 Against this background, I now turn to the complaint made against the sentence. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Discount for plea of guilty. 
       
      
    25 The remarks on sentence by his Honour included the following statement: (ROS 3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The prisoner is, of course, entitled to have the benefit of his pleas of guilty taken into account. They were of utilitarian value to the State, although, as it appears, the case against him was strong, he having been observed in the course of both matters for which he is before me."" 
        
       
      
    26 That statement is said to reveal error for a number of reasons. First, it suggested, as the Crown acknowledged, that his Honour discounted the utilitarian benefit arising from the plea of guilty by reason of the strength of the Crown case. There should be no such discounting. Howie J, in R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 expressed the principle in these terms: (at para 12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""This Court has pointed out, time and time again, that the strength of the Crown case is an irrelevant factor in determining the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. The strength of the Crown case is relevant only to the evaluation of remorse and what weight should be given to that factor in determining the appropriate sentence."" 
        
       
      
    27 His Honour added: (at para 14) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Judges of the District Court must surely be aware by now that to suggest, as his Honour clearly did, that the utilitarian value of the plea has been reduced by the strength of the Crown case, is an error which might warrant the intervention of this Court."" 
        
       
      
    28 Secondly, his Honour, according to the applicant, neither identified the discount he applied, nor the factors which he took into account (apart from the irrelevant factor, the strength of the Crown case). He was obliged to do one or other. Again the principle was expressed by Howie J in the same case in the following passage: (at para 12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... if judges are not prepared to make the discount clear by quantifying it or indicating the starting point of the sentence before the application of the discount, then with respect, they should carefully and correctly enunciate the factors taken into account and the principles being applied in determining the discount which they are applying. As Dunford J noted in  
        R v Mako 
         [2004] NSWCCA 90 at [21]: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'In all cases the important consideration is to expose the transparency of the process so that it can be seen that an appropriate discount has been allowed.'"" 
          
         
        
       
      
    29 The Crown responded by pointing out that his Honour was not obliged to quantify the discount. Although he did not refer to the matters he took into account in his discussion of the plea of guilty (apart from the irrelevant matter), he began his remarks on sentence with these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The prisoner pleaded guilty before a Magistrate on 10 October last year ..."" 
        
       
      
    30 His Honour, according to the Crown, was plainly conscious of the timing of the plea and its importance in determining of the size of the discount. 
     
      
    31 The applicant, by way of rejoinder, submitted that his Honour made no reference to the complexity of the matter, that being a further aspect identified in R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 418. Whilst neither Count 1 nor Count 2 could be considered complex, and would not have taken a great deal of Court time, the combination of those charges and the five separate matters included on the Form 1 did have significant utilitarian value. 
     
      
    32 There is substance in each of the criticisms made by the applicant. I believe there was error. The reference to the strength of the Crown case, in the context of a discussion of the worth of a plea of guilty, inevitably gave rise to an impression that his Honour discounted the value of that plea by reason of that fact. 
     
      
    33 The Crown, anticipating that finding, submitted, however, that no lesser sentence was warranted in law (s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912) (R v Astill (No 2)  (1992) 64 A Crim R 289 at 303 and 304; R v Boulghourgian (2001) 125 A Crim R 540 at para 34). The Crown pointed to the following: 
     
      
    · The offences were committed whilst the applicant was on conditional liberty on bail (in relation to the offences on the Form 1); 
     
      
    · Not all the property was recovered; 
     
      
    · The applicant has previous convictions of the same type, for which he received custodial sentences; 
     
      
    · The applicant was not young; 
     
      
    · There were multiple offences, including offences on a Form 1. 
     
      
    34 Should the Court intervene? Where an error is shown, and where it can be inferred that the sentencing Judge would have given a lesser sentence, but for the error, ordinarily one would expect this Court to intervene unless to do so would reduce the sentence to a level which was less than adequate. 
     
      
    35 Here it was suggested by the applicant that, assuming his Honour had applied a discount of approximately 10 percent for the plea of guilty, and that it would have been reasonable for him to have allowed 25 percent, then the head sentence would have been reduced by approximately 6 months (to 4 years 6 months rather than 5 years). The non parole period would have been adjusted accordingly (and probably rounded off from 3 years to 2 years 6 months, reflecting the finding of special circumstances). 
     
      
    36 Two issues arise. First, is it reasonable to assume a discount of 25 percent for the plea of guilty? Secondly, is the sentence, adjusted in the way suggested, or approximately in that way, inadequate having regard to the personal circumstances of Mr Oliver and the criminality involved? The Crown submitted that the sentence, so adjusted, would be inadequate, pointing mainly to the length of the non-parole period which would then be too low. The applicant submitted that such a sentence would be well within the range. The length of the non-parole period was the consequence of the finding of special circumstances. No challenge had been made to that finding. The applicant further submitted that it was reasonable to adopt a 25 percent discount. The offences had been committed on 3 and 6 July 2002. The plea was entered in the Local Court on 10 October 2002. It was therefore a very early plea. Mr Oliver's companion in Count 1, also pleaded guilty. He was given a discount of 25 percent for that plea by Bell DCJ on 28 May 2004 (R v Christopher Shaw) 
     
      
    37 I have come to the view that the Court should intervene. I accept that, but for the error, his Honour would have imposed a lesser sentence along the lines suggested by the applicant and that such a sentence would have been within the range of sound sentencing discretion and therefore unlikely to have attracted a successful Crown appeal. In these circumstances I believe it is just for the Court to intervene and resentence the applicant in terms which correct the demonstrated error. 
     
      
    38 In re-sentencing, I believe a discount of 25 percent for the plea of guilty is reasonable. I would, for the same reasons as provided by the sentencing Judge, find special circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Order: 
       
      
    39 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. That the time for filing the Notice Seeking Leave to Appeal be extended. 
       
       
      2. That leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      3. That the appeal be allowed and that the sentence imposed on 3 May 2003 in respect of Count 1 be quashed, the sentence on Count 2 being confirmed. 
       
       
      4. That in lieu of the sentence in respect of Count 1, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years 6 months commencing on 15 August 2002 and expiring on 14 February 2007, with a non parole period of 2 years 6 months commencing on 15 August 2002 and expiring on 14 February 2005, at which time the applicant will be eligible for release on parole.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: Tesay Hasan (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Dodd in the District Court at Sydney on 12 March 2004 following his pleas of guilty in the Central Local Court on 29 July 2003 to two counts of robbery in company committed against two taxi drivers on 22 and 30 December 2002 respectively. He adhered to his pleas in the District Court on 5 March 2004. The offences were committed along with a co-offender, Ozal Shefki, a cousin of the applicant. The maximum penalty for each offence is twenty years imprisonment: s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.2 His Honour sentenced the applicant to two wholly concurrent terms of imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of two years to commence on the date of sentencing, 12 March 2004. The co-accused received the same sentences, but backdated to an earlier starting date due to pre-sentence custody. 3 The applicant has filed a Notice of Application for Extension of Time to lodge the Notice for Leave to Appeal, being two days out of time. 4 At about 6:30pm on 22 December 2002, the applicant and Shefki approached a taxi parked near the Parramatta Railway Station. Shefki sat in the front seat and the applicant in the back. The driver, Mr Nguyen, drove them to Leichhardt. He was directed to a dead-end street, supposedly on the basis of the offenders going to a girlfriend’s house. The applicant suddenly grabbed Mr Nguyen from behind by the throat with both arms. Mr Nguyen described being “strangled” and held back strongly in his seat. Shefki threatened to stab him if he did not hand him money. Mr Nguyen gave $150 to Shefki from his shirt pocket. The taxi ignition keys and the victim’s house keys were also stolen. The offenders ran away.5 At about 10:30pm on 30 December 2002, the offenders entered a taxi at the Lidcombe Railway Station taxi rank. The applicant sat in the back and Shefki sat in the front. The driver, Mr Wong, was directed to drive to Star City Casino. About halfway there he became concerned that he may not be paid and after some discussion Shefki handed Mr Wong his mobile telephone as a form of security. Close to the Casino he was directed to drive into a dead-end street, again on the basis of going to a girlfriend’s house, who, according to Shefki, had the credit card they were going to use to pay for the fare. The applicant grabbed Mr Wong from behind by the throat with both arms. Mr Wong described having “a lot of trouble breathing and I thought I was going to die.” The applicant was pulling him “very tight back into my seat.” Shefki threatened to stab him if he did not hand over money. Mr Wong pointed to the centre console, as he was unable to speak, and Shefki stole $60 to $70, the taxi ignition keys and reclaimed his mobile telephone. The offenders ran off.6 The victim, Mr Nguyen, identified Shefki when he happened to see him at Liverpool Local Court on 27 March 2003 (Mr Nguyen was studying law and attended to observe court proceedings generally). The applicant turned himself in on 4 June 2003, it seems after a conversation with Shefki, but at a time when his identity was unknown to police. The applicant was charged by police that same day and released on bail. None of the property stolen was recovered and had not been repaid at the time of sentencing.7 With respect to the objective seriousness of the offence, his Honour noted the prevalence of robbery from the person and described both offences as “serious”. His Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In my view they were not mere opportunistic examples of this kind of criminal activity but there was some element of planning involved. That is, in my view, confirmed by the fact that a second offence took place in much the same manner as the first. You both appear to have acted entirely in similar roles in each offence. Although the offences cannot be regarded as being towards the upper end of the scale for such offences, they are, nevertheless, serious examples of such offences.” 
        
       
      
    8 His Honour summarised the applicant’s subjective features (ROS 6-10). The applicant was nineteen at the time of the offences and twenty when sentenced. He is Shefki’s cousin. His Honour noted that the applicant was on a twelve-month bond to be of good behaviour imposed at the Downing Centre Local Court, three months before the offences for common assault, and a second twelve-month bond imposed by Burwood Local Court two months before the offences for driving in a manner dangerous. His Honour noted that the present offences were thereby aggravated (although it was submitted that it would be more accurate on the authorities to say that the present offences are seriously aggravated).9 A pre-sentence report stated that the applicant was generally compliant in the past with his supervision and reporting obligations. The applicant had remained on bail since handing himself in to the police. He had a supportive family upbringing, but they were shocked at his behaviour and he clashed with his father. This led to the applicant leaving home in November 2003. His sister noted that he had become more mature and family orientated since moving out and he was now more mature in his choice of friends.10 The applicant completed most of his HSC and completed six months of an Australian Army Reserve Private’s course, but left to work as a bricklayer’s labourer and then worked for a real estate agent. He commenced a TAFE course in real estate but discontinued after a few weeks and had resumed work as a bricklayer. He had a positive report from his current employer.11 The applicant reported being shot at some months prior to the offences when he was at Shefki’s house, apparently by a gang called “The Assyrian Kings”. He and Shefki decided to commence a weight-training program and they took steroids, leading to bouts of uncontrollable anger. The applicant had stopped using steroids. His Honour noted that the pre-sentence report and the psychological report of Mr Gorrell discussed the possible side effects of steroids on users of the drugs.  
     
      
    12 As his Honour observed, however, both offences were committed deliberately and no evidence was led to establish that steroid leads to the commission of this type of offence. The steroid use was not an excuse for the offences and could not be used in mitigation, given the deliberate planning of the offences and the modus operandi used by the offenders on each occasion.13 In sentencing the applicant and his co-offender, his Honour noted that they had both pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and said (ROS 9) that on account of the utilitarian value of such pleas he was allowing a discount in accordance with R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 of twenty-five per cent. Subsequently, his Honour referred to the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and a number of features of the offences identified in that case as relevant to determining the sentence. 14 The matters referred to are also relevant under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. His Honour went on: 
     
      
       
        
        “... and you have both pleaded guilty, the significance of that being limited by a strong case in your case, Mr Shefki, and as a result of your admissions in your case also, Mr Hasan.” 
        
       
       
      and later: 
       
        
        “ 
        I take into account in your case Mr Hasan that you did turn yourself in and had you not done so the possible prosecution of you for these offences might not have taken place.” 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour found special circumstances and then decided that although there were two separate offences, he would make the sentences for each offence wholly concurrent with each other and imposed the sentences referred to.16 Grounds of Appeal 1 and 2 are as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        1. His Honour erred in assessing the value of the plea of guilty stating that it was “limited by a strong Crown case”;  
         
         
        2. The sentence does not reflect a significant element of leniency having proper regard to the principles enunciated in  
        R v Ellis 
         (1986) 6 NSWLR 603.  
        
       
      
    17 A difficulty which immediately arises in considering both grounds is that, although his Honour has referred to two guideline judgments by name, he has not shown how he has applied them, and although he has announced a twenty-five per cent discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty, he has not specified the notional sentence which he has discounted by twenty-five per cent.18 One can mathematically calculate that four years is seventy-five per cent of five years four months, but if five years four months was in fact his Honour’s starting point, it is in excess of the range indicated in R v Henry for cases which clearly and, as his Honour implicitly found, were not at the top of the range of cases considered in that judgment. As pointed out in R v Lynn [2004] NSWCCA 222, the purpose of identifying a discount range is to improve the transparency of the process and to alter the widespread perception that there is no benefit from an early plea: R v Thomson at [162]. See also R v Mako [2004] NSWCCA 90.19 It is generally, in my view, unsatisfactory to indicate that a specified discount is being allowed without specifying the term off which such discount is being allowed, otherwise there is a danger that the offender may perceive that although a discount has been specified, it has not in fact been allowed in the sentence. I have some concern that this may be what in fact happened in this case.20 One of the relevant factors referred to in Henry is a plea of guilty of limited value. As was made clear in Thomson, this factor in the Henry guideline is separate to the issue of the utilitarian value of the plea, in respect of which the discount is additional and dependent primarily on the timing of the plea. 21 In the present case, the reference to the strong Crown case related to the evidence of identification by one of the taxi drivers of the co-accused and, in the present case, to the fact that he had made a number of admissions and this is related to ground 2.  
     
      
    22 With all due respect to his Honour, the applicant’s admissions did not limit the significance or value of his pleas of guilty but considerably enhanced them. These were not mere pleas exhibiting a degree of contrition, but the applicant had voluntarily surrendered to police and confessed at a time when they were apparently not aware of his identify and, as his Honour said, if he had not done so he may never have been prosecuted for these offences.23 This factor of itself entitled the applicant to some degree of leniency in accordance with the principles set out in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. But, the facts of this case are very different to that in Ellis. There, the applicant had made voluntary disclosure of his involvement in armed robberies of which the police had no knowledge. Here, on the other hand, the police had information in respect of the robberies, they had identified and arrested his co-offender and there was a real risk, it would seem, that the co-offender may identify the applicant, particularly bearing in mind that he confessed after speaking to the co-offender. But he did voluntarily surrender and confess and is entitled to some recognition and leniency on that account. 24 The third ground of appeal is that the sentences are manifestly excessive. In considering this ground it is necessary to bear in mind that these were deliberate, unprovoked attacks on taxi drivers at night in dead-end streets into which they had been directed so that the robberies could take place and in Henry itself, Spigelman CJ drew attention at [162] to the particular vulnerability of taxi drivers. See also R v Iskander (CCA – 22 July 1996).25 However, there were two quite separate discrete offences some eight days apart, and yet his Honour saw fit to make the sentences wholly concurrent; and although the applicant’s subjective features were generally good, these offences were committed in breach of two separate good behaviour bonds granted to him in the Local Court.26 Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 requires, in the case of sentencing for multiple offences, that the Court first fix an appropriate penalty for each offence and then consider accumulation or concurrence so as to give effect to the principle of totality; that is, to determine the appropriate period of incarceration for the total criminality involved: R v Kalache (2000) 111 A Crim R 152 at 183-4, cited in R v AEM Snr, KEM and MM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [60]. Generally, disparate features of the two offences will point to at least a partial accumulation: R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [7] 27 If four years was the appropriate sentence for one robbery in company, it would not, in my view, also be an appropriate sentence for two robberies in company. I therefore consider that the sentences should have been made partially concurrent.28 Although not referred to in the grounds of appeal, it was submitted that parity principles such as referred to in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 and Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 required that this applicant receive a lesser sentence than his co-accused because there was more evidence of contrition in his case on account of his voluntarily surrendering to police at a time when they apparently were not aware of his identity but, as I have already commented, this was precipitated by the co-accused and was some months after the commission of the offences. 29 Whilst it is conceded by the Crown that there may technically be some merit in this submission, any difference to be reflected in the comparative sentences on this account, would in all the circumstances be minimal.  
     
      
    30 For myself, I would not have placed these offences at the bottom of the range indicated in Henry because they each involved an attack on a victim in a particularly vulnerable position and because the offences constituted breaches of two bonds only recently given. I would have allowed a discount of approximately thirty per cent on account of the utilitarian value of the pleas at the earliest opportunity and the voluntary surrender of the applicant to police and disclosure to police, but I would have made the sentences for the two offences partly cumulative. 31 When these factors are all balanced against each other, I am satisfied that the effective sentence imposed of four years with a non-parole period of two years is not manifestly or otherwise excessive, and is well within the appropriate range. 32 As error has been disclosed in his Honour’s approach, I have taken into account the contents of the two affidavits that have been filed. They show that the applicant is making good use of his time in custody to better himself and to prepare for his release; and that his rehabilitation is well advanced and his prospects good. This is commendable but is no less than the sentencing judge expected, and was the reason for him finding special circumstances thereby reducing the non-parole period from three-quarters of the head sentence to only one-half. 33 For these reasons I would grant an extension of time for the filing of the notice of the grounds of appeal. I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal. 34 BELL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Dunford J for the reasons that his Honour gives.35 DUNFORD J: The orders will be as I have indicated.

    2 HIDDEN J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against an interlocutory order made by Judge Gibb in the District Court on 12 October 2004 when her Honour granted leave to the Crown to amend an indictment under s 20 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The effect of the order was to permit the Crown to add a further and alternative count to the indictment that had previously been presented against the applicant. Her Honour having granted leave to amend the indictment, however, thereupon ordered that there be separate trials of the two counts. At the hearing of this application, the Court granted leave to the Crown to file an appeal against the order granting separate trials. 
     
      
    4 The facts can be briefly stated. On 18 June 2004 the applicant was committed for trial to the District Court on an offence contrary to s 52A(3)(a) of the Crimes Act. An indictment was initially presented to the District Court containing a single count in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        On or about 26 October 2002, at East Hills in the State of NSW, did drive a motor vehicle bearing registration number SCF-666 when it was involved in an impact whereby grievous bodily harm was occasioned to Stravroula Galanis, and at the time of the impact, Paul Lykouras was under the influence of a drug, namely morphine and cannabis.  
        
       
      
    5 The incident giving rise to that charge took place on 26 October 2002 when the van driven by the applicant left the roadway for about 7 meters and collided with a telegraph pole. It had apparently travelled straight ahead having failed to take a sweeping curve in the road. As a result of the impact grievous bodily harm was caused to the female passenger sitting in the front seat. 
     
      
    6 When a police officer arrived at the scene shortly after the impact he observed the applicant “running around and jumping in and out of the white van” trying to find his mobile telephone. He also appeared to be aggressive. The officer formed the view that the applicant was under the influence of some substance. Another police officer at the scene described the applicant as having “glassy eyes and when spoken to appeared to have trouble with pronunciation and the formation of sentences”. He observed the applicant swaying from side to side, continually pacing around and closing his eyes “like he was going to fall asleep”. A third police officer also formed the view that the applicant was under the influence of some substance and appeared to have difficulty comprehending instructions. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was breath-tested with a negative result. He was conveyed to a hospital where a sample of blood was taken. Analysis of the applicant’s blood showed the presence of cannabis, heroin and Rohypnol. In the vehicle police found what was described as a “fit kit”, a bag containing syringes, a tourniquet and swabs. There was also found in the vehicle a can that had apparently been converted for the use of smoking a drug. The Crown intends to rely upon expert evidence based upon the analysis of the applicant’s blood to prove that, at the time of the impact of the vehicle he was driving with the telegraph pole, he was under the influence of the drugs alleged in the count in the indictment. 
     
      
    8 The applicant participated in a record of interview during which he stated that the vehicle had been pulling to the left because he thought the wheels were out of alignment. He maintained that he had been driving at about 40-50 kph along Henry Lawson Drive and was tired at the time but in no hurry to get home. He told police that, as he approached the curve, he noticed an on-coming vehicle in the same lane as that in which he was travelling. The applicant steered his vehicle to the right to avoid a collision. Just after the other vehicle had passed him he struck the telegraph pole. He denied drinking alcohol prior to driving his vehicle or taking any drug other than an anti-depressant that had been prescribed for him. He admitted smoking cannabis at times and stated that he had used drugs in the past but added, “at the moment I am trying to be very good”. The applicant said that he had been a heroin user for about six months and admitted having items in his vehicle for using heroin. He told police he had last used heroin about a week earlier. 
     
      
    9 There is in the police brief the statement of a witness who observed the applicant’s vehicle driving at about 80 kph when it came into collision with the telegraph pole. The witness saw no other vehicle in the vicinity. The witness thought that the applicant was affected by drugs because of his behaviour after the collision. 
     
      
    10 The applicant was to stand trial on 12 October 2004. On that date the Crown made an application to Judge Gibb to amend the indictment to add a further count in the alternative being: 
     
      
       
        
         
        On or about 26 October 2002, at East Hills in the State of NSW, did drive a motor vehicle bearing registration number SCF-666 when it was involved in an impact whereby grievous bodily harm was occasioned to Stravroula Galanis, and at the time of the impact, Paul Lykouras did drive in a manner dangerous to another person or persons. 
         
        
       
      
    11 The amendment was opposed by Mr Doris, counsel appearing for the applicant. As has already been mentioned, her Honour granted leave to the Crown to amend the indictment by adding the alternative count but then went on to order separate trials of each of the counts, an order apparently not sought by either party. In light of the fact that the count to be added was in the alternative to the first count it is, to say the least, a somewhat curious result that the two charges should be tried separately. The reason for her Honour taking this course, however, was that, although she believed the amendment to be appropriate, she was of the opinion that the two charges were of a different nature and that there would be prejudice to the applicant if the trial of the alternative count proceeded with the principal charge. 
     
      
    12 The background to the application by the Crown to amend the indictment at a very late stage in the proceedings appears to be that it had been forewarned shortly before the trial that there was to be a challenge by the applicant to the admissibility of the evidence of the taking of the blood sample and the consequent analysis disclosing the presence of the morphine and cannabis. That challenge is to be on the basis that the sample was illegally taken because of a breach by police of the statutory regime governing the taking of a blood sample from the driver of a motor vehicle. The Crown, it seems as a matter of caution, sought to rely upon an alternative basis for proving that the applicant committed an offence under s 52A(3), being that he was driving in a manner dangerous by permitting his vehicle to leave the road surface. 
     
      
    13 Section 52A(3) of the Crimes Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (3)  
        Dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm 
         A person is guilty of the offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm if the vehicle driven by the person is involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm to another person and the driver was, at the time of the impact, driving the vehicle:  
         
          
          (a) under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of a drug, or  
           
          (b) at a speed dangerous to another person or persons, or  
           
          (c) in a manner dangerous to another person or persons.  
          
         
        A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 7 years. 
         
        
       
      
    14 During the hearing of the application, the question was raised from the Bench whether s 52A(3) created one offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, the matters appearing in (a) to (c) of the section being merely alternative ways of proving that particular offence, or created three offences, one offence being prescribed by each of (a), (b) and (c). Neither of the parties had raised this issue before Judge Gibb nor in their written submissions before this Court. The arguments of the parties seemed to have been premised upon the fact that the two charges in the indictment were for distinct and separate offences, albeit arising out of the same factual circumstances. 
     
      
    15 The parties asked for, and were granted, leave to make further written submissions on this issue after the Court reserved its decision. In those further submissions the Crown argued that the section created only one offence and that the alternative counts that the Crown sought to prosecute in the amended indictment were merely different ways of proving the same offence. Mr Doris argued that, whether or not there is only one offence created by the section, proper practice demanded that the Crown stipulate the specific manner in which it says that an offence in breach of the section was committed. He argued that, where the Crown is alleging that the offence was committed in more than one way, it should lay separate charges, each alleging a particular manner in which the offence was committed. In that regard he relied upon Beach (1994) 75 A Crim R 447 at 453. 
     
      
    16 In the present matter it is unnecessary to resolve the issue of whether a single offence is, or multiple offences are, created by the section. The Crown clearly has taken the view that it should lay individual charges for each alleged breach of the section arising from the facts surrounding the particular act of driving, and, if there is more than one, laying the charges in the alternative. There seems to me on reflection to be a real benefit in the Crown following that course: it both informs the accused and the court of the particular allegation made against the accused in each charge and it assists the court in understanding the basis upon which the jury found the accused guilty of a charge on the indictment, if a guilty verdict is returned to one or other of the counts. 
     
      
    17 The real dispute between the parties is whether it was unfair for the Crown to lay the further charge in all the circumstances of this particular matter. It is argued by Mr Doris that it is unfair to the accused for the Crown at this stage in the proceedings to bring the further charge, whether the new charge be a separate and distinct offence or whether it be merely a further allegation in proving the offence created by the section. He also argues that her Honour’s discretion to permit the laying of the alternative count miscarried on a number of discrete bases. The Crown contends that the only error her Honour made was in ordering separate trials of the two charges. 
     
      
    18 The first basis upon which it is said that her Honour’s discretion miscarried is that Gibb DCJ should have refused to consider the question of the amendment until her Honour had ruled upon the admissibility of the evidence of the taking of the blood sample and the analysis. It was submitted that the applicant might have been successful in having the evidence of the blood analysis excluded and, if so, the charge as alleged in the original indictment was bound to fail. It is argued that the Crown should not have been permitted a “second bite of the cherry” by seeking to prove the charge another way “two years down the track”. 
     
      
    19 In support of the application Mr Doris has set out the arguments upon which the applicant will rely in seeking to have the evidence of the analysis of the applicant’s blood excluded from the trial. The Crown spent a significant part of its submissions to the Court in rebutting the arguments put forward by the applicant. However, I do not believe that it is either necessary or appropriate for this Court to embark upon a consideration of the merits or otherwise of the arguments for the exclusion of the evidence. The issue is to be resolved by the applicant firstly satisfying the trial judge that the evidence was obtained unlawfully and, if he is successful in that endeavour, next for the Crown to seek to have the judge exercise the discretion under s 138 of the Evidence Act to permit the evidence to be led notwithstanding the illegality involved. These steps require findings of fact upon evidence that was not before the trial judge and is not before this Court. For example, if there were a breach of the relevant statutory provisions, it would be necessary for the court to consider whether that breach was intentional or unintended. Based upon those findings of fact the court must consider the exercise of a discretion taking into account competing public interests. Even if the blood sample were taken improperly because of some technical breach of the statutory scheme, that conclusion does not by any means determine that the evidence should not be admitted. 
     
      
    20 In my view the present application is not resolved by this Court making some speculative assessment of the prospects of the evidence being either excluded or admitted. I do not believe that the applicant’s argument in support of the current application is made any more powerful by this Court coming to the view, if it could properly do so, that his prospects of being acquitted on the charge as originally particularised was strong because the exclusion of the evidence was very likely. Nor do I believe that it was necessary for her Honour to embark upon that exercise in order to determine whether she ought to exercise her discretion to give leave for the amendment of the indictment. 
     
      
    21 A substantial part of the applicant’s argument in this regard seems to me to be based upon an asserted right to seek to have the charge dismissed upon a technicality without the Crown frustrating that right by laying a charge that may have to be determined on its merits. In my view there is no such right. It may be that the applicant feels aggrieved by the Crown’s attempts to strengthen the case against him because he believed, rightly or wrongly, that the charge initially laid by the Crown would fail at the outset because the evidence of the taking of the blood sample and its subsequent analysis would be rejected by the Court. But an accused person has no right to have a charge prosecuted on one particular factual basis and no other, nor to have the question of his guilt determined by reference to a single charge. It cannot be either oppressive or unfair, in my opinion, for the Crown simply to seek to prove a charge in more than one way, or to rely upon alternative charges arising from the one set of facts. This is so regardless of whether the alternative or additional allegation is raised before or after the trial commences. 
     
      
    22 If during the course of a trial, the Crown seeks to prove that the accused committed the offence charged in some way other than was opened to the jury or other than is set out in the particulars, the question that arises is whether the new allegation has caused the trial to become unfair because, for example, the accused has been deprived of the opportunity of meeting it by the late raising of the new allegation. If the unfairness cannot be addressed by, for example, witnesses being recalled or a short adjournment being granted to the accused, the trial judge will abort the trial and discharge the jury. 
     
      
    23 There is, of course, a rule of practice that precludes the Crown from raising an alternative count late in a criminal trial. But this rule is concerned with ensuring a fair trial and not with limiting the manner in which the Crown can proceed against an accused. The most recent discussion of this constraint upon the Crown’s right to conduct the prosecution as it chooses is found in R v Gulliford [2004] NSWCCA 338. In that case the trial judge formulated an alternative verdict during the defence case. The Crown had not opened to the jury on the availability of such a verdict and it goes without saying that the alternative count was not set out in the indictment. Nevertheless the alternative was left to the jury on the basis that it was capable of being proved by the evidence and the jury might not have been satisfied of all of the elements that made up the principal offence charged in the indictment. 
     
      
    24 In upholding the conviction on the alternative count Wood CJ at CL, with whom the other members of the Court agreed on this point, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        91 While it is generally inadvisable for a trial judge to raise an alternative count, which has not been suggested by trial counsel,  
        R v Pureau 
         (1990) 19 NSWLR 372 and  
        R v Cameron 
         [1983] 2 NSWLR 66 at 71, it is not forbidden. Much will depend upon the timing, whether counsel have had a proper opportunity to deal with it, and whether the defence has been prejudiced, for example in the way that the case was conducted:  
        R v Quinn 
         (1991) 55 A Crim R 435. 
        
       
       
      It was clear in  
      Gulliford 
       that the appellant had suffered no prejudice by the addition of the alternative count and, therefore, there was no miscarriage of justice by it being raised so late in the proceedings. 
       
      
    25 The point is that both the trial judge and this Court are concerned with ensuring a fair trial to the accused and not with some broader concept of unfairness to restrict the Crown in its conduct of the prosecution as might be expected in a sporting contest. I know of no occasion where a Court has refused to allow the Crown to rely upon an alternative count or an alternative way of proving the offence charged simply because to do so might deprive the accused of the chance of a complete acquittal. I do not believe that a court has such a power. 
     
      
    26 In the present case all that has happened is that, albeit very late in the proceedings, the Crown has sought to rely upon a further and alternative allegation of a criminal charge arising from the same facts and circumstances as that which gave rise to the initial charge brought against the applicant. As the Crown can rely upon an alternative count raised for the first time during a trial where to do so would cause no prejudice to the accused, I have difficulty in understanding how the Court can refuse to allow it to do so before the trial commences. Of course, the earlier the alternative allegation is raised, the less likely is it that the new allegation will prejudice the right of an accused to a fair trial. 
     
      
    27 In so far as the applicant contends that it was unfair or oppressive for the Crown to seek to frustrate his chance of being acquitted on the charge as initially laid by bringing an alternative count, the application is completely without merit. In my view it would be a very rare case indeed where a court would refuse to allow the Crown to amend an indictment before the trial commences in order to add an alternative count unless the Court is satisfied that to permit the amendment would result in prejudice to the fair trial of the accused on the amended indictment. 
     
      
    28 The submission that the trial judge should have either herself decided the admissibility of the evidence of the taking of the blood sample or should have empanelled a jury to determine the initial charge before permitting the Crown to lay the alternative count is equally without merit. Clearly if her Honour had taken either course, there was a real risk that the Crown would not have been able to proceed on the alternative count either because to do so would infringe the principle against double jeopardy or because it would be oppressive to require the accused to stand trial on the alternative count having been acquitted of the principal count. In any event, I have expressed my view that the applicant had no right to have the principal count determined before the issue of the amendment of the indictment was decided. 
     
      
    29 It is next submitted that the applicant would be unfairly prejudiced by a joint trial of the two counts. Simply put the contention is that, if the two counts were tried together, the accused would not receive a fair trial on the alternative count in light of the evidence admissible on the first count. In order to prove the principal charge alleging that the applicant was under the influence of a drug the Crown intends to lead evidence not only of the analysis of the blood sample but also of the condition of the applicant following the impact of the motor vehicle as observed by police at the scene and the finding of implements for the administration of a drug, syringes and a bong, in the motor vehicle. There are also the admissions made by the applicant of drug usage in the recorded interview. 
     
      
    30 Of course it may be that after a voir dire hearing, evidence of the taking of the blood sample and its later analysis might be excluded. If that occurred, the trial judge would then have to consider the relevance of the objects found in the motor vehicle, the applicant’s admissions and the evidence of the applicant’s behaviour after the impact, and the police officer’s opinion as to his condition on the charge alleging the applicant was under the influence of a drug. These are matters for determination in a proper structured way as the proceedings progress and not on an application to amend the indictment. It is far from certain to my mind that the exclusion of the evidence of the blood sample would result in the failure of the Crown to prove that the applicant was driving under the influence of a drug or drugs. 
     
      
    31 The Crown has submitted that evidence of the applicant’s intoxication by drugs, even if the blood analysis were excluded, would be admissible on the charge alleging that the applicant was driving in a manner dangerous: see R v McBride [1962] 2 QB 167; R v Thorpe [1972] 1 All ER 929; and R v Woodward [1995] 3 All ER 79. This may or may not be so; it depends upon the weight of the evidence to show that the applicant’s driving may have been affected by the use of drugs: Owens (1987) 30 A Crim R 59. Evidence of the applicant’s state after the impact, the fact that the alco-test failed to indicate that he was under the influence of alcohol, the presence of the implements in the vehicle connected with drug usage and his admissions may, when taken together, be evidence from which the jury could infer that he was affected by drugs to a degree. I am not to be taken as suggesting that the evidence would be sufficiently relevant to overcome its prejudicial value. I am simply indicating that this is a matter that would need to be addressed by the trial judge. For present purposes, I merely express the view that the evidence concerning the applicant’s intoxication by drugs is not necessarily irrelevant to the alternative count alleging that he was driving in a manner dangerous. 
     
      
    32 Ultimately, therefore, the situation may be that the applicant is before the jury only on the alternative count and without any evidence relating to his being under the influence of drugs. On the other hand he may stand before a jury on both charges. If that were the situation, I do not believe that the trial of the alternative count would be so prejudiced by the evidence relating to the principal count that separate trials would be required, assuming that the trial judge held that evidence of drug usage was inadmissible on the alternative count and even assuming that a court has power to grant separate trials on alternative counts or could ever properly exercise such a power. 
     
      
    33 The allegation so far as the alternative count is concerned is a relatively simple one: the fact that the applicant allowed his vehicle to leave the road and impact with a telegraph pole is itself evidence that he was driving in a manner dangerous. I do not understand why it should be thought that, notwithstanding proper directions, warnings and cautions, a jury could not determine that question uninfluenced by the evidence relating to the applicant’s drug usage. It is a common feature of trials that evidence relating to one count on an indictment contains material that is not relevant to another count on the indictment and yet that evidence may be capable of prejudicing an accused on the count to which the evidence is not relevant. Yet where both of those counts arise from the very same factual basis and are part and parcel of the one course of criminal conduct it is almost inconceivable that a court would order separate trials of the two counts, even if they were not framed in the alternative. The court simply relies upon the jury to follow the directions they are given in respect of the use to be made of the evidence relevant to the different counts. 
     
      
    34 The present situation is not significantly dissimilar. I find it difficult to believe that, had the indictment initially been presented to the court with the two alternative counts contained in it, any responsible counsel would have sought to obtain an order for separate trials. There is no difference, in my view, arising from the fact that the Crown sought to add the alternative count on the day of trial. It is unfortunate that the Crown should have taken the course it did so late in the proceedings, but, putting prejudice to the accused by that late decision to one side, the fact that the Crown sought to add the alternative count to the indictment on the day of trial can have no impact upon a determination of the appropriateness of adding the alternative count to the indictment or the decision to have the charges heard together. 
     
      
    35 The remaining basis of complaint by the applicant is that the late decision by the Crown to add the alternative count has prejudiced the ability of the applicant to defend that charge. In particular it is submitted that the delay in the Crown making the allegation contained in the alternative count has deprived the applicant of the ability to have investigations conducted as he would have done had he been initially charged with that offence. There has been an affidavit filed by the applicant’s solicitor indicating that it was his usual practice in defending such allegations to obtain opinions from an expert “Transport engineer” and a mechanic who had examined the vehicle. Neither action was undertaken in the present case because no allegation of driving in a manner dangerous had been brought against the applicant. 
     
      
    36 The fact that an accused has been disadvantaged by delay in preparing a defence has rarely, if ever, been a ground for staying a prosecution. It has generally been accepted that it is sufficient that the jury is made aware of the disadvantages, both presumptive and proven, suffered by an accused in meeting the Crown case because of the delay and that the jury be directed to take that matter into account in determining whether the Crown has proved the charge. The most obvious example of the use of such a direction is in child sexual assault prosecutions: see R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362. 
     
      
    37 In the present case it is perhaps somewhat surprising that such inquiries have not been undertaken in view of the defence available to an accused person under s 52A(8): it is a defence if the accused shows that the impact was not in any way attributable to the fact that he was under the influence of a drug. I note that there is an expert report as to the condition of the vehicle as part of the Crown brief. However that may be, I am not satisfied that any disadvantage occasioned to the accused by the delay of the Crown in laying the allegation that he was driving in a manner dangerous is such that a trial of that allegation would necessarily be unfair. If required, the jury can be directed to take into account that the Crown has to negative that there was any defect in the motor vehicle or any other cause of the impact other than that the applicant was driving in a manner dangerous to the public and that the delay in bringing that allegation may have deprived the applicant of producing material that might raise a doubt that the Crown has satisfied that onus. 
     
      
    38 Similarly a complaint that there may have been witnesses to the accident who are now unavailable is a matter which is normally dealt with by directions to the jury and I cannot see why that would not be the appropriate course in the present case. 
     
      
    39 Finally, it was submitted that the applicant is prejudiced by the fact that there were no committal proceedings in respect of the charge alleging that the applicant was driving in a manner dangerous. While accepting the importance of committal proceedings generally in order to inform an accused of the prosecution case and to test it to a limited degree, I cannot see how the accused has been prejudiced in the present case by the failure to have committal proceedings on what is a very simple allegation based upon evidence most, if not all, of which was relevant to the charge alleging that the applicant was driving under the influence of a drug. If I am in error in my assessment of that situation, there are procedures available for overcoming any prejudice the applicant might have suffered by reason of the Crown laying the new charge ex officio. 
     
      
    40 I propose that the leave to appeal against the order granting leave to the Crown to amend the indictment be granted but the appeal be refused. I further propose that the appeal by the Crown against the order for separate trials be allowed and the order quashed.

     REGINA v HELTON RODREGEOUS RIBEIRO 
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
     1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Chief Judge Blanch in the District Court on 30 April 2004. 
     
      
    2 On that occasion, the applicant appeared before his Honour and pleaded guilty to four counts in an indictment then presented. He also asked for two offences to be taken into account on a form 1. 
     
      
    3 As his Honour found, a plea of guilty had been offered at an early stage and the presentation of the indictment was required by technical irregularities and no delay was attributable to the applicant. 
     
      
    4 The first count to which the applicant pleaded guilty charged aggravated breaking, entering and stealing for which the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. The second count, receiving stolen property, has a prescribed maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 years. The third count, receiving stolen property, has a maximum prescribed penalty of imprisonment for ten years, and a fourth count, possessing a prohibited weapon, for which a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment was applicable. 
     
      
    5 The offences on the form 1 related to possessing housebreaking implements and possessing a prohibited weapon. His Honour imposed sentences on each of the four counts. 
     
      
    6 On the second count he imposed imprisonment for a fixed term of two years and on the third and fourth counts each terms of imprisonment for fixed terms of 12 months. On the first count the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for five years with a non parole period of three years. His Honour ordered that all sentences be served concurrently. Hence it follows that the effective sentence imposed upon the applicant was imprisonment for five years with a non parole period of three years. 
     
      
    7 In helpful written submissions which have been provided to the Court by both parties, counsel for the applicant observed that the impositions may not reflect precisely the approach indicated by the High Court in Pearce v The Queen 1998 194 CLR 610. However, it does not seem to me that that is a matter of any significance to the outcome of this appeal and it suffices to look at the effective sentence in the context of the facts found by his Honour and the submissions made on behalf of the applicant. 
     
      
    8 I have said that the first count was by far the most serious. His Honour sketched those facts which were that on 14 May 2001 a woman aged in early middle years was in her home in a southern Sydney suburb going to the garage in order to leave in her car. She was confronted by the applicant who was wearing a balaclava. There obviously followed a physical struggle between them, the details of which are set out in his Honour's remarks on sentence and which I need not for present purposes repeat in full. 
     
      
    9 Demands were made by the applicant that the woman part with the jewellery which she was wearing. She was then forced into her house and made to disclose the whereabouts of other jewellery. Entry into the house caused an alarm to be triggered and the woman's condition was such that she was unable, due to her quivering and shaking, to switch it off. In fact, the applicant only departed the scene when the victim was able to press a panic alarm and he fled with a large amount of jewellery. 
     
      
    10 One incident in the course of the struggle involved the victim scratching the applicant's face. Showing what I would take to be some sensitivity to the ways in which he might be detected, he directed the victim to wash her hands. Prudently, she only lightly rinsed them and, as his Honour found, the applicant was able to be identified by DNA testing of samples from under the victim's fingernails. 
     
      
    11 The value of the jewellery was considerable. It is of interest to observe that the applicant, who gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings, was taken to the particular items about which he said he remembered very little. However, he was asked what he did with all that jewellery and said that he gave it to someone to sell. He was not sure how much he got for it, but he suggested $10,000 or $9,000. 
     
      
    12 Given the market into which he must have been seeking to dispose of this stolen jewellery, it is obvious that the material stolen was very valuable indeed. It may also be noted in passing that the applicant was unable to identify the purchaser of the goods. He said it was a person he didn't know well, whom he had known through other associates and there the matter was left. 
     
      
    13 The other offences, as I have said, are not as serious, but that is not to say that they were not significant. 
     
      
    14 The second count related to being in possession of a motorcar valued at some $35,000. When the applicant's home was searched pursuant to a warrant there were discovered a valuable pen and men's watch, which were able to be identified as being property stolen from a home in a suburb other than that relevant to the first count. 
     
      
    15 The fourth count referring to a weapon relates to a flick knife which was found in the bedroom of the home. It might also be observed that the charge concerning a weapon taken into account on the form 1 involved an expandable telescopic baton of a type sometimes used by law enforcement agents which was found in the applicant's home. 
     
      
    16 It was this accumulation of facts which were before his Honour and which required the imposition of an appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    17 His Honour approached the matter, as disclosed in his remarks, by observing the facts which I have mentioned and thereafter he turned to subjective matters concerning the applicant and to two particular matters which were obviously of advantage to the applicant in the matter of sentence. 
     
      
    18 The first of these was a reflection of his early pleas of guilty and the second were matters which can conveniently be referred to as matters pursuant to s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    19 The way his Honour assessed the matter and reached the sentences which I have indicated was to conclude, as he said, that an appropriate starting point was ten years imprisonment. He then allowed a discount of some two years to reflect the early pleas of guilty and a further discount of three years for what I have described as the s 23 matters. 
     
      
    20 In submissions today, counsel for the applicant has drawn attention to a remark of his Honour's immediately preceding the assessment of ten years imprisonment as a starting point. His Honour said: “It comes down then to a question of attempting to assess the general criminality involved in these offences and imposing an appropriate sentence with the appropriate discounts.” 
     
      
    21 It was submitted that it can be inferred from this that his Honour had erroneously failed to take into account, in the overall assessment of his starting point, subjective matters other than the two discrete matters which he had dealt with when he reached the figure of ten years. 
     
      
    22 That submission takes his Honour's remark quite out of context. First of all, his Honour, a most experienced sentencing Judge, obviously was not excluding subjective matters when he referred to an “appropriate” sentence. Even more clearly, if one goes back to see what his Honour was talking about, one can observe that he had recited matters relevant to the subjective situation of the applicant commencing with his birth, his problems, his family problems, psychological matters and so forth. 
     
      
    23 I would reject the submission that his Honour's approach to assessing the period of ten years imprisonment was tainted by error. 
     
      
    24 The sole ground of appeal, as expressed, was that the assessment of ten years was manifestly excessive. In the course of argument, however, submissions were developed indicating that the accumulated discounts which I have mentioned, being two years for the pleas of guilty and three years for the s 23 matters, were insufficient in all the circumstances. 
     
      
    25 It can be recorded that the latter circumstances were made known to his Honour in the usual procedure and documentation in relation thereto has been placed in a sealed envelope. That envelope has been opened by this Court and the content read by the members of the Bench and counsel appearing for the applicant and for the Crown. 
     
      
    26 It suffices, in my view, to observe that the additional discount of three years is well within the range of the sound exercise of his Honour's discretion in reflecting those matters. I am also of a view that no error is manifest in his Honour's initial discount from the period of ten years of two years representing the early pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    27 The period of ten years, as representative of an appropriate sentence for the criminality of this particular offender, does not, in my view, manifest any error. 
     
      
    28 Some particular attention was directed by counsel to remarks by Hodgson JA and Simpson J, respectively, in the appeal of Regina v NP [2003] NSWCCA 195, in particular, in submitting that the overall discount for the two discrete matters of the plea of guilty and the s 23 assistance should be 60 per cent rather than 50 per cent. Our attention was directed to the remark of Simpson J: 
     
      
       
        
        “The result of the rigorous application of what had become relatively standardised discounts (especially where a considerable discount for a plea of guilty is added to an even more considerable discount for significant assistance) can, on occasion, cause a sharp intake of breath, but that is the result of the application of correct and established legal principle.” 
        
       
      
    29 I have no quarrel with her Honour's remark, but the implication of the submission of the applicant that provocation of a sharp intake of breath is an objective and, somehow or other, a touchstone for seeing whether or not sufficient discount has been made, is a proposition which I can not endorse. 
     
      
    30 In my view, no error has been shown to have been committed by his Honour and the application for leave to appeal should be granted, but the appeal dismissed 
     
      
    31 JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of the presiding Judge and with the orders proposed by his Honour 
     
      
    32 GROVE J: The orders of the Court therefore will be as I have proposed.

      SENTENCE 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The prisoner David Tuigamala was convicted after trial of the murder of Barry John Alexander. He now appears for sentence. 
     
      
      FACTS: 
      
    2 The offence occurred at about 5am on 6 December 2003 at the Club Hotel, Campbelltown, where the prisoner and some associates were drinking. He had earlier attended another hotel but, on his account, while he had been drinking beer and bourbon and Coke, he was not overly affected by alcohol. On his own estimate, he placed himself at 5 on a scale of 1 to 10 of intoxication. 
     
      
    3 The deceased, who was also drinking at the hotel, was, however, very much affected by alcohol, as was evidenced by his blood alcohol concentration of 0.285 grams of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, ascertained following the post-mortem examination. 
     
      
    4 He had been drinking with friends for about nine hours or so at various establishments, including Sweeneys, The City Hotel and the Club Hotel. 
     
      
    5 The offence occurred when the deceased walked from the toilet area of the hotel toward the table where the prisoner was sitting with some Islander friends. As he approached their table, some words were spoken which led to the prisoner striking the deceased once to the face with a heavy left hook. It landed with sufficient force to knock the deceased, who was a large 39 year old man, 176 centimetres tall and weighing 116 kgs, to the ground knocking him out. 
     
      
    6 Hotel security staff arrived at the scene and instructed the prisoner to move away. They lifted the deceased to a sitting position, where he sat, slumped and at best only partially conscious. While being held up, the prisoner stepped forward from the group of men who had gathered and kicked the deceased savagely to the left side of the face with a heavy size 12 Colorado boot which he was wearing. 
     
      
    7 The deceased was flung back to the ground and although attempts were made to resuscitate him, he died within a very short time, before the arrival of police and ambulance staff. 
     
      
    8 The blow with the boot was likened by eyewitnesses to a man kicking a football. It landed with sufficient force to cause significant injuries to the left side of the deceased's face, including fractures to the left auxiliary sinus, fragmented fractures of the maxillary sinus, a fracture of the inner end of the inferior margin of the left orbit and a comminuted fracture of the left nasal cartilage. 
     
      
    9 The prisoner is himself a large and powerfully built man who was aged 29 years at the time of the offence and who had trained, although not fought, as a boxer. 
     
      
    10 The deceased was found to have died as a result of the combined effect of asphyxiation due to the presence of blood in his airways and lungs coming from the nasal and sinus injuries. 
     
      
    11 There were only two issues in the trial; namely, whether the prisoner had intended to cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased and whether he had acted under provocation. To some extent, these were associated in that they related to evidence which was led at the trial from the prisoner and from Winston Tuliakioni to the effect that, as the deceased approached the prisoner's table, he had said words to the effect, ""fuck you, fuck you"" or ""fuck you all"", or ""fuck off"", although nothing more. 
     
      
    12 A somewhat more offensive observation was attributed to him by Vali Sua with whom the deceased had been engaged about an hour earlier in an exchange, which could have led to an altercation, but which was amicably resolved due to the intervention of two other patrons and which led to them shaking hands and having a drink together. 
     
      
    13 It was Sua's account that the deceased had said to the prisoner, who was an Islander, and to the other islanders at his table, ""You think you black cunts can come and rule this club"". An issue arose as to whether he was telling the truth or attempting to assist his friend. No one else gave evidence of hearing this observation, and when Sua spoke to police, within days of the offence, he said that he could not remember the words that were used. I have no doubt that the jury disbelieved this part of the evidence. I similarly disbelieve it in view of the fact that neither the prisoner, who said that he reacted to the words which had been spoken by the deceased, or Tuliakioni, heard the offensive and insulting words which Sua attributed to him. 
     
      
    14 I accept that the deceased did use the expression ""fuck you"" when speaking to the prisoner, but whether that was a gratuitous unprovoked observation or whether he was responding to something that the prisoner had already said is less certain. There was in that regard some support for a finding that the prisoner had spoken himself, before the punch, having regard to the evidence of Margarita Lopez that she heard him say, while the bouncers were assisting the deceased, ""He deserved it. I told him to fuck off"". 
     
      
    15 Whatever did occur, the jury found that provocation had been negatived by the Crown. Properly was that so, since the jury would been well entitled to have been satisfied, if the observation ""fuck you"" had been made, either once or repeated, that it was not such as could have caused an ordinary person in the position of the prisoner, and of his age and maturity, to have so far lost his self-control as to form an intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    16 There was also an unanswerable case, based upon the evidence of the prisoner, and independently supported by the evidence of the eyewitnesses, that he paused after the punch, contemplated what he would do next, and then deliberately launched a powerful kick to the face of the deceased with the knowledge and intention of causing him grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    17 To that extent, but only to that extent, the fatal kick was premeditated. That arises not only from the interval between the punch and the kick, during which period the bouncers had come over and asked the prisoner to move away, Sua had told him not to do any more, and the bouncers had been bringing the deceased to a sitting position. It also arises from the several admissions which the prisoner made during cross-examination concerning his state of mind. I do, however, accept that what occurred had not been planned before the exchange between the two men. 
     
      
    18 The prisoner's conviction for murder was inevitable, and while he has shown some limited remorse for the offence in the histories which he has provided to the experts who have provided evidence on sentencing, he does continue to attribute at least some of the blame to the deceased. To that extent, his insight into his criminality is at best partial. 
     
      
    19 It is obvious that he was angry, and it is also probable that this was in part due to the effects of alcohol on him and also to his limited intelligence and powers of self-control, to which I will return shortly. 
     
      
    20 The prisoner's anger might help to explain why the offence was committed, but it does not exclude the existence of the intention which was required for the offence of murder. Alcohol might also have had some effect in causing the prisoner to overreact, but it similarly does not provide any defence. 
     
      
    21 Assuming in the prisoner's favour that the words ""fuck you"" were used, they were hardly sufficient to justify any significant response, let alone the exceedingly violent response that occurred on this occasion. The prisoner's reaction was brutal, it was excessive, and it involved a form of conduct, in using the boot, for which the community holds a particular abhorrence. 
     
      
    22 I have taken the victim impact statements, from the widow and father of the deceased, into account in accordance with the principles stated in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76, a decision I consider to be binding upon me until it is reconsidered by the Court of Court of Criminal Appeal in the light of the most recent amendments to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: See R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300, where the possibility of its review was raised, but reserved for another day.  
     
      
    23 The victim impact statements show, in a most graphic way, the devastating consequences upon the family of the deceased who have lost a loved and supporting father as the result of a senseless act of criminality. It is impossible to summarise the loss which has been occasioned in a few short paragraphs, and to do so, or to attempt to do so, would only be to detract from their content.  
     
      
    24 It is enough to say that a large family has been significantly and permanently shattered by this event, and that a widow, and two young children, have been left in a situation which is beyond their comprehension, and which not only risks significant financial loss for them, but has left them with deep and permanent emotional harm. Clearly, no sentence which any Court could impose can ever even begin to substitute or rectify that loss. 
     
      
       
      SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES 
       
      
    25 Subjectively, the prisoner is of Samoan extraction, having been born on 12 August 1977. He came to this country in 1993 and was, at the time of the offence, living in a de facto relationship. He has two children, and he had been largely employed as a labourer, storeman, car detailer, spray painter and furniture manufacturer. He was schooled to year 9 and had a difficulty with learning and truancy, both in his country of birth and in this country.  
     
      
    26 Unfortunately, as seems to be a feature of Samoan culture, he was subjected to physical discipline both at the hands of his father and school authorities, which was only likely to accustom him to violence as a means of response. That is, however, of limited significance since those who take up life in this country are expected to adjust to its norms or otherwise to accept the consequences. That arises from the fact that the protection of the community and deterrence are among the specific objectives of sentencing referred to in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    27 The prisoner has a prior record which commenced on 14 May 1997 with a conviction for malicious damage which led to a fine. One month later, on 11 June, he was fined again, this time for an offence of stealing. 
     
      
    28 On 23 April 1999 he was sentenced to imprisonment for two years and six months, comprising a minimum term of six months and an additional term of two years, for offences of aggravated robbery with wounding and robbery in company. 
     
      
    29 On 3 April 2000, he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for an offence of affray, and for an offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. A probation period was fixed of four months. 
     
      
    30 On 18 May 2002, he was fined for mid range PCA and driving while never having been licensed. 
     
      
    31 This is a short, although discreditable record, which shows the prisoner to have had little regard for the constraints of the law. 
     
      
    32 A number of reports have been tendered as to the psychosocial and psychological background of the Prisoner, from Dr Reid, Dr Nielssen, Emma Collins and Danielle Castles. These reports record a consistent history of the prisoner having been a slow learner from childhood, and of having experienced a number of falls and fights which left him with some apparently minor head injuries, although without any signs of him sustaining permanent brain damage. 
     
      
    33 On psychological testing, it was found that he had experienced difficulty due to cultural and language factors in completing the relevant tests. He was however assessed as being of borderline premorbid intellectual ability, falling into the first percentile for persons of a similar age. He was also assessed as illiterate with poor verbal skills. It was Dr Reid's opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am of the opinion however his low intelligence, poor verbal skills and socio-cultural factors contributed to Mr Tuigamala's poor impulse control and violent outburst. Furthermore, it seems that Mr Tuigamala's limited cognitive abilities have resulted in him acting out his emotions, later being remorseful for his actions, a pattern of behaviour that has previously got him into trouble. 
        
       
       
        
        It is felt Mr Tuigamala could benefit from a highly structured anger management program teaching him simple behavioural strategies to remove himself from situations where he is likely to get angry, recognise early warning signs of anger and have repetition of instructions and feedback within the behavioural management program.” 
        
       
      
    34 Miss Collins and Miss Castles recorded, as part of the histories provided by the Prisoner, that he had been sent to Australia with the aim that eventually he would work and send money back to support his large family in Samoa. He found the environment in Sydney somewhat more favourable and less violent than at home, but he missed his family and he had some difficulties with his relocation, which increased when his uncle, with whom he was residing, died in 1996. Thereafter, he began to associate with delinquent peers and became involved in criminal behaviour. He also began to experiment with alcohol and substance abuse. 
     
      
    35 Miss Collins noted that, following the death of his uncle and the prisoner's departure from their home: 
     
      
       
        
        “… his antisocial behaviour appeared to escalate, impacted by drug use and association with delinquent peers. In considering his history, Mr Tuigamala impresses as someone who lacks reasonable impulse control. This is suggested from the cognitive testing completed by Dr Reid, his deteriorating behaviour and general presentation during the assessment. Due to his poor cognitive functioning, Mr Tuigamala appears to lack the necessary resources to regulate his behaviour and is subject to irrational and impulsive behaviour. His alcohol use, particularly with regards to the current offence, acted as a disinhibitor in relation to his aggressive conduct. Furthermore, his exposure to violence from an early age normalises the use of aggression as a means of coping and control, and Mr Tuigamala simply does not have the internal mechanisms to regulate the expression of such behaviour. A synthesis of an early introduction to violence, reduced intellectual ability and alcohol abuse are integral factors in his impulse difficulties and as such resulted in his criminal conduct. He will need therapeutic assistance in order to learn to regulate his behaviours and not resort to aggression as a coping mechanism with regards to future stressors.” 
        
       
      
    36 She also said that his difficulties with self regulation represent the highest risk factor with regards to his future dangerousness and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Tuigamala remains a young man highly susceptible to the influence of others. His low resourcefulness and cognitive functioning, and his early exposure to maladaptive parenting will make it likely that he will be easily institutionalised within a custodial environment. It will be to his advantage to make as much use as possible of rehabilitation options, including an opportunity to utilise as early a release as possible to further his rehabilitation in the community. It is likely that Mr Tuigamala will need continued support upon his return to the community to help him integrate and resume employment upon release. At that time, a review of his potential for substance abuse treatment will be necessary.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    37 Dr Nielssen, who was principally concerned with the prisoner's fitness to plead, as to which he was satisfied, eliminated any form of psychiatric disorder. Although he did not subject the prisoner to any formal psychological testing, he assessed his overall intelligence to be at the bottom half of the normal range, rather than at the level equivalent to mental retardation. This was based on his vocabulary, verbal expression, literacy and general knowledge disclosed during the interview. I consider that this impression of Dr Nielssen was likely to have been a more realistic assessment of the prisoner's functioning intelligence, since it was clear that he had some limitations due to language, and the like, in response to formal testing. 
     
      
      THE SENTENCING 
       
      
    38 The case is one to which the provisions of s 3A and s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act apply. It is also one which falls within Division 1A of part 4 of the Act, being an offence identified in the table, to that Division, as carrying a standard non-parole period of 20 years. 
     
      
    39 The application of those provisions was established by the Court of Criminal Appeal in its decision in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131, where it was said by the Court: 
     
      
       
        
        “117. In order to give the Division practical utility it seems to us, in the light of the foregoing analysis, that a sentencing judge must ask and answer the following question: “are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period?” 
        
       
       
        
        118. That question will be answered by considering: 
        
       
       
        
        (i) the objective seriousness of the offence, considered in the light of the facts, which relate directly to its commission, including those which may explain why it was committed, so as to determine whether it answers the description of one that falls into the mid range of seriousness for an offence of the relevant kind; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the circumstances of aggravation, and of mitigation, which are present in the subject case, or which apply to the particular offender, as listed in s 21A(2) and (3), and as incorporated by the general provisions in s 21A(1)(c) and by the concluding sentence to s 21A(1).  
        
       
       
        
        119. Depending upon the considerations referred to in the first of these paragraphs, it may become immediately apparent that the case is not one for which the standard non-parole period specified in the Table was intended to apply. 
        
       
       
        
        120. Whatever be the case in that regard, the considerations referred to in the second paragraph may similarly provide a reason for a departure from the standard non-parole period.  
        
       
       
        
        121. If the question, which we consider should be posed, is answered in the affirmative, then it seems to us that the Court should exercise its sentencing discretion in accordance with established sentencing practice and by reference to the matters identified in sections 3A, 21A, 22, 22A and 23 of the Act. The ultimate objective remains one of imposing a sentence that is just and appropriate, having regard to all of the circumstances of the offence and of the offender, and so as to give effect to the purposes mentioned in s 3A of the  
        Sentencing Procedure Act 
        .  
        
       
       
        
        122. In this approach the standard non-parole period can properly take its place as a reference point, or benchmark, or sounding board, or guidepost, along with the other extrinsic aids such as authorities, statistics, guideline judgments and the specified maximum penalty, as are applicable and relevant. In particular, it can have a direct relevance as a reference point to be compared with the sentence which is provisionally reached after an assessment has been made of the relative seriousness of the subject offence, and of the various aggravating and mitigating factors, as well as any other subjective factor that may be present, including in particular the fact, if it be the case, that the offender entered a plea of guilty. In that regard the sentencing judge will need to keep in mind that the standard non-parole periods were framed upon the assumption that the case was determined at trial and that s 22 of the Act contemplates that the fact of a plea will attract a discount. 
        
       
       
        
        123. The reference point has, in this sense, an important role to play in ensuring consistency in sentencing. Because the standard non-parole period will be imposed, subject to s 21A, for matters within the mid range, it will act as a guide for cases that are outside the mid range.  
        
       
       
        
        124. The desirability of a judge adopting the practice of standing back after reaching a provisional sentence, and of reviewing it so as to be sure that it is appropriate for the offence at hand (see the observations made in  
        R v McGourty 
         [2002] NSWCCA 335 at para 45), cannot be understated, and the existence of a standard non-parole period is likely to be of assistance in this respect.  
        
       
       
        
        125. Sight should also not be lost of the fundamental principle noted in  
        Hoare v The Queen 
         (1989) 167 CLR 348 at 354: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Secondly, a basic principle of sentencing law is that a sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court should never exceed that which can be justified as appropriate or proportionate to the gravity of the crime considered in the light of its  
          objective 
           circumstances.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        126. It is true that the Division does not specify either a minimum or a maximum non-parole period for the relevant offence, nor is there anything to suggest that it had in contemplation either a linear, or an exponential progression within a range between those points, in which the mean was to be understood as the standard non-parole period. Had there been an intention to convert sentencing to a precise arithmetic exercise of that kind then those reference points would need to have been identified and consideration given to the weight to be attached to the adjusting factors. The absence of any provision of that kind is a further pointer towards the continuation of a wide area of discretion, without resort to some rigid mechanistic or arithmetic approach, of the kind which would be totally unsuited to the difficult task of sentencing.  
        
       
       
        
        127. The approach which we have outlined does not seem to require a departure from the intuitive or instinctive synthesis approach to sentencing which received judicial support in  
        R v Thomson and Houlton 
         (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at paras 57-60 and which was favoured in the joint judgment in  
        Wong v The Queen  
        (2001) 207 CLR 584, but which has also attracted some criticism ( 
        R v Markarian 
         [2003] NSWCCA 8 – special leave to appeal to the High Court granted). Nor do we see it as requiring resort to a rigid two-tiered approach which involves determining an objective sentence and then adjusting it to take account of subjective factors of the kind which was criticised in  
        AB v The Queen 
         (1999) 198 CLR 111, per McHugh and Hayne JJ.” 
        
       
      
    40 I am satisfied, having regard to the test laid down in that decision, that the offence of the prisoner should be assessed as one which would place it in the mid range of objective seriousness for an offence of its kind. I am also satisfied that there are no reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    41 In the present case, the violence was extreme, and as I observed, not only did the prisoner fail to respond to attempts to restrain him, he also had the opportunity for reflection, between the punch and the kick, yet he elected to go ahead with a further brutal response to a defenceless man on the ground. While I accept that he has limited intelligence and powers of self-control arising from his background and personality, and acted excessively while partially intoxicated, I am not persuaded that those factors in this case significantly reduced his objective criminality. 
     
      
    42 In short, the case is not one where there was that degree of psychiatric or psychological disturbance, or disinhibition, or significant dysfunctional background, or other circumstances, beyond a trivial provocation, to provoke the explosive rage and loss of self-control that was exhibited. 
     
      
    43 In the present case, the aggravating factors which are referred to in s 21A, which were not themselves ingredients of the offence of murder, are confined to those mentioned in s 21A(2)(d), that is in relation to his prior record of criminality. The only mitigating factors referred to in s 21A(3) that were present were those mentioned in subparagraph (b), that mentioned in subparagraph (c) to a very limited extent in so far as the deceased offered the relatively mild observation ""fuck you"", and also that referred to in (i) to a limited extent.  
     
      
    44 The uttering of the words mentioned, although they were no doubt offensive and unnecessary, could hardly have been a shock to a person such as the prisoner who has served time in prison and who could not be described as a naive or delicate man unaccustomed to earthy language.  
     
      
    45 Otherwise, all that operates in his favour, particularly in the absence of any evidence of significant remorse, is that the killing was not planned, was to a considerable extent impulsive, and was not one where the prisoner intended the consequence to be a death. 
     
      
    46 As I have indicated, there was to a limited degree remorse, but it is not a case where there has been a clear or significant expression of remorse. I am satisfied that the prisoner was aware that the consequences of his act would at least be very serious facial injury although no doubt he did not contemplate a death. To that extent, the factor referred to in s 21A(3)(j) does not apply. 
     
      
    47 The offence here involved is the kind of offence which calls for a sentence that carries with it not only a significant element of personal deterrence, but one that also conveys a significant element of general deterrence. Those who frequent hotels need to understand that they are places for convivial social gatherings and not an occasion for vicious street brawls. The mix of alcohol, aggression and youth is always volatile, but that fact only strengthens the need for restraint on the part of those who attend such places. 
     
      
    48 The prisoner has not responded favourably to probation or parole in the past, and I find that his prospects of rehabilitation are at best slim, in the light of his record, his limited intelligence and self-control, and his preconditioning to violence as a first response. That emerges from the expert reports which I have earlier noted. 
     
      
    49 I do not consider in this case that special circumstances exist that would require an extension of the balance of term as provided by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Clearly, the prisoner would benefit from a lengthy period of post release supervision as well as anger management counselling. However, the balance of the term which I have in mind would be sufficient to provide for that. I would, however, recommend that such counselling commence during the term of his custody. 
     
      
    50 Otherwise, as explained in the decisions in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 and R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172, I have taken into account the various matters that could otherwise qualify as special circumstances, in setting the sentence, and to reapply again, by way of a special circumstances, would only be to involve a double counting of the kind which the authorities say is inappropriate. 
     
      
    51 Upon that basis, I sentence you, David Tuigamala, to a non-parole period of 20 years to date from 7 September 2003, and to a balance of term of six years. The overall sentence, accordingly, is one of imprisonment for 26 years to date from 7 September 2003 with a non-parole period of 20 years to date from 7 September 2003 and to expire on 6 September 2023. The last mentioned date is the earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole.

    1 MCCOLL JA: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 LEVINE J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    3 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Ernest John Wilkinson, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, an offence under s61J of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum sentence of twenty years imprisonment. There were two further charges under the same provision on a Form 1. He was sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen years, to date from the day of his arrest, 9 October 2002, with a non-parole period of thirteen and a half years. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    4 The three offences were committed over a period between April 2001 and September 2002, when the complainant was between thirteen and fourteen years old. The circumstance of aggravation in each case was that she was under the age of sixteen: s61J(2)(d). She also suffered from a mild intellectual disability, having a mental age of eight to nine years. The applicant knew her because he had previously had a relationship with her mother. The three offences, together with several other incidents of a similar nature, occurred on occasions when she was staying at the applicant’s home. 
     
      
    5 The first of the three offences occurred in the later part of 2001, the second in June 2002, and the third towards the end of September 2002. It is unnecessary to recite the detail of the offences except to record that each involved penile/vaginal intercourse. The complainant became pregnant as a result of the second offence, and it was this which brought the applicant’s conduct to light. The pregnancy was terminated. Police were notified, and the applicant was arrested and interviewed on 9 October 2002.  
     
      
    6 The complainant had been interviewed on 3 October 2002. She described the incident which gave rise to her pregnancy and, although she had difficulty articulating the act of sexual intercourse, she made it clear that the sexual activity took place over her protests. She said that there had been similar incidents before but she provided no detail about those occasions. Asked how often it had occurred before, she could only say “more than once.” 
     
      
    7 From the progress of her pregnancy, it was clear that the act of intercourse giving rising to it had occurred some time in June 2002. This was the second offence on the Form 1. In his police interview, the applicant not only admitted intercourse on that occasion but also provided the information giving rise to the principal offence and the first offence on the Form 1. Without that information those charges could not have been framed. He admitted having had intercourse with the complainant “about half a dozen times”, saying that the incidents he described giving rise to the other two charges were the first and last of those occasions. The principal charge related to that last occasion, and the first charge on the Form 1 to the first occasion. 
     
      
    8 On 1 October 2002, prior to his arrest, the applicant attempted suicide by an overdose of prescription drugs when he heard about the complainant’s pregnancy. He told police that he did so because he knew that “everything would come out” about his sexual contact with the complainant and that he was afraid of reprisals which might be arranged by her father, who had contacts in the prison system. He added, “I knew that I’d sooner die in me sleep than die stabbed to death or bashed to death”. He also said that he had left a tape for the complainant in which, as he put it, “I said somethin’ along the lines that, that I was sorry for what I’d done, and that I’d be better off dead and it wasn’t her fault that I committed suicide and not to blame herself… and that I loved her”. Asked how he would describe his love for her, he said, “She was somethin’ special to me, that’s all… It wouldn’t be like a love between a man and a woman, it was just a love that I felt for her. I think because she was the only person that I felt comfortable with.”  
     
      
    9 He pleaded guilty to the principal charge in the Local Court and was committed for sentence.  
     
      
       
      Subjective Case 
       
      
    10 The applicant was aged between fifty-three and fifty-four years at the time of the offences and is now fifty-seven. He has a lengthy criminal record, including some entries for offences of a sexual nature which were very important in the sentencing task faced by the primary judge. His record begins with offences of dishonesty dealt with in the Children’s Court when he was only eleven years old. It continues into his adult years and, apart from sexual offences, is mainly composed of offences of dishonesty, some of them serious enough to have resulted in terms of imprisonment.  
     
      
    11 In 1964, on his seventeenth birthday, a judge of the Supreme Court ordered that he be detained in a juvenile institution for carnal knowledge and indecent assault of a female under sixteen years of age. There was no evidence before the sentencing judge in the present case about the circumstances of those offences. However, it is his sexual offences as an adult which are of primary significance and his Honour did have the facts of some of those. 
     
      
    12 In 1983, when he was thirty-five years old, he was found guilty at trial of six counts of sexual intercourse without consent and a related count of robbery, and was sentenced to terms of imprisonment aggregating twelve years with a non-parole period to expire on 1 July 1987 (a period of about five years and seven months). His appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed: R v Wilkinson (CCA, unreported, 6 October 1983). The offences arose from one incident, in which he forced a sixteen year old girl into a derelict house, detained her for five hours, subjected her to five acts of vaginal intercourse and one of anal intercourse, and took from her what Street CJ in the Court of Criminal Appeal described as “some trifling possessions” and a small sum of money. He was released on parole in December 1985, aged thirty-nine. 
     
      
    13 In 1988, at the age of forty, he was convicted in the District Court of four counts of homosexual intercourse with a male under eighteen years of age, and was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for three years and six months with a non-parole period of three years. The facts of those offences, which were committed while on parole, were not before his Honour in the present case. However, there was a psychiatric report of Dr Jonathon Carne, to which it will be necessary to refer later. In recounting his history to Dr Carne, the applicant said that the sexual activity the subject of those charges was consensual.  
     
      
    14 In 1990, at the age of forty-two, he was convicted of sexual intercourse without consent of a person under the age of sixteen, armed robbery and indecent assault. He was again on parole at the time of these offences. He was sentenced to terms of imprisonment aggregating eight years and eight months with a minimum term of seven years. The offences arose from two incidents, two days apart. 
     
      
    15 For several months in 1990 he was living with his brother and sister-in-law in Albury. On 9 July 1990 he sexually assaulted their daughter, his niece, by placing his hand inside her clothing and rubbing her vagina. He stopped when she told him to. She told her mother what he had done. He left the house early the following morning, leaving a note apologising for his action. 
     
      
    16 The following day, he was hitch-hiking towards Goulburn when a man stopped to offer him a lift. He directed the driver to a bushland area, where he threatened him with knife, forced him into the bush, tied him up, removed his trousers and underpants and fondled his penis. He then gagged the victim and left him tied to a tree. The charge of armed robbery also arose from this incident but the material before his Honour did not disclose what property was stolen.  
     
      
    17 He was again released on parole in July 1997, but this parole period had expired well before the commission of the present offences.  
     
      
    18 He had a dismal childhood, the detail of which need not be recited. It is sufficient to say that he never knew a stable family life, and spent periods in institutions not only for committing offences but also upon being found to be what was then known as an “uncontrollable” child. His only education was in those institutions, and it was limited. As an adult, apart from periods of imprisonment, he pursued an itinerant lifestyle with casual employment in unskilled positions. He had never had a long term intimate relationship. At the time of the present offences he was living alone in Housing Department accommodation in the south-west of Sydney. 
     
      
    19 Before his Honour was a report of 9 October 2002 by Associate Professor K Wilhelm, psychiatrist, of the St Vincent’s Mental Health Service, prepared following the applicant’s suicide attempt on 1 October. Professor Wilhelm described that attempt as “severe and intended to kill him”. From the history provided, he diagnosed a condition of worsening depression over the previous six months. However, he found that the applicant was not “psychotic, delirious, or obviously depressed in terms of psychomotor change or profound suicidal ideation”. He added, nevertheless, that he does “constitute an ongoing suicidal risk but this is unlikely to be resolved by any psychiatric treatment”. 
     
      
    20 In a report of June 2003, Dr Carne concluded that the applicant had an antisocial personality disorder and was depressed in the period leading up to the offences. He recommended that, while in custody, he attend a sexual offenders program and be assessed by a forensic psychiatrist experienced in the treatment of such offenders, and that such a regime should continue upon his release. He also recommended consideration of the use of long-acting antiandrogen medications to decrease his sexual drive. 
     
      
    21 From those reports and from the report of a general practitioner, Dr V M Nguyen, it also appears that the applicant suffers from serious organic health problems. He has severe, chronic ischaemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease. He has suffered a number of acute myocardial infarctions and had coronary bypass surgery in 1991. A further blockage was detected in 1994 but, because of his continued heavy smoking, surgery was deferred. Dr Nguyen reported in May 2003 that he had been experiencing recurrent angina attacks despite being on “maximum medical treatment”. In addition, he suffers from chronic insulin dependant diabetes, which is poorly controlled, as well as chronic asthma, hypercholesteronaemia and gout. He has been on an array of medication. However, Dr Nguyen reported that he was often not compliant with treatment and that, if he continued his current lifestyle, his prognosis was “extremely poor”. 
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    22 In this Court Mr Hulme SC, for the applicant, submitted that the sentence is manifestly excessive, arguing that this was the result of a number of specific errors to be identified in his Honour’s remarks on sentence. It is convenient to deal firstly with those specific matters.  
     
      
       
      Standard non-parole period 
       
      
    23 At the commencement of the remarks, having referred to the applicant’s plea of guilty to “aggravated sexual assault” and the maximum penalty for the offence, his Honour observed, “The standard non-parole period is ten years.” Clearly, this was a reference to the standard non-parole period for the offence under s61J of the Crimes Act to be found in the table to division 1A of part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: see s54B of that Act. However, those provisions were introduced in 2002 and apply only to offences committed on or after 1 February 2003. They did not apply to this case. 
     
      
    24 In R v Ohar [2004] NSWCCA 83, this Court held that a sentencing judge was in error in seeking “some guidance” from the table of standard non-parole periods for the purpose of sentence in a case which was not governed by those provisions, even though that judge was aware of that fact and recognised that he was “not bound” by them: see the judgment of James J at [83] - [85]. The Crown prosecutor before us noted that his Honour made no further reference to the standard non-parole period, and argued that the conclusion could not be drawn that he had regard to it in an impermissible way in the sentencing process. However, one is left to wonder why his Honour did refer to it at all, particularly given that he did so immediately after his reference to the maximum sentence. I am driven to the conclusion that his Honour mistakenly believed it to be applicable to the case. 
     
      
    25 I think that there is force in Mr Hulme’s argument that, although not expressed, the assumption that the ten year standard non-parole period applied explains the manner in which the sentence was arrived at. Section 54A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that the standard non-parole period “represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness” of offences of that kind. Given the facts and the applicant’s antecedents, which highlighted the need for particular deterrence, his Honour fairly observed that these offences were “deserving of the most severe punishment”. If he had used the standard non-parole period of ten years as a starting point, one can understand how he might have arrived at the non-parole period of thirteen and a half years which he specified. If one were then to add a third of that period, four and a half years, the result is the head sentence of eighteen years which was passed. That approach would have been consistent with s44 of the Act as it is now expressed, having itself been amended in 2002 and also applying in its amended form to offences committed on or after 1 February 2003. 
     
      
    26 In short, it appears to me that his Honour dealt with the matter in accordance with the statutory regime introduced by the 2002 amendments and, in so doing, he fell into error. This is sufficient to warrant this Court’s intervention and to enliven our discretion to re-sentence. It certainly could not be said, in the terms of s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, that no lesser sentence than that which his Honour passed was warranted in law. Strictly, it is unnecessary to determine the other particular matters raised by Mr Hulme. However, it is appropriate to refer to them and some of them bear on the assessment of the sentence which should now be passed.  
     
      
    27 Form 1 matters 
     
      
       
      At the beginning of his remarks, his Honour referred to the committal charge and to the two other charges on the Form 1 which, he said, “have been taken into account…”. However, he went on to refer to the three offences without distinguishing between the principal offence and those on the Form 1. More importantly, at the end of the remarks he passed sentence in this way: 
       
       
        
        I sentence you to a term of eighteen years imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of thirteen and a half years. 
        
       
       
      He then set out the commencement date of the sentence and the terminal dates of the non-parole period and the head sentence. However, he did not express the sentence to be referable to the committal charge, with the Form 1 matters being taken into account. 
       
      
    28 Moreover, the transcript discloses that the procedure set out in s33(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, dealing with outstanding charges being taken account, was not followed. While the Form 1 document cannot now be found, it is accepted that the applicant signed it and intended that the two additional offences be taken into account. Section 33(2) permits a court to take a further offence into account if the offender admits his or her guilt of that further offence and indicates that he or she wants the court to take it into account when sentencing for the principal offence. These are formal steps which should be taken and recorded during the sentence proceedings. It does not appear that his Honour asked the applicant whether he admitted his guilt to the two matters on the Form 1 and whether he wished them to be taken into account when being sentenced for the committal charge. 
     
      
    29 From all this, Mr Hulme submitted, it should be inferred that his Honour failed to approach the matter in accordance with the principles governing the Form 1 procedure enunciated by Spigelman CJ in Attorney General’s Application under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146, particularly at [42] – [43]. Mr Hulme argued that he appears to have passed a sentence intended to reflect the total criminality of the three offences, rather than focusing upon the principal offence. The Crown prosecutor submitted that that inference should not be drawn, relying upon the fact that his Honour did specify at the outset of his remarks that the two charges on the Form 1 “have been taken into account.” 
     
      
    30 For present purposes, the matter need not be resolved. However, it highlights the need to ensure that the procedure in s33(2) is followed and that the formal sentencing order expressly records that the sentence is passed in respect of the principal offence, with the Form 1 matter or matters being taken into account.  
     
      
    31 Plea of guilty, contrition and co-operation 
     
      
       
      As was accepted by the Crown’s representative at the sentence proceedings, the applicant had pleaded guilty to the principal charge at the earliest opportunity. As I have said, the two charges on the Form 1 were able to be framed only because of his admissions. Moreover, in admitting that there had been about half a dozen acts of intercourse in all, he acknowledged a wider pattern of abuse than the complainant herself had been able to articulate. 
       
      
    32 As to the plea of guilty, his Honour said in his remarks no more than that he had taken it into account. He also said that he saw no evidence of contrition. It was incumbent upon his Honour to explain the significance which he placed upon the plea of guilty, that is, “to have spelt out the way in which it was taken into account”: R v McCarroll [1999] NSWCCA 237, per Wood CJ at CL at [14]. As counsel for the applicant at the sentence proceedings had argued, it was of considerable utilitarian value and it also spared a vulnerable complainant the necessity of giving evidence.  
     
      
    33 On the question of contrition, his Honour said nothing about that latter aspect of the plea, which was a relevant matter: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, per Spigelman CJ at [4] and [119] – [120]. Nor did he refer to the applicant’s admissions, particularly insofar as they disclosed a measure of criminality of which the police had no evidence: cf R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. Some remorse might fairly have been inferred from these factors. Whether an expression of remorse might be found in the tape which he left for the complainant before his attempted suicide I find it unnecessary to decide. 
     
      
    34 In my view, these are matters which should have earned the applicant a significant measure of leniency. Given that the sentence of eighteen years was ninety percent of the maximum, it is difficult to see what weight, if any, was afforded to them. 
     
      
       
      Health and conditions of custody 
      
    35 There was evidence that the applicant had been in protective custody, which his Honour said that he had taken into account. However, while he referred to Dr Carne’s psychiatric diagnosis and recommendations, he said nothing about the state of the applicant’s physical health. Mr Hulme submitted that the sentence demonstrates that these matters had not been taken into account or, at least, had not been given the weight which they deserved. 
     
      
    36 It is well established that the state of health of an offender is relevant to sentence where it might be exacerbated by the conditions of his or her custody or where it might render those conditions more burdensome, although that is not the only basis upon which regard might properly be had to it. The principles were reviewed by this Court in R v L (CCA, unreported, 17 June 1996) at pp 6-8. Equally, the fact that a sentence is likely to be served in protective custody is relevant and, given the nature of the applicant’s crimes, it is almost inevitable that he would require protection for the whole of the custodial term of his sentence. However, there appears to be a variety of arrangements within the prison system at present for prisoners requiring protection and whether, and to what extent, the arrangements in a particular case lead to conditions more onerous than those of the general prison population needs to be the subject of evidence: R v Kain [2004] NSWCCA 143, per Levine J at [60] ff.  
     
      
    37 There is some force in Mr Hulme’s argument but, again, the matter need not be resolved. It is reasonable to assume that the applicant’s experience of incarceration will be more difficult because of the parlous state of his health. However, there was no evidence before his Honour of the effect of his health or of his status as a protected prisoner on the conditions of his custody. Suffice it to say that, for the purpose of re-sentence, there is before this Court an affidavit of the applicant dealing with both those matters.  
     
      
       
      Antecedents 
       
      
    38 Finally, Mr Hulme submitted that the severity of the sentence demonstrates that, in assessing the significance of the applicant’s prior record for serious sexual offences, his Honour fell into the error identified in the joint judgment in Veen v The Queen [No 2] (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477: 
     
      
       
        
        …the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences… 
        
       
      
    39 Yet again, it is unnecessary to determine this matter. For the purpose of re-sentence there is no doubt about the significance of that criminal history, but its proper place was explained in the same joint judgment as follows (also at 477): 
     
      
       
        
        It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind. 
        
       
       
      Re-sentence 
       
      
    40 The applicant’s affidavit, sworn on 6 May 2004, discloses that he had then been waiting for about a year to see a specialist cardiologist with a view to undergoing a bypass operation. He has continued to have frequent angina attacks, sometimes more than once a day, and has often had to wait for a significant period of time before officers attend his cell to supply him with the necessary medication. He has been on strict protection with limited association, which has reduced his opportunity for daily exercise in a yard and has compromised his access to educational courses. 
     
      
    41 There is no denying the gravity of these offences, particularly given the age of the complainant and her limited intellectual capacity. It is also to be borne in mind that they are part of a wider pattern of abuse. It is necessary to recognise the seriousness of the principal offence, taking into account the further offences on the Form 1 and giving appropriate weight to the applicant’s antecedent criminal history, while making due allowance for his deprived background, his age, his state of health and his conditions of custody. I would assess the appropriate starting point for sentence at sixteen years. In the light of his plea of guilty, his co-operation with the police and the measure of remorse which I would be prepared to infer, I would reduce that sentence by twenty-five percent to twelve years.  
     
      
    42 While there is evidence which might justify a finding of special circumstances, I would not depart from the normal statutory proportion in specifying the non-parole period. In my view, a period of any less than nine years would be inadequate to mark the applicant’s criminality. The balance of the sentence of three years remains a substantial period of parole eligibility during which he might be assisted to re-enter the community. 
     
      
    43 Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and quash the sentence passed in the District Court. On the committal charge, taking into account the two matters on the Form 1, I would sentence the applicant to imprisonment for twelve years, with a non-parole period of nine years, to date from 9 October 2002. He would be eligible for release on parole on 8 October 2011.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: This is a Crown appeal against the sentence imposed upon the Respondent by Judge Dodd in the Sydney District Court on 1 July 2004, following his plea of guilty to one count of aggravated break enter and steal in company contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act (NSW) 1900. The sentence imposed, taking into account two offences on a Form 1 of being disguised with intent to commit an indictable offence and of being carried in a conveyance taken without the consent of its owner, was one of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, to take effect from the date of arrest, namely 13 May 2003. Although the sentence was not structured in accordance with s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, for all practical purposes it may be assumed that what his Honour set was a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of term of 3 years. 
     
      
       
      FACTS 
       
      
    2 Warren Cornett and another unidentified male approached the Respondent, in about mid April 2003 in relation to a plan, which they had formulated, to carry out a bank robbery in Narrabeen. The Respondent had only recently been released from prison. He agreed to participate. The plan was put into effect on the morning of 8 May 2003, when an unidentified male drove the Respondent and Cornett to the vicinity of the bank in a stolen BMW. Cornett gave the Respondent a sledgehammer, gloves and a balaclava en route.  
     
      
    3 After conducting surveillance for about 15 minutes, between 8:30 and 8:45 AM, the Respondent and Cornett pulled balaclavas over their faces and ran to the front of the bank. The Respondent used the sledgehammer, and Cornett used a crowbar to smash and pull out the window next to the ATM, and by that means they gained access to the Bank.  
     
      
    4 The four staff on the premises, who had been replenishing the ATM, retreated to the rear of the bank, activated the security screens and raised the alarm. Cornett directed the Respondent to the vaults where he attempted, unsuccessfully, to smash open a safe using the sledgehammer. He joined Cornett in a search of the premises looking for money. They located some stacks of $50 and $20 notes in a room behind the vaults, which they stole before decamping in the stolen get away car. The total cash stolen was $171,980. Little of this was recovered.  
     
      
    5 His Honour held that the offence was towards the upper end of the scale for such offences and hence fell above the mid range of objective seriousness utilising the language of s 54A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, particularly having regard to the use of the sledgehammer and the amount taken. He found that the Respondent had played no part in the planning of the offence, and that Cornett had directed him during its commission. Nevertheless his Honour found that the Respondent had clearly known what was involved prior to the day that the plan was carried into effect. He also found that he had been pressured into committing the offence because of the obligation which he had to repay a debt which he had incurred while in prison for the purchase of heroin for his own use.  
     
      
    6 The Crown submits that the sentence was manifestly inadequate and suggests that error occurred in three respects: 
     
      
       
      (a) In the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence; 
       
       
      (b) In the determination of an appropriate starting point; 
       
       
      (c) In a failure to adequately reflect the serious aggravating factors that the offence was committed while the Respondent was on Parole, that he had a significant criminal history, and that he had committed a similar offence in the past.  
       
      
    7 There is an obvious overlap in these contentions, and, as this is a Crown appeal, it is one to which the principles summarised by me in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 apply, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “…it is important to note the principles which apply in relation to the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence:  
         
          
           
          (a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
          House v The King 
           (1936) 55 CLR 499, applies to Crown appeals against sentence:  
          Dinsdale v The Queen 
           (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion, as to the appropriate sentence, for that of the sentencing judge:  
          Lowndes v The Queen 
           (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown;  
          R v Tait 
           (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; and  
          Wong and Leung v The Queen 
           (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 58 and 109. 
           
           
          (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
          Malvaso v The Queen 
           (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere:  
          R v Baker 
           [2000] NSWCCA 85. 
           
           
          (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle “ 
          for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons 
          ”: per Barwick CJ in  
          Griffiths v The Queen  
          (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
          Everett v The Queen 
           (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299;  
          Dinsdale v The Queen  
          (2000) 202 CLR 321, at paras 61 and 62, and  
          Wong & Leung v The Queen  
          at para 109. 
           
           
          (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
          R v Allpass 
           (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
          R v Papazis 
           (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
          Wong and Leung v The Queen  
          at para 110. 
           
           
          (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
          R v Holder and Johnston 
           (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
          Dinsdale v The Queen 
           at para 62.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      
    8 It may also be noted that a further restraint on interference arises from the strong resistance that exists against appellate tinkering with sentences: see Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 also at para 62, an admonition that has not always been heeded in both Crown appeals and in appeals against sentence.  
     
      
    9 In order for the Crown to make its appeal good it must first establish either patent or latent error, sufficient to justify an exercise of the discretion referred to in the extract from the decision in Wall; and see also R v Bezan [2004] NSWCCA 342 at paras 26 to 28 where I drew attention to the circumstance that it is only where the sentence is clearly outside the appropriate range that latent error is to be found.  
     
      
    10 This appeal is to be considered in a context where the maximum available penalty for the offence charged is one of imprisonment for 20 years, and the offence is one for which a standard non-parole period of 5 years has been fixed. While it was held in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131 that this period was intended to apply to an offence which is in the middle range of objective seriousness where there has been a plea of not guilty, it nevertheless has an important role as a reference point for sentences after a plea: see R v Davies [2004] NSWCCA 319.  
     
      
    11 In sentencing the Respondent his Honour expressly took into account the circumstances that: 
     
      
       
      (a) when interviewed, after his arrest, he made full admissions and nominated his two co-offenders, although the police did not accept that he had correctly named the driver; 
       
       
      (b) he had provided some information in relation to a gaol murder, the correctness of which police also did not accept, but which had led to the need for him to serve the sentence on protection; 
       
       
      (c) he was 31 years of age and had a criminal history dating back to 1985, including “convictions for like offences”, with the result that, in the last 9 years, he had only spent two months not in custody, a record which his Honour found did not entitle him to any leniency; 
       
       
      (d) he had re-offended while on parole; 
       
       
      (e) he had been raised in the Redfern area, and had continually gravitated back to the Redfern community where he tended to revert to drug use;  
       
       
      (f) he had addressed his drug and alcohol history only sporadically and had said that it was his inability to handle emotions that triggered his drug use; 
       
       
      (g) he claimed to have been using $100 worth of heroin at the time of the offence and to have been drinking alcohol every second day; 
       
       
      (h) he was in a de facto relationship and had three children, and was described by his partner as an excellent father; 
       
       
      (i) he had limited education but had been undertaking some trade courses, had been studying while in prison, and had received good reports from his supervisors, as to his behaviour particularly over the last 3 years; 
       
       
      (j) He had agreed to forfeit the motor vehicle which he had purchased from his share of the proceeds of the offence, by way of reparation, a matter indicative of remorse; 
       
       
      (k) he had given evidence of a preference for leading a law abiding life out of prison rather than continually returning to prison; and that 
       
       
      (l) although speculative, he had some prospects of rehabilitation, bearing in mind the attitude of his partner and father each of whom was supportive of him. 
       
       
      
    12 His Honour accepted that the Respondent was entitled to have taken into account, in his favour, his preparedness to supply information to the police about Cornett and to give evidence in any prosecution of him. He also found that he was entitled to a discount of 25%, for his plea which was to be regarded as having been made at the earliest available opportunity.  
     
      
    13 Attention was given to the provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in so far as his Honour identified, as aggravating factors, the matters referred to in s 21A(2)(d), (j) and (n) and correctly excluded those factors that were elements of the offence. The mitigating factors which his Honour found to be present were those mentioned in s 21A(3)(d), (i), (k), and (m). So far as I can see no relevant mitigating factor was overlooked. 
     
      
    14 The Form 1 matters were held by his Honour to have been so highly connected with the commission of the offence that they should not result in any lengthening of the overall sentence either as to the non-parole period or the balance of parole. No error exists in that respect. 
     
      
    15 Special circumstances were found relating to the Respondent's age and the need for an extended period of supervision by reason of the length of the time that he has spent in prison, almost continually, since the age of 22, and his tendency to revert to drug addition. As a result the balance of the term of the sentence was well in excess of that specified in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    16 It is not evident, on the face of his Honour’s comprehensive reasons for sentence that, save for one matter, any relevant sentencing principle was overlooked or incorrectly stated. The only exception was the assumption that the case fell directly within the net of s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. More correctly, since it was a matter dealt with on a plea, the standard non-parole period referred to in the Table provides a reference point: see R v Davies (Supra). 
     
      
    17 In these circumstances the Crown needs to show that the sentence was so obviously outside the legitimate sentencing range as to demonstrate latent error.  
     
      
    18 In my opinion it has satisfied that test for two reasons. 
     
      
    19 The first reason is that the imposition of a sentence involving a non-parole period of 3 years, and a balance of term of 3 years, appears quite disproportionate for an offence which his Honour described as falling towards the “upper end of the scale” for an offence of its kind, even after making full allowance for the subjective circumstances as they were presented to his Honour. In that regard, I would accept the Respondent's contention that his Honour needed to take into account the fact of protection upon the basis of the evidence that was led, being confined to that which came from the Respondent, to the effect that, at the Parklea Correctional Centre, he was only allowed one hour out of the cells each day.  
     
      
    20 I do not, however, consider it necessary to decide the issue which arose, as to whether, in the absence of the Prosecution having placed before the sentencing judge the full factual details of the Respondent's prior conviction for armed robbery, which had been the subject of the decision of this Court in R v Ceissman [2000] NSWCCA 274, it is permissible for us now to have regard to the contents of that judgment, as a curial document on the public record, in determining the adequacy of the sentence. That it was permissible for us to do so, and as a consequence, to be aware of the fact that the Respondent had previously been convicted of an almost identical offence, and then to take that into account when considering whether there was latent error, was the contention of the Crown. Reliance was placed upon R v Snider [2004] NSWCCA 134 per Kirby J at paras 47 to 49, where his Honour, while offering some support for such proposition, considered it unnecessary for decision upon the facts of that case. 
     
      
    21 I similarly consider, in the present case, that there was sufficient on the face of the record, including the finding that the Respondent had “convictions for like offences”, and his criminal history, to show that the sentence was disproportionate to the criminality involved, without resort to the earlier judgment of this Court, bearing in mind that the maximum sentence available for the offence was one of imprisonment for 20 years, and that it was one which had been selected by the legislature as appropriate for the specification of a standard non-parole period.  
     
      
    22 In this regard, the statement of principle by Howie J in R v Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 is apposite: 
     
      
       
        
        “67 Firstly, the court must have regard to the maximum penalty for the offence at the time when the crime was committed. This will indicate the policy of the legislature at the time the offence was committed:  
        Oliver 
         (1980) 7 A Crim R 174. It will prescribe the limit of the court’s discretion, as the maximum penalty is intended for cases falling within the worst category of cases for which the penalty is prescribed:  
        Veen v The Queen (No 2) 
         (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 478;  
        Ibbs v The Queen 
         (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451. Prima facie the maximum penalty indicates the seriousness of the offence:  
        Gilson v The Queen 
         (1991) 172 CLR 353 at 364.  
        
       
       
        
        68 Secondly, the court must consider where in the range of the conduct covered by the statutory offence, the particular criminal conduct committed by the offender falls:  
        Baumer v The Queen 
         (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57;  
        Ibbs 
        , above, at 452. This will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        70 The nature of the criminal conduct proscribed by an offence and the maximum penalty applicable to the offence are crucially important factors in the synthesis which leads to the determination of the sentence to be imposed upon the particular offender for the particular crime committed. Even after taking into account the subjective features of the offender and all the other matters relevant to sentencing, such as individual and general deterrence, the sentence imposed should reflect the objective seriousness of the offence:  
        Dodd 
         (1991) 57 A Crim R 549, and be proportional to the criminality involved in the offence committed:  
        Veen v The Queen 
         (1979) 143 CLR 458. Whether the sentence to be imposed meets these criteria will be determined principally by a consideration of the nature of the criminal conduct as viewed against the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence.” 
        
       
       
      
    23 As has been noted apart from the fact that the present case was a well planned professional bank robbery, in which force was used and a considerable sum of money was stolen, the Respondent came before his Honour with a bad prior record, which had resulted in a lengthy period of almost continuous custody, and which had seen him reoffend while on parole on four occasions. He had reoffended again during the first two months of his most recent release on parole, and that was an aggravating circumstance of some significance: R v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 and R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109.  
     
      
    24 The “economic duress” which the Respondent suggested had led him to join in the venture may have provided the motive, but it did not, in my view, mitigate the objective criminality of the Respondent, since it stemmed from independent criminal conduct on his part and arose from his continued association with career criminals.  
     
      
    25 The second reason why error has been shown relates to the extent to which there was a variation in the statutory ratio between the balance of the term and the non-parole period, which suggests that disproportionate weight was given to the subjective circumstances of the Respondent. 
     
      
    26 The evidence led from the Respondent, to the effect that he had never previously given assistance to the authorities, and had done so, on this occasion, because he wanted to change his values and principles “from a pro[fessional] criminal”, so that he could be “a good role model for his newborn son and daughter” while commendable, hardly placed him in the category of an offender at the cross roads within the well known meaning of that expression as used in R v Osenkowski (1982) 5 A Crim R 394. 
     
      
    27 The caution which this Court has expressed in relation to the need to subject evidence of this kind to careful analysis and not to resort to “wishful thinking” (per Dunford J in R v Govinden (1999) 106 A Crim R 314; or to a “triumph of hope over experience” per Spigelman CJ in R v Hunt [2002] NSWCCA 482, is apposite.  
     
      
    28 The Respondent’s record and his ready return to drugs tend to belie any suggestion that, on this occasion, he should be given any substantial consideration in relation to the proportion between the non-parole period and the balance of term. His was a record which suggested an undue readiness to resort to drug use, and to criminal offending when personal problems emerged, and his Honour’s finding that his prospects of rehabilitation were “speculative” could not be said to have been other than realistic. 
     
      
    29 In these circumstances, I am persuaded that the appeal properly falls within the category of cases where legal error is to be inferred from the inadequacy of the sentence, notwithstanding the cautious approach which the Court has favoured, for example in R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at paras 11 to 12 and at para 19 and in R v Bezan (Supra).  
     
      
    30 The question of discretion arises for consideration. It was submitted by the Respondent that there were two reasons for exercising that discretion in his favour. First, it was submitted that the delay between sentence being pronounced on 1 July 2004 and the appeal being signed on 11 August 2004 and served on the following day, but not filed until 19 August 2004, was excessive and constituted hardship. I am not persuaded that in this case a delay of 6 weeks between sentence and notification is of sufficient significance, to warrant dismissal of the appeal.  
     
      
    31 Secondly, reference was made to the fact that the sentence which the co offender Cornett received for this offence was one involving a fixed term of 4 years, which was totally subsumed within the sentences imposed for the remaining offences for which he was sentenced. Judge Williams had indicated, in that case, that he would have imposed a total head sentence of 19 years with a non-parole period of 14 years for all of the offences, in respect of which a number of other offences were also taken into account on a Form 1. It was reduced to one which resulted in an effective non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of term of 2 ½ years.  
     
      
    32 I accept that it would be inappropriate for this Court to substitute a sentence which would result in the Respondent having a legitimate sense of grievance when comparing his sentence with that of his co offender, for the reasons outlined in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606, Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295, and Siganto v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 656.  
     
      
    33 There were in this instance, significant differences between Cornett and the Respondent in that Cornett: 
     
      
       
      (i) had provided assistance that was assessed as “substantial”, including an undertaking to give evidence and the provision of information which was unknown to police, which left him and his family in a serious degree of personal danger and which, in combination with his pleas, attracted a discount of 55%; 
       
       
      (ii) was held in the Special Witness Unit with the consequent hardship attaching to that fact and will need relocation and special protection following his release; 
       
       
      (iii) had a lesser record than the Respondent; 
       
       
      (iv) was younger than the Respondent; 
       
       
      (v) had not been on conditional liberty when he had offended; 
       
       
      (vi) had a severely abusive and dysfunctional past and was found to be genuinely remorseful. 
       
      
    34 By contrast, while the Respondent was entitled to a discount for his plea and assistance in nominating Cornett (who had been arrested on the occasion of his last offence) as his co offender, his “assistance” otherwise was judged to be neutral in so far as the police did not believe the information which he had supplied. 
     
      
    35 The fact that Cornett had pleaded to a large number of unrelated offences and had acknowledged his guilt in relation to the Form 1 offences, constituted a very significant utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system.  
     
      
    36 It is also not to be overlooked that Cornett received after discount, a fixed term of imprisonment for the present offence which exceeded the non-parole component of the Respondent's sentence by one year. Admittedly the Respondent's release at the end of that period would not be automatic, and he faces a possible revocation of parole if he reoffends. Nevertheless, there are significant differences between the two offenders and an increase in the Respondent's sentence to the least that could properly have been imposed, would not result in a sentence that would offend the parity rule.  
     
      
    37 I am therefore of the opinion that notwithstanding the discretion, the case is one where the Court should intervene. In determining an appropriate sentence I consider, as did Kirby J in Snider that it is appropriate for us to refer to the earlier judgment of this Court, concerning the offences that were there under consideration, and which show that they were not only similar to the matter which is now before us, but were particularly serious.  
     
      
    38 I am also satisfied that it is proper for us to refer to the affidavit which has been tendered to show that the Respondent's conditions of detention as Special Management Area Placement Prisoner at Junee Correctional Centre are very much less arduous than those which he apparently experienced at Parklea.  
     
      
    39 He is eligible for all programmes, he will not be prejudiced in the classification system, and he has the opportunity of extended periods outside his cell. This evidence demonstrates the point which this Court made in R v Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207, and in several subsequent cases, that it is inappropriate to make a general assumption that a Prisoner on protection will suffer some special hardship.  
     
      
    40 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      2. Sentence below quashed and in lieu thereof sentence the Respondent to a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months to date from 8 May 2003 and to expire on 7 November 2007, and to a balance of term of 2 years. The earliest date on which he would be eligible for release on parole would accordingly be 7 November 2007. 
       
      
    41 I would find special circumstances in relation to the balance of term in the desirability of the Respondent receiving a somewhat longer period of supervision post release, to address his drug addiction and to encourage his rehabilitation.  
     
      
    42 SIMPSON J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.  
     
      
    43 BARR J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: Shaun Andrew Cornelissen and Reginald Jeffrey Sutton appealed against their convictions, after a joint trial in the District Court before his Honour Judge Twigg and a jury, on a charge of the manslaughter of a man named Tony James Byrne on 2 August 2001 at Parkes. 
     
      
    2 Judge Twigg sentenced Cornelissen to a term of imprisonment of three years, with a non-parole period of eighteen months, commencing on 2 October 2003. His Honour sentenced Sutton to a term of imprisonment of two years with a non-parole period of one year, also commencing on 2 October 2003. Sutton was released on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period of his sentence on 1 October 2004. If his appeal against his conviction is dismissed, each of the appellants applies for leave to appeal against the sentence passed on him by Judge Twigg. 
     
      
       
      CROWN CASE AT THE TRIAL 
       
      
    3 Many of the Crown witnesses were related in some way to other Crown witnesses or to one of the appellants or to the deceased and, before summarising some of the evidence, it is convenient to set out these relationships. 
     
      
    4 A witness whose name at the time of the trial was Diane Cornelissen had previously been married to a man named Tom Byrne, by whom she had five children including Tanya Byrne (a witness at the trial), Tony Byrne (the deceased) and Monique Byrne (a witness at the trial).  
     
      
    5 A man named Chris Cornelissen was the father, by a woman referred to at the trial simply as Anna, of two children, Shaun Cornelissen (one of the appellants) and Tammy Cornelissen (a witness at the trial). In August 2001 Tammy Cornelissen was in a relationship with the appellant Sutton. Chris Cornelissen was also the father, by a woman named Kerry Troy, of Louise Cornelissen (a witness at the trial).  
     
      
    6 In 1982 Chris Cornelissen and Diane were married. After their marriage Diane’s five children by Tom Byrne and Chris Cornelissen’s two children by Anna lived with them in the same household. There were no children of the marriage of Chris and Diane Cornelissen. 
     
      
    7 The appellant Sutton is the son of a man named Reginald Sutton and Kerry Troy. 
     
      
    8 The witnesses in the Crown case included Monique Byrne and Tanya Byrne, Tammy Cornelissen and Louise Cornelissen and Diane Cornelissen. A woman named Jade Coghlan, who was the de facto wife of the deceased, was also a Crown witness. Other witnesses in the Crown case included Simon Monkerud and Katrina Whitney, who were in a relationship with each other but who do not appear to have been related to any of the other witnesses or to either of the appellants. There were two medical witnesses in the Crown case, Dr Sugo, a pathologist who performed a post-mortem examination of the deceased’s body, and Dr Rodriguez, a neuropathologist, who gave evidence about the mechanisms by which the deceased might have sustained his injuries. 
     
      
    9 The Crown case can, very broadly, be stated as follows. 
     
      
    10 On 2 August 2001 the appellant Cornelissen became aware, through overhearing part of a conversation between his sisters Tammy and Louise, that Tammy alleged that she had been sexually abused as a child by two of Diane’s sons by Tom Byrne. Cornelissen concluded that one of those sons would have been the deceased Tony Byrne. 
     
      
    11 Cornelissen asked Sutton to accompany him and on the evening of 2 August 2001 the two appellants went to the house of the deceased and his de facto wife Jade Coghlan. On the first occasion the appellants came to the house, the deceased was not at home and the appellants left. When the appellants returned shortly afterwards, the deceased was at home. Also present in the house were Jade Coghlan, Monique Byrne, Simon Monkerud and Katrina Whitney. 
     
      
    12 After being told by Jade Coghlan that the two appellants had come to the house, the deceased went to the front door of the house. There was a physical altercation between the deceased and Cornelissen.  
     
      
    13 A loud noise was heard by the four people who were inside the house and they came to the front door. The deceased was then lying on the ground in the front yard. The deceased got to his feet but was obviously distressed. Cornelissen punched the deceased and the deceased collapsed. He died shortly afterwards. The punch had caused a tear in one of the blood vessels supplying blood to his brain and this tear had given rise to a subarachnoid haemorrhage.  
     
      
    14 On the night of 2 August 2001 the two appellants went to the police station. Sutton was interviewed in an electronically recorded interview, which commenced shortly after midnight, but Cornelissen declined to be interviewed. 
     
      
    15 The Crown case against Cornelissen was that he had punched the deceased, thereby causing the death of the deceased, and that he was guilty of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. The Crown case against Sutton was that he was also guilty of manslaughter, either as a party to a joint enterprise with Cornelissen in the carrying out of which Cornelissen had punched the deceased or as a principal in the second degree, that is as a person, who, being present, had knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted Cornelissen. 
     
      
    16 It is useful at this stage to summarise the evidence of the four witnesses who were inside the house concerning what they said happened after they all heard a loud noise. 
     
      
    17 Jade Coghlan said that when she heard a loud noise she made a telephone call to the police, before following the other three persons to the front door of the house.  
     
      
    18 Jade Coghlan had given evidence that, before the deceased had gone to the front door to meet the appellants, he had told her:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I don’t want any trouble at the house. I will tell them to f – off and if there is any trouble just call the police”. 
        
       
      
    19 In cross-examination she agreed that she had not told the police investigating the deceased’s death that the deceased had told her this, until the day before she gave evidence at the trial. 
     
      
    20 While Jade Coghlan was still talking to the police on the telephone on the evening of 2 August 2001, she looked out the front door and saw the deceased lying on the lawn on his back. She called out, asking whether an ambulance was needed and Monique Byrne yelled that something was wrong and that the deceased’s heartbeat was very faint. Jade Coghlan told the police on the telephone to ring an ambulance. 
     
      
    21 Jade Coghlan ran into the front yard of the house and put her hand on the deceased’s chest. At first his heart was beating very fast but then it stopped. 
     
      
    22 Monique Byrne gave evidence that, after hearing a loud noise coming from out in the front yard of the house, she ran to the front door. She was just behind Simon Monkerud. She gave the following further evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I seen my brother on the ground and Jeff Sutton on one side and Shaun Cornelissen on the other”. (T p138 lines 47-48) 
         
         . . . 
         
         “Simon Monkerud went to get Shaun off and I tried to get Jeff away from Tony.” (T p140 lines 33-34) 
         
         . . . 
         
        “I was from behind him (Sutton) and I was trying to pull him away from Tony”. (T p140 lines 45-46) 
         
         . . . 
         
         “I yelled and swore at him.” (T p140 line 50) 
        
       
      
    23 Monique Byrne eventually pulled Sutton away from the deceased and Simon Monkerud eventually got Cornelissen away from the deceased. 
     
      
    24 Monique Byrne’s evidence continued as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. After you’d seen Shaun pulled off and you’ve pulled Jeff off, did Tony do anything? 
         
        A. Tony was still laying on the ground and that’s when Jeff threw his arms up in the air and said, ‘I didn’t do a effing thing’ and just started laughing. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So Jeff’s thrown his arms up in the air, said, ‘I didn’t do – ‘, did he say – I’m sorry to be appearing to make this difficult, did he say ‘effing thing’. You can say it? 
         
        A. ‘I didn’t do a fucking thing’. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I think you said he started to laugh? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. After that happened did anything happen to Tony or did Tony do anything? 
         
        A. No, because the next –when I saw that Tony was standing again and that’s when I had my back turned and I was answering back to Jade. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say you were answering back to Jade, did you hear – where was Jade? 
         
        A. At the front door. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you said ‘answering back’ did Jade say anything to you that caused you to answer back? 
         
        A. She had said, ‘Do we need an ambulance?’ or, ‘Call an ambulance’ and I said, ‘Yes, we need an ambulance’. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So after you said, ‘Yes, we need an ambulance’, did Tony do anything then? 
         
        A. When I seen, out of the corner of my eye, Tony was standing and he had his arms up in the air and he was swaying and he didn’t look right. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: The witness has two hands loosely held out and upwards rolling from side to side. At the same time she is rolling her head from side to side. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. When you say ‘didn’t look right’, can you expand on that? 
         
        A. It’s, I suppose, if you get knocked out and you try to get up real quick. He was staggery” (T p141 lines 8-51) 
        
       
      
    25 Monique Byrne gave evidence that when the deceased had got up he did not appear to her to be swinging punches. By the time she turned around again after speaking to Jade, “Tony was laid back out again on the ground”. She heard Cornelissen say something to the effect “He deserved everything he got”. 
     
      
    26 Simon Monkerud gave evidence that after he heard a bang, he ran to the front door and outside the house. He gave the following further evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I seen Tony Byrne laying on the ground, Shaun and Jeff Sutton over him.” (T p186 lines 21-22) 
         
         . . . 
         
        “Q. Did you see if the accused Sutton was doing anything to Tony? 
         
        A. No”. (T p186 – lines 40-42) 
        
       
       
       . . . 
       
       
        
        “I just yelled out, ‘Cut it out’”. (T p186 – line 46) 
        
       
       
        
        “Q. When you yelled out ‘cut it out’, did anyone do anything, any of the three people? 
         
        A. Yeah, Jeff walked straight towards me and Shaun was standing near Tony while Tony was on the ground”. (T p186 – lines 52-55) 
        
       
       
        
        “Q. Did at any time Tony get off the ground? 
         
        A. Yes, after I’ve told them to stop it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you told them to stop it, did Shaun Cornelissen do anything? 
         
        A. No. he just stood there. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You said you saw Tony get up. Is that correct? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When Tony got up what did Tony do? 
         
        A. Took his jumper off and staggered towards Shaun. (T p187 – lines 8-19) 
        
       
      
    27 Simon Monkerud gave evidence that he saw the deceased throw a couple of punches and saw Cornelissen throw punches but he did not see any of the punches from either of them strike the other:- 
     
      
       
        
        “After a couple of seconds he (the deceased) just hit the ground. 
        ”  
        (T p187 – line 58) 
        
       
      
    28 Simon Monkerud gave evidence that Sutton was “about 2.1 metres away from where the fight was”. Sutton did not say anything. After the deceased went to the ground, Cornelissen stood over the deceased and said “He deserves what he’s got”. 
     
      
    29 In cross-examination Simon Monkerud agreed that in the statement he had made to police he had said that, when he first walked out of the house, he had seen the deceased and Cornelissen on the ground, that he was unsure which of them was on top and that he had seen Sutton pulling the deceased’s shirt sideways. In cross-examination Simon Monkerud said that he had only remembered the deceased taking his jumper off, when he was actually giving his evidence at the trial.  
     
      
    30 Katrina Whitney said that after she heard a bang, she had run to the front of the house. Simon Monkerud and Monique Byrne were in front of her and to some extent blocked her view. She gave the following evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Just tell the Court what you were able to see when you came out the front door? 
         
        A. When I came out the front door I seen Monique and Simon on either side of Jeff and Shaun and Tony. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So now where was Tony? 
         
        A. Getting up from the ground”. (T p216 lines 52-58) 
        
       
      
    31 Katrina Whitney heard Simon Monkerud yelling “cut it out” and Monique Byrne saying “get off him”. At the time Monique Byrne said “get off him” Monique Byrne was trying to push Sutton away from the deceased. 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What did you see happen next? 
         
        A. Tony got up. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he do anything? 
         
        A. Took his jumper off, he was staggering at that stage. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say-- 
         
        A. Like he was dizzy. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you just keep your voice up. You said Tony was staggering or like he was dizzy, did you see Shaun do anything? 
         
        A. He was – Tony was – he took his jumper off. He was dizzy, he was trying to swing some punches at Shaun and then Shaun swung one back. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. After Shaun swung one back did you see anything happen to Tony? 
         
        A. He fell to the ground. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you actually see whether a punch you say Shaun swung, did you see whether it hit Tony? 
         
        A. No, because Simon was in my view”. (T p 217 lines 35-57) 
        
       
      
    32 Katrina Whitney heard Cornelissen say “that will do him, he got what he deserved”. 
     
      
       
      THE DEFENCE CASE OF THE APPELLANT CORNELISSEN AT THE TRIAL 
       
      
    33 The appellant Cornelissen gave evidence at the trial. The evidence he gave included the following evidence. 
     
      
    34 On 2 August 2001 he was at the house of his half-sister Louise. He overheard part of a conversation between Louise and his sister Tammy. Louise said “they done these things to you. You should do something about it”. Cornelissen’s evidence continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I overheard them (Louise and Tammy) say these things that have happened to you when you were younger. It wasn’t very hard to put two and two together. We had two older brothers in the house at the time”. (T p379 line 58 – p380 line 3). 
        
       
      
    35 Cornelissen took his wife and Tammy back to Tammy’s house. Sutton was at Tammy’s house. 
     
      
    36 Cornelissen decided to go and see the deceased and ask him about the allegations. Cornelissen asked Sutton if he would come for a drive with Cornelissen and Sutton agreed. Cornelissen’s evidence continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Jeffrey asked me, ‘where are you going?’ I said, ‘I’m going to see my brother, Tony’. He said, ‘what for?’ I said, ‘I need to ask him a few questions and clear a few things up’”. (T p380 lines 47-50) 
        
       
      
    37 Cornelissen and Sutton travelled by car to the deceased’s house and parked at the front of the house. Cornelissen knocked on the door of the house and had a short conversation with Jade Coghlan. He was told by Jade Coghlan that the deceased had gone for a drive but that he should not be too long. The two appellants left. 
     
      
    38 The appellants returned shortly afterwards. When they returned Cornelissen parked the car some distance away from the house. Cornelissen said in evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I said to Jeff, ‘I don’t know how Tony is going to react to what I have to ask him. I don’t want him to do anything to my car’ because I’d just purchased the car at the time”. (T p382 lines 18-21) 
        
       
      
    39 Cornelissen knocked on the front door. The deceased came to the door, opened the door and came outside the house. Cornelissen gave the following further evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I said to Tony, ‘Is it true these things I’ve heard about you and Garry doing to Tammy when she was younger?’ (T p383 line 43-44 
        ) 
         
         . . . 
         
         “He (the deceased) took two steps down the stairs and pushed me into the chest” (T p383 lines 56-57). 
        
       
      
    40 Cornelissen was pushed backwards but remained on his feet. He was then asked what happened next. He said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Both (the appellant Cornelissen and the deceased) turned at a 90 degree angle facing each other. He had his arms up, I had my arms up, there was a couple of punches thrown. One struck me across the tip of the nose”. (T p384 lines 45-47) 
         
         . . . 
         
        “Q. “Who threw the first punch in that series of blows? 
         
        A. Tony did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you punch him in return? 
         
        A. Defending myself”. (T p384 lines 52-57) 
        
       
      
    41 The appellant gave evidence that, after he was struck on the nose:- 
     
      
       
        
        “.. we were still standing in the position, we locked arms, had a bit of a wrestle while we were standing up. Tony got the better of me. I went straight down on to the ground on my back. He was on his knees at that stage, above me”. (T p385 lines 32-36) 
         
         . . . 
         
        “I recall that Tony was being pulled off by Jeff. I seen Jeff’s feet standing next to me as I was laying on the ground.” (T p386 lines 5-7) 
        
       
      
    42 At that stage people came running out of the house and the appellant Cornelissen and the deceased stood up. The appellant’s evidence continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What was the next thing that happened? 
         
        A. Tony came at me with a couple of more punches. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say came at you, how did he come at you? 
         
        A. Walked towards me with his fists in the air, swung one, two punches at me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened to those punches? 
         
        A. They didn’t connect, I was backing away at the time. I was walking backwards. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Then what happened? 
         
        A. We turned and faced the road. I was standing in the middle of the yard and Tony – I wouldn’t call it a run, but he came straight towards me anyway. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And was he doing anything as he did that? 
         
        A. Yes, he had his arms in the air as he came towards me, fists in the air. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At that point, what was in your mind as he came towards you on that occasion? 
         
        A. Self preservation, defending myself. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you do? 
         
        A. Ducked to the side as he threw a punch.

        A. To my left-hand side. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And? 
         
        A. And I threw a punch as well”. (T p 386 line 53 – 387 line 26) 
        
       
      
    43 The appellant’s evidence continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q.…when you swung that right hand, was your fist opened or closed? 
         
        A. Closed. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you feel it strike anything? 
         
        A. Yes.

        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was in your mind when you struck that blow? 
         
        A. Just defending myself.

        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How did you feel about that? 
         
        A. Shocked, upset.

        A. I walked over and looked down at him on the ground.

        A. I said, ‘He’s had enough’ and ‘he deserved that’”. (T p387 line 52 – p388 line 23) 
        
       
       
       
       
      THE DEFENCE CASE OF THE APPELLANT SUTTON AT THE TRIAL  
       
      
    44 The appellant Sutton did not give evidence at the trial. However, the tape recording of his electronically recorded interview on the night of 2-3 August 2001 was admitted into evidence. 
     
      
    45 Sutton had attended the police station at about 10 pm on 2 August 2001 with Cornelissen (question and answer 24). He had been advised by an officer of the Aboriginal Legal Service not to say anything but had told police that he wanted to give his version of what had happened (question and answer 53). He had told police that “I’m only a witness” (question and answer 61), a witness for Cornelissen (question and answer 72). 
     
      
    46 In his answer to question 74 Sutton gave a narrative account of what he said had happened. His answer was as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, we just pulled up over there and Shaun, Shaun….. and he wasn’t there at this time. And then we, we’ve then left and come back, it was only, what, 10 minutes or something. We parked up on the, I’m not sure Medlyn Street just there, parked up near the corner there, ‘cause we didn’t want to take his car down near his place because reckoned he might get into it, or, I don’t know, smash it, or kick it, or something like, I don’t know. And we walked down there and Shaun’s gone up to the door while I waited, I was out there with …. And, yeah, he just got Tony to come to the door and Tony’s come out the front and had a swing at Shaun and that’s when I come over and, yeah, they’ve Shaun’s got, sorry, Tony’s got Shaun on the ground and he was on top of him punchin’ him, so I just, I grabbed, grabbed Tony by the back of the jumper and I was pullin’ him off and that’s when people come runnin’ out of the house, like sayin’ ‘Stop it and stop it’, and that. And then, yeah, got him off, he was standin’ up and then Shaun’s, Shaun got up and then he just went for Shaun and Shaun punched him and I just thought he knocked him out and we’ve walked off. That’s all that’s happened”. 
        
       
      
    47 When asked what had been the purpose of going to see the deceased, Sutton replied “I didn’t have no purpose, mate, I was, was only there for Shaun. Shaun wanted me to go round there” (question and answer 85). 
     
      
    48 When asked why Cornelissen had gone to see the deceased, Sutton replied:- 
     
      
       
        
        “He was workin’ somethin’ out with him, mate, they, they haven’t been getting’ on for a while, or somethin’, just, just went down there to see him 
        ”.  
        (answer to question 94 
        ) 
        
       
      
    49 When asked what had caused both of the appellants to go to the deceased’s house, Sutton replied:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Mate, Shaun just asked me to go round there with him, mate, like, he wanted to work somethin’ out, that’s what I just said, mate”. (answer to question 102) 
        
       
      
    50 In his answer to question 123 Sutton gave another narrative account of what he said had happened:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Yeah, And then he’s, yeah, he’s just walked out, mate, ‘cause I was, he’s just walked out and then fuckin’, I don’t know what was said, and then he’s just, like, went at Shaun, hit Shaun and Shaun’s hit back and he’s just, I’m not sure if he’s tackled or Shaun went to the ground after the hit or somethin’, but then he was on top of him. So, I just ran over, mate, and just pullin’ him off. They all seen me, I didn’t, I didn’t hit him or nothin’. I only just grabbed him like that there and I was just pullin’ him off, pullin’ him off him. And then they was all carryin’ on like, like, ‘stop it, stop it, stop it’, like, and then he’s, when he’s let him up, but he’s, Shaun’s got up too after he’d, like, he got up first, ‘cause he was on top, got up and then Shaun’s got up and then he’s just went for Shaun, like went at him. And then Shaun’s just hit him, hit him on the, in the face area somewhere and then he’s just fell back on the ground and just thought he was knocked out”. 
        
       
      
    51 Sutton said that a punch by Cornelissen had been “only a little punch”. 
     
      
    52 Question and answer 145 were as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. He didn’t you didn’t ask before you went around as to what, you know, what you’re going to sort out here, what’s.. ? 
         
        A. No, Well, I just, I just, well, they’re brothers, mate, I, well, it’s not as if we was goin’ round to some fellow he hated, or anything like that. I didn’t think, like, he was goin’ round there for trouble until like, Shaun said he’d park his car up on the corner, mate and like he though that, like if things didn’t work out, mate, like, I don’t know, he was gunna jump into his car or I don’t know”. 
        
       
      
    53 Sutton was aware of one, but only one, previous fight between Cornelissen and the deceased. 
     
      
    54 When asked how he felt about what he said had happened, Sutton said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        ..because they were fightin’, I just, I was glad that, well, not glad, just he’d be right, mate, I’m, I was just glad that Shaun didn’t lose the fight, which I’m not glad at all now, at all. I was, that, gees I don’t know what to say for that, mate. Like, I was glad that Shaun didn’t lose the fight, but I wish that … didn’t happen, it’s makes me like, it makes me, like, I don’t know how Shaun would be feelin’, it’s his brother”. (answer 168) 
        
       
      
    55 Sutton said that all he had done was to try and grab the deceased off Cornelissen, “’cause he was on top of Shaun” (questions and answers 169, 170). 
     
      
    56 Sutton said that all he had done in the fight was to pull the deceased off Cornelissen and that he himself had no injuries. Monique Byrne had pulled Sutton back, when Sutton was attempting to pull the deceased off Cornelissen.

    57 The grounds of appeal in Cornelissen’s appeal against conviction are:- 
     
      
       
        
        “

        The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury not to engage in tendency reasoning with respect to relationship evidence admitted in the prosecution case

        4. The verdict was unreasonable 
        ”. 
        
       
      
    58 The grounds of appeal in Sutton’s appeal against conviction are:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        1. The trial judge erred by permitting the jury to consider the evidence of Tanya Byrne in the case against the appellant 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        2. The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury as to the elements of manslaughter

        5. The verdict was unreasonable” 
        . 
        
       
      
    59 It is apparent that Cornelissen’s first ground of appeal and Sutton’s fourth ground of appeal are closely related and that Cornelissen’s second ground of appeal and Sutton’s second ground of appeal are closely related. Cornelissen’s third ground of appeal and Sutton’s first ground of appeal are also closely related. It is convenient to deal at the same time with the closely related grounds in the two appeals. 
     
      
       
       
      Ground 1 (Cornelissen) 
       
        
      The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury not to engage in tendency reasoning with respect to relationship evidence admitted in the prosecution case 
      . 
       
       
      Ground 4 (Sutton) 
       
        
      The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury not to engage in tendency reasoning with respect to relationship evidence admitted in the prosecution case 
      . 
       
      
    60 At the trial evidence was given of four previous occasions on which there had been physical violence between the deceased and the appellant Cornelissen. 
     
      
    61 Before any of this evidence was given, there was discussion between the trial judge and counsel concerning the admissibility of this evidence. According to the transcript the Crown prosecutor said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown says that part of the relationship forms the evidence between the accused and the deceased”. 
        
       
      
    62 It was not disputed on the hearing of this appeal that this part of the transcript is garbled and that what the Crown prosecutor had said was to the effect that, in the Crown’s submission, the evidence formed part of the relationship between Cornelissen and the deceased. 
     
      
    63 Counsel for Cornelissen said that he did not object to the evidence being adduced and counsel for Sutton said that the evidence did not affect his client. 
     
      
    64 The witness Jade Coghlan then proceeded to give evidence about these four occasions. She said that at a barbeque at the home of Chris and Diane Cornelissen the appellant Shaun Cornelissen had headbutted and punched the deceased. The deceased’s nose had been broken and he had sustained two black eyes. At a party to celebrate Chris Cornelissen’s fiftieth birthday which was held at the Bogan Gate Hall, the appellant Cornelissen had headbutted the deceased. On an occasion in a caravan park where Monique Byrne was living, the appellant Cornelissen had grabbed the deceased around the throat and punched him. On an occasion at Cornelissen’s flat in Parkes the deceased had made a remark about a compact disk which was being played and Cornelissen had pushed the deceased and punched him in the face. 
     
      
    65 Evidence was given by some other Crown witnesses about some of these incidents. 
     
      
    66 The appellant Cornelissen gave evidence about these four occasions. With regard to the incident in the caravan park, he said that the deceased had become very aggressive and that the two women Monique Byrne and Jade Coghlan had had a fight in which Jade Coghlan had been struck with a beer bottle. Cornelissen denied that he had had any fight with the deceased on this occasion. 
     
      
    67 Cornelissen gave evidence that at Chris Cornelissen’s fiftieth birthday party it had been the deceased who had headbutted him and that he had not “touched” the deceased. At the barbeque at Chris and Diane Cornelissen’s home the deceased had headbutted Cornelissen and Cornelissen had then punched the deceased. At Cornelissen’s flat Cornelissen and the deceased had wrestled with each other, the wrestling having been initiated by the deceased. 
     
      
    68 In his closing address at the trial the Crown prosecutor made some references to this evidence. The Crown prosecutor submitted that when Cornelissen had given evidence about these four incidents he had tried to portray the deceased as having been the aggressor and himself as having been “passivist”. The Crown prosecutor submitted that the jury should accept the evidence of Jade Coghlan in preference to the evidence of Cornelissen. 
     
      
    69 In his closing address at the trial counsel for Cornelissen submitted to the jury that they should dismiss the evidence about the previous “blues” between the deceased and Cornelissen, which counsel for Cornelissen described as evidence of the prior “relationship” between the deceased and Cornelissen, as being totally irrelevant to what had happened on 2 August 2001. 
     
      
    70 It was submitted on this appeal by counsel for Cornelissen that, evidence of the four previous incidents of physical violence having been admitted as relationship evidence and not as tendency evidence, the evidence could not be used by the jury as tendency evidence (Evidence Act s 95) and, as there was a real risk that the jury, if the jury accepted Jade Coghlan’s evidence, might use the evidence as showing a tendency on the part of Cornelissen to be physically violent to the deceased, it was incumbent on the trial judge to give the jury a direction that the evidence could not be used for that purpose. The trial judge had not given the jury any such direction. 
     
      
    71 It was conceded by counsel for Cornelissen on the appeal that no such direction had been asked for at the trial and, therefore, leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules was required in order for the appellant Cornelissen to rely on this ground of appeal. However, it was submitted, leave under r 4 should be granted, because there would have been no forensic reason for counsel for Cornelissen at the trial not asking for such a direction. In his final address counsel for Cornelissen had not sought to derive any advantage from the version of the four incidents his client had given and had submitted to the jury that they should dismiss the evidence about the four incidents as being totally irrelevant. 
     
      
    72 In my opinion, it was unfortunate that evidence about the four incidents was ever admitted. It was not necessary to establish what had been the relationship between Cornelissen and the deceased, in order to be able to understand and put in an intelligible context what the Crown alleged had happened on the night of 2 August 2001. On the Crown case Cornelissen had acted on 2 August 2001 as the Crown alleged he had, because on that day he had become aware, for the first time, of an allegation that the deceased had sexually abused his sister, while they were children. 
     
      
    73 In my opinion, the submissions of counsel for the appellant Cornelissen should be accepted. The evidence about what happened on the four occasions was admitted as relationship evidence only, there was a real risk that the evidence might be used as evidence of a tendency on the part of Cornelissen to be physically violent to the deceased and the trial judge should have given a direction that the evidence could not be used for that purpose. It is difficult to see any forensic reason why counsel for Cornelissen at the trial would have deliberately refrained from seeking such a direction. 
     
      
    74 I would grant leave under r 4 and I would uphold Cornelissen’s first ground of appeal. 
     
      
    75 As the appellant Sutton’s liability, whether as a party to a joint enterprise with Cornelissen or as a principal in the second degree, is dependent on what was Cornelissen’s conduct towards the deceased on 2 August 2001, leave should be granted to Sutton to rely on his fourth ground of appeal and this ground of appeal should also be upheld. 
     
      
    76 Ground 2 (Cornelissen) 
     
      
      The trial judge erred in his directions regarding manslaughter 
      . 
       
       
      Ground 2 (Sutton) 
       
      The learned trial judge erred in his directions to the jury as to the elements of manslaughter 
      . 
       
      
    77 As I have already indicated, the Crown case that the appellant Cornelissen had committed the crime of manslaughter was that, in the second part of the physical altercation between Cornelissen and the deceased, Cornelissen had struck the deceased with a punch, otherwise than in self-defence, thereby doing an unlawful and dangerous act, which had caused the deceased’s death. 
     
      
    78 Quite apart from whether the Crown had proved that Cornelissen had not acted in self-defence, there was a strongly contested issue at the trial as to whether the Crown had proved that the act of punching the deceased had been a “dangerous” act. 
     
      
    79 In his summing-up the trial judge gave the jury the following directions about manslaughter:- 
     
      
       
        
        “To establish that both accused are guilty of manslaughter it is necessary for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt all of the following elements: 
        
       
       
        
        1. that Shaun Cornelissen and Jeff Sutton entered into a joint criminal enterprise to assault Tony Byrne; 
        
       
       
        
        2. that the accused, Shaun Cornelissen, committed an unlawful and dangerous act carrying with it an appreciable risk of serious injury by assaulting Tony James Byrne; 
        
       
       
        
        3. causing the death of Tony James Byrne; and 
        
       
       
        
        4. Shaun Cornelissen committed the assault as an incident in the carrying out of the joint criminal enterprise. 
        
       
       
        
        Manslaughter is committed where the accused causes the death of a person by an act which is both unlawful and dangerous. It is not necessary that the accused was aware that the act was dangerous provided that a reasonable person would have appreciated that the act was one which, in the circumstances, exposed others to risk of serious injury, that is an unlawful and dangerous act carrying with it an appreciable risk of serious injury. 
        
       
       
        
        In this case the act must be a breach of the criminal law. It is put by the prosecution that with an assault, the test of danger is objective. The only intent is an intent to commit an act which is unlawful and dangerous, that is to assault Tony Byrne. Each of the barristers sought to give you an example. May I give you this example of a dangerous act. Imagine two young persons at the end of a pier over water and they are tossing a box and passing one to the other like a ball. One misses the catch and it goes over the side and there is a person swimming underneath and the box hits the swimmer and kills him. What the two young persons were doing was a dangerous act. They had no idea that there was a swimmer underneath. It amounts to manslaughter because they were committing a dangerous act within the terminology that I mentioned to you, where there was a risk of serious injury. In this instance the prosecution puts to you that there was a joint criminal enterprise.” 
        
       
      
    80 It was submitted by counsel for each appellant that the directions given by his Honour were erroneous in certain respects. 
     
      
    81 In directing the jury about whether an act was dangerous, his Honour said that an act was dangerous, if a reasonable person would have appreciated that the act exposed others to an appreciable risk of serious injury. 
     
      
    82 This direction was obviously derived from a passage in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Toohey J, Gaudron J and McHugh J in Wilson v The Queen (1991-1992) 174 CLR 313 at 334, where their Honours authoritatively stated that in a trial for manslaughter the jury should be directed to assess “whether a reasonable person in the accused’s position would have realised that (in punching the deceased) he was exposing him to an appreciable risk of serious injury”. However, in the directions his Honour gave in the present trial his Honour had omitted from the directions the need for the reasonable person to be placed “in the accused’s position”. 
     
      
    83 It was submitted that the omission was significant, because different witnesses at the trial had given different accounts of what they had observed in the confrontation between Cornelissen and the deceased. For example, some Crown witnesses had given evidence that, before he was struck the fatal blow, the deceased was staggering. In his evidence Cornelissen denied that the deceased was staggering. Because what was material was what was apparent to Cornelissen and not what a Crown witnesses might have observed, it was essential that the jury should have been directed that, in determining whether the Crown had proved that Cornelissen’s act of punching was dangerous, they had to determine whether the Crown had proved that a reasonable person, in the position of Cornelissen, would have realised that in punching the deceased he was exposing him to an appreciable risk of serious injury. 
     
      
    84 In my opinion, counsel for Cornelissen’s submissions should be accepted. No objection was taken at the trial to his Honour’s directions but, as the omission was a significant omission in directing the jury about what the Crown had to prove to establish the offence charged, leave under r 4 should be granted and this ground of appeal should be allowed in both appeals. 
     
      
    85 It was further submitted by counsel for each appellant that the example given by the trial judge as being an example of a dangerous act was inapposite and positively misleading, in that it might have led the jury to take into account the outcome of Cornelissen’s act, that is the death of the deceased, in deciding whether Cornelissen’s act was dangerous. 
     
      
    86 On this appeal the Crown accepted that there were defects in the example given by the trial judge but submitted that better examples of dangerous acts had been given by counsel in their closing addresses and the Crown pointed out that elsewhere in the summing-up the trial judge had warned the jury against using hindsight.  
     
      
    87 In my opinion, the example given by his Honour was, with respect to his Honour, a poor one and could have been misleading. It is by no means clear on the brief facts postulated by his Honour that a reasonable person, in the position of the two persons passing the box between them, would have appreciated that the acts of passing the box carried an appreciable risk of serious injury to another person. One fact which was postulated by his Honour, that the persons passing the box had no idea that there was a swimmer underneath, might well militate against a finding that the acts of passing the box were dangerous according to the test stated in Wilson. I mention in passing that it is by no means apparent that the acts of passing the box would have been unlawful. 
     
      
    88 I would not have upheld this ground of appeal, merely on the basis that the example given by his Honour was inapposite and liable of itself to have been misleading, but the giving of such an example by his Honour strengthens my conclusion that this ground of appeal should be upheld. 
     
      
    89 It was further submitted by counsel for Cornelissen that the trial judge, after giving these directions of law about manslaughter, had failed to relate the directions to the evidence. Nowhere in the summing-up did the trial judge tell the jury in terms that they had to determine whether, applying the directions of law he had given them, they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Cornelissen’s act of punching the deceased, quite apart from whether it was done in self-defence, was a dangerous act. 
     
      
    90 In my opinion, it would have been preferable for the trial judge to have more explicitly related his directions of law about manslaughter to the evidence in the particular trial but I have concluded from a consideration of the summing-up as a whole that the jury would have realised that one of their tasks was to determine whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that Cornelissen’s act of punching the deceased had been a dangerous act. 
     
      
    91 There may have been other defects in the trial judge’s directions but any such other defects were not the subject of argument on the hearing of the appeal 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 (Cornelissen) 
       
      The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury regarding the evidence of alleged admissions by the appellant 
      . 
       
       
      Ground 1 (Sutton) 
       
      The trial judge erred by permitting the jury to consider the evidence of Tanya Byrne in the case against the appellant 
      . 
       
      
    92 The evidence of alleged admissions referred to in Cornelissen’s ground of appeal is the evidence of Tanya Byrne referred to in Sutton’s ground of appeal. It is convenient first to consider Sutton’s ground of appeal, which asserts that the evidence was inadmissible against him, before considering Cornelissen’s ground of appeal, which concedes that the evidence was admissible against Cornelissen, but asserts that the trial judge erred in the directions he gave about the evidence.  
     
      
    93 Tanya Byrne, a sister of the deceased, was one of the last witnesses called in the Crown case. She gave evidence which was generally in accordance with what she had said in a statement she had made to police after the trial had commenced.  
     
      
    94 Tanya Byrne gave evidence that, after hearing of her brother’s death, she had travelled to Parkes, where she had a conversation with the appellant Cornelissen, the appellant Sutton not being present. 
     
      
    95 In this conversation Cornelissen had said that, on the second occasion he and Sutton had gone to the deceased’s house on the night of 2 August 2001: 
     
      
       
        
        “Shaun said that they went there, Tony come out, he closed the door behind him, pulled it to. Shaun and Tony were talking and then Shaun hit him. Then they had a fight, Tony got the better of Shaun”. (T p265 lines 34-37) 
        
       
       
       . . .  
       
       
        
        “Jeff kicked Tony in the guts and dragged him off Shaun and then the fight continued. I asked Shaun did he hit him with anything and he said no. I asked him did Jeff hit him with anything. He wouldn’t answer me”. (T p 265 lines 50-54) 
        
       
       
       . . .  
       
       
        
        “I asked him why he took Jeff. The first time he said he didn’t know. Later I asked him again and he said he took Jeff in case Tony went off”. (T p 266 lines 9-11) 
        
       
      
    96 Before this evidence was given at the trial by Tanya Byrne, there had been argument in the absence of the jury about its admissibility and particularly its admissibility against the appellant Sutton. Counsel for Sutton at the trial submitted that the evidence was inadmissible against Sutton and seriously prejudicial to him. The Crown prosecutor conceded that the evidence was not admissible against Sutton but submitted that any prejudice to Sutton from the admission of the evidence against Cornelissen could be cured by the giving of directions by the trial judge. The trial judge gave a judgment in which he held that the evidence was admissible against Cornelissen and that, so far as Sutton was concerned, he could overcome any prejudice to Sutton by directing the jury that they should put the evidence out of their minds (in considering the case against Sutton). In other words, his Honour held that the evidence was inadmissible against Sutton but that he could cure any prejudice to Sutton stemming from the admission of the evidence against Cornelissen by giving the jury appropriate directions. 
     
      
    97 After Tanya Byrne had given her evidence in chief, including her evidence of what she had been told by Cornelissen, she was cross-examined by counsel for Cornelissen but she was not cross-examined at all by counsel for Sutton. 
     
      
    98 Notwithstanding the trial judge’s ruling that the evidence was inadmissible against Sutton, the Crown prosecutor in his final address, in making submissions in support of the Crown case against Sutton, said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “You’ve heard the evidence of Tanya Byrne as to what was said by the accused to her. That being that Jeff raced in and kicked him in the guts. So he was getting support, the Crown says. An accessory, helping”. (T p450 lines 14-18) 
        
       
      
    99 A little later in his address the Crown prosecutor said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “You’d be quite entitled to accept that Sutton was an accessory because of what Cornelissen said to Tanya Byrne of kicking him in the guts”. (T p451 lines 8-10) 
        
       
      
    100 Not only was what the Crown prosecutor said in his address a contravention of the ruling the trial judge had previously made but what the Crown prosecutor asserted that Tanya Byrne had said in her evidence went beyond the evidence she had actually given. It would appear that in the statement she had given to police Tanya Byrne had said that “Jeff raced in” immediately before she said that Sutton had kicked the deceased but in actually giving her evidence before the jury Tanya Byrne had omitted saying that Jeff had “raced in”. 
     
      
    101 In counsel for Sutton’s final address counsel told the jury that Tanya Byrne’s evidence of what Cornelissen had said to her could not be evidence against Sutton. Counsel said, “it’s got nothing to do with him”. 
     
      
    102 During a break in the delivery by his Honour of his summing-up the Crown prosecutor said that the trial judge would have to give a warning pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act about Tanya Byrne’s evidence, because it was, in effect, evidence by one co-accused (Cornelissen) against another co-accused (Sutton). 
     
      
    103 Counsel for Sutton submitted that Tanya Byrne’s evidence was not admissible against Sutton. Counsel submitted:- 
     
      
       
        
        “What another accused says to someone else, some time afterwards, in the absence of the co-accused, isn’t admissible against him – it’s admissible against Mr Cornelissen – and I’d ask your Honour to ask the jury to perform a mental gymnastics of excluding that evidence against Mr Sutton”. 
        
       
      
    104 The trial judge thanked counsel for their submissions but gave no indication of what he proposed to say about the matter in the rest of the summing-up. 
     
      
    105 Later in the summing-up the trial judge said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Tanya Byrne has given evidence of what Cornelissen said about his involvement, and also what Cornelissen said to her, he being charged, as was Sutton at the time, with this event, concerning Sutton’s involvement. Now, so far as what Cornelissen says, you have heard his version of it – and again, you have got to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt– but it is a matter that you can take into account as an admission or a matter that is told to Tanya, but in considering its worth to you, consider the time lag, consider the circumstances in which she says it was given and the concrete evidence against. 
        
       
       
        
        You may think, in those circumstances, that it is not such strong or reliable evidence. I want to warn you that in all of those circumstances you ought to consider carefully whether it is unreliable evidence, but in relation to what she says about Sutton’s involvement – that is what Cornelissen told her was Sutton’s involvement, this suggested ‘kicking in the guts’ – remember that this is from an accomplice (Cornelissen) – that is, someone like Sutton charged – and I must warn you that the evidence of an accomplice in situations like that might be so unreliable that you would put one side. I mean, we often hear, do we not, of accomplices giving evidence against one another because they want to protect their own selves. Well here you have an accomplice (Cornelissen) giving evidence, or rather Tanya telling us of what is supposedly said by Cornelissen concerning Sutton’s involvement, and that you may consider to be so unreliable that you would put it one side, but I give you that direction because that is the likelihood, one might say, of what an accomplice might say in a situation where he is allegedly involved in a serious aspect of it”. 
        
       
      
    106 Immediately after the trial judge had concluded his summing-up, counsel for Sutton said that the trial judge had not said in the summing-up that Tanya Byrne’s evidence was not admissible against Sutton. The trial judge said that he had not said so, deliberately, and “I have ruled that it (Tanya Byrne’s evidence) is admissible but I added that warning”. 
     
      
    107 Counsel for Sutton referred the trial judge to s 83 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    108 The Crown prosecutor submitted that whether the evidence should be admitted was a matter for the exercise of a discretion by his Honour. 
     
      
    109 The trial judge held that s 83 of the Evidence Act was inapplicable and that “I allow the evidence and the direction from me to stand”. In giving his ruling his Honour referred to s 165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act. In referring to s 165(1)(d) his Honour would appear not to have distinguished between first hand evidence given by an “accomplice” and hearsay evidence given by another witness of what an “accomplice” had said to that other witness. 
     
      
    110 On the hearing of this appeal counsel for the Crown conceded that Tanya Byrne’s evidence was inadmissible against Sutton. Tanya Byrne’s evidence was evidence of what one accused Cornelissen had said to her, in the absence of the other accused Sutton, long after any joint enterprise between Cornelissen and Sutton had ended, and was not admissible in the trial of Sutton. Counsel for Sutton at the trial was correct in referring his Honour to s 83 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    111 Before the evidence was given his Honour had made a correct ruling that the evidence would not be admissible in the trial of Sutton and, after Tanya Byrne had given her evidence in chief, counsel for Sutton at the trial did not cross-examine Tanya Byrne. 
     
      
    112 However, in contravention of the ruling the trial judge had made, the Crown prosecutor in his final address relied on the evidence of Tanya Byrne as supporting the Crown case against Sutton and misstated the evidence Tanya Byrne had actually given. 
     
      
    113 In his summing-up the trial judge in effect reversed his earlier ruling and by giving the jury a warning about Tanya Byrne’s evidence conveyed to the jury that, although they would have to have regard to the warning, the evidence was admissible against Sutton. 
     
      
    114 Tanya Byrne’s evidence was seriously prejudicial to Sutton. Tanya Byrne gave evidence that Cornelissen had said that Sutton had kicked the deceased “in the guts”; that when Tanya Byrne asked Cornelissen whether Sutton had hit the deceased “he (Cornelissen) wouldn’t answer me” (which was capable of giving rise to an inference that Sutton had, in fact, hit the deceased); and that Cornelissen had said that he had taken Sutton with him “in case Tony went off”. 
     
      
    115 Sutton’s third ground of appeal must be upheld. 
     
      
    116 As regards Cornelissen’s third ground of appeal, it was conceded on the appeal by counsel for Cornelissen that the evidence, although not admissible against Sutton, was admissible against Cornelissen. However, it was submitted, there was a danger that the warning the trial judge had given in his summing-up about the unreliability of Tanya Byrne’s evidence against Sutton as being evidence of what she had been told by an “accomplice” (Cornelissen), might have been taken into account by the jury in assessing the evidence of Cornelissen generally. The trial judge should have guarded against this danger by giving the jury further directions but the trial judge had not done so. 
     
      
    117 I consider that the trial judge did err in the directions he gave about the evidence of Tanya Byrne. Of course, if his Honour had abided by the correct ruling he had earlier made that the evidence of Tanya Byrne was inadmissible against Sutton, there would have been no need for his Honour to give the directions of which complaint is now made. However, his Honour reversed that ruling and gave directions. In the directions the appellant Cornelissen should not have been referred to as an “accomplice”, a word which is not used in the Evidence Act and which is calculated to convey to the jury that the trial judge considers that an accused person so described is indeed guilty (See R v Stewart (2001) 52 NSWLR 301 at par 126 per Howie J and at par 21 per Spigelman CJ). Furthermore, I accept that there was a danger that the directions given, in the absence of further directions, might have influenced the jury’s assessment of Cornelissen’s evidence generally. 
     
      
    118 I would uphold Cornelissen’s third ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 (Sutton) 
       
      The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury as to a joint criminal enterprise 
      . 
       
      
    119 As has already been indicated, the Crown did not allege at the trial that the accused Sutton had personally done any act causing the death of the deceased. On the Crown case the act causing the deceased’s death had been done by the other accused Cornelissen.  
     
      
    120 The primary Crown case against Sutton was that he had been a party to a joint criminal enterprise with Cornelissen and that in the course of carrying out that criminal enterprise Cornelissen had thrown the punch which caused the death of the deceased and that, consequently, Sutton, as well as Cornelissen, was guilty of manslaughter. 
     
      
    121 Alternatively, the Crown said that Sutton was guilty of manslaughter as an accessory or principal in the second degree, as being a person who was present when the principal in the first degree Cornelissen did an unlawful and dangerous act causing the deceased’s death and Sutton, knowing that Cornelissen was committing or about to commit such an act, aided and abetted Cornelissen. 
     
      
    122 The trial judge in his summing-up gave the jury directions both about what the Crown had to prove to establish Sutton’s guilt as a party to a joint criminal enterprise and what the Crown had to prove to establish Sutton’s guilt as being an accessory. 
     
      
    123 On this appeal it was submitted by counsel for Sutton that, as on the Crown case there was no doubt which of the two accused was the principal offender and no doubt that the other accused had been present when the principal offender struck the fatal blow, the present case (on the Crown allegations) was a classic case of a principal in the first degree and an accessory and there had been no need for the Crown to seek to rely on joint criminal enterprise, whether straightforward or extended. Reference was made to the judgment of Hunt J in R v Stokes and Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25. 
     
      
    124 It was further submitted by counsel for the appellant that, in any event, the evidentiary basis for there having been any joint criminal enterprise between the two accused was “tenuous”. 
     
      
    125 It was not in issue at the trial that Cornelissen believed that his sister Tammy had alleged that she had been sexually abused as a child by the deceased and that it was this belief which had led Cornelissen to go to the deceased’s house on 2 August 2001. The Crown alleged that the other accused Sutton had also become aware of the allegation of sexual abuse. However, Cornelissen when giving evidence at the trial denied that he had told Sutton about the allegation and Sutton, when he was interviewed on the night of 2-3 August 2001 repeatedly said that all Cornelissen had told him about the purpose of their joint visit to the deceased was that Cornelissen wanted to “work something out” with the deceased, without Cornelissen being any more explicit. The Crown submitted at the trial that, notwithstanding the assertions of both accused, the jury should infer that Cornelissen had told Sutton why Cornelissen wanted to visit the deceased. 
     
      
    126 In my opinion, the Crown case against Sutton could have been presented, without any disadvantage to the Crown, simply on the basis of accessorial liability and the introduction of a Crown case based on joint criminal enterprise led to complications in the summing-up. Nevertheless, I do not consider that, even in a trial where the Crown case against an accused could, without disadvantage to the Crown, have been limited to a case based on accessorial liability, the Crown is precluded, as a matter of law, from also seeking to rely on joint criminal enterprise and I do not read Hunt J’s judgment in Stokes and Difford as saying anything to the contrary. I am also of the opinion that there was a sufficient basis to enable the Crown to seek to rely on joint criminal enterprise. 
     
      
    127 I would not uphold Sutton’s third ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 (Cornelissen) 
       
      The verdict was unreasonable 
      . 
       
       
      Ground 5 (Sutton) 
       
      The verdict was unreasonable 
      . 
       
      
    128 The principles to be applied by a Court of Criminal Appeal in deciding whether verdicts of guilty are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence have been stated in such cases as M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 and MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 622-624 (52-59). The test to be applied is whether the Court of Criminal Appeal, after making its own independent assessment of the evidence, considers it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the accused’s guilt, applying the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, acting as a reasonable jury and reaching their verdict upon the whole of the evidence. “But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations” (M v The Queen per Mason CJ, Deane J, Dawson J and Toohey J at 493). 
     
      
    129 I will deal firstly with Cornelissen’s ground of appeal. 
     
      
    130 It was clearly open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Cornelissen had punched the deceased and that the punch by Cornelissen had caused the death of the deceased. The issues on this ground of appeal are whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Cornelissen’s punch was “dangerous” according to the test stated in Wilson and whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Cornelissen had not acted in self-defence. 
     
      
    131 With regard to these issues, it was submitted by the Crown inter alia that it would have been open to the jury to find that Cornelissen had a motive for being hostile to the deceased; that Cornelissen had decided to confront the deceased about the allegation that the deceased had sexually abused Cornelissen’s sister; that, instead of going alone to the deceased’s house, Cornelissen had taken Sutton with him, indicating that Cornelissen anticipated that there might be physical violence; that on the second visit to the deceased’s house Cornelissen had parked his car some distance away from the house, so that the deceased could not damage the car; that in the first part of the physical altercation outside the house the deceased had gone to the ground, that when the deceased had got to his feet again he was staggering and obviously distressed, yet Cornelissen had punched him; and that after the deceased had been knocked down Cornelissen had shown no concern for the deceased and had expressed satisfaction with what he had done. 
     
      
    132 I have taken the Crown submissions into account but I have nevertheless concluded that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt, both as to whether the act of punching was dangerous and as to whether Cornelissen had not acted in self-defence. 
     
      
    133 As regards whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act of punching was dangerous, it is noteworthy that none of the Crown witnesses gave evidence of having actually seen Cornelissen throw a punch which connected with the deceased. Jade Coghlan was still inside the house, when the punch knocking the deceased down was thrown. Monique Byrne, although outside the house, had her back turned, talking to Jade Coghlan, at the time when the punch was thrown. By the time Monique Byrne had looked around, the deceased was on the ground. Simon Monkerud saw Cornelissen throw punches but he did not see any of the punches strike the deceased. Katrina Whitney saw Cornelissen throw one punch but did not see whether it hit the deceased. 
     
      
    134 It would not have been open to the jury to infer from the deceased’s injuries and death that the punch had necessarily been a heavy punch. In his report which was admitted into evidence Dr Rodriguez, the neuropathologist called by the Crown, said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage most commonly results from a blow to the side or the back of the neck, resulting in rotation of the head on the neck. The direction of the blow and subsequent rotation of the head appears to be more important than the force of the punch and relatively minor blows have resulted in this injury. At least one case of basal subarachnoid haemorrhage has been described where the victim moved his head to avoid a blow. It has been suggested that this injury may be more common if the victim’s reflexes are impaired as may be the case if the victim was affected by alcohol or was ‘groggy’. While this may be true in many cases, it is by no means a universal finding”. 
        
       
      
    135 In the present case the deceased had been drinking alcohol and had a moderate blood alcohol reading.  
     
      
    136 In his evidence Cornelissen said that he had thrown only a single punch. Sutton, when he was interviewed by police, said that the punch by Cornelissen was “only a little punch”. 
     
      
    137 As regards whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Cornelissen had not acted in self-defence, Simon Monkerud gave evidence that the deceased, after getting up from the ground, had taken his jumper off, moved towards Cornelissen and thrown a couple of punches. Katrina Whitney gave evidence that the deceased had taken his jumper off and had tried to swing some punches at Cornelissen and that Cornelissen had then swung one punch back. Cornelissen himself gave evidence that the deceased had advanced towards him, throwing punches and that he had thrown a single punch in self-defence. 
     
      
    138 Even if the deceased was observed by some of the Crown witnesses to be staggering, this might not have been apparent to Cornelissen and did not incapacitate the deceased from advancing towards Cornelissen and throwing punches. 
     
      
    139 In my opinion, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Cornelissen did not believe that it was necessary to defend himself or that Cornelissen’s conduct in throwing a single punch, which was not necessarily a forceful punch, was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as perceived by Cornelissen.  
     
      
    140 I would uphold Cornelissen’s fourth ground of appeal. 
     
      
    141 If Cornelissen’s fourth ground of appeal is upheld, then Sutton’s fifth ground of appeal must be upheld. As the trial judge correctly told the jury in his summing-up, if Cornelissen was not found guilty, then Sutton could not be found guilty, as Sutton’s criminal liability depended on Cornelissen being criminally liable. 
     
      
    142 There are further reasons why a verdict of guilty against Sutton was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
     
      
    143 As regards Sutton being liable as a party to a joint enterprise with Cornelissen to seriously assault the deceased, the jury, on the basis of the evidence of both Cornelissen and Sutton and particularly the answers given by Sutton when he was interviewed on 3 August 2001, ought to have had a reasonable doubt about whether there was any such joint criminal enterprise between Cornelissen and Sutton. 
     
      
    144 As regards accessorial liability, although Sutton was undoubtedly present, the jury ought, on the Crown witnesses’ own evidence, to have had a reasonable doubt about whether Sutton was aiding and abetting Cornelissen when Cornelissen threw the fatal punch. Monique Byrne gave evidence that she saw the deceased lying on the ground and she saw Sutton “on one side” of the deceased and that she pulled Sutton away from the deceased. Sutton protested to her that he had not done anything. Monique Byrne gave no further evidence which would implicate Sutton. Simon Monkerud gave evidence that he saw the deceased lying on the ground and Sutton “over” the deceased but he did not see Sutton do anything to the deceased and after Simon Monkerud yelled out “cut it out”, Sutton walked over to Simon Monkerud. Simon Monkerud gave no further evidence which would implicate Sutton. Katrina Whitney saw Monique Byrne pushing Sutton away from the deceased and gave no further evidence which would implicate Sutton. 
     
      
    145 In my opinion Sutton’s fifth ground of appeal should be upheld. 
     
      
       
      CONCLUSION 
       
      
    146 In my opinion, Cornelissen’s first, second, third and fourth grounds of appeal should be upheld and his appeal against conviction should be allowed. As I have upheld his fourth ground of appeal, the conviction should be quashed absolutely and a judgment and verdict of acquittal entered. 
     
      
    147 In my opinion, Sutton’s first, second, fourth and fifth grounds of appeal should be upheld and his appeal against conviction should be allowed. As I have upheld Sutton’s fifth ground of appeal, his conviction should be quashed absolutely and a judgment and verdict of acquittal entered. 
     
      
    148 As both conviction appeals should be allowed, it is unnecessary to deal with the applications for leave to appeal against sentence.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: On 3 September 2003, the appellant was indicted to stand trial before his Honour Judge Patten and a jury in respect of the following charge:  
     
      
       
        
        ""That on 22 November 2001 at Sydney, New South Wales, without reasonable excuse, he did attempt to obtain possession of prohibited imports to which s 233B of the  
        Customs Act  
        1901 applied, namely, narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of heroin being not less than the trafficable quantity applicable to heroin, which had been imported into Australia in contravention of the said Act."" 
        
       
      
    2 The trial concluded on 17 September 2003 with the jury returning a verdict of guilty. On 14 November 2003 his Honour sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 7 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 8 months, taking into account a period of 4 months in pre-trial custody. The appellant appeals to this Court against his conviction only. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    3 On 15 November 2001, a package was consigned at the office of DHL Worldwide Express (DHL) in Istanbul, Turkey for carriage to Australia. The package was addressed to Salaam Joumaa at 200 Noble Avenue, Greenacre, New South Wales. The contents of the package were described as ""car part"".  
     
      
    4 The package arrived in Sydney on 17 November 2001 and was placed in the bond store operated by DHL. On 18 November 2001, officers of the Australian Customs Service (ACS) attended the bond store, opened the package and located three cardboard boxes inside. Each box was marked ""Volvo"" and contained what appeared to be an engine flywheel. The ACS officers x-rayed the flywheels and detected therein a concealed quantity of heroin. The ACS then provided the flywheels to the Australian Federal Police.  
     
      
    5 On 19 November 2001, Federal Agents examined the flywheels and found that each contained three separate cavities containing heroin. One of the flywheels was left intact and used as a model from which the police created three replica flywheels for use in a controlled delivery of the package to the nominated address at Greenacre. They placed a listening device and a controlled delivery sample of 20 grams of the imported heroin into one of the replica flywheels. The replicas were painted a red/brown colour and coated with grease. The grease caused the paint to breakdown and to adhere to the hands and clothing of persons who came into contact with it. The three replica flywheels were then placed into the ""Volvo"" boxes and rewrapped in the original packaging. 
     
      
    6 On 22 November 2001, police conducted a controlled delivery of the restructured package. At 12.55 pm on that day a Federal Agent posing as a DHL courier delivered the package to 200 Noble Avenue, Greenacre. At the time of the delivery there were five people at the premises, namely, the addressee Salaam Joumaa, Adam Kheir (who is a cousin of the appellant), Melanie Gibson (who is Adam Kheir's wife) and their two children.  
     
      
    7 The listening device transmitted the sounds of activity and conversation during the course of the afternoon. A Federal Agent and an Arabic interpreter, Dr Muhammad Gamal, monitored those transmissions.  
     
      
    8 The listening device transmitted intermittent sounds of knocking, scraping, and hammering between 1.19pm and 2.08pm. At 2.17pm, Adam Kheir and his wife, Melanie Gibson, departed from the premises and returned 24 minutes later at 2.41pm.  
     
      
    9 At 2.42pm the appellant arrived by car at the premises and entered the house through the front doorway. At 2.49pm he exited the house through the front doorway, walked down the driveway on the right-hand side of the house and entered the backyard.  
     
      
    10 Between 2.50pm and 3.12pm the listening device transmitted the sound of hammering consistent with the flywheels being broken apart. The sound of hammering was louder and more consistent than during period before the arrival of the appellant. By 3.02pm the sound of hammering was constant. The listening device also transmitted the sound of a power tool consistent with the use of an angle-grinder later found at the premises. Between 2.50pm and 3.12pm the device also transmitted conversations between two adult males conducted mainly in Arabic concerning the package, the flywheels and their anticipated contents. During that period, the appellant and Adam Kheir were the only adult males at the premises.  
     
      
    11 Dr Gamal translated the conversations between the two adult males into English and prepared a transcript referring to the males as M1 and M2. He identified Adam Kheir as M1 and the appellant as M2.  
     
      
    12 At 3.12pm a third adult male, Alan Kheir, who is the father of Adam Kheir and the uncle of the appellant, arrived at the premises and entered through the front doorway. The listening device continued to transmit the sounds of hammering and conversation between, so it was alleged, the appellant and Adam Kheir regarding the flywheels and their contents, until 3.16pm when transmission ceased. The device did not transmit any words spoken by Alan Kheir. 
     
      
    13 At 3.25pm Federal Agents attended the premises and executed a search warrant. It is to be noted that the appellant was not named in that warrant although Adam Kheir was. When police entered the backyard, the appellant and Adam Kheir were standing on the back steps to the house. Two of the replica flywheels had been broken apart by that time and pieces of them were scattered across the back steps. Lying amongst the broken pieces were a hammer and chisel. The controlled delivery sample of heroin had been removed from one of the replica flywheels and was on the floor, just inside the back doorway to the house.  
     
      
    14 The Federal Agents observed that the appellant's hands were greasy and bore red/brown residue that was consistent with the paint that had been applied to the replica flywheels. Furthermore, the shirt and jeans worn by him also bore red/brown residue and grease marks. The red/brown coloured marks appeared in a ""cog-pattern"" that was consistent with the dimensions and colour of the teeth on the circumferences of the replica flywheels. Those marks appeared on the front of the appellant's shirt and on the front, inner thigh and back of his jeans. The grease marks were consistent with the grease that had been applied to the replica flywheels having attracted foreign matter. 
     
      
    15 The third flywheel was located on a table in the sunroom of the premises. Next to the table were a number of tools including pliers, a screwdriver and an angle-grinder that was plugged into the power point in the wall.  
     
      
    16 The three ""Volvo"" boxes that had contained the replica flywheels were found in a bin at the front of the house. The police observed Salaam Joumaa placing them there at 3.11pm.  
     
      
    17 The Crown alleged that the appellant jointly possessed the replica flywheels with Adam Kheir between 2.50pm, when the appellant walked down the driveway and entered the backyard, and 3.25pm when Federal Agents entered the backyard and observed the appellant and Adam Kheir standing on the back steps amidst the broken pieces of replica flywheel, tools and the controlled delivery sample. 
     
      
    18 The Crown relied upon a combination of the following circumstances to establish that the appellant had participated in opening the replica flywheels and that he knew or believed them to contain narcotic goods: 
     
      
    (a) The attendance by the appellant at the address to which the package had been consigned at 2.42pm being 1 hour 47 minutes after delivery of the package, and 1 minute after the return of Adam Kheir to the premises; 
     
      
    (b) The attendance by the appellant at the delivery address approximately 30 minutes before the anticipated arrival of his uncle, Alan Kheir, at that address, it being the appellant's case that earlier on the day in question, he had met his uncle at Punchbowl and had been invited by him to visit the Greenacre home that afternoon (the appellant gave evidence that he had expected Alan Kheir to arrive home at about 3.00pm);  
     
      
    (c) The presence of the appellant in the backyard of the premises between 2.50pm and 3.25pm during which period the replica flywheels were broken open; 
     
      
    (d) The participation by the appellant in the breaking of the replica flywheels that, from their outward appearance, did not appear to contain concealed goods and did not invite opening; 
     
      
    (e) The intercepted conversation between the appellant and Adam Kheir concerning the opening of the replica flywheels and their anticipated contents; 
     
      
    (f) The red marks on the hands of the appellant and the red, cog-pattern marks on his jeans and shirt; 
     
      
    (g) The continuing presence of the appellant in the back yard of the premises between 2.12pm and 3.25pm during which period the appellant could have entered the house and socialised with Alan Kheir (who had arrived at approximately 3.10pm), had that been the true purpose of his visit; and 
     
      
    (h) The position of the appellant at 3.25pm when the Federal Agents entered the back yard, the appellant being on the back steps of the house amidst broken pieces of broken flywheels, a hammer, chisel and the controlled delivery sample of heroin. 
     
      
       
      The defence case 
       
      
    19 As at 22 November 2001, the appellant was employed at Flemington Markets where on that day, he had worked from 3.00am to 10.30am. As already noted, he had met with his uncle, Alan Kheir, who had invited him to visit his Greenacre home that afternoon. The appellant went home and slept in his work clothes. He awoke and invited his wife, Madeline Sassine, to join him in visiting Alan Kheir. She declined, and the appellant went alone wearing his work clothes.  
     
      
    20 The appellant expected Alan Kheir to arrive home at about 3.00pm. He said that he arrived at the premises prior to 3.00pm and waited in the lounge room. Adam Kheir came into the lounge room, spoke briefly with the appellant and left. The appellant heard the sound of knocking and went to the back of the house to investigate and to smoke a cigarette. He entered the sunroom and saw that Adam Kheir was smashing something with a hammer. He walked onto the back steps and asked Adam Kheir what he was doing. The latter replied that he was ""breaking something"". The appellant walked around the backyard smoking cigarettes. He maintained that he did not have a lengthy conversation with Adam Kheir and did not know what he was doing. He said that Adam Kheir was talking to himself and to the people who were inside the house, namely, Melanie Gibson, Salaam Joumaa and Salaam El-Kheir, the wife of Alan Kheir. The appellant said that he heard the sound of a power tool being operated inside the house but did not see who was operating it. 
     
      
    21 The appellant also gave evidence that he picked up parts of the smashed bits of flywheel that were in the yard out of curiosity. He said that Salaam El-Kheir instructed him to go to the garage and obtain a bag of potatoes to take home. He obtained the bag and placed it on the back steps. Alan Kheir arrived home and greeted the appellant from inside the house. The appellant indicated that he would finish his cigarette and would then join Alan Kheir inside. The appellant maintained that he did not believe that there would be narcotic goods at the house. He did not see the ""Volvo"" boxes, did not use a hammer or chisel to destroy the replica flywheels and did not see the controlled delivery sample of heroin on the floor just inside the backdoor. He said his clothes were dirty because of his work at the Flemington Markets and became dirtier when the Federal Agents ordered him to lie on the ground in an area near the back steps full of debris from the broken flywheels. He maintained that he had the imprints of the flywheel on his clothes as a result of being required to lie on top of the broken pieces of flywheel by the Federal Agents. 
     
      
    22 Alan Kheir gave evidence that on the day in question he had invited the appellant to visit at his home. He said that he returned home shortly after 3.00pm and went to kitchen where he saw the appellant standing in the backyard smoking a cigarette. The appellant signalled that he would finish his cigarette and come inside. Adam Kheir was near the backdoor at the time but, according to his evidence, he did not hear any hammering or banging at that time. However, after he had poured a glass of water and retired to the lounge room, he heard a knocking noise. 
     
      
    23 Some nine witnesses, relatives and friends of the appellant, were called for the defence mainly to give evidence of good character. They gave evidence that he was honest, pious and counselled against drug use.  
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 1 - the learned trial judge erred in the manner in which he dealt with the evidence of ""bad character"" of the appellant, which emerged unexpectedly during the trial. 
       
      
    24 It is necessary to preface this ground of appeal by reference to the course of that part of the trial concerning the appellant's good character. Evidence was adduced on behalf of the appellant that he was a person of good character. One Federal Agent was cross-examined to the effect that he did not believe that the appellant had a criminal history and another gave evidence in cross-examination that the appellant was unknown to the police at the time that they obtained the warrant to search the Greenacre premises and that he had never been charged with, or convicted of, any offence in Australia. The appellant gave sworn evidence. In his evidence-in-chief he said that he had never been investigated, charged or convicted in respect of any criminal offence in Lebanon. A certificate from the Judiciary Registrar of the Republic of Lebanon was tendered in support of that evidence.  
     
      
    25 Early in his evidence-in-chief the appellant said that he resided with his wife and her two children (of a previous marriage) in a two-bedroom unit in Mimosa Road, Greenacre. He agreed that he was currently in receipt of a carer's pension, as he was required to look after his wife who had had an eye operation and had failing eyesight. He produced two carer's pension cards, which were tendered by his trial counsel and admitted without objection as Exhibit 13.  
     
      
    26 Somewhat later in his examination-in-chief, his counsel sought access to the two pension cards. He asked the interpreter to read out the addresses on those cards, one of which was 1/816 Punchbowl Road, Punchbowl expiring in June 2004. The other had expired in June 2003 and had the address 19 Catherine Street, Punchbowl. The appellant was then asked to explain why the addresses were not listed as Mimosa Street. The appellant stated that the addresses on the cards were those of his sister. When asked why his sister's address was on the cards, he responded (AB 587): 
     
      
       
        
        ""I've lodged my application with Centrelink at my sister's address so that informs Centrelink that my wife and I are separate, so that we can, I have more money."" 
        
       
      
    27 At this point trial counsel for the appellant indicated to his Honour that he had almost concluded the appellant's evidence-in-chief. There was then a short adjournment after which, in the absence of the jury, the appellant's trial counsel sought a certificate under s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Evidence Act) upon the basis that the appellant's evidence as recorded above might have disclosed what amounted to a social security offence. Counsel indicated (at AB 588) that the answer was not one for which he was prepared. His Honour then indicated to the appellant that he was entitled to object to answering questions on the basis that he had a ""privilege against self-incrimination"". The appellant maintained that having sworn on the Koran, he was telling the truth. His Honour then granted the appellant a certificate pursuant to s 128(6) of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    28 The jury then returned and the following exchange took place between the appellant and his trial counsel (at AB 590): 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Sir, do you recall that I asked you a question about exhibit 13, being two cards relating to a carer's pension benefit? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Sir, if I understand your answer, you have indicated to his Honour and the jury that the address which appears on those cards is not in fact your address where you live? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. If I understand your answer, it is that another address has been placed on the card or cards so as to enable you to obtain a social security benefit to which you would not otherwise be entitled? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You understand, I take it, that the answer that you gave to his Honour and the jury in response to my question may not be one in your interests? If I could just get a 'yes 
        ' or 'no' to that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you give that answer? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Because I did swear on the Koran to say the truth and I am saying the truth. I am not lying."" 
        
       
      
    29 The following day, trial counsel for the appellant informed his Honour that he had further questions in chief to ask the appellant which, relevantly, involved the following exchange (at AB 592): 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Sir, you have informed the jury of your being in receipt of a benefit to which you are not entitled from the Department of Social Security, do you agree with that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you consider that that was an honest thing to do? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What is the amount or extent of the benefit that you have received and to which you are not entitled? 
        
       
       
        
        A. How? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What is the amount or extent of the benefit to which you are not entitled in terms of what is the sum of money or the amount of it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. $45 per week. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And why is it that you came to be in receipt of that benefit of $45 a week to which you are not entitled, why did you do that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I have financial hardship. I've got to financially support the kids, they are growing and I had just difficulty to manage to make ends meet. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And sir, why is it that you have instructed me to raise these further matters? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I know this thing will hurt me, but I am telling the truth. I am telling the truth."" 
        
       
      
    30 I interpolate here to observe that in his evidence-in-chief the appellant said that although he knew his uncle Alan (Kheir) well as they were of similar age, and that Alan was his ""mate"", Adam was much younger and had ""different thoughts, different ideas"" as a consequence whereof he did not socialise with him. Further, he said that he went around the house to the backyard because he heard a knocking or banging noise and because he wished to have a cigarette, as he could not smoke inside the house. It was then that he noticed that Adam had a hammer and was breaking or smashing something. Having asked Adam what he was doing, the latter responded, ""I'm breaking something"". He said that he was waiting in the backyard for his uncle to arrive, smoking cigarettes. He had no idea what Adam was doing or why he was doing it. He noticed that Adam was talking to himself and to people inside and was swearing. He did not know who Adam was speaking to, but it was not to him. In any event, he was paying little attention. He accepted that he had picked up some broken pieces of material, which Adam had smashed, out of curiosity.  
     
      
    31 Having been shown his shirt and the markings on it, the appellant said that he was still wearing his work clothes which were dirty and that when the police arrived, they told him to lie on the ground which was covered in debris. He lay there for some 20 to 25 minutes. He denied smashing what he referred to as ""the disks"" with a hammer or chisel and said that he did not see the plastic bag containing a white powder in the back doorway of the house. He said that he did not believe or think that there were any drugs on the premises and that if he had thought that was the case, he would never have entered the premises. When he noticed his uncle at the premises, he indicated that he would finish his cigarette and come in and see him. He said that he was not the sort of person who would be involved in the trafficking or sale of heroin as he regarded it as filthy and he knew that it would hurt his children and did not like it. 
     
      
    32 Accordingly, the thrust of the appellant's evidence-in-chief was that his presence in the backyard was entirely innocent; that he had no idea what Adam was doing or why; that he certainly did not believe that there were narcotics contained in the disks that Adam was smashing and that he had no idea why Adam was smashing them in the first place. He had only picked up a piece of the broken disks out of curiosity and had not taken any part in the breaking or smashing of them. His explanation for the marks on his clothing was that he had been required to lie down in the debris by the police and the pieces may have marked his clothing as a consequence: in any event, he was in his work clothes which were already dirty. 
     
      
    33 Following an extensive cross-examination of the appellant by the Crown Prosecutor, the latter indicated (at AB 629) to his Honour (in the absence of the jury) that he intended to cross-examine the appellant on what I will refer to as the pension card issue. A question then arose as to whether the leave of the Court was required pursuant to s 112 of the Evidence Act, which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A defendant is not to be cross-examined about matters arising out of evidence of a kind referred to in this Part unless the court gives leave."" 
        
       
      
    34 His Honour acceded to the Crown Prosecutor's submission that s 112 had no application to the present case. In this respect, the Crown Prosecutor informed his Honour that he wished to cross-examine the appellant in relation to the lie that he had told to Centrelink, to the effect that he was separated from his wife and his general preparedness to lie including with respect to the matters in issue which he had, in his evidence-in-chief, denied. 
     
      
    35 Thereafter the Crown Prosecutor continued his general cross-examination of the appellant, which included questions suggesting that he was not telling the truth. He then turned to the question of the carer's pension cards (Exhibit 13) indicating that he proposed asking the appellant questions in relation to them.  
     
      
    36 The following exchange then took place in the presence of the jury between the trial judge, the Crown Prosecutor and trial counsel for the appellant (at AB 652-653): 
     
      
       
        
        ""His Honour: This might raise the questions that I have to deal with in the absence of the jury yesterday Mr Crown? 
        
       
       
        
        Crown: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        Webb: Perhaps a brief adjournment might be of some assistance. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: I don't know that a brief adjournment is necessary. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour Q: I take it what you are doing is claiming privilege in relation to the answers to those questions, is that so? 
        
       
       
        
        [Accused] A. Yes, regarding – I spoke the truth yesterday regarding the pension issue. But now I don't wish to discuss it any more or talk about it. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: Very well. You are not obliged to answer the questions if the answers may incriminate you. 
        
       
       
        
        Webb: Your Honour, I have a brief application which I wish to raise, if I may, in the absence of the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: Very well. I have to ask you to withdraw for a moment ladies and gentlemen."" 
        
       
      
    37 After a short adjournment at the request of trial counsel for the appellant, the trial judge was informed that the appellant was prepared to answer questions relating to the pension card issue which had arisen in his examination-in-chief. Thereafter the Crown Prosecutor proceeded to cross-examine the appellant with respect to this matter and which extended effectively over four pages of transcript (AB 656-661). The thrust of that cross-examination was to establish that the appellant had: lied to Centrelink; had not expected to be questioned about the addresses on the cards; lied to Centrelink because it suited him; lied in his evidence-in-chief when he denied involvement with the flywheels as this suited him; lied as to how he got the red marks on his jeans and that he had in fact broken open the flywheels in order to obtain the drugs that he thought were inside them. The appellant denied that he had lied in respect of any of the factual matters the subject of his evidence-in-chief and, when asked whether he had given evidence honestly in the trial, responded (at AB 659): 
     
      
       
        
        ""I swore on the Holy Koran and I put my hand on the Koran and every word I have uttered in this Court is the truth."" 
        
       
      
    38 Finally, of the nine character witnesses called on behalf of the appellant, three of them were cross-examined with respect to the pension card issue. The first was Madeline Sissine, the appellant's wife who, having given evidence as to the appellant's good character, said that knowledge of the fact that he had falsely advised Centrelink that he was separated from her in order to obtain a carer's pension at a higher rate, did not affect her assessment of his character. The second was Majed Kheir, a solicitor, and a friend and relative of the appellant. In his evidence-in-chief he agreed that the appellant was a person who would take an oath on the Koran very seriously as he was a ""pilgrim"" and that it was his belief that the appellant would not tell lies having sworn on the Koran. It was put to him in chief that he was aware of the issue relating to the appellant obtaining social security benefits to which he was not entitled but he indicated that his knowledge of that fact did not change his view as to the appellant's honesty. Under cross-examination he agreed that he would consider it dishonest for a person to lie to Centrelink in order to falsely obtain a benefit. 
     
      
    39 The third was Bedrieh El-Kheir, the appellant's brother-in-law, who had given evidence as to the appellant's moral character and his honesty. Under cross-examination he indicated that knowledge of the appellant's dealings with Centrelink did not change his view of the appellant's character.  
     
      
    40 The appellant, in oral submissions, divided Ground of Appeal 1 into three sub-paragraphs as follows: 
     
      
     (a) The trial judge erred in determining that the Crown did not require leave to cross-examine the appellant about his evidence of having lied to Centrelink; 
     
      
     (b) The cross-examination of the accused and three of his character witnesses about that issue caused a miscarriage of justice; 
     
      
     (c) The trial judge failed to direct the jury about the use they might make of that evidence. 
     
      
       
      I shall deal with each of these matters seriatim, referring to them as Ground of Appeal 1(a), (b) and (c). 
       
       
      Ground of Appeal 1(a) : requirement for leave 
       
      
    41 The basis upon which the appellant submitted that s 112 of the Evidence Act required the Crown Prosecutor to obtain leave to cross-examine the appellant with respect to the pension card issue was that it was a matter ""arising out of evidence of a kind"" referred to in s 110(2) of that Act. Section 110(1) provides that certain rules do not apply to evidence adduced by a defendant to prove that he is, either generally or in a particular respect, a person of good character. There is no doubt that the appellant had, before he was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor on the pension card issue, adduced evidence to prove that he was (at least generally) a person of good character.  
     
      
    42 However, in the present case the Crown Prosecutor was intending to cross-examine the appellant with respect to his evidence-in-chief that he was, in effect, not a person of good character because he had lied to Centrelink. The appellant submitted that that was evidence of a kind referred to in Part 3.8 of the Act. This was so because of the terms of s 110(2) which, relevantly, provide as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""If evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that a defendant is generally a person of good character has been admitted, the hearsay rule … [does] not apply to evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is not generally a person of good character."" 
        
       
      
    43 Section 110(3) is in similar terms to s 110(2) and relates to the adducing of evidence to prove that the defendant is not a person of good character in a particular respect. 
     
      
    44 The appellant submitted that, albeit accidentally, his trial counsel had adduced evidence-in-chief of his bad character when he responded to questions relating to the different addresses on his carer's pension cards. Accordingly, so it was submitted, he had adduced evidence to prove (directly or by implication) that he was not generally a person of good character. That was evidence of a kind referred to in Part 3.8 of the Evidence Act as a consequence whereof the Crown required leave before it could cross-examine with respect to it. 
     
      
    45 The Crown submitted that leave was not required pursuant to s 112 as Part 3.8 of the Act was directed at situations in which evidence is adduced by a defendant to prove that he or she is, either generally or in a particular respect, a person of good character. When such evidence is adduced, the defendant may not be cross-examined about matters arising out of that good character evidence unless the court grants leave. In deciding whether to grant leave, the court is required to take into account the matters referred to in s 192 of the Act. Those matters only apply if the Crown seeks to introduce evidence of bad character in response to evidence that the accused is of good character. They do not apply when evidence is adduced on behalf of the accused that he is of bad character.  
     
      
    46 There is no doubt that Part 3.8 of the Evidence Act is directed to the adducing of evidence by a defendant with respect to his or her good character as well as to the adducing of rebuttal evidence from the prosecution with some limitations. It is thus tolerably clear that Part 3.8 is directed towards firstly, the removal of restrictions which existed at common law upon the adducing of evidence of general or particular good character by an accused person and, secondly, requiring the prosecution to obtain the leave of the court before the accused is cross-examined with respect to that good character in order to rebut it. 
     
      
    47 The present case is somewhat unique in that the evidence in respect of which the Crown wished to cross-examine was not, on one view of it, the evidence adduced by the appellant of his good character but, on the contrary, of his bad character constituted by the lie that he told to Centrelink. 
     
      
    48 In my opinion, two issues arise for consideration. The first (which was not the subject of any submissions) is whether the evidence, which I have extracted in [28] and [29] above, was adduced to prove that the appellant was not generally a person of good character. The second is whether, it being common ground that the appellant had adduced evidence-in-chief of his good character, the proposed cross-examination by the Crown of his evidence with respect to the pension card issue was cross-examination with respect to a matter arising out of that evidence. In this respect the Crown submitted that it was not seeking by the proposed cross-examination to rebut evidence that the appellant was of good character by introducing evidence of bad character. Rather, it was seeking to cross-examine on evidence already led on behalf of the appellant that indicated his bad character. It was contended that in any event, the appellant's responses-in-chief as to why he agreed that the evidence he had given in relation to the carer's pension cards might not be in his interests, namely because he had sworn on the Koran to tell the truth and he was telling the truth, was itself evidence of good character. In other words, the appellant was utilising the admission by him of social security fraud to demonstrate his candour and truthfulness under oath and as a basis from which the jury could conclude that his evidence regarding the matter with which he was charged was also truthful. 
     
      
    49 As to the first issue referred to in the paragraph above, in my opinion the original evidence (which I have extracted at [26above) was not ""adduced"" within the meaning of s 110(2) as it was not adduced by the appellant or his trial counsel on his behalf with the intention of proving that he was a person of bad character. In Gabriel v The Queen (1997) 76 FCR 279 at 296, Higgins J referred to the decision of this Court in R v Fuller (1994) 34 NSWLR 233, where it was held that the right to adduce evidence of bad character in rebuttal of ""good character"" evidence was confined to situations where evidence was firstly given with the intention of establishing good character. Further, at 295, his Honour expressed the view that for evidence to be ""adduced"", the ""conduct of the accused's case must involve a deliberate decision to give the 'gateway' evidence (whatever it be) as part of his or her case"". Again, at 297 his Honour concluded that the accused could only be regarded as raising good character if it was concluded that it was being done deliberately for that purpose, not inadvertently or incidentally.  
     
      
    50 These expressions of Higgins J were referred to with approval by Mason P and Barr J in their joint judgment in this Court in R v Bartle (2003) 181 FLR 1 at 28-29. Although their Honours accepted that Higgins J in Gabriel had only discussed the issue of the subjective intent involved in the statutory reference to ""adducing"" evidence of good character, the joint judgment agreed with what his Honour had written observing that it was consistent with the approach taken by this Court in Fuller. Accordingly, for evidence of good character to be ""adduced"" within the meaning of s 110 of the Evidence Act, there must be proof of intent in the sense of a conscious decision to raise the issue of the accused's good character. 
     
      
    51 The Crown does not dispute that the evidence elicited by trial counsel for the appellant in the appellant's response, which I have extracted in [26] above, was without any conscious or deliberate decision to elicit evidence of the appellant's bad character. The transcript makes it clear that trial counsel was caught unawares by the answer he received. The problem however is that after an adjournment, two further exchanges took place in the appellant's evidence-in-chief (which I have extracted in [28] and [29] above) which clearly involved a conscious decision to elicit the responses that were obtained. No doubt this was done for justifiable forensic reasons. Having accidentally opened up the issue, it was necessary as a matter of legitimate trial tactics to present it in as good a light as possible. The questions the subject of the exchanges referred to elicited (and no doubt were intended to elicit) the response from the appellant that having been asked a question, he had sworn on the Koran to tell the truth and that was exactly what he was doing notwithstanding that the answer might be harmful to his case. Accordingly, to the extent to which those answers constituted evidence of the good character of the appellant in a particular respect in the sense that he was an honest person who would not lie having taken an oath on the Koran, it was in my opinion evidence of good character to which s 112 applied.  
     
      
    52 The above observations are relevant also to the second issue referred to in [48] above, namely, whether the cross-examination proposed by the Crown Prosecutor with respect to the pension card issue was in rebuttal of the appellant's evidence of his good character. In other words, the utilisation by the Crown Prosecutor of the appellant's evidence with respect to the pension card issue, although perhaps indicative of bad character, was being used for the purpose of rebutting his evidence of good character which had been adduced on his behalf in the cross-examination of some of the Crown's witnesses.  
     
      
    53 That proposition can be tested upon the assumption that the evidence with respect to the pension card issue had not been given by the appellant, but that the Crown Prosecutor was aware that the addresses on the two pension carer's cards were not those of the appellant and had sought to cross-examine the appellant with respect thereto. Although such cross-examination would have been relevant to the appellant's credibility, it would not have been relevant ""only"" to his credibility with the consequence that s 104(2) would have had no application. The appellant conceded as much on the appeal. On the other hand, such a line of cross examination would have been relevant to rebutting the appellant's evidence of good character and, in particular, that he was a person whose honesty was beyond question.  
     
      
    54 As the appellant had put himself forward as a person who would never tell a lie after having taken an oath on the Koran, in my opinion that constituted evidence of good character in a particular respect upon which, if the Crown wished to cross-examine him thereon, it first required leave pursuant to s 112.  
     
      
    55 The Crown's cross-examination was directed, inter alia, to suggest that notwithstanding that the appellant had sworn an oath on the Koran to tell the truth, he was prepared to tell lies whenever it suited him. The questions asked were in my opinion intended to adduce evidence in cross-examination of the appellant in rebuttal of his evidence that he was a person who never told lies and who, having taken an oath on the Koran, would always tell the truth. 
     
      
    56 For the foregoing reasons, in my opinion the trial judge erred in accepting the submission of the Crown that it was entitled to cross-examine the appellant with respect to the pension card issue without first obtaining the Court's leave pursuant to s 112 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
       
      What is the consequence of such leave not having been granted? 
       
      
    57 In Stanoevski v R (2001) 202 CLR 115, the High Court held that in exercising the discretion to grant leave pursuant to s 112 to cross-examine an accused person about his or her character, the court must have regard to the matters contained in s 192(2) which, relevantly includes  
     
      
       
        
        ""(a) the extent to which to [give leave] would be likely to add unduly to … the length of the hearing; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the extent to which to [give leave] would be unfair to a party … 
         
         
        (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which leave is sought."" 
        
       
      
    58 There can be no doubt, and it is not in dispute, that in the event that the trial judge erred in failing to exercise his discretion whether or not to grant leave to the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine pursuant to s 112 of the Act, that error constituted a ""wrong decision"" on a ""question of law"" within the meaning of s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Consequently, the appellant's trial was flawed and his conviction cannot stand unless the Crown can establish that the conviction has not resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    59 In Stanoevski at 129 [56], McHugh J observed that there were  
     
      
       
        
        ""[t]wo ways that are open to the prosecution to show that no miscarriage of justice occurred. First, no miscarriage of justice occurred if the trial judge could not reasonably have refused to grant the prosecution leave to cross-examine the appellant on her claim of good character. Second, no miscarriage of justice occurred if the appellant would have been convicted even if leave to cross-examine had been refused."" 
        
       
      
    60 At 131 [67] Hayne J posed the test in terms of whether the cross-examination which was allowed would inevitably have been permitted had the various matters referred to in s 192 of the Evidence Act been taken into account. 
     
      
    61 The Crown submits that the cross-examination which did take place would inevitably have been permitted had the relevant matters referred to in s 192(2) been specifically adverted to. Given the nature of the cross-examination that took place and its relevant focus on one particular issue, I have no difficulty in concluding that the trial judge would have been acting unreasonably had he considered that the granting of leave to cross-examine would have been likely to add unduly to the length of the hearing.  
     
      
    62 Equally, there could be no doubt that the evidence in relation to which the Crown should have sought leave, was important as it was clear that the appellant was mounting a defence based on his good character and, in particular, that as a consequence he was an honourable and truthful person. Furthermore, trial counsel for the appellant made it clear to his Honour when calling witnesses to depose to the appellant's good character, that the primary issue for the jury depended to a large degree upon the honesty of the appellant in the giving of his evidence. Accordingly, the appellant's evidence going to his attitude to the truth, having sworn on the Koran, thus became a central plank in his defence. In these circumstances, in my opinion it would have been unreasonable for the trial judge to have regarded the evidence in respect of which leave to cross-examine was sought as being other than important. 
     
      
    63 The appellant nevertheless submitted that the granting of leave to cross-examine would have been unfair to him within the meaning of s 192(2)(b) as it would clearly be prejudicial to his defence which concentrated in a significant way on evidence called to establish his good character. That provision refers to the question of unfairness to ""a party"" which, in the present context, includes not only the appellant but also the Crown. Given the evidence which had been adduced by the appellant of his good character and, in particular, of his truthfulness having sworn on the Koran, in my opinion it would have been grossly unfair to the Crown to deny leave to cross-examine the appellant to rebut that evidence.  
     
      
    64 While the appellant submitted that, although it was likely that leave would have been granted, it was not inevitable, I cannot with respect agree. In my opinion the trial judge could not reasonably have refused to grant the prosecution leave to cross-examine the appellant with respect to the pension card issue in order to rebut the evidence adduced by the appellant of his good character. Accordingly, although the appellant's trial was flawed by the legally incorrect decision of the trial judge not to require the prosecution to seek leave pursuant to s 112 of the Evidence Act, in my opinion the Crown has established that the appellant's conviction has not, as a consequence of that flaw, resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    65 Before leaving this ground of appeal I should refer to a submission made by the appellant based upon the exchange between the trial judge and counsel which I have extracted in [36] above. 
     
      
    66 It was submitted that because this exchange took place in the presence of the jury, the informing of the appellant by his Honour that he was not obliged to answer further questions if the answer might incriminate him, was not only prejudicial but also unfair to the appellant, resulting in a mistrial. The basis of this submission is not entirely clear to me although, as I understand it, it is being suggested that because the appellant was warned in the presence of the jury, the latter would assume that the evidence which the appellant had already given with respect to the pension card issue involved him in the commission of a criminal offence. 
     
      
    67 I see no prejudice or unfairness in what occurred. In the first place, the jury would obviously have realised that it was an offence for the appellant to have obtained a benefit from the Department of Social Security to which he was not entitled and which he had obtained by providing false information. Secondly, immediately after the subject exchange took place, and in the absence of the jury, trial counsel (at AB 654) informed his Honour after an adjournment that his client would proceed to answer any questions relating to the pension card issue and, of course, he did so. It would therefore have been more than apparent to the jury that even though the appellant was not required to answer such questions, he had done so voluntarily. In this respect, the jury were unaware that he had received a certificate under s 128. In my opinion, therefore, there is no substance in this complaint.  
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 1(b) : miscarriage of justice in cross-examination 
       
      
    68 As I have observed in [38] and [39] above, the Crown Prosecutor cross-examined three of the appellant's character witnesses with respect to the pension card issue. Although it is now submitted that to permit that cross-examination constituted a miscarriage of justice, it is noteworthy that trial counsel for the appellant took no objection at the time to the questioning. Furthermore, leave to cross-examine those witnesses was not required as s 112 only mandates such leave with respect to the proposed cross-examination of the ""defendant"", in this case the appellant. Again, no application was made to the trial judge to suggest that he should have refused to admit such evidence by seeking the exercise by him of his discretion under s 135 or s 137 of the Act. This is hardly surprising given that any such application would inevitably have been refused.  
     
      
    69 In my opinion, there is no substance in this ground and it should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 1(c) : absence of a jury direction 
       
      
    70 The complaint with respect to this ground of appeal concerns the failure of the trial judge in his summing up to direct the jury as to the use they might make of the evidence of the ""lie"" to the Department of Social Security and the suggestion by the Crown to the appellant that he was a person who was willing to lie when it suited him. It was submitted that it was crucial for the trial judge to have directed the jury that this evidence was admissible only as to the appellant's credit and that they could not use it to engage in propensity reasoning. That is, they could not reason that because the appellant had admitted to defrauding Social Security, this made it more likely that he had committed the offence with which he was charged. 
     
      
    71 His Honour's direction to the jury in his summing up with respect to the appellant's good character evidence was as follows (at AB 805-806): 
     
      
       
        
        ""The accused called evidence to establish that he is a person of good character. That evidence was to the effect that he has no prior criminal convictions and indeed has never previously been charged with a criminal offence, either here or in Lebanon where he spent his early life. You may accept that, if that evidence were not true the Crown would have led evidence to rebut it.  
        
       
       
        
        The accused has also led other evidence to the effect that generally he is a man of good character, particularly in his family and personal relationships and that he is a man who takes his religion seriously.  
        On the other hand it has emerged that he was dishonest in his dealings with the Department of Social Security in relation to a carer's pension for his wife. It is a matter for you to decide whether you think that in any relevant sense the accused is a man of good character 
        . If you think that relevantly to the charge he faces he is a man of good character then you may take that into account in the following way.  
        First of all the fact that he is a person of good character entitles you to consider the improbability of him having committed the offence alleged 
        .  
        In other words you are entitled to take the good character of the accused into account on the question of his guilt 
        . Secondly, the accused has given evidence in this trial. The fact that he is a person of good character would support his credibility. This is a factor which the accused is entitled to have you take into account therefore when deciding whether or not you accept his evidence. None of this, of course, means that good character provides the accused with some kind of defence. It is only one of the many factors which you are to take into account in determining whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. In other words of course people do commit crimes for the first time and evidence of previous good character cannot prevail against evidence of guilt which you find convincing notwithstanding the accused's previous good character."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    72 The portion of the above passage which I have first emphasised comprised the only reference by the trial judge to the pension card issue apart from the following passage towards the end of his summing up where he was relating to the jury the submissions of the Crown and the defence. He said (at AB 837): 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Webb reminded you of the extent to which the accused relies upon his good character in the ways that I have already mentioned you may use that evidence and said in effect that you would not regard as significant the evidence as to obtaining a social security benefit to which he was not entitled. Mr Webb submitted that the accused admitted what he had done to you and that you would regard him as a truthful witness."" 
        
       
      
    73 His Honour had correctly instructed the jury in the portion of his summing up (the second part that is emphasised) that it was entitled to take into account the appellant's good character when considering the improbability of his having committed the alleged offence. Further, he correctly directed the jury that that evidence would support his credibility. The complaint that is made is that, having referred to the fact that he was dishonest in his dealings with the Department of Social Security in relation to the carer's pension for his wife, and that this fact may impact upon whether they considered him to be a man of good character, his Honour did not go on to instruct the jury as to what use they could make of that evidence if they accepted that it negated the evidence of the appellant's good character and established him as a person of bad character. In other words, the only direction that his Honour gave was that the jury in determining whether the appellant was a man of good character could take the pension card issue into account. That direction was then immediately followed by a direction that they were entitled to use the fact that the appellant is a person of good character (if they so found) when considering the improbability of his having committed the alleged offence.  
     
      
    74 By not directing the jury that if they found the appellant was a person of bad character as a consequence of his dishonest dealings with Centrelink, they could only use that evidence when considering the appellant's credibility but could not take it into account on the question of the appellant's guilt. A finding by the jury that the appellant was a person of bad character did not entitle them to consider the probability of his having committed the offence with which he was charged because of that fact. Without such a direction so it was submitted, the jury may well have taken the view that if they found the appellant to be a person of good character, they were entitled to consider the improbability of his committing the offence as charged, and that if they considered him a person of bad character, they were entitled to consider the probability of his committing that offence. 
     
      
    75 Reliance was placed by the appellant upon the decision of this Court in R v Hamilton (1993) 68 A Crim R 298. Hunt CJ at CL, with whom Finlay and Levine JJ agreed with respect to the relevant considerations applicable to the raising of character, commenced his judgment (at 299) by noting that under s 412 of the Crimes Act 1900 evidence of good character may demonstrate that it is unlikely that, as a person of good character, the accused would have done the act charged. As a corollary, the evidence may also support the credibility of a denial by the accused that he or she did the act or did it with the relevant specific intent and hence the unlikelihood of his or her guilt.  
     
      
    76 His Honour then referred to the fact that once character has been raised by the accused, the Crown becomes entitled to elicit or lead evidence of bad character to rebut the evidence of good character upon which the accused relies. That is now subject to provisions such as s 112 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    77 After noting that the admissibility of evidence of bad character is subject to the discretion of the trial judge to exclude it in circumstances now covered by provisions such as s 135, s 137 and s 192 of the Evidence Act, his Honour observed that prejudice is inevitable from the admission of such evidence although mere existence of that prejudice alone will not justify the discretionary exclusion of it. His Honour then continued (at 299-300, omitting citations): 
     
      
       
        
        ""The jury must carefully be directed that the evidence of the accused's bad disposition may be used by them only as rebutting the evidence of good character upon which the accused relies; they must not use it as showing that the accused, as person of bad disposition, was likely to have committed the crime with which he or she has been charged. But no matter how carefully the jury may be directed and no matter how conscientiously they may seek to comply with those directions, it is clear that usually such evidence of bad disposition can be damning to the accused, and that it can significantly reduce any prospect that he or she will be acquitted."" 
        
       
      
    78 Reliance was also placed upon the following passage from the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ, in Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234 at 245: 
     
      
       
        
        ""23. A direction which might have appropriately been given and which would have allayed any concerns which the trial judge may have had in this unusual case, in which the issues may not have been defined as they might have been had the prosecutor made a speech to the jury, is one in these terms: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            'You have heard a lot of questions, which attribute lies to the accused. You will make up your own mind about whether he was telling lies and if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies have in relation to the issues in the case but I give you this warning: do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something, that is evidence of guilt.' 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        24. A direction in such terms may well be adaptable to other cases in which there is a risk of a misunderstanding about the significance of possible lies even though the prosecution has not suggested that the accused told certain lies because he or she knew the truth would implicate him or her in the commission of the offence."" 
        
       
      
    79 The lies to which the above passages from Zoneff refer, related to lies allegedly told by the accused when cross-examined – it was not the Crown's submission that those lies were capable of stemming from a consciousness of guilt. The trial judge was apparently concerned that there was a serious risk that the jury might engage in an impermissible process of reasoning in relation to any lies which had been elicited in cross-examination. He gave a direction which their Honours in the High Court considered inappropriate. The appropriate direction in the circumstances was that which they essayed in [23] of the judgment referred to above. 
     
      
    80 It seems to me that the direction to which Hunt CJ at CL referred in Hamilton, and which I have extracted in [77] above is the type of direction to which the joint judgment was referring in Zoneff with appropriate adaptations. In the present case the trial judge correctly directed the jury that the appellant's dishonest dealings with the Department of Social Security could be taken into account by them when considering whether or not the appellant was a person of good character. That was a very live issue in the trial. His Honour failed to warn the jury that it was not to follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because the appellant had been shown to have been dishonest in his dealings with the Department of Social Security, that that was evidence that could be utilised for the purpose of determining whether he was guilty of the offence charged. That, of course, involved criminality of an entirely different nature to his dishonesty in relation to the pension card issue.  
     
      
    81 The failure to so warn the jury, especially, where the reference to the pension card issue was immediately followed by an instruction that it was open to the jury, if they found the appellant to be a person of good character, to take that into account on the question of his guilt, clearly gave rise to the risk of a misunderstanding by the jury as to the significance of that issue and, in particular, to the risk that they might well consider that any finding by them of bad character, could be taken into account on the question of the appellant's guilt. 
     
      
    82 For the foregoing reasons and in particular, given the juxtaposition by the trial judge in his summing up of his reference to the appellant's dishonest dealings with the Department of Social Security and the use to which the jury could utilise evidence of good character on the question of the appellant's guilt, it became imperative for his Honour to direct the jury that they must not use evidence of bad character, if so found, to show that the appellant was likely to have committed the offence with which he had been charged. 
     
      
    83 The Crown nevertheless submitted that a Hamilton-type direction was unnecessary. It relied upon the following passage from the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in Dhanhoa v The Queen (2003) 199 ALR 547 where at 554 [34], their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is not necessary for a trial judge to give a direction, either of the kind referred to in  
        Edwards 
         or of the kind referred to in  
        Zoneff 
        , every time it is suggested in cross examination or argument, that something that an accused person has said, either in court or out of court, is untrue or otherwise reflects adversely on his or her reliability. Where the prosecution does not contend that a lie is evidence of guilt, then, unless the judge apprehends that there is a real danger that the jury may apply such a process of reasoning, as a general rule it is unnecessary and inappropriate to give an  
        Edwards 
         direction.  
        Zoneff 
         was said to be an unusual case, and the direction there proposed was said to be appropriate where there is a risk of misunderstanding about the significance of possible lies."" 
        
       
      
    84 In their joint judgment, McHugh and Gummow JJ stated the test (at 559 [60]), where an accused's out of court statement is said to be a lie but the Crown does not suggest that the accused has lied because he had a consciousness of guilt, in terms that there is no miscarriage of justice where the trial judge has failed to direct the jury as to the use they can or cannot make of the accused's lies unless the accused establishes that it is a reasonable possibility that the failure to direct the jury ""may have affected the verdict"".  
     
      
    85 The Crown points out, correctly, that no request was made by trial counsel for the appellant to the trial judge that the jury be directed against engaging in propensity reasoning with respect to any evidence of bad character that they might find. It submitted that the position with respect to evidence of bad character should be no different to that with respect to evidence of good character where it is now established that the trial judge is not obliged to direct a jury about an accused's good character, but has a discretion whether or not to do so after evaluating the probative significance of the evidence in relation to both the accused's propensity to commit the crime charged and the accused's credibility: Melbourne v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 1 at 14 [30] per McHugh J; at 57 [157] per Hayne J. 
     
      
    86 I would reject the submission that the principle so articulated in Melbourne is equally applicable to evidence of bad character. As McHugh J points out in Melbourne at 16 [36], the common law has for more than a century drawn a distinction between the admissibility of evidence of good character and the admissibility of evidence of bad character in a criminal trial. As his Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Evidence of good character is readily admitted because it is regarded as tending to prove that the accused is unlikely to have committed the crime in question. Evidence of bad character is admitted only in exceptional circumstances even where the courts regard it as tending to prove that the accused is likely to have committed the crime in question."" 
        
       
      
    87 His Honour then goes on to refer to the development by the common law of strict rules for the admissibility of evidence designed to prove that, by reason of his or her character or propensities, the accused is likely to have committed the crime with which he or she is charged. This is known as propensity evidence and is the subject of specific provisions in the Evidence Act. But what is clear is that evidence of bad character cannot be used by a jury to infer guilt in the substantially less restricted way in which evidence of good character can be used by the jury for the purpose of inferring lack of guilt. 
     
      
    88 In my opinion, given that immediately before the trial judge had specifically directed the jury as to the use they could make of evidence of good character, he had indicated to the jury that, in effect, they could take into account the appellant's dishonest dealings with the Department of Social Security when determining whether he was a man of good character, his Honour should have appreciated that there was a real risk or danger that the jury, if they came to the view that the appellant was not a man of good character, might impermissibly apply to their conclusion that he was a person of bad character, similar reasoning to that which they had been directed they could utilise if they found good character. To adopt the expression of McHugh and Gummow JJ in Dhanhoa, there was a reasonable possibility that the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury that, if they found bad character as a consequence of the pension card issue, they could not use that evidence other than with respect to the appellant's credibility. In particular, they could not take it into account on the question of his guilt in the sense that, because he was a person of bad character, it was more probable that he committed the offence charged.  
     
      
    89 Finally, the Crown submitted that because the evidence relating to the pension card issue had been introduced, albeit accidentally, by the appellant and was thereafter deliberately expanded upon in his evidence-in-chief for the purpose of bolstering his credibility in denying his involvement in breaking open the flywheels to recover their contents, no miscarriage of justice resulted from the failure of the trial judge to give what was referred to as a Hamilton direction.  
     
      
    90 There is no doubt that trial counsel for the appellant sought to turn the issue to the appellant's advantage. In his final address he submitted to the jury that at the end of the day what was important in the trial was whether or not the appellant had been honest with the jury. The following was advanced (at AB 793): 
     
      
       
        
        ""He told you something which you might not think might not otherwise be in his interests but he told you the truth in his evidence and in respect of that matter that is something that you would take into account in my submission in his favour."" 
        
       
      
    91 In the Crown Prosecutor's final address, reference was made (at AB 751) to the volume of evidence about the appellant's character. It was also put to the jury that there was evidence that the appellant provided false information to Centrelink in relation to his carer's pension and that he had lied to Centrelink. The following submission was then made: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I anticipate that the defence will indicate to you that the revelation by the accused of this lie demonstrates his truthfulness, and the Crown suggests that you would reject any such submission. The fact is members of the jury that the accused lied when it suited his purposes, and admitting to a lie does him no credit. The Crown submits to you that you would not use the fact that he lied and then admitted it to find that he is in fact a witness of the truth."" 
        
       
      
    92 There is no doubt that the Crown confined its submissions to the jury with respect to the pension card issue to the contention that that evidence was highly relevant to the appellant's credibility. However, in my opinion, neither that fact nor the fact that trial counsel for the appellant sought to utilise the evidence in order to bolster the appellant's credibility detracts from the risk that the jury unless instructed otherwise may have impersonally considered that they could use any finding by them that the accused was not a person of good character, to reason that it would make it more likely that he had committed the offence charged. That risk I consider to be both real and significant given the juxtaposition by the trial judge in his summing up of the pension card issue and the use that the jury might legitimately make of evidence of good character on the question of the appellant's guilt. The jury unless instructed otherwise, may have impermissibly considered that they could use any finding by them that the accused was not a person of good character to reason that that would make it more likely that he had committed the offence charged. There was at the very least, a reasonable possibility that the jury convicted the appellant because, having found that he was a person of bad character due to his dishonest dealings with Centrelink, it was more probable that he was guilty of the offence with which he was charged.  
     
      
    93 I have already noted that trial counsel for the appellant did not seek a Hamilton direction from the trial judge. Rule 4 therefore applies. In my opinion the overriding duty of his Honour to ensure a trial according to law obligated him, irrespective of whether the direction was sought, to instruct the jury accordingly: BRS v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 275 at 302, 306. The defence case very much depended upon the jury's belief in the honesty of the appellant which in turn depended upon their finding that he was a person of good character. The failure of the trial judge to properly direct the jury resulted in the appellant being denied a real chance of an acquittal and hence a fair trial. In these circumstances, in my opinion, there has been a miscarriage of justice as a consequence whereof leave should be granted pursuant to Rule 4 and this ground of appeal should be upheld. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 2 : the quality of the intercepted recording and the reliability of the opinion evidence expressed in the transcript of that recording were, having regard to the quality of the evidence of voice identification, such that both the recording and the transcript should have been excluded from the trial 
       
      
    94 Given my view with respect to Ground of Appeal 1, it is strictly unnecessary to deal with this or the other grounds of appeal. However, as in my opinion there must be a new trial, it is appropriate that the issues raised by these grounds be determined.  
     
      
    95 There was no objection by trial counsel for the appellant to the tender and admission of either the tape recording or the transcript of that recording so that Rule 4 also applies to this ground of appeal. Nevertheless, the appellant submitted that application should have been made at the end of Dr Gamal's evidence for the recording and transcript to be rejected upon the basis that the transcript in particular was unreliable. The appellant submits that had that occurred, the Crown case would have collapsed.  
     
      
    96 It was common ground that the admission of voice identification evidence was a matter for judicial discretion: Li v The Queen (2003) 139 A Crim R 281 at 290 [61]. It was not in dispute that the transcript was admissible: only that, as a matter of discretion, the trial judge ought to have rejected it upon the basis that it was so unreliable its admission would have been unfairly prejudicial to the appellant: see Evidence Act, ss 135 and 137. 
     
      
    97 Dr Gamal agreed that the soundtrack of the recording was ""very poor"". There was considerable background noise; extended breaks where nothing could be heard at all; words could be heard but not understood; and at times there was insufficient detail in the quality of the soundtrack to form a definite opinion as who was speaking to whom. Furthermore, there were bits and pieces missing in what otherwise may have been a flow of words and there was a complete absence of any visual cues to assist the translator in determining meanings. When asked to rate the quality of the soundtrack out of ten, with zero the lowest and ten the highest, Dr Gamal nominated two. He agreed that at times he was picking up words without context and that without context, meaning in any sense could not be confidently surmised. However, he stated that he was at the listening post and had been briefed (presumably as to the purpose of the exercise) and that certainly at times there was sufficient intonation and context to enable him to understand what was being said. 
     
      
    98 Dr Gamal further indicated that he had no difficulty in identifying between Male 1 (M1) and Male 2 (M2) in that the Arabic of M1 (Adam Kheir) was poor, whereas that of M2 (the appellant) was good. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the quality of the utterances and terms of the recording were poor and that at times the language was such as to be either inaudible or indecipherable. At times there was corruption in the phonemic structure of the speech that made it difficult to understand.  
     
      
    99 The thrust of the cross-examination of Dr Gamal is exemplified in the following exchange (at AB 422-423): 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. …So would it be a fair statement of your evidence that the quality of the sound was so poor that it was frequently difficult and perhaps difficult in any event to understand who was speaking? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That's correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So would it be fair to say that the quality of the sound being so poor made it difficult, firstly, to know what was being said? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And secondly, to be confident as to who it was that said it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That's correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Having said that, it goes without saying I think that it was also very difficult and indeed perhaps even very, very difficult to know who was speaking to whom? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That's correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So it was difficult to know what was being said having regard to the poor quality of the sound track? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It was difficult to discern who was saying it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And it wasn't possible in the circumstances of this operation to know with any certainty as to who was speaking to whom? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That's correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. By way of an example in relation to this last mentioned difficulty as to who was speaking to whom, you would not be in a position to say fairly and squarely whether, for example, some of these utterances of male 1 were said to the other male or another person who may have been at the house? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That's correct."" 
        
       
      
    100 In re-examination Dr Gamal reiterated (at AB 436-437) the nature of the translator's skill and the factors that were taken into account in preparing a transcript. In particular, he referred (at AB 437) to the rewinding of the soundtrack and listening to the same segment ""again and again and again"" in order to prepare an accurate transcript. He said that if he was in any doubt, he would leave a gap or indicate that the sound was either inaudible or untranslatable. However, he was adamant (at AB 438) that between 2.50pm and 2.52pm there were only two voices being those of M1 and M2. 
     
      
    101 The critical part of the transcript is as follows (at AB 982-985):

            I opened one and it turned out to be empty. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Male 2: Maybe the one next to the sofa, I hope so."" 
        
       
      
    102 Much emphasis was placed by both parties on the statement attributed to M2:  
     
      
       
        
        ""No, now they will call me. I know … I want only a little bit and the rest remain with you."" 
        
       
      
    103 Dr Gamal was cross-examined about this statement and accepted that there was a 50% chance that the statement he attributed to M2 was attributable to M1. However, he was adamant that either M1 or M2 (being Adam Kheir or the appellant) made the statement. In this respect the following exchange took place in the re-examination (at AB 438): 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Do you recognise a chance that the other person, Male 1, Adam Kheir, said those words? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I would have to agree with that, because given the quality of the tape, obviously if it's not by Male 2, it would have to be Male 1, simply because there were only two males involved. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were asked some questions about whether, when the transcript denotes ""Male 2"", it's possible that the speaker was in fact Male 1. What possibility do you recognise in that regard? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Again, there is always the possibility, but again, as I said, when I prepared this I signed it and I knew that I would be called to give evidence, be cross-examined on it, so the nature of transcribing is that you only commit to paper what you're so sure of. But, again, I guess life taught me that mistakes do happen. And fatigue, albeit a very unrecognised factor, it does influence the work of interpreters and translators."" 
        
       
      
    104 The Crown's response to the appellant's criticisms based on Dr Gamal's cross-examination, of the transcript's accuracy was to point to Dr Gamal as an experienced interpreter and translator of the Arabic language who had worked for 25 years in that capacity and held a Master of Arts degree in translation and interpreting as well as in applied linguistics and had completed a doctoral thesis in petology. He was accredited at the advance level with the National Accreditation Authority of Translators and Interpreters in interpreting Arabic into English and English into Arabic.  
     
      
    105 There was no doubt that Dr Gamal was able to identify Adam Kheir as M1 and the appellant as M2 in the transcript. He had given evidence as to the problems with the sound recording and the allowances that he had made for that. It was ultimately submitted that the cross-examination of Dr Gamal was relevant not to the admissibility of either the sound recording or the transcript but only to the weight to be given to that evidence: Li at 291 [71]. It was a matter for the jury as to the weight they attached to the transcript and whether they accepted its accuracy, matters in respect of which the trial judge had instructed them in his summing up: eg at AB 811, 819. 
     
      
    106 The trial judge dealt at some length with the circumstantial evidence constituted by the transcript of the sound recording noting (at AB 812) that the only males in the house between 2.40pm and 3.10pm were the appellant and Adam Kheir. He rehearsed (at AB 813-819) Dr Gamal's evidence in detail, which I have summarised above. In fact, his references to Dr Gamal's evidence extended over some 7 pages where he quoted verbatim from the transcript of that cross-examination. Furthermore, in accordance with s 116 of the Evidence Act, the trial judge directed the jury (at 831) that, insofar as the evidence of Dr Gamal identified the appellant as M2 in the sound recording, there was a special need for the jury to exercise caution before accepting that identification evidence.  
     
      
    107 His Honour also directed the jury to exercise special caution in relation to Dr Gamal's evidence. As I understand it, no complaint is made with respect to the various directions given by the trial judge to the jury with respect to the identification evidence the subject of the transcript of the sound recording.  
     
      
    108 The appellant in his written submissions asserted that according to Dr Gamal's evidence there was a 50% chance that he had been mistaken with the voice identification, which would have been sufficient to found an argument for the exclusion of the transcript by reason of its substantially diminished probative value. However, it was quite properly conceded in oral argument that the acknowledgment by Dr Gamal of the 50% chance of error related, firstly, to attributing words to M2 instead of M1 and, secondly, concerned only the words ""No, now they will call me. I know … I want only a little bit and the rest remain with you"". Dr Gamal did not concede a 50% chance of error in relation to the balance of words attributed to M2 in the transcript. 
     
      
    109 The difficulty with the appellant's submission is that even with respect to the statement in respect of which Dr Gamal acknowledged the possibility of a 50% chance of error in attribution, it was common ground that there were only two males present at the relevant time so that the words in question must have been spoken by either M1 or M2, that is, by either Adam Kheir or the appellant. 
     
      
    110 Accordingly, the appellant was forced to submit that if the words in question were properly attributed to M1 (Adam Kheir), they may have been directed not to M2 (the appellant) but to some other person who may have been in the house at the time including, for instance, Salaam Joumaa to whom the original package had been addressed. 
     
      
    111 In my opinion, it was a matter for the jury as to whether the words in question were spoken by M1 or M2 and, if the former, whether they were spoken to M2 or some third party. The chance of error identified by Dr Gamal went to the weight of the evidence and the jury was properly directed by the trial judge who, as I have indicated, made it clear that there was a special need for the jury to exercise caution before they accepted the evidence in question. In any event that part of the transcript in respect of which Dr Gamal acknowledged the chances of a 50% error in attribution was only part of the material in the transcript which the jury was required to take into account. In my opinion it was open to the jury to accept as accurate the balance of the transcript and, in particular, the attribution therein of the various statements to either M1 or M2.  
     
      
    112 Furthermore, if the jury accepted the accuracy of the transcript in that regard, then the various statements attributed to the appellant were consistent with him being more involved in what was occurring than, as he submitted, a mere helper or curious bystander. It was, in fact, further conceded by the appellant that the statements attributed to M2 at and after 2.52pm were at least relevant to the appellant's knowledge of the contents of the flywheels and to the assistance which he was giving to Adam Kheir with respect to their opening.  
     
      
    113 The appellant's final submission was that the admission of the sound recording and its transcript caused a miscarriage of justice in that it was left in an unfairly prejudicial manner to be considered by the jury in support of the Crown case. If by that submission it was being contended that the trial judge should have exercised his discretion and refused to admit the transcript upon the basis that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant (s 137), or that its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the appellant or be misleading or confusing (s 135), then I would respectfully disagree with the proposition that in the circumstances had an appropriate application been made, the trial judge would have been acting unreasonably had he not acceded thereto or, alternatively, was in breach of his duty to ensure a fair trial by failing to exercise his discretion under s 135 and s 137 of his own motion. In my opinion, it was clearly open to the trial judge to decline to exercise his discretion under those provisions.  
     
      
    114 It follows from the foregoing that, in my opinion, leave to rely on Ground of Appeal 2 should be refused. In any event the ground should be rejected on its merits. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 3 : the trial proceedings miscarried by reason of the failure of the trial judge to leave alternative hypotheses of fact, reasonably open on the evidence and consistent with innocence, to the jury. 
       
      
    115 The trial judge's directions to the jury in his summing up with respect to the critical element of attempt to obtain possession was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Before I come to the word 'attempt' it is important that I give you a direction as to the meaning of possession. The essence of the concept of possession in law is that at the relevant time you intentionally have control over the object in question, whether alone or jointly with some other person or persons. Relating to the facts of this case you would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the intention of the accused was to be in a possession (sic) to exercise control over the heroin, either alone or jointly with someone else. The Crown would say Adam Kheir and possibly Salaam Joumaa (sic). In other words, the accused could not be attempting to obtain possession of the heroin merely by helping to break open the flywheels even if he knew what was expected to be in them unless he also expected, alone or jointly with someone else, to be able to exercise control over the heroin found inside. The Crown says you would infer this from the circumstances and of course the accused says he did not participate at all in the breaking of the flywheels. 
        
       
       
        
        As to the meaning of attempt, what the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt is some act by the accused towards committing the crime which was immediately rather than remotely connected with committing that crime  
        and which cannot reasonably be regarded as having any purpose other than to commit the crime 
        . Again the Crown says to you that if you accept the Crown case you would have no difficulty in concluding that the accused was directly involved in breaking open the flywheels, that this constituted an immediate act towards obtaining possession of the heroin which the Crown says you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the accused knew was inside. 
        
       
       
        
        The word 'attempt' in this context has a connotation of both knowledge and intention. That is you would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what the accused did was with knowledge of what he was doing and with the intention to obtain possession for himself, either alone or jointly with someone else, of the heroin which he believed was inside the flywheels."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    116 Towards the end of his summing up, the trial judge summarised what he termed the ""significant issue"" in the case in these terms (at AB 837): 
     
      
       
        
        ""To briefly recap, the significant issue for you in this case is whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable [doubt] that the accused attempted to obtain possession of narcotic goods. Possession in the sense that he was to exercise control over those goods either alone or jointly with somebody else and attempt in the sense that it was an act immediately rather than remotely connected with the crime and that it was accompanied by both knowledge or belief that the fly wheels contained narcotics and an intention to obtain possession of them."" 
        
       
      
    117 After the jury retired and in fact on the following day, they sent a note to the trial judge indicating that they wished further definition of ""possession"" including the aspect of control. In the further directions which followed, the trial judge instructed the jury (at AB 844-845) that 
     
      
       
        
        ""…all you need to be concerned about beyond reasonable doubt is that the accused intended to be able to exercise control over the narcotics, either alone or with others involved with him in the illegal enterprise. I think that is to be contrasted with the situation, for instance that he assisted Mr Adam Kheir to break open the fly wheels even knowing or suspecting what was in them but having no interest whatsoever in whatever they contained. If that were the case then he would not be seeking to obtain physical control over the narcotics in the sense that he would be able to dispose of them either alone or with other persons as he wished. 
        
       
       
        
        If he had no intention of exercising any control over the narcotics at all but was merely assisting Mr Kahir (sic) to open the fly wheels, then he would not be guilty of the charge."" 
        
       
       
      Trial counsel for the appellant took no objection to these directions: nor did he seek any further directions. Rule 4 therefore applies to this ground of appeal. 
       
      
    118 The appellant submitted that it was incumbent upon the trial judge to direct the jury to exclude the possibility that although he knew the contents of the flywheels and was helping to expose the contents, he was not seeking to control the contents. In other words, although the jury had been directed as how they could reason to the appellant's guilt on the element of possession, they had not been directed as to how they could reason to his innocence. 
     
      
    119 In my opinion there is no substance in this complaint. The passage in the summing up which I have extracted and emphasised in [115] above made it clear to the jury that they had to find some act of the appellant that was not explicable otherwise than by having the purpose of committing the crime, that is, seeking control over the contents of the flywheels. His Honour clarified this issue in that part of his summing up extracted in [117] above by directing the jury that if the appellant was merely assisting Adam Kheir to open the flywheels, he would not be guilty of the offence with which he was charged and that he could only be guilty if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he intended to obtain physical control of the contents of the flywheels either alone with some other person, relevantly, Adam Kheir. In my opinion, it was not incumbent upon the trial judge in the circumstances to further direct the jury that they had to exclude the possibility that he was merely helping Adam Kheir and that he was not seeking any control over the flywheels' contents.  
     
      
    120 In my opinion, it was made clear to the jury that if on the evidence they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was doing anything other than merely helping Adam Kheir, then they must acquit. I therefore see no basis for criticising the trial judge's directions on this issue as a consequence whereof I would refuse leave under Rule 4 and, in any event, would reject this ground of appeal on its merits. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 4 : the verdict of guilty was unreasonable having regard to the evidence: s 6(3)  
      Criminal Appeal Act  
      1912 
       
      
    121 The thrust of this ground was that on the evidence, the jury's verdict of guilty was unsafe and unsatisfactory. It was submitted that the appellant was a person of good character; had no criminal record, had a religious and caring nature; had taken a stance upon and counselled against involvement with drugs, and that the marks on his clothing were explicable by the fact that he had carried a bag of red potatoes just prior to the arrival of the Federal Agents and/or they resulted from the fact that he was required to lie face-down on the concrete pathway where there were pieces of broken flywheel. These matters were of such weight, so it was submitted, as to justify the conclusion that the jury, acting reasonably, could not have rejected as a rational inference the possibility that the appellant although present when Adam Kheir was smashing the flywheels, did not take part in that activity and was merely a curious observer or helper.  
     
      
    122 It is unnecessary to trace in any detail through the evidentiary material on which this submission was based. It was submitted by the appellant that without the transcript the Crown had no case. However I beg to differ. Although the transcript was important to the Crown's circumstantial case, the marks on the appellant's clothing were of equal significance. In this respect, the photographs which were in evidence, of that clothing and in particular, of the jeans which the appellant was wearing at the time, did not accurately provide a true picture of the state of the marks on them. The Court viewed carefully the original exhibit being the appellant's jeans which established, at least to me, that: firstly, the marks on the jeans were clearly from the flywheels; secondly, that those marks could not have been caused by the appellant merely lying on top of pieces of the smashed flywheels; and thirdly, that the appellant had clearly been holding the flywheels between his legs for his jeans to have become marked in the manner and to the extent observed. In my opinion, no other explanation is plausible, particularly that advanced by the appellant, namely, that the marking occurred when he was required by the Federal Agents to lie face down on the ground. Accordingly, it was clearly open to the jury to accept beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had actively participated in the smashing of the flywheels. 
     
      
    123 The appellant also relied upon the fact that his fingerprints were not found on the packaging of the flywheels or the tools that were used to dismantle them. However, in my opinion the Crown is correct when it submits that the absence of the appellant's fingerprints on the items seized by the Federal Agents did not indicate absence of involvement in the breaking of the replica flywheels. It was common ground that the flywheels had been painted and covered in grease that caused the paint to break down and to adhere to the hands and clothing of any person who came into contact with them. When the Federal Agents entered the backyard the appellant's hands were observed to be greasy, dirty and marked with paint from the flywheels. The evidence was that greasy and dirty hands would deposit too much oil on a surface to leave an identifiable fingerprint. Accordingly, in these circumstances, it was unsurprising that the appellant's fingerprints were not found on the flywheels or the tools that were used to dismantle them. 
     
      
    124 On the other hand, the marks on the appellant's clothing and hands in combination with the transcript of the recorded conversations with Adam Kheir, as well as his presence on the back steps amidst the tools, the controlled delivery sample and the broken pieces of replica flywheel, provided, as the Crown submitted, ample evidence of the appellant's participation in the enterprise.  
     
      
    125 The appellant further submitted that there were knocking and tapping sounds a considerable time before he arrived at the house, which suggested that the possession of the heroin was being attempted before the appellant was even at the scene. There is no doubt that Adam Kheir was a heroin addict and that it was he who had the principal interest in gaining access to the flywheels' contents. However, the fact that he attempted to do so before the appellant arrived does not, in my opinion, detract from the evidence which it was open to the jury to accept that the dismantling procedure intensified after the appellant's arrival and in his presence. 
     
      
    126 The appellant further submitted that the case against him ultimately depended on the questionable identification of his voice and the transcript of the conversations prepared by Dr Gamal, this being the only evidence purporting to link the appellant to the smashing of the flywheels. However, for reasons already referred to, I do not agree that the Crown's case was wholly dependent upon this. Certainly, the transcript was of significance to the Crown's case but it also very much depended upon the marks on the clothing and hands of the appellant, his presence in the backyard between 2.50pm and 3.25pm and his position on the back steps at the time the Federal Agents arrived.  
     
      
    127 Finally, the appellant submitted that the jury were not directed that they had to exclude as a reasonable hypothesis that Adam Kheir was attempting to possess the heroin solely for himself. Nor were they directed that they had to exclude as a reasonable hypothesis that Adam Kheir was attempting to possess the heroin jointly with Salaam Joumaa (to whom the packages were addressed) to the exclusion of the appellant. It was submitted that these alternative hypotheses, which had a basis in the evidence and which were consistent with the appellant's innocence, should have been the subject of a specific direction from the trial judge. 
     
      
    128 His Honour directed the jury that the Crown was required to establish that the appellant attempted to obtain exclusive or joint possession of the narcotic goods. I have already set out his Honour's directions in this regard in [115] above. Further, his Honour directed the jury in these terms (at AB 813): 
     
      
       
        
        ""What you do need to be satisfied about beyond reasonable doubt in relation to the issue of whether the accused attempted to obtain possession is whether the circumstantial facts proved to your satisfaction, convinced you beyond reasonable doubt, that the element of the charge has been proved  
        in the sense that there is no other rational explanation for what occurred other than that the accused is guilty 
        ."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    129 I have also previously referred to the further directions given by the trial judge to the jury with respect to the issue of possession or attempted possession in [117] above. In my opinion these various directions and, in particular, the parts thereof which I have emphasised made it clear to the jury that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to exercise control over the contents of the flywheels in the sense that there was no other rational explanation for what he was doing such as that he was merely assisting Adam Kheir to open them. As the Crown submitted, it was implicit in these directions that sole possession by Adam Kheir or joint possession by Adam Kheir and another person apart from the appellant, would not support a verdict of guilty. In my opinion, no further directions were required and I would reject the appellant's challenge to the summing up which submits to the contrary. 
     
      
    130 It follows from the foregoing that, in my opinion, the verdict of the jury was both reasonable and supportable having regard to the evidence as a whole. Accordingly, this ground should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    131 Notwithstanding my rejection of Grounds of Appeal 2, 3 and 4, the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury as to the use they might make of evidence of bad character in the event they came to the conclusion as a consequence of the pension card issue that the appellant was of such a character, constituted a miscarriage of justice to which, in my opinion, the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act does not apply.  
     
      
    132 Much of the Crown case depended upon allegations which the appellant on oath denied and which he sought to support by evidence of his good character. The Crown sought to negate that evidence by reference to the pension card issue and, in particular, to use that material to attack the appellant's credit upon which his defence in large measure relied. In that part of the trial judge's directions to the jury which I have extracted at [71] above, there was in my opinion a significant possibility that if the jury determined that the appellant was not a person of good character, it would seek to use that conclusion as entitling them to consider the probability of the appellant having committed the subject offence. His Honour's failure to properly direct the jury in relation to the use which it might make of any finding of bad character resulted in the loss by the appellant of ""a fair chance of acquittal by the failure to afford him the trial to which he was entitled, that is to say, a trial in which the relevant law was strictly followed"": Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 372. The loss of the chance of acquittal cannot be other than a substantial miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    133 Accordingly, I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
     (1) Appeal against conviction allowed. (2) The conviction and sentence of the appellant be quashed and that there be a new trial.134 HOEBEN J: I agree with Tobias JA

       (viii) Three charges of supplying a prohibited drug. 
        
       
      
     13 Judge Finnane sentenced the applicant for the twenty-seven offences on 7 December 2001. On 23 January 2002 and 25 October 2002 his Honour corrected what appeared to him to be errors in the sentences he had earlier pronounced. On 25 October 2002 his Honour set a non-parole period for each of the sentences he had earlier imposed. The sentences his Honour ultimately imposed were:- 
      
       
        
       (i) On each of the three charges of homosexual intercourse with a male person under the age of ten years (counts 8, 9 and 10), a sentence of imprisonment of fifteen years with a non-parole period of seven and a half years. 
        
        
       (ii) On each of the eleven charges of homosexual intercourse with a male person between the ages of ten and eighteen years (counts 3, 4, 5, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22), a sentence of imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of six years. 
        
        
       (iii) On the charge of sexual intercourse with a person between the ages of ten and sixteen years (count 16), a sentence of imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of four years six months. 
        
        
       (iv) On each of the two charges of attempted homosexual intercourse with a male person between the ages of ten years and eighteen years (counts 13 and 14), a sentence of imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of one and a half years. 
        
        
       (v) On each of the two charges of indecent assault (counts 2 and 11), a sentence of imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of one and a half years. 
        
        
       (vi) On each of the two charges of an act of indecency within s 61E(2) (counts 1 and 7), a sentence of imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of one and a half years and on the charge of inciting an act of indecency within s 61E(2) (count 23) a sentence of imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of two years three months. 
        
        
       (vii) On each of the two charges of inciting an act of indecency within s 61N (counts 24 and 25), a sentence of imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of two years three months. 
        
        
       (viii) On each of the three charges of supplying a prohibited drug (counts 6, 26 and 27), a sentence of imprisonment for one year with a non-parole period of nine months. 
        
       
      
     14 It can be seen immediately that the sentences his Honour imposed for the two offences of an act of indecency within s 61E(2) were equal to the maximum sentence and that the sentences his Honour imposed for the three offences of inciting an act of indecency (within s 61E(2) or s 61N) exceeded the maximum sentence. 
      
       
      
     15 His Honour made most of the sentences he imposed commence from 10 November 1997, the date on which the applicant had been taken into custody and from which he had remained in custody. However, his Honour provided for a partial accumulation of sentences, by making the sentence on count 5 for homosexual intercourse with SD commence on 9 November 2003, that is on the expiration of the non-parole period of the sentences on counts 3, 4, 12, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22; by making the sentence on count 17 for homosexual intercourse with DH commence on 8 November 2009, that is (ignoring the odd day) on the expiration of the non-parole period of the sentence on count 5; and by making the sentences on counts 8, 9 and 10 for homosexual intercourse with GD commence on 10 November 2012, that is (again ignoring the odd day) half way through the non-parole period of the sentence on count 17. 
      
       
      
     16 The total effect of the sentences imposed by his Honour was that his Honour imposed sentences totalling thirty years commencing on 10 November 1997 and expiring on 9 November 2027, with non-parole periods totalling twenty-two and a half years commencing on 10 November 1997 and expiring on 9 May 2020. 
      
       
        
       CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS 
        
       
      
     17 Among the documents before Judge Finnane was a chronology prepared by the Crown and it is convenient to refer to some of the events included in the chronology. 
      
       
      
     18 On 21 August 1987 three police officers went to the applicant’s home, searching for a fugitive named Wain. At the applicant’s home the police found pornographic videos of young boys. The sum of $40,000 was paid to the police officers, in consideration of no charges being brought against the applicant or Wain. A young boy, who was at the applicant’s home when the police arrived, was told by the police to leave the premises. 
      
       
      
     19 In March 1989 the applicant left New South Wales, after learning that one of the police officers who had come to his home on 31 August 1987 and two other individuals had been arrested and charged with supplying the prohibited drug amphetamine. In October 1989 the applicant was arrested in Victoria on a charge of conspiring to supply amphetamine and was extradited to New South Wales.  
      
       
      
     20 The applicant offered to assist in a prosecution of the three police officers for their conduct in 1987 and on 15, 16 and 17 January 1990 police conducted a long interview of the applicant. After the applicant had been interviewed, criminal charges were brought against the three police officers.  
      
       
      
     21 On 3 April 1990 the Attorney-General granted an indemnity to the applicant pursuant to s 13 of the  
     Criminal Procedure Act 
     , as then in force. The indemnity recited that the applicant was required as a witness in the proceedings against the three police officers for the offences allegedly committed by them and by the indemnity the Attorney-General undertook “that no criminal proceedings in the nature of the offences aforesaid or any associated offences,” should be taken against the applicant in relation to any part by him in the commission of the offences by the three police officers. 
      
       
      
     22 On 28 May 1990 the applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Court in the District Court for two offences of supplying a prohibited drug and supplying not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, to which he had pleaded guilty. The applicant was sentenced by Judge Court to concurrent terms of imprisonment of three years, with minimum terms of two years three months. In sentencing the applicant Judge Court took into account assistance provided by the applicant to the police, as set out in a letter from the Police Department, that he had supplied valuable information involving three police officers who had extorted the sum of $40,000 from a child molester without preferring any charges. 
      
       
      
     23 In August 1990 committal proceedings against the three police officers commenced. The applicant gave evidence in the committal proceedings and at the conclusion of the committal proceedings the three police officers were committed for trial. 
      
       
      
     24 On 15 August 1990 during the committal proceedings the Attorney-General gave the applicant an undertaking pursuant to s 14 of the  
     Criminal Procedure Act 
     , as then in force. In the undertaking it was recited that criminal proceedings were pending against the three police officers for offences arising out of the receipt of a sum of money which had been withdrawn from the applicant’s bank account on or about 21 August 1987 and that the applicant was required as a witness in those criminal proceedings. By the undertaking the Attorney-General undertook that any answer given or any disclosure made by the applicant in the proceedings against the police officers would not be used in evidence against the applicant. 
      
       
      
     25 On 18 January 1992 the applicant was released from prison, having served the minimum terms of the sentences imposed by Judge Court. 
      
       
      
     26 The trials of the three police officers (two separate trials were ordered) took place between March and May 1994. The applicant gave evidence at both trials. All of the police officers were acquitted. 
      
       
      
     27 Although all the police officers were acquitted, Judge Finnane said in his remarks on sentence:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The offender (that is the applicant) clearly was involved in 1987 as the victim of an extortion attempt by three former police officers. These three were ultimately acquitted but it seemed quite plain that there was evidence that they extorted a large sum of money from him and a man called Wain to protect them from prosecution for offences involving child sex, in particular offences with boys”. 
         
        
       
      
     28 No charges were laid against the applicant while the proceedings against the police officers were pending, although police clearly had information suggesting that the applicant had committed child sexual assault offences. It is apparent from passages in a judgment of Judge Davidson of the District Court given on 3 September 1999 to which we will subsequently refer in more detail, that law enforcement authorities considered that, if the applicant was himself prosecuted, he might decline to give evidence against the police officers and that there was also continuing controversy within the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions concerning the scope of the protection against prosecution afforded to the applicant by the indemnity and the undertaking which had been given by the Attorney-General. 
      
       
      
     29 On a number of occasions between April 1995 and November 1995 the applicant was interviewed by investigators of the Royal Commission conducted by Justice Wood. In December 1995 the applicant left Australia for Indonesia. In March 1996 the applicant failed to appear in response to a summons to give evidence before the Royal Commission. 
      
       
      
     30 In February 1996 and April 1996 police came into possession of video tapes showing the applicant committing many of the offences with which he was subsequently charged. 
      
       
      
     31 On 10 November 1997 the applicant was arrested in Honduras. After he was arrested he was taken to the United States. The applicant was extradited from the United States and he returned to Australia on 31 March 1998. After he returned to Australia he was charged with a large number of offences, which broadly corresponded to the offences for which he was later sentenced by Judge Finnane, together with a further eleven offences involving another complainant to whom we will refer as K. 
      
       
      
     32 The applicant brought proceedings for a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings against him. His application for a stay was heard and determined by Judge Davidson in the District Court. His Honour delivered a reserved judgment on 3 September 1999.  
      
       
      
     33 In his judgment Judge Davidson indicated that two principal submissions had been made on behalf of the applicant in support of his application for a stay of the criminal proceedings, namely:- 
      
       
      
     34 (1) Police officers and Crown Prosecutors had by their conduct “allowed the applicant to give evidence for the State (in the prosecution of the three police officers) on the basis that he believed after discussion with them that he was fully immune from prosecution” and “failed to inform the applicant, before he gave evidence at the committal and at the two trials, that there was a risk that he would be charged”. 
      
       
      
     35 (2) On a proper construction of the indemnity and the undertaking the applicant was fully indemnified for any offence alleged to have been committed by him before he last provided assistance by giving evidence or, alternatively, before the indemnity and the undertaking were signed by the Attorney-General. Of particular relevance to this second principal submission was the proper construction of the expression “any associated offences” in the indemnity of 3 April 1990. 
      
       
      
     36 With regard to submission (1), Judge Davidson held, on the basis of a number of parts of the evidence which had been adduced before him, that the applicant had failed to establish that he had had a belief that he was immune from being prosecuted and that “there is a strong body of evidence that he was well aware that he might be charged with offences arising out of his paedophilic activities before he gave any substantial evidence in any of the proceedings against X and Y or Z (the police officers)”. 
      
       
      
     37 With regard to submission (2), Judge Davidson held that on the proper construction of the indemnity of 3 April 1990 the applicant was protected from prosecution for the offences allegedly committed by him against the complainant K but was not protected from prosecution for any of the other alleged offences. 
      
       
      
     38 Accordingly, Judge Davidson stayed the prosecution of the applicant on the eleven charges involving the complainant K but not on any of the other charges. On 15 May 2000 an appeal by the applicant against Judge Davidson’s decision was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal and on 16 February 2001 an application by the applicant for special leave to appeal to the High Court was refused. 
      
       
        
       THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE JUDGE FINNANE 
        
       
      
     39 The proceedings before Judge Finnane were protracted, commencing on 25 June 2001, continuing on 26 June 2001 and being resumed on various subsequent dates up to 7 December 2001, when Judge Finnane pronounced the sentences he was passing on the applicant. As previously noted, on two subsequent occasions Judge Finnane corrected what appeared to his Honour to have been errors in the sentences he had imposed on 7 December 2001. 
      
       
      
     40 In his remarks on sentence of 7 December 2001 Judge Finnane said that none of the delays which had occurred in the proceedings on sentence up to 5 November 2001 were in any way attributable to the applicant. Part of the delay which had occurred had been caused by the sentencing judge himself seeking information about sentences imposed on other child sexual assault offenders and particularly an offender named Michael Hill. 
      
       
      
     41 The Crown case on sentence included:- 
      
       
        
       A. A statement of the facts of the offences. 
        
        
       B. A criminal history of the applicant, which showed that he had not previously been convicted of any offence, apart from the offences for which he was sentenced by Judge Court. 
        
        
       C. A bundle of statements by the complainants. 
        
        
       D. A video, which was a compilation of a number of the videos referred to in the statement of facts, showing sexual activity by the applicant with a number of the complainants and also showing Michael Hill himself videoing what the applicant was doing. 
        
        
       E. Sentencing statistics. 
        
        
       F. A letter from the Police Department about the assistance the applicant had provided in the prosecution of the three police officers, being the same letter as had been before Judge Court when he sentenced the applicant for the drug offences. 
        
        
       G. A report by a forensic psychiatrist dated 21 July 2001 relating to one of the complainants, in which the psychiatrist found that the complainant had a personality disorder and a substance dependency syndrome but that “it is difficult to say with any certainty to what degree his (the complainant’s) current traits are a result of his association with Mr Dunn”. 
        
        
       H. A number of documents relating to the sentencing of Michael Hill. 
        
       
      
     42 The applicant did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence. Two documents were admitted into evidence in the defence case in the proceedings on sentence, namely:- 
      
       
        
       1. An appraisal of the psychological condition of the applicant dated 30 November 2001, which had been prepared by a forensic psychologist Thomas Benjamin. 
        
        
       2. A character reference for the applicant by a Marist brother. 
        
       
      
     43 The legal representation of the applicant changed during the proceedings on sentence. Up until 7 November 2001 the applicant was represented by Mr McCrudden of counsel. From 7 November 2001 to 16 November 2001 the applicant was represented by Mr Meltzer of counsel and from 16 November 2001 to 7 December 2001 the applicant was represented by Dr Gumbert of counsel. 
      
       
      
     44 From time to time in the proceedings on sentence counsel who was then appearing for the applicant foreshadowed an application for leave to withdraw the applicant’s pleas of guilty or actually made an application to withdraw the pleas of guilty. Whenever such an application was actually made, Judge Finnane refused the application. A written application for leave to withdraw the pleas of guilty was filed before the hearing on 7 December 2001 but at the beginning of the hearing on 7 December 2001 counsel for the applicant withdrew the application. Subsequently at the hearing on 7 December 2001 counsel for the applicant said that the applicant had maintained pleas of not guilty, only for so long as the matters raised in his application for a stay had remained undetermined, and counsel urged the sentencing judge to take into account the applicant’s pleas of guilty in sentencing the applicant. 
      
       
        
       PROCEEDINGS IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
        
       
      
     45 There was considerable delay in the appeal and the applications coming before the Court of Criminal Appeal for hearing.  
      
       
      
     46 On 2 May 2003 the Court Registry received written submissions from Mr Stratton of senior counsel, which were limited to submissions for the applicant on his application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on him by Judge Finnane. 
      
       
      
     47 In July 2003 the Court Registry received written submissions dated 7 July 2003 which had been prepared by the applicant himself and which were divided into three parts, dealing, respectively, with an application by the applicant for an inquiry under Pt 13A of the  
     Crimes Act 
     , his appeal against conviction and his application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on him. 
      
       
      
     48 In October 2003 the Court Registry received further written submissions dated 15 October 2003, which had been prepared by the applicant himself and which dealt with the conviction appeal and with the application for leave to appeal against the sentences. 
      
       
      
     49 On 12 July 2004 the Court Registry received further written submissions prepared by the applicant himself, which dealt with the application for an inquiry, the appeal against conviction and the application for leave to appeal against the sentences. 
      
       
      
     50 On the final page of the applicant’s written submissions of July 2004 the applicant said that, because of the state of his health, he would not be attending the hearing before the Court of Criminal Appeal. The applicant annexed to his submissions a medical report dated 9 January 2004, stating that the applicant has a long history of cardiac problems and that he also has an auto-immune disease manifested by severe Raynard’s disease. In the report the medical officer expresses the opinion that the applicant’s “long term prognosis for longevity is poor”. 
      
       
      
     51 The applicant did not attend the hearing in the Court of Criminal Appeal. Mr Stratton of counsel did appear on his behalf and made submissions to the Court in support of the application for leave to appeal against sentence, but not otherwise. 
      
       
      
     52 Written submissions on the appeal against conviction and the application for leave to appeal against sentence were lodged by the Crown and counsel for the Crown orally addressed the Court of Criminal Appeal with respect to both the convictions and the sentences. 
      
       
        
       APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION 
        
       
      
     53 It is convenient to deal first with the appeal against conviction. 
      
       
      
     54 In written submissions which the applicant himself prepared six grounds of appeal against conviction can be distinguished. Some of these grounds of appeal were not precisely formulated by the applicant in his written submissions but it would appear that the grounds of appeal can be stated as follows:- 
      
       
        
       1. The applicant was deceived into making the pleas of guilty. 
        
        
       2. The applicant was induced to plead guilty by the Crown proposing to tender, as evidence in any trial of the applicant, videos which would not have been properly admissible against the applicant. 
        
        
       3. The decision of Gallop J of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capitol Territory in  
       R v Tilley 
        (1992) 109 FLR 155 precluded the conviction of the applicant. 
        
        
       4. Judge Finnane was not impartial, because of an association between his Honour and a television channel (Channel 9), and should have disqualified himself. 
        
        
       5. Prejudicial publicity about the applicant before the hearing “fatally compromised” the Crown case against the applicant. 
        
        
       6. The applicant had been unlawfully brought to New South Wales by being unlawfully expelled from Honduras and then being unlawfully extradited from Florida in the United States of America. 
        
       
      
     55 As already stated at the beginning of this judgment, the applicant pleaded guilty to all twenty-seven counts on 26 June 2001 and these pleas of guilty were never withdrawn at any time during the proceedings before Judge Finnane. Before this Court could entertain the applicant’s appeal against conviction, the Court would have to grant leave to the applicant to withdraw his pleas of guilty. The Court could grant leave to the applicant to withdraw the pleas of guilty, if not to grant leave to withdraw the pleas would involve a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
      
     56 In  
     R v Davies 
      (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 16 December 1993) Badgery-Parker J, with whose judgment the other members of the Court agreed, in a passage in his Honour’s judgment which has often subsequently been quoted or referred to with approval (for example in  
     R v Toro-Martinez 
      (2000) 114 A Crim R 533 at 538 (26) per Spigelman CJ), said at p 8:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The test is whether the circumstances revealed a miscarriage of justice. The need to accord finality to a plea of guilty because of its status as a solemn admission of all of the ingredients of the offence is postulated upon knowledge by the person entering that plea of all the facts…. and it is not necessary to be accorded such finality if there are circumstances which indicate that the plea ‘was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt’… If the integrity of the plea is bona fide questioned because it appears that the person who entered that plea was not in possession of all the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt, then in my opinion the plea of guilty ought to be set aside and a new trial ordered if (but only if, and the onus lies on the appellant) it is clear that there is… ‘an issuable question of guilt’ – to put it more simply, if there is a real question to be tried. If the plea was not entered into with full knowledge of the facts and as a genuine recognition of guilt, and if the material before the Court of Criminal Appeal shows that there is a real question about the guilt of the accused, then the proper course must be to set aside the plea of guilty, to quash the conviction, and to order a new trial”. 
         
        
       
      
     57 In  
     R v Boag  
     (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 Hunt CJ at CL, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, said at p 37:- 
      
       
        
         
         “A miscarriage of justice may occur in many different situations if a prisoner is not permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty. Such a miscarriage will be established not only where the applicant did not appreciate the nature of the plea which he had entered but also, for example, if there was no evidence upon which he could have been convicted, or if he had not intended to admit that he was guilty or if his plea had been induced by fraud or threats or other impropriety, when he would not otherwise have pleaded guilty… As Badgery-Parker J said in  
         Davies 
          (at p 8), there must be shown to be some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt…. The requirement that a miscarriage of justice be demonstrated before leave is granted to withdraw a plea is well settled in the authorities to which I have referred”. 
         
        
       
      
     58 In  
     R v Bayliss  
     [2002] NSWCCA 11 the Court said at (12):- 
      
       
        
         
         “Finally, as a matter of clear legal principle, we observe that since it is the appellant who contends that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, he bears the onus of demonstrating that fact… To the extent to which this depends upon a resolution of matters of fact, he bears the onus of establishing the necessary facts…” 
         
        
       
      
     59 As we have already indicated, the applicant’s pleas of guilty were entered on 26 June 2001 and remained in effect during a sentence hearing which extended over almost six months and in which the applicant was continuously legally represented, albeit by a succession of counsel. At the hearing on 7 December 2001 counsel for the applicant told the court that an application which had been filed for leave to withdraw the pleas of guilty was itself being withdrawn and counsel urged Judge Finnane to take into account the applicant’s pleas of guilty in sentencing the applicant. 
      
       
      
     60 There was no suggestion in the applicant’s written submissions that he did not appreciate the nature of a plea of guilty or that he did not intend to plead guilty or that there was any charge in respect to which there was no evidence on which he could have been convicted. 
      
       
      
     61 The only offences as to which there is any suggestion in the applicant’s written submissions that the applicant might not have been guilty are the offences charged in counts 8, 9 and 10 of the indictment of homosexual intercourse with a male person under the age of ten years, and the only suggestion made in the applicant’s written submissions about these offences is that the complainant might not have been under the age of ten years at the time of the commission of the offences. 
      
       
      
     62 According to the applicant’s written submissions, the Crown, in order to prove when it was that the offences charged in counts 8, 9 and 10 had been committed and, hence, that they had been committed when the complainant was under the age of ten years, relied on a video-audio tape recording, which showed the applicant committing a sexual act with the complainant and in which a radio broadcast could be heard, which could be dated to November 1986. The applicant says in his written submissions that he asserted to his lawyer that the video tape showing the applicant and the complainant had been contaminated by the addition to it of an audio recording of the radio broadcast. 
      
       
      
     63 This assertion made by the applicant in his written submissions, unsupported by any evidence, is insufficient to discharge the onus which rests on the applicant to establish that there is a real question about his guilt on any of the charges or that his pleas of guilty were not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt. 
      
       
      
     64 In the first ground of appeal against conviction the applicant alleges that he was deceived into making the pleas of guilty. In his written submissions the applicant alleges that counsel then appearing for the applicant told the applicant that counsel had made a plea bargain with the prosecution, that, if the applicant pleaded guilty to all the offences charged, the prosecution would seek sentences much more lenient than those ultimately imposed. If there was any evidence of these allegations, then it might be arguable that the applicant’s pleas of guilty were induced by some impropriety. However, there is no evidence before this Court of the making of any such plea bargain or of any such conversation between the applicant and his counsel. Furthermore, even if there was such evidence, we would not accept that the applicant would not otherwise have pleaded guilty to the charges. 
      
       
      
     65 As regards the second ground of appeal against conviction, the applicant alleges in his written submissions that the Crown agreed, during the pendency of the applicant’s application for a stay of the criminal proceedings against him, that the Crown would not use in the prosecution of the applicant any evidence which police had obtained before 1994 and that the Crown, in breach of the agreement, proposed to use as evidence against the applicant in any trial of the applicant, videos which had been compiled by combining extracts from videos which had been obtained by the police before 1994. There is no evidence before this Court to support the applicant’s allegation about the provenance of the videos which the Crown proposed using as evidence in any trial of the applicant. It was the Crown case that police had not obtained the videos the Crown proposed using as evidence until some time in 1996, and the Crown case was supported by evidence from a police officer. 
      
       
      
     66 As to the third ground of appeal against conviction, the decision of Gallop J in  
     R v Tilley 
      was simply a decision, on the particular facts in that case, that a stay of criminal proceedings should be ordered on the ground that the proceedings were an abuse of process. The decision in  
     R v Tilley 
      does not create any precedent and could not give rise to any ground of appeal against the applicant’s convictions. 
      
       
      
     67 As to the fourth ground of appeal against conviction Judge Finnane disclosed during the proceedings on sentence that he had once had some professional association with Channel 9, and that he had communicated with Channel 9 about the proposed showing by Channel 9 of a programme about the applicant during the pendency of the proceedings on sentence. No application was made to Judge Finnane that he should disqualify himself and his Honour was not obliged to disqualify himself. 
      
       
      
     68 The last two grounds of appeal sought to be relied on by the applicant, even if the factual matters on which they are based were established, could not amount to valid grounds of appeal against conviction. 
      
       
      
     69 We conclude that this Court should not grant leave to the applicant to withdraw his pleas of guilty and, accordingly, the applicant’s appeal against conviction is dismissed. 
      
       
        
       THE APPLICATION FOR AN INQUIRY UNDER Pt 13A OF THE CRIMES ACT 
        
       
      
     70 In his written submissions and particularly in his written submissions of July 2003 the applicant listed and developed a number of grounds for this Court to order such an inquiry. 
      
       
      
     71 An application by the applicant for an inquiry under Pt 13A of the  
     Crimes Act 
      has already been referred to a single judge of the Supreme Court pursuant to the provisions of s 474 0 of the  
     Crimes Act, 
      which provides that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Pt 13A of the Act is to be exercised by the Chief Justice or by a judge of the Supreme Court who is authorised by the Chief Justice to exercise that jurisdiction. That judge has, pursuant to s 474E(3A) of the  
     Crimes Act 
     , deferred consideration of the application, pending the determination of the applicant’s appeal against conviction and application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
      
       
      
     72 The Court of Criminal Appeal is a statutory court, having only such jurisdiction as is conferred on it by statute. The jurisdiction conferred on the Court of Criminal Appeal does not include jurisdiction to consider an application for an inquiry under Pt 13A of the  
     Crimes Act 
     . This Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the application for an inquiry and the applicant, if so minded, will have to ask the single judge of the Supreme Court who has been authorised to exercise the jurisdiction of the Court in relation to the earlier application for an inquiry to resume his consideration of that application. 
      
       
        
       APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE 
        
       
      
     73 On 7 December 2001 Judge Finnane delivered lengthy remarks on sentence. We will now refer to certain aspects of his Honour’s remarks on sentence. 
      
       
      
     74 In the remarks on sentence his Honour referred to the statement by the complainant SD. SD first met the applicant, when he was twelve or thirteen years old. The applicant invited SD to come to the applicant’s home. When SD went to the applicant’s home, a video depicting boys performing sexual acts on each other was being shown. The applicant offered SD cannabis, which SD accepted. The applicant induced SD to go to an upstairs room and suggested to SD that he take off his clothes. The applicant put gel on his penis and rubbed his erect penis on SD’s stomach (count 1). The applicant complimented SD on his looks and smooth skin. The applicant played with SD’s penis (count 2) and then sucked SD’s penis (count 3). The applicant gave SD $40 and drove SD to his home, giving SD his telephone number. 
      
       
      
     75 SD went to the applicant’s home on a number of occasions. On one such occasion the applicant sucked SD’s penis (count 4). The applicant induced SD to consent to being anally penetrated by the applicant (count 5) and to engage in other sexual activities. His Honour continued:- 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Over a period of time (SD) saw him (the applicant) on numerous occasions, had sexual relations with him on numerous occasions, was videoed and photographed and ultimately became a heroin addict. When he was fourteen or fifteen he was basically discarded by Mr Dunn and passed on to another man 
         ”. 
         
        
        
       His Honour added:- 
        
        
         
         “ 
         It could be said that each of the young men concerned who have provided statements have a similar type of story which involved them in being induced to go to Mr Dunn’s residence and then being induced to engage in sexual activities, given money, given drugs”. 
         
        
       
      
     76 In the case of each complainant the applicant had built up a relationship with the complainant over a period of time, for the purpose of enabling the applicant to perform sexual acts with the complainant, and the specific acts charged were only instances of a large number of sexual acts which had occurred. 
      
       
      
     77 In his remarks on sentence his Honour also referred, but in less detail, to the facts of some of the offences involving the complainant GD. His Honour noted that on three occasions the applicant had sucked GD’s penis. His Honour considered that the offences against GD were the most serious of all the offences, because of GD’s youth, GD being under the age of ten years at the time of the offences. 
      
       
      
     78 His Honour found that the applicant was predatory, that he was “on the hunt” for boys who he could induce to come to his house. Some boys were recommended to the applicant by other boys. Some boys were recommended to the applicant by acquaintances of the applicant, who engaged in similar activities. 
      
       
      
     79 His Honour considered that the applicant’s conduct was aggravated by his having had a colleague Michael Hill, video the applicant performing sexual acts and even having had Hill himself videoed, as Hill was videoing the applicant. His Honour found that the applicant was proud of having committed the offences and wanted to have the committing of the offences recorded by being videoed. 
      
       
      
     80 His Honour found that the applicant had no insight into the depravity of his actions; that the applicant felt that he had been entitled to commit the offences, because he did not regard his conduct as having been criminal; and that the applicant considered that the complainants, however young they were, were capable of giving their consent and that the complainants had consented to the various sexual activities with the applicant. 
      
       
      
     81 His Honour found that, if the applicant was released from custody, he would return to engaging in the same conduct. “The only caveat is that because of his age and his state of health he may not be able effectively to do it”. 
      
       
      
     82 At pages 20-21 of his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge summarised the offences for which he was sentencing the applicant, stating the maximum penalties for some, but not all, of those offences. It was not an easy task accurately to summarise all of the many offences for which the applicant was being sentenced and all of the maximum penalties for those offences but it must be pointed out that there were some errors in his Honour’s summary. 
      
       
      
     83 In his summary his Honour said that there were “four acts of indecency each carrying a maximum penalty of four years”, whereas there were only two offences of an act of indecency, for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for two years, not four years. His Honour said that there were ten counts of homosexual intercourse with a boy between the ages of ten and eighteen years, whereas there were eleven such offences. His Honour said that there was one count of soliciting or inciting someone to commit an act of indecency, without stating the maximum penalty for the offence, whereas there were three such offences, for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for two years. His Honour said that there were three counts of aggravated indecent assault, “the aggravation being that the indecent assault was done in company with Hill and with others, some of the others being other boys”, whereas there were only two charges of indecent assault, without any circumstance of aggravation being alleged in either of the charges. His Honour incorrectly stated that the maximum penalty for the three offences under s 25(1) of the  
     Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
      was imprisonment for two years and a fine of 50 penalty units, whereas the maximum penalty was imprisonment for ten years and a fine of 2000 penalty units. 
      
       
      
     84 In his remarks on sentence his Honour set out or referred to some of the subjective circumstances of the applicant. Much of what his Honour said was taken from the psychological assessment of the applicant by Mr Benjamin. 
      
       
      
     85 The applicant was born on 30 January 1941. He was accordingly sixty years old when he was sentenced and is now sixty-three years old. 
      
       
      
     86 The applicant left school at the age of fifteen and joined the novitiate of an order of Teaching Brothers. He left the novitiate without becoming a Brother. He became a school teacher in the Catholic education system and was a science teacher at a well known school for about twenty years. There was no evidence to suggest that the applicant had committed any offence of any nature while he was a school teacher. In the reference which was admitted into evidence the Marist Brother said that the applicant had been a dedicated and hard-working member of the school staff, who was well respected by both the staff and the students. 
      
       
      
     87 In 1981 the applicant suffered an acute myocardial infarction. In 1986 he retired from teaching because of ill health, with only minimal superannuation.  
      
       
      
     88 His Honour noted that the applicant had claimed to Mr Benjamin, and his Honour apparently accepted, that the applicant had had “no overt sexual history”, until he was in his forties. Up until then the applicant’s sexual life had been limited to “child pornography and fantasy and he had no relationships”. However, after his heart attack the applicant had “abandoned his period of self denial” and had engaged in acts of child sexual assault. 
      
       
      
     89 In his remarks on sentence his Honour accepted that the applicant was not in good health, that the applicant would serve his sentence “in strict confinement”, that because of the nature of his offences the applicant would be threatened with violence and would be at risk of violence while he was in prison and that the applicant had been subjected to an exceptional degree of notoriety.  
      
       
      
     90 In his remarks on sentence his Honour considered the sentences which had been passed on Michael Hill in 1991 and concluded that the sentences passed on Hill were not of much assistance in the sentencing of the applicant. We will return to this part of his Honour’s remarks on sentence later in this judgment. 
      
       
      
     91 Judge Finnane said that he had taken into account that the applicant had pleaded guilty. His Honour noted that the applicant had maintained pleas of not guilty while the proceedings for a stay of the criminal proceedings against him were still on foot. His Honour did not regard the applicant’s pleas of guilty as any evidence of contrition. He considered that the applicant’s pleas of guilty were merely an acceptance by the applicant of the inevitable, “once the High Court had removed his last hope of defeating the charges on technical grounds”. His Honour declined to quantify any discount he was allowing for the applicant’s pleas of guilty, in reliance on the then recent decision of the High Court in  
     Wong v The Queen 
      (2001) 207 CLR 584. 
      
       
        
       Submissions for the Applicant on Sentence 
        
       
      
     92 It was submitted by Mr Stratton on behalf of the applicant that, although Judge Finnane had said in his remarks on sentence that he had taken into account the applicant’s pleas of guilty and the applicant’s ill health and that the applicant would be likely to serve his sentences “in strict confinement” because of the risk of violence to the applicant from other prisoners, it could be seen from the length of the sentences ultimately imposed by his Honour that his Honour had not made any, or any sufficient, allowance for these matters. 
      
       
      
     93 The principal submission made by Mr Stratton was that the sentences imposed on the applicant far exceeded the range of sentences which had been imposed on other child sexual assault offenders and should be regarded as having been manifestly excessive. 
      
       
      
     94 In the submissions he prepared himself the applicant repeated and elaborated on the same submissions as had been made by Mr Stratton in his written submissions. The applicant also submitted that he should have received a discount for “deferment”, that is for the delay which had occurred in his being sentenced, and that he should have received a discount because promises which had been made to him when he agreed to provide assistance in the prosecution of the police officers had been broken. 
      
       
        
        
       Decision on Sentence 
        
       
      
     95 As we remarked earlier in this judgment, the sentences imposed for the offences charged in counts 23, 24 and 25 of the indictment exceeded the maximum sentence fixed by s 61E(2) or s 61N of the  
     Crimes Act 
      and, consequently, as the Crown conceded, this Court must intervene and re-sentence the applicant for those offences. 
      
       
      
     96 As was also conceded by the Crown, the sentences imposed for the offences charged in counts 1 and 7 of the indictment, although not exceeding the maximum sentence of two years fixed by s 61E(2) of the  
     Crimes Act 
     , were equal to that maximum sentence and were imposed by the sentencing judge in the erroneous belief that the maximum sentence was four years and, consequently, his Honour’s sentencing discretion also miscarried in relation to these offences and this Court must determine what sentences it would itself impose for these offences. 
      
       
      
     97 The sentences imposed for the offences charged in counts 6, 26 and 27 of the indictment were imposed in the erroneous belief that the maximum penalty was imprisonment for two years and a fine of fifty penalty units, whereas the maximum penalty was imprisonment for ten years and a fine of 2,000 penalty units. This was an error in favour of the applicant. However, although his Honour was mistaken about the maximum penalty available and the maximum penalty available was much higher than his Honour thought, no appeal against these sentences was brought by the Crown and we would not regard the sentences imposed by his Honour as unduly lenient. 
      
       
      
     98 We have already referred to remarks made by Judge Finnane about the applicant’s pleas of guilty. Subsequently to Judge Finnane sentencing the applicant, it was held in this Court ( 
     R v Sharma 
      (2002) 54 NSWLR 300) that, notwithstanding the decision of the High Court in  
     Wong 
     , sentencing courts in this State should continue to apply  
     R v Thomson  
     (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, the guidelines judgment concerning pleas of guilty. In  
     R v Thomson 
      at 419 (160) it was stated that sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of a plea of guilty on a sentence being imposed, that the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of a 10 to 25 per cent discount on sentence and that the primary consideration determining where in that range a particular case should fall is the timing of the plea of guilty, that is the time when the plea of guilty is made. 
      
       
      
     99 Judge Finnane obviously found that the applicant’s pleas of guilty had been late pleas of guilty and this was a finding his Honour could properly make. The applicant’s trial had been fixed to commence on 25 June 2001, that is the day before the applicant entered his pleas of guilty. Even if it is accepted that the applicant had been justified in bringing the application for a stay of the criminal proceedings against him, four months had elapsed since his application for a stay had been finally disposed of, by the High Court refusing special leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
      
       
      
     100 However, even though the applicant’s pleas of guilty were late pleas of guilty, the pleas of guilty nevertheless had utilitarian value for the criminal justice system (what would have been a long trial was averted and the complainants were spared having to give evidence) and a discount of at least 10 per cent for the purely utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty should have been allowed. 
      
       
      
     101 Judge Finnane accepted that, because of the risk of violence from other prisoners, the applicant would be likely to serve the sentences which would be imposed on him “in strict confinement” and that some allowance should be made for this factor. 
      
       
      
     102 At the hearing of the application counsel for the applicant stated that he did not object to the Court making general use of an affidavit sworn on 8 February 2004 by Mr Peter Tansey, a Senior Assistant Superintendent of the Goulburn Correctional Centre, about the applicant’s conditions of custody after he had been placed in the Goulburn Correctional Centre in January 2003. It is apparent from Mr Tansey’s affidavit that in February 2004, although the applicant was subject to somewhat more onerous conditions of custody than those which applied to prisoners in the general prison population, it would be an overstatement to say that he was being held “in strict confinement”. 
      
       
      
     103 In his affidavit Mr Tansey said that the applicant had been admitted to Goulburn Correctional Centre in January 2003 as a “non-association inmate” but that in March 2003 his classification had been changed to “limited association inmate”, which enabled him to have limited association with other inmates. In February 2004 the applicant was housed in a unit with twelve other inmates and he had contact with those other twelve inmates. He was sharing a cell with one other inmate and was spending “more time in his cell than normal discipline inmates in the general prison population”. The applicant was working alone in a secured room as a laundry sweeper. The applicant had access to services and programmes. 
      
       
      
     104 As Judge Finnane recognised, some allowance also had to be made for the applicant’s state of ill health. 
      
       
      
     105 If, as his Honour said in his remarks on sentence, he had taken all of these specific matters into account, that is the pleas of guilty, the applicant’s more than usually onerous conditions of custody and the applicant’s ill health, then the total effective sentence his Honour must have had in mind, before allowing for these matters, must have been at least thirty-five years. 
      
       
      
     106 As regards the additional specific matters raised by the applicant in the submissions he prepared himself, I make the following comments:- 
      
       
      
     107 According to the Crown’s evidence, the video tapes on which the charges against the applicant were based were seized by police in 1996. The applicant was then overseas. After the applicant had been brought back to Australia and had been charged, the applicant brought and pursued the application for a stay of the criminal proceedings against him. This application was finally disposed of in February 2001. In these circumstances the applicant was not entitled to any discount on sentence on the basis that there had been a delay in his being sentenced. 
      
       
      
     108 There was no evidence before Judge Finnane, and there is no evidence before this Court, of any promises allegedly made to the applicant (apart from the indemnity and the undertaking) or of any breaches of any such promises.  
      
       
      
     109 As previously noted, the principal submission made by Mr Stratton was that the sentences imposed on the applicant were manifestly excessive as far exceeding the upper limit of the range of sentences which had been established by sentences imposed on other persons sentenced for multiple offences of child sexual assault. In support of this submission counsel for the applicant referred to a number of cases including  
     R v AB  
     (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 7 July 1997; unreported CCA 6 December 2000);  
     R Fisk 
      (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 21 July 1998);  
     R v Bell 
      (unreported District Court Davidson DCJ 12 February 1999);  
     R v Allen  
     (unreported District Court Phelan DCJ 7 November 2000); and, particularly,  
     R v Hill 
      (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 7 July 1992). 
      
       
      
     110 In  
     R v AB 
      the offender pleaded guilty to sixty-seven offences of child sexual assault, committed against fifteen children aged between nine and eleven years over a period of about ten years. The offender was a member of a religious teaching order and the victims were some of his pupils. 
      
       
      
     111 AB had fled to the United States, after he became aware that complaints had been made about his conduct. He was extradited from the United States on twenty-eight of the offences, after contested extradition proceedings. However, after having been extradited from the United States, the offender co-operated fully with the police, including volunteering information about thirty-nine other offences he had committed and waiving any objections under extradition law to being dealt with for those further offences. The offender was initially sentenced to sentences totalling eighteen years, with minimum terms totalling thirteen and a half years. An appeal against sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed. However, on a further appeal to the High Court the High Court held that the sentencing judge’s discretion had miscarried, because he had not taken into account that further extradition proceedings had been avoided by the offender’s waiving of any objection and had not taken into account the desirability of encouraging extradited persons to make a full disclosure of all their criminality and to waive their rights under extradition law. The matter having been remitted by the High Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal sentenced the offender to sentences totalling fifteen years with minimum terms totalling twelve years. 
      
       
      
     112 In  
     R v Fisk 
      the offender pleaded guilty to twenty-four offences involving three victims. Nine of the offences had been committed against one victim between 1974 and 1978 and consisted of one offence of indecent assault and eight offences of buggery. Another eight offences had been committed against a second victim between 1986 and 1988 and consisted of two charges of sexual intercourse without consent with a person under the age of sixteen years, one charge of indecent assault on a person under the age of sixteen years, four charges of homosexual intercourse with a male between the ages of ten and eighteen years and one charge of aiding and abetting an act of homosexual intercourse with a person between the ages of ten and eighteen years. Another seven offences had been committed against a third victim between January and July 1988 and were offences of the same kinds as the offences which had been committed against the second victim. The twenty-four offences which had been charged were not isolated, aberrant acts but were representative of the lifestyle of the offender.  
      
       
      
     113 Fisk was sentenced to terms of imprisonment totalling twelve years with minimum terms totalling nine years. An appeal by Fisk against the sentences which had been imposed was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  
      
       
      
     114 In  
     R v Bell 
      the offender was found guilty after a trial of twenty-eight offences committed against five victims, including sixteen charges of homosexual intercourse with a male between the ages of ten years and eighteen years, three charges of indecently assaulting a child under the age of sixteen years and under the offender’s authority, two charges of indecently assaulting a male, six charges of indecently assaulting a child under the age of sixteen years and one charge of an act of indecency with a child under the age of sixteen years.  
      
       
      
     115 Subsequently, the offender pleaded guilty to a further sixteen charges against thirteen additional victims, comprising three charges of homosexual intercourse with a male between the ages of ten years and eighteen years, one charge of an act of indecency with a person under the age of sixteen years, one charge of inciting an act of indecency with a person under the age of sixteen years, two charges of indecently assaulting a male, six charges of indecent assault and three charges of indecent assault on a child under the offender’s authority. 
      
       
      
     116 The offender also asked the sentencing judge to take into account in sentencing him thirty-one further offences of similar kinds. 
      
       
      
     117 The seventy-five offences for which the offender was sentenced or which were taken into account in sentencing the offender were committed between 1978 and 1991 against a total of eighteen boys, whose ages generally ranged from twelve years to fifteen years.  
      
       
      
     118 The offender was sentenced to terms of imprisonment totalling fourteen years with minimum terms totalling ten and a half years. An appeal against conviction was abandoned and the Court of Criminal Appeal refused leave to withdraw the abandonment of the appeal.  
      
       
      
     119 Judge Finnane referred to  
     Bell 
      at p24 in his remarks on sentence. His Honour noted that Bell was, like the applicant, a child sexual assault offender of great notoriety, that he had committed many crimes and that he had engaged in predatory activities. His Honour distinguished Bell’s case on the grounds that the children who had been the victims of Bell’s offences were somewhat older than the victims of the applicant’s offences and that the judge who had sentenced Bell had accepted that Bell understood that his conduct was wrongful and had accepted Bell’s assurance that he would not re-offend. 
      
       
      
     120 In  
     R v Allen 
      the offender was sentenced for twenty-six offences of child sexual assault, including ten charges of buggery. A further twenty-one offences were taken into account in sentencing the offender. The offences had been committed between 1966 and 1999 against a total of eleven boys aged between nine and seventeen years but mainly between ten and thirteen years. Sentences totalling fourteen years were imposed with minimum terms totalling nine and a half years. 
      
       
      
     121 The case on which counsel for the applicant, and the applicant himself, placed particular reliance was  
     R v Hill 
     . 
      
       
      
     122 Hill pleaded guilty to charges of twenty-three offences, including eight offences of homosexual intercourse with a person between the ages of ten and sixteen years, one offence of homosexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years, five offences of indecent assault, two offences of homosexual intercourse with a person under the age of eighteen years, offences of inciting a person under the age of sixteen years or eighteen years to commit an act of indecency and one offence of inciting a male person under the age of eighteen years to commit an act of homosexual intercourse. The offences were committed against seven boys at various times between 1987 and 1991.  
      
       
      
     123 Hill was sentenced in the Supreme Court by Loveday J on 29 November 1991. In his brief remarks on sentence Loveday J referred to Hill’s bad previous criminal record for sexual offences. His Honour said that he took into account “most strongly” Hill’s pleas of guilty, particularly because they saved the young victims from having to appear in court. 
      
       
      
     124 In sentencing Hill Loveday J adopted the sentencing practice which was followed in this State before the decision of the High Court in  
     Pearce v The Queen 
      (1998) 194 CLR 610 of reflecting the total criminality in all the offences in the sentence imposed for the most serious offence, the offence of homosexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years, and imposing fixed terms of imprisonment or penal servitude for all the other offences, which were to be served concurrently with parts of the minimum term for the principal sentence. For the offence of homosexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years Loveday J sentenced Hill to a sentence of sixteen years with a minimum term of twelve years, commencing on 10 March 1991, the date Hill had gone into custody. 
      
       
      
     125 On 7 July 1992 an appeal by Hill to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed by Loveday J was dismissed. The leading judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal was given by Smart J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Carruthers J concurred. 
      
       
      
     126 In his judgment Smart J summarised Hill’s conduct as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The offences involved a range of sexual acts. Some involved the fondling of a boy’s penis, some involved oral intercourse either by or on the boy, some involved penile/anal intercourse and some involved acts of gross indecency. In some instances the applicant incited one or more of the boys to perform indecent acts or assaults upon another boy or other boys. Sometimes three boys were involved at the one time. In some instances the applicant recorded or caused to be recorded what took place on a video tape”. 
         
        
       
      
     127 In his judgment Smart J referred to Hill’s criminal record. This criminal record included four convictions in 1968 for indecent assault on a male person for which sentences of imprisonment were imposed; a conviction in 1974 for aggravated assault of a sexual nature on a male person under the age of seventeen years; and convictions in 1979 for five offences of indecent assault on a male, one offence of assault with intent to commit buggery and one offence of buggery, for which sentences of imprisonment totalling eleven years were imposed. Hill was released from prison on 2 August 1985, having served those sentences. Smart J, having regard to the dates of the offences for which Hill had been sentenced by Loveday J, commented:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The disturbing thought is that within less than two years after his release and having spent six and two third years in gaol he had returned to his old habits 
         ”. 
         
        
       
      
     128 Hill was not legally represented either before Loveday J or on his application for leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. In the written submissions he himself prepared for the application to the Court of Criminal Appeal he referred to close friends and acquaintances “with similar sexual tastes to my own” and Smart J observed that “he seems to feel that he is entitled to give expression to those tastes” and that “there appears to be little or no prospect of rehabilitation”. 
      
       
      
     129 Although Smart J concluded that Hill’s appeal against the severity of the sentences passed on him should be dismissed, his Honour described “the sentence” as “a lengthy and heavy one” and said that he had “found the question of sentence a disturbing and difficult one”. 
      
       
      
     130 On 26 March 1997 Hill was sentenced in the District Court by his Honour Judge Shillington on thirteen charges of aiding and abetting the applicant (that is Robert Joseph Dunn) in committing offences of having sexual intercourse, within the definition of “sexual intercourse” in the  
     Crimes Act 
     , with a child aged between ten and eighteen years, being the same child as was the victim of the offences charged in counts eleven to sixteen of the indictment against the applicant. These thirteen offences had come to the attention of police, because Hill was shown in the videos which police had obtained possession of in 1996. Hill pleaded guilty to all thirteen charges at the earliest opportunity.  
      
       
      
     131 Judge Shillington considered that it was clear that, if Hill’s conduct in aiding and abetting the applicant had been brought to Loveday J’s attention when he sentenced Hill in 1991, “it would have been taken into account in the sentence which was imposed”. Accordingly, Judge Shillington, while sentencing Hill to concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment, the longest of which were four years, made all the sentences commence from the date on which Hill had gone into custody, 10 March 1991, with the consequence that all of the sentences would be concurrent with part of the minimum term of the principal sentence imposed by Loveday J and Hill would, effectively, not receive any additional punishment. 
      
       
      
     132 On 28 November 1997 Hill was sentenced in the District Court by his Honour Judge Sides on four further charges of offences committed against a single victim, consisting of three charges of homosexual intercourse with a person between the ages of ten and eighteen years and one charge of inciting an act of indecency.  
      
       
      
     133 Judge Sides decided that, because the victim of these offences was not one of the victims of the offences for which Hill had been sentenced in 1991, some effective additional punishment should be imposed on Hill. On each of the three charges of homosexual intercourse his Honour imposed a sentence of four years imprisonment, with a minimum term of twelve months commencing on 10 March 2003 and an additional term of three years commencing on 10 March 2004. 
      
       
      
     134 The overall effect of the sentences passed on Hill by Loveday J, Judge Shillington and Judge Sides was that Hill was sentenced to terms of imprisonment totalling sixteen years, with minimum terms or fixed terms of imprisonment totalling thirteen years. 
      
       
      
     135 In considering the sentences passed on Hill it is necessary to keep in mind what Hunt CJ at CL said, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, in  
     R v Morgan 
      (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371:- 
      
       
        
         
         “It is quite wrong to compare the sentence under challenge directly with that imposed upon another offender (who is not a co-offender) simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. What must be looked at is whether the challenged sentence is within the  
         range 
          appropriate to the objective gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender, and not whether it is more severe or more lenient than some other sentence (other than that of a co-offender) which merely forms part of that range”. 
         
        
       
      
     136 These observations by Hunt CJ at CL in  
     R v Morgan 
      have often been referred to with approval in subsequent cases, for example  
     R v Merritt 
      [2004] NSWCCA 19 at (62). 
      
       
      
     137 However, in the present case Hill, although not strictly a co-offender (except in respect of the offences of aiding and abetting the applicant for which Hill was sentenced by Judge Shillington) was not simply another offender who had similar characteristics to the applicant and who had committed similar offences to the applicant. Hill and the applicant knew each other and were members of the same circle of paedophiles. Two of the victims of the offences for which the applicant was sentenced had also been victims of some of the offences for which Hill was sentenced. A matter which Judge Finnane regarded as aggravating the applicant’s criminality was that some of the offences had been committed in the company of Hill and Hill had videoed the applicant committing the offences. 
      
       
      
     138 There was a further reason why the sentences passed upon Hill in 1991 and considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1992 are of particular significance in the sentencing of the applicant. In  
     R v MJR 
      (2002) 54 NSWLR 368, a decision of a Court of Criminal Appeal constituted by five judges, which was handed down on 12 April 2002, that is after Judge Finnane had sentenced the applicant on 7 December 2001, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that in sentencing an offender it is proper to take into account sentence practice as at the date of the commission of the offence, when sentencing practice has moved adversely to the offender between the time of the commission of the offence and the time of sentencing. 
      
       
      
     139 In so deciding the Court of Criminal Appeal applied the Court’s previous decision in  
     R v Shore  
     (1992) 66 A Crim R 37, in preference to the Court’s previous decision in  
     R v PLV 
      (2001) 51 NSWLR 736, to which Judge Finnane had been referred by the Crown in the proceedings on sentence. In  
     R v Shore 
     , a case in which many years had elapsed between the commission of the offences and the offender being sentenced (the offender having absconded while on bail), Badgery-Parker J who gave the leading judgment, approved (at p 42) as being correct some remarks which had been made by the sentencing judge:- 
      
       
        
         
         “In my opinion I should, so far as I am able to do so, seek to impose upon the offender a sentence appropriate not only to then applicable statutory maxima but also to then appropriate sentencing patterns. That is by no means easy but in my view I must endeavour to do so”. 
         
        
       
      
     140 The present Court is, of course, bound to apply the decision of the five judge Court of Criminal Appeal in  
     R v MJR 
     . The sentences imposed on Hill in 1991 and the assessment of those sentences by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1992 provide information about sentencing patterns for offences of child sexual assault in 1991-1992, that is at a time much more proximate than the present to the times at which the applicant’s offences were committed. 
      
       
      
     141 Hill’s case was certainly regarded as relevant, and important, during the hearing of the proceedings for the sentencing of the applicant. At times during the hearing both the Crown Prosecutor and Judge Finnane referred, even if inaccurately, to Hill as having been the applicant’s “co-offender”. Submissions were made to Judge Finnane about what were submitted to be similarities or differences between the applicant’s case and Hill’s case. As previously noted, the hearing of the proceedings on sentence was adjourned, at the instance of Judge Finnane, to enable his Honour to obtain further information about the sentencing of Hill. Ultimately, a substantial amount of material about the sentencing of Hill was collected and became exhibit H in the proceedings on sentence. Exhibit H comprised the indictment presented against Hill, a summary of the counts in the indictment against Hill, Hill’s criminal history, the judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal on Hill’s appeal, the facts sheets used in the sentencing of Hill and a large bundle of statements by or interviews of victims of the offences committed by Hill. 
      
       
      
     142 In his remarks on sentence Judge Finnane devoted almost an entire page to discussing Hill’s case. This discussion contained an important error. His Honour said that the sentences of fixed terms of four years (or less), which had been imposed on Hill in 1997 (by his Honour Judge Shillington), “were made cumulative on his then sentence”, whereas, as we have already stated, the sentences which were imposed on Hill by Judge Shillington were made fully concurrent with part of the minimum term of the principal sentence imposed by Loveday J and did not involve the imposition of any additional punishment. 
      
       
      
     143 In a later part of his remarks on sentence Judge Finnane said with respect to Hill’s case:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Whilst I have had regard to Hill’s case and the sentences imposed on Hill, and whilst I have had regard to the fact that Hill was a persistent offender, I have formed the opinion that that case is not of a great deal of assistance to me in dealing with this case. And that is so because he was sentenced in 1991, he pleaded guilty at the outset, the offences were not as numerous as the current offences and they did not involve the circumstances of these offences”. 
         
        
       
      
     144 Of these grounds for concluding that Hill’s case was not of much assistance, the first ground given, that Hill had been sentenced many years before in 1991, so far from being a valid reason for distinguishing Hill, was, on the authority of  
     Shore 
      and  
     MJR 
     , wrong in principle. As we have already indicated,  
     MJR 
      was decided after his Honour sentenced the applicant and his Honour was not referred to  
     Shore 
      but only to  
     PLV 
     . 
      
       
      
     145 The second ground given by his Honour, that Hill had pleaded guilty at the outset, was a valid ground of distinction between Hill’s case and the applicant’s case. However, the applicant did ultimately plead guilty and, as we have already indicated, was entitled to a discount of at least 10 per cent for his pleas of guilty. 
      
       
      
     146 The third ground given by his Honour, that Hill’s offences were not as numerous as the applicant’s offences, could not be given much weight. The applicant was sentenced for twenty-seven offences. Hill had been sentenced for twenty-three offences. Three of the applicant’s offences were for supplying small quantities of cannabis to boys who were not naive in the use of cannabis and these offences were, of themselves, quite minor offences. In any event, the total number of offences with which the applicant was charged was somewhat arbitrary, depending on decisions by the prosecution whether to charge a single offence or multiple offences for conduct by the applicant on a single occasion. 
      
       
      
     147 It is unclear what his Honour meant by saying that Hill’s offences did not involve “the circumstances” of the applicant’s offences. In the immediately following part of his remarks on sentence his Honour said that the applicant had engaged in predatory behaviour and had had his behaviour videoed. However, Hill also had engaged in predatory behaviour and it was Hill who had videoed the applicant. It would appear to us that the circumstances of Hill’s offences were very similar to the circumstances of the applicant’s offences. 
      
       
      
     148 We conclude that the reasons given by his Honour for deciding that Hill’s case was not of much assistance in the sentencing of the applicant were wrong in principle or were of no, or only limited, weight or were left unexplained by his Honour. 
      
       
      
     149 We also consider it likely that, in having regard to Hill’s case and the sentences imposed on Hill, his Honour was influenced by his mistaken view that the sentences of four years imposed by Judge Shillington on Hill had been made cumulative upon, and not concurrent with, the sentences imposed by Loveday J on Hill and that the total effect of the sentences imposed on Hill was more severe than it really was. 
      
       
      
     150 Apart from the grounds given by Judge Finnane in his remarks on sentence for distinguishing Hill’s case, it was submitted both in the proceedings on sentence and before this Court that the applicant’s offences were more serious than Hill’s offences, because the applicant’s offences included three offences of homosexual intercourse with a male person under the age of ten years (counts 8, 9 and 10), whereas Hill’s offences included only one such offence (count 17 in the indictment against Hill). It was contended that the gravity of an offence of homosexual intercourse with a male person under the age of ten years is shown by what was the high maximum penalty for such an offence, penal servitude for twenty-five years; whereas the maximum penalty for an offence of homosexual intercourse with a male person between the ages of ten years and eighteen years was penal servitude for only ten years. 
      
       
      
     151 This is a valid ground of distinction between the applicant’s case and Hill’s case. However, there are some partially offsetting factors. 
      
       
      
     152 On each of counts 8, 9 and 10 in the indictment against the applicant the applicant’s conduct was that he had sucked the complainant’s penis. These were objectively serious offences to commit on children under the age of ten. However, each of these offences, considered by itself and grave though it was, was not as objectively serious as Hill’s conduct in committing the offence charged in count 17 of the indictment against him, which involved actual penile/anal penetration of the victim. 
      
       
      
     153 Another partially offsetting factor was Hill’s serious previous criminal history of convictions and prison sentences for child sexual assault offences, whereas the applicant had no previous criminal convictions.  
      
       
      
     154 We conclude that because of the close connection between the applicant’s case and Hill’s case and because, by virtue of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
     MJR 
     , a sentencing court would be required to have regard to patterns of sentencing at times more proximate to the times of the commission of the offences by the applicant between 1985 and 1992, Hill’s case was a case to which his Honour should have had particular regard. However, on grounds which were wrong in principle or could only be of little weight or which were left unexplained, his Honour decided that Hill’s case was not of much assistance in the sentencing of the applicant. In deciding that Hill’s case was not of much assistance in the sentencing of the applicant, his Honour was also influenced by his factual error in supposing that the sentences imposed on Hill by Judge Shillington had been made cumulative upon, and not concurrent with, the sentences imposed on Hill by Loveday J and that the total effect of the sentences imposed on Hill was more severe than it really was. In our opinion, these errors made by the sentencing judge with respect to Hill’s case were such that his Honour’s sentencing discretion generally miscarried. 
      
       
      
     155 We are further of the opinion that, notwithstanding the seriousness of the applicant’s criminality and the distinctions which can properly be drawn between the applicant’s case and other cases, the sentences imposed on the applicant were outside the range of sentences indicated by such cases as  
     AB 
     ,  
     Fisk 
     ,  
     Bell 
     ,  
     Allen 
      and  
     Hill 
     . 
      
       
      
     156 It is, accordingly, necessary for this Court to re-sentence the applicant. 
      
       
      
     157 We have already set out the objective facts of the offences committed by the applicant and the subjective circumstance of the applicant. 
      
       
      
     158 The offences committed by the applicant were objectively very serious and, because they included no fewer than three offences of having had homosexual intercourse with a male under the age of ten years, the applicant’s total objective criminality, even after allowing for partially offsetting factors, should be regarded as greater than Hill’s. However, this Court is bound by the decision in  
     MJR 
      to sentence the applicant in accordance with patterns of sentencing at the times the offences were committed, so far as they can be determined, and the sentences imposed on Hill in 1991 considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1992 evidence the patterns of sentencing which this Court is bound to apply. 
      
       
      
     159 We accept Judge Finnane’s findings that the applicant has no insight into the depravity of his actions and has not shown any contrition. We also accept Judge Finnane’s finding that, if his age and health permitted, the applicant would be likely to re-offend. However, as the applicant is now sixty-three years old and in poor health, it would seem unlikely that the applicant, if still alive after serving a lengthy prison sentence, would be able to resume re-offending. 
      
       
      
     160 In re-sentencing the applicant some allowance must be made for the utilitarian value of the applicant’s pleas of guilty, his ill health and the likelihood that he will continue to serve his sentence in more than usually onerous conditions of custody. 
      
       
      
     161 In re-sentencing the applicant fixed terms of imprisonment should be imposed for most of the offences, because if a sentence containing a non-parole period and a parole period was set, the parole period would be subsumed in the non-parole period or the fixed term of some longer sentence or sentences. There is no necessity, as Judge Finnane thought, to set a non-parole period for every one of the sentences. In accordance with sentencing principle, where a fixed term of imprisonment is imposed the fixed term will be equivalent, not to the total term of a sentence containing a non-parole period and a parole period, but merely to the non-parole period of such a sentence. 
      
       
      
     162 Before indicating the sentences to be imposed upon the applicant, we wish to make the following two matters perfectly clear. Firstly, the sentences that we believe are appropriate in the circumstances of this case are not a guide to what would now be appropriate for an offender who committed similar offences in more recent years. As events have turned out one of the significant errors in the exercise of the sentencing discretion by Judge Finnane was that he did not have sufficient regard to the sentences imposed upon Hill. He applied, as he was bound to, the standing decision of this Court in  
     PLV 
      which was not overruled until five months after he sentenced the applicant. Consequently he did not take into consideration the requirement, recognised in  
     MJR 
     , 
       
     to impose sentences within the range that was current at the time of offending. Sentences imposed in 1992 provide little assistance in determining the appropriate sentence or sentences to be imposed for similar offences committed in recent years. Sentences have increased since and this would have to be reflected in sentences imposed upon more recent offenders. 
      
       
      
     163 The second matter is that the Court is constrained in determining the appropriate sentences by those imposed upon Hill having regard to the close association between the two offenders and their criminal conduct. The applicant and Hill were not co-offenders in relation to most of the offences for which the applicant was sentenced and the principle of parity in sentencing joint offenders strictly does not apply. However, the criminality of the offender and Hill was so interrelated in time and space that they can fairly be considered as involved in the same criminal enterprise of seducing and violating underage males. Shillington DCJ sentenced Hill for offences as an accessory to sexual crimes committed by the applicant similar to those for which he must be re-sentenced by this Court. The sentences imposed upon Hill are, therefore, directly relevant and not merely as evidence of the sentencing pattern in 1991. 
      
       
      
     164 But for the fact that justice in the sentencing process requires there to be a substantial relationship between the sentences imposed upon Hill and those imposed upon the applicant the Court would have imposed sentences totalling 24 years and fixed a total non-parole period in accordance with a total sentence of that severity. Such a sentence would have properly reflected the applicant’s criminality having regard to the fact that the sentencing range at the time of offending was less severe than that which now exists. However, in our judgment such a sentence would be unduly harsh having regard to the total sentence actually imposed upon Hill having regard to the close connection between their offences. The sentences we will impose are the least that can properly be imposed to reflect the objective seriousness of the applicant’s criminal conduct. 
      
       
      
     165 We consider that the following sentences should be imposed on the applicant:- 
      
       
      
     166 On each of counts 1 and 7 (charges of an act of indecency for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for two years), a fixed term of imprisonment of nine months. 
      
       
      
     167 On each of counts 2 and 11 (charges of indecent assault for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for four years) a fixed term of imprisonment of fifteen months. 
      
       
      
     168 On each of counts 3, 4, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 (charges of homosexual intercourse with a male person between the ages of ten years and eighteen years in which the type of homosexual intercourse was some form of fellatio, for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for ten years), a fixed term of imprisonment for four years. 
      
       
      
     169 On each of counts 5 and 15 (charges of homosexual intercourse with a male person between the ages of ten years and eighteen years in which the type of homosexual intercourse was penile/anal intercourse committed by the applicant on the complainant, for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for ten years), a fixed term of imprisonment for five years. 
      
       
      
     170 On each of counts 8, 9 and 10 (charges of homosexual intercourse with a male person under the age of ten years, in which the applicant sucked the complainant’s penis, for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for twenty-five years), a term of imprisonment for eight years or an equivalent 
       
     fixed term of imprisonment for six years. 
      
       
      
     171 On each of counts 13 and 14 (charges of attempted homosexual intercourse with a male person between the ages of ten years and eighteen years for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for five years), a fixed term of imprisonment of two years. 
      
       
      
     172 On count 16 (a charge of sexual intercourse with a person between the ages of ten years and sixteen years for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for eight years), a fixed term of imprisonment for three years. 
      
       
      
     173 On counts 23, 24 and 25 (inciting a person under the age of sixteen years to commit an act of indecency for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for two years), a fixed term of imprisonment of one year. 
      
       
      
     174 On counts 6, 26 and 27 (supplying a prohibited drug for which the maximum sentence was imprisonment for ten years), a fixed term of imprisonment of nine months. 
      
       
      
     175 After considering questions of totality, cumulation and concurrency of sentences, we have concluded that all the sentences, apart from the sentences on counts 5 and 15 and on counts 8, 9 and 10, should be ordered to commence on 10 November 1997, the date on which the sentences imposed by Judge Finnane commenced, those sentences to be served concurrently with each other. The longest of the sentences commencing on 10 November 1997 are the sentences of fixed terms of imprisonment for four years on counts 3, 4, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 which would have expired on 9 November 2001. 
      
       
      
     176 The sentences of fixed terms of imprisonment for five years on counts 5 and 15 should commence on 10 November 2001 and expire on 9 November 2006, these two sentences to be served concurrently with each other. 
      
       
      
     177 The sentence on count 8 of a fixed term of imprisonment for six years should commence on 10 November 2006 and expire on 9 November 2012. The sentence on count 9 of a fixed term of imprisonment for six years should commence on 10 November 2008 and expire on 9 November 2014. The sentence on count 10 of a term of imprisonment for eight years should commence on 10 November 2009 and expire on 9 November 2017, with a non-parole period of six years commencing on 10 November 2009 and expiring on 9 November 2015. The earliest date on 
       
     which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole is 9 November 
       
     2015. The total effect of the sentences is that the applicant is sentenced to terms of imprisonment totalling twenty years, with fixed terms of imprisonment and the non-parole period of the sentence imposed on count 10 totalling eighteen years. We consider that eighteen years is the minimum period of imprisonment the applicant should serve. Having regard to the applicant’s lack of insight into his offending and his lack of contrition and the unlikelihood of the applicant being rehabilitated, we do not consider that any useful purpose would be served in setting any longer period during which the applicant would be eligible for release on parole. 
      
       
      
     178 The orders the Court makes on the application for leave to appeal against sentences are:- Leave is granted to the applicant to appeal against the sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Finnane. The appeal against those sentences is allowed. The sentences imposed by Judge Finnane are quashed and in lieu thereof the sentences we have nominated are imposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: This is a Crown appeal against sentences imposed on the respondent Trevor John Silcock in the District Court by his Honour Judge Freeman on 16 September 2004. On each of five charges of indecent assault, to which the respondent had pleaded guilty, his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for two years commencing on 16 September 2004, all the sentences to be concurrent. His Honour made an order pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act suspending each sentence, conditionally upon the respondent entering into a recognisance to be of good behaviour during the term of the sentences, accepting the supervision and directions of the Probation and Parole Service and undertaking psychological counselling, if necessary in the opinion of his treating doctor and the officer of the Probation and Parole Service in charge of his case.  
     
      
    2 The victim of all of the five offences was a boy born in June 1971, who I will refer to as “the complainant”. The first two offences were committed between 14 July 1981 and 31 December 1984; the third offence was committed between 1 March 1983 and 31 March 1983; the fourth offence was committed between 1 March 1983 and 1 February 1984; and the fifth offence was committed between 1 February 1984 and 28 June 1985. All of the five charges were brought pursuant to s 61E(1) of the Crimes Act (now repealed), under which the maximum sentence was imprisonment for six years. 
     
      
    3 The five offences which were charged were a few only of the acts of sexual assault committed by the respondent on the complainant between 1981 and 1985. Many of the acts of sexual assault had been so similar that the complainant was unable to individually distinguish them. 
     
      
    4 Although the offences for which the respondent was sentenced had been committed between 1981 and 1985, the complainant did not report any of the offences to the authorities until the year 2000. After the complainant reported the offences, further delays occurred before the respondent was sentenced on 16 September 2004. 
     
      
    5 Judge Freeman’s statement of the facts of the offences in his remarks on sentence was closely based on a set of agreed facts which had been admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence and was not the subject of any complaint on this appeal. In his remarks on sentence his Honour stated the facts of the offences as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The prisoner first met his victim at Woonona, when the victim was 10 years old. On the day of their very first meeting, with the approval of the victim’s mother, the boy stayed overnight in the prisoner’s flat and sexual activity was initiated by the offender that night and continued over the following four years. The prisoner befriended the victim’s family, in a sense deliberately ingratiating himself with them and trading upon the problems with alcohol suffered by the victim’s mother to blind her to what it was that he was doing to her son. 
        
       
       
        
        With the mother’s permission, the prisoner often took the boy away, the better to effect his sexual attacks upon him and indeed, for a period of time, so had he grafted himself onto this family, that he lived with the family and shared a bedroom with his victim. 
        
       
       
        
        The five identified occasions in the indictment are: on the first day of meeting the prisoner fondled the victim’s genitals over his trousers and later persuaded the child to engage in mutual masturbation; about two weeks after that, the prisoner encouraged the victim to be naked on a bed and he pushed his erect penis between the boys legs and buttocks simulating sexual intercourse until he ejaculated; the third count relates to a time when he was living with the family when the victim was 11 and it is an occasion on which the prisoner masturbated the boy, introduced the boy’s penis into his mouth and sucked it. 
        
       
       
        
        When the victim was 11 or 12 years old according to count 4, the prisoner took him on a holiday to Sawtell at which time the prisoner paid the boy for his participation in mutual masturbation and count 5 relates to a later school holiday period, when the victim was 12 or 13. Again, he was taken to Sawtell and he engaged in mutual masturbation with the prisoner introducing the victim’s penis into his mouth”. 
        
       
      
    6 The offences of child sexual assault on the complainant for which the respondent was sentenced by Judge Freeman were not the first offences of child sexual assault for which the respondent had been sentenced. 
     
      
    7 On 19 February 1988, for an offence of indecent assault of which the respondent had been found guilty after a trial, a District Court judge deferred passing sentence conditionally upon the respondent entering into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for five years. 
     
      
    8 During the term of this recognisance and in breach of it, the respondent committed five further offences of indecent assault. He pleaded guilty to charges of these offences. On 7 May 1990 his Honour Judge Herron in the District Court on each count deferred passing sentence, conditionally upon the respondent entering into a further recognisance to be of good behaviour for five years. His Honour directed that there be no action on the breach of the recognisance previously entered into. 
     
      
    9 On 11 April 1997 the respondent was sentenced in the District Court by his Honour Judge Johnston for nine offences of aggravated indecent assault and one offence of committing an act of indecency, which had been committed against four boys ranging in age from eight to fourteen years and all of which had been committed within the term of the recognisance granted by Judge Herron. The respondent had pleaded guilty to charges of these offences. In sentencing the respondent Judge Johnston also took into account five further offences of indecent assault, all of which had been committed within the term of the recognisance granted by Judge Herron. On six of the charges the respondent was ordered to perform 300 hours of community service. On the remaining charges Judge Johnston deferred passing sentence, conditionally upon the respondent entering into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for three years. 
     
      
    10 The respondent, who was born in November 1937 and, accordingly, is now sixty-seven years old, has had, and continues to have, a number of serious health problems. In 1975 the respondent suffered severe burns to 65 per cent of his body. In 1978 he began to suffer, and he continues to suffer, from psoriasis, a chronic skin disorder. Drugs which have been administered to the respondent to treat his psoriasis reduce the ability of his immune system to cope with infection. 
     
      
    11 In 1993 the respondent was diagnosed as having cancer of both the penis and the bladder, a highly unusual combination of cancers. On 25 May 1993 a partial amputation of the respondent’s penis was performed. The respondent was treated with radio therapy to the bladder and penis, which caused radiation burns to his groin and lower abdomen.  
     
      
    12 In March 1996 the respondent underwent a bilateral orchidectomy, in which his testes and much of his scrotum were removed. 
     
      
    13 In late 1996 a suprapubic catheter was surgically inserted in the respondent’s abdomen and he has continued to need to use a catheter. There is a risk of the respondent contracting an infection at the site of the entry of the catheter into his abdomen. In a report dated 17 June 2004 Dr Knight, a general practitioner who has been treating the respondent since 1984, expressed the opinion that, if the respondent was required to serve a custodial sentence in which he had to share facilities with other inmates, he would be at serious risk of contracting a life threatening infection against which his immune system would have little ability to protect him. 
     
      
    14 In his remarks on sentence Judge Freeman found that the offences were objectively serious, particularly because of the seriously adverse effect of the offences on the complainant, as shown by a statement by the complainant, and because in committing the offences the respondent had abused a position of trust. His Honour stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Were I simply dealing with the matter on this basis (that is the objective seriousness of the offences), I would unhesitatingly impose a lengthy period of full-time custody 
        ”. 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour found that neither the delay which had occurred between the commission of the offences and the reporting of the offences, nor the delay which had subsequently occurred in the criminal proceedings against the respondent should lead to the adoption by his Honour of any different sentencing option. His Honour remarked that often offences of child sexual assault “do not surface for long periods of time, until the victim has managed to screw him or herself up to the point of making the necessary revelations”. Delays which had occurred in the criminal proceedings against the respondent were at least partly attributable to adjournments which had been sought by the respondent on the grounds of his requiring medical treatment. 
     
      
    16 In his remarks on sentence Judge Freeman then proceeded to trace the history of the respondent’s health problems and the history of the previous criminal proceedings against him for offences of child sexual assault, which I have already summarised earlier in this judgment. 
     
      
    17 With regard to the bilateral orchidectomy which the respondent had undergone in March 1996, his Honour rejected a submission made by counsel for the respondent in the proceedings on sentence that the respondent had undergone the operation as a means of rehabilitating himself by reducing his capacity to offend and found that the respondent had undergone the operation more as a means of gaining relief from the extreme discomfort caused by swelling of his genitals. His Honour noted an opinion by a psychiatrist that, the operation having been performed, the risk of the respondent re-offending had been markedly reduced. 
     
      
    18 With regard to the respondent’s health Judge Freeman said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        I should deal with one or two other propositions that were put to me. One is that such is the state of his health that a term of custody should be avoided because of the extreme risk of infection whilst in custody with communal showers and the like. Dr Knight speaks of that risk, it being related to his suprapubic catheter and the inflamed and potentially easily infectable flesh around it. I should say that I do not regard the prisoner’s state of health to be such as would be beyond the capacity of the Corrections Health Service to treat. 
        
       
       
        
        It has been clear on repeated inspection since 1994 that there is no recurrence of tumour at the original site in his bladder. He requires the replacement of his catheter at six-weekly intervals. These are not matters outside the expertise, as I understand it, of Corrections Health or at least, outside the expertise of specialists to whom Corrections Health could send the prisoner, were he in custody”. 
        
       
      
    19 His Honour Judge Johnston’s remarks on sentence of 11 April 1997 were before Judge Freeman in the proceedings on sentence and Judge Freeman commented on those remarks on sentence as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The remarks on sentence very carefully and fully, if I may say with respect, composed by his Honour Judge Johnston, seemed to indicate that he was influenced very deeply by the prisoner’s physical condition; the fact that his prospects of re-offending had been markedly reduced; the fact that he had undergone this orchidectomy; the fact that he was suffering very substantial health problems at that time because of the difficulty of treating his concurrent conditions of urethral restriction, psoriasis, radiation burns and the like. His Honour – and again I say this with great respect – recorded the fact that the offences with which he was dealing had been breaches of previously granted bonds, and consequently, were extremely aggravated, given the history of bonds and their repeated breaches, but nonetheless concluded that a non-custodial sentence was an appropriate one”. 
        
       
      
    20 In his remarks on sentence his Honour noted that there had been no Crown appeal from any of the previous sentencing decisions made in 1988, 1990 and 1997 and that the offences for which he was sentencing the respondent had been committed before the offences for which the respondent had previously been sentenced and, unlike the offences for which Judge Herron and Judge Johnston had sentenced the respondent, were not aggravated by having been committed in breach of a recognisance. 
     
      
    21 Towards the close of his remarks on sentence Judge Freeman addressed what appeared to his Honour to be a crucial issue. At p 10 of his remarks on sentence his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “What I am concerned with now is the very great tension which exists between my own view of what offences of this nature require in terms of the imposition of full-time custody on the one hand and the fact that even worse offences, many of them committed in circumstances of aggravation, have been dealt with by three senior judges in the past. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst I am not bound by their decisions, I must avoid the impression or appearance at least, of second-guessing them and imposing what, to my mind, would have been an appropriate sentence, lest it appear that I’m sentencing him for the whole range of his gross misbehaviour over the last 20 years and not just for these offences involving (the complainant)”. 
        
       
      
    22 At p 11 of his remarks on sentence his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        So let me make it clear. I would have, myself, sent him to full-time custody, for these offences alone, occurring in 1981 through to 1985. I do not regard delay as requiring me to depart from that stance. I do not regard his age, at almost 66, as requiring such an extraordinary allowance as to cause me to depart from that stance. I do not regard the delay which has taken place (in the circumstances in which it has taken place) as requiring adjustment of that initial outlook. I am persuaded virtually solely by his subsequent history and the way in which it has been dealt with by the courts, that I should stay my hand from incarcerating him immediately and for a long period of time”. 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Nonetheless, at least the imposition of a term of imprisonment is necessary, in my view, to mark the seriousness of these offences and to give at least the appearance of the court doing that which it is required to do: act in the protection of the children of our community against predators such as this prisoner. In all the circumstances, I propose to stay the operation of those sentences”. 
        
       
      
    24 On this appeal the principal submissions made by the Crown were as follows. 
     
      
    25 It was submitted by the Crown that in sentencing the respondent the sentencing judge had failed to comply with the principle of sentencing stated in the well known passage in the joint judgment of McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 (45):- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence as well, of course, as questions of totality”. 
        
       
      
    26 It was contended by the Crown that the five offences for which the respondent was sentenced differed in their objective seriousness, the second offence being objectively more serious than the other offences and the third and fifth offences being objectively more serious than the first and fourth offences. Consequently, if Judge Freeman had complied with the sentencing principle stated in Pearce and fixed appropriate sentences for each offence, he would have imposed sentences of different lengths for the various offences. However, his Honour had imposed sentences of the same length for all of the offences. Furthermore, if his Honour had fixed an appropriate sentence for the second offence, the sentence for that offence should have exceeded two years and it would not have been open to Judge Freeman to suspend the execution of such a sentence (s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). 
     
      
    27 It was submitted that there had been a further contravention of the principle of sentencing stated in Pearce in that, notwithstanding that the offences had all been committed against the same complainant, they had been committed at different times, at different places and consisted of different conduct by the respondent and, consequently, there should have been some cumulation or partial cumulation of the sentences for the offences, yet Judge Freeman had made all the sentences fully concurrent. 
     
      
    28 It was further submitted by the Crown that Judge Freeman, having formed a view of his own as to what sentences should be imposed on the respondent for the offences for which he was sentencing the respondent, should not have allowed his sentencing decision to be controlled, at least to the extent to which it was, by the previous sentencing decisions of other judges who had sentenced the respondent for other offences. By allowing himself to be persuaded “virtually solely” by the previous sentencing decisions to stay his hand and not impose sentences of imprisonment to be served immediately, which his Honour considered that the offences required, his Honour had ended up imposing sentences which were manifestly inadequate to reflect the objective seriousness of the offences. Even if it was unlikely that the respondent, because of his ill health, would re-offend, it was still necessary for sentences to be imposed on the respondent which would give effect to the need for retribution and general deterrence. 
     
      
    29 It was acknowledged by the Crown that no Crown appeal had been brought from any of the previous sentencing decisions but the Crown pointed out that there are a number of constraints on the bringing of a Crown appeal against sentence and because no Crown appeal has been brought it cannot necessarily be inferred that a sentence should be regarded as not having been manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    30 Counsel for the respondent submitted that Judge Freeman had been entitled to reason as he had in his remarks on sentence. It was contended that for Judge Freeman to have ignored the previous sentences imposed on the respondent for worse offences would have led the public to question whether justice was being properly administered. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    31 The present case is unusual and indeed extraordinary. Usually, when a judge is sentencing an offender who has previously been sentenced by other judges, the judge is sentencing for an offence or offences which were committed by the offender after the offences for which the offender has previously been sentenced. 
     
      
    32 On the appeal neither counsel was able to refer the Court to any authority which was in point or of any real assistance. Counsel for the respondent did refer to the decision of this Court in R v Baxter (unreported, NSWCCA 26 May 1994) in which a Crown appeal against sentence was dismissed. However, Baxter is clearly distinguishable from the present case. In Baxter the Court of Criminal Appeal held that it had been within the discretion of the sentencing judge not to impose custodial sentences for three offences of committing an act of indecency, because the offender had previously been sentenced in Victoria to non-custodial sentences for four offences, including offences of indecent assault, committed against the same victim and to have imposed custodial sentences for the less serious New South Wales offences would have jeopardised a continuing course of psychiatric treatment the respondent was undergoing, with beneficial results, pursuant to the sentences imposed in Victoria. 
     
      
    33 In his remarks on sentence Judge Freeman clearly stated the process of reasoning by which he arrived at the sentences he ultimately imposed. Apart from the previous sentences passed on the respondent, he would have sentenced the respondent to lengthy sentences of full-time custody to be served immediately. However, “virtually solely” because of the previous sentences passed on the respondent, his Honour refrained from imposing the sentences which he otherwise would have imposed and imposed sentences of imprisonment for two years only, the execution of which he ordered to be suspended. 
     
      
    34 In my opinion, and without my needing to decide whether it was permissible for his Honour to have at least some regard to the sentences previously passed on the respondent, it was an error for his Honour to permit his sentencing decision to be controlled, to the extent to which it was, by the previous sentences passed on the respondent. The function his Honour was required to perform remained the function of imposing sentences on the respondent which his Honour considered to be proper sentences, having regard to all the objective and subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    35 There are, of course, some principles requiring consistency in sentencing. There is a general principle that a sentence passed on a particular offender for a particular offence should be consistent with the range of sentences passed on offenders generally for that kind of offence. There is also the principle of attaining parity and avoiding disparity in the sentencing of co-offenders. However, the Court was not referred to any authority which would support any principle that, if a particular offender has been sentenced leniently in the past, he should continue to be sentenced leniently. 
     
      
    36 Judge Freeman’s apprehension expressed in his remarks on sentence that, if he were to impose the sentences he considered appropriate, it might appear that he was sentencing the respondent, not only for the five offences committed against the complainant, but for the whole of the respondent’s criminal conduct over the previous twenty years, was, in my opinion, unnecessary. His Honour could have made it quite clear in his remarks on sentence, as he in fact did, that he was sentencing the respondent only for the five offences committed against the complainant. 
     
      
    37 Having decided that, because of the previous sentencing decisions, he would not impose lengthy custodial sentences to be served immediately and that the sentences he imposed would be suspended, his Honour made no real attempt to comply with the sentencing principle stated in Pearce. 
     
      
    38 I have held that error occurred in the sentencing of the respondent. However, the Crown appeal was brought on the ground that the sentences were manifestly inadequate and the question remains of whether the sentences were manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    39 In the extraordinary circumstances of this case I have formed the conclusion that this Court should not find that the sentences were manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    40 Apart from considerations which apply to Crown appeals generally, I rely particularly on the respondent’s many health problems, which I have discussed earlier in this judgment and which I consider should be given greater weight than Judge Freeman did. His Honour referred in his remarks on sentence to Dr Knight’s evidence about the risk of the respondent contracting an infection (which Dr Knight said would be life threatening), if he was required to serve a custodial sentence and share communal facilities. There was no countervailing evidence and no good reason for rejecting Dr Knight’s evidence and, indeed, Judge Freeman did not reject Dr Knight’s evidence. The only comment Judge Freeman made, apparently without any evidentiary foundation, was that he did not consider that it would be beyond the capacity of the Corrections Health Service to treat the respondent (if he did contract an infection). 
     
      
    41 Other matters which I have taken into account include the age of the respondent, the unlikelihood of his re-offending after the bilateral orchidectomy and the delays which have occurred in the criminal proceedings brought against him. 
     
      
    42 I also take into account that the offences were committed between 1981 and 1985 and it is necessary to apply, so far as possible, the principle of sentencing stated in R v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368, namely that a sentencing court should take into account sentencing practice at the date of the commission of an offence, when sentencing practice has since moved adversely to the offender. It was submitted, and I accept, that, if the respondent had been sentenced in about 1985 in accordance with sentencing practice then applying, he probably would have received a less severe sentence than would now be imposed for similar offences committed recently. 
     
      
    43 In my opinion, this Court should dismiss the Crown appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    44 HIDDEN J: I agree with the order proposed by James J and with his Honour’s reasons.  
     
      
    45 I can understand that the sentencing judge perceived an incongruity in dealing the respondent for his first set of offences much more severely than he had been dealt with by other judges for subsequent offences. In my view, the leniency extended to the respondent for those subsequent offences was a relevant matter. However, I agree with James J that it was not entitled to the determinative significance which his Honour gave it. 
     
      
    46 BELL J: I agree with James J.

     ISLAND MARITIME LIMITED v BARBARA FILIPOWSKI 
      
     SACHIN KULKARNI v BARBARA FILIPOWSKI 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SULLY J: I agree with Dunford J. 
     
      
    2 DUNFORD J: These are two applications for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 from the judgment of Bignold J in the Land and Environment Court on 9 July 2004: Filipowski v Island Maritime Ltd & Anor [2004] NSWLEC 366 refusing applications for permanent stays of proceedings in prosecutions brought against the applicants as owner and master respectively of the “Pacific Onyx” for contravention of s 8(1) of the Marine Pollution Act 1987 alleging a discharge of oil into State waters on 14 November 1999.  
     
      
    3 The stays of proceedings were sought on the grounds that the prosecutions constituted a breach of the rules against double jeopardy and were an abuse of process because similar proceedings against the same parties had previously been brought under s 27(1) of the Act and had been dismissed by Talbot J: Filipowski v Island Maritime Ltd & Anor [2003] NSWLEC 59, and on account of the delay that had occurred between the subject discharge and the institution of the current proceedings. 
     
      
    4 The Marine Pollution Act 1987 (the Act) is directed to protecting the sea and other waters from pollution by oil and other noxious substances discharged from ships. It has since been amended by the Marine Legislation Amendment (Marine Pollution) Act 2002, No 75, but as at 14 November 1999 the relevant provisions included the following. 
     
      
    5 Part 2 (ss 7-13) was headed “Pollution by oil”, and s 8, so far as material, was as follows:  
     
      
       
      Prohibition of discharge of oil or oily mixtures into State waters 
       
        
        (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (4), if any discharge of oil or of an oily mixture occurs from a ship into State waters, the master and the owner of the ship and any other person whose act caused the discharge are each guilty of an offence punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding:  
         
          
          (a) if the offender is a natural person—2 000 penalty points, or 
           
          (b) if the offender is a body corporate—10 000 penalty points  
          
         
        (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to the discharge of oil or of an oily mixture from a ship:  
         
          
          (a) for the purpose of securing the safety of a ship or saving life at sea, 
           
          (b) if the oil or oily mixture, as the case may be, escaped from the ship in consequence of damage, other than intentional damage, to the ship or its equipment, and all reasonable precautions were taken after the occurrence of the damage or the discovery of the discharge for the purpose of preventing or minimising the escape of oil or oily mixture, as the case may be, 
           
          (c) in the case of an oily mixture, if the discharge was for the purpose of combating specific pollution incidents in order to minimise the damage from pollution and was approved by a prescribed officer, or 
           
          (d) if the discharge was authorised by the Minister for training purposes. 
          
         
        
       
      
    6 Subsection (3) defined “intentional damage” for the purposes of subs 2(b) and subs (4) provided other defences relating to discharges at sea, not relevant to the present case. Subs (6) was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (6) In proceedings for an offence against subsection (1) in relation to a ship, it is sufficient for the prosecution to allege and prove that a discharge of oil or of an oily mixture occurred from the ship into State waters, but it is a defence if it is proved that, by virtue of subsection (2) or (4), subsection (1) does not apply in relation to the discharge. 
        
       
      
    7 Part 3 of the Act (ss 14-24) related to “Pollution by noxious substances”, whilst Part 4 (ss 25-32) was headed “Pollution relating to transfer operations”. Section 25 contained a number of definitions for the purposes of the Part including “appropriate person” and “transfer operation”, whilst ss 26 and 27 were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        26 Discharges to which Part applies 
        
        
        This Part applies to a discharge of oil or of an oily mixture or of a liquid substance or of a mixture containing a liquid substance into State waters:  
        (a) from a ship or place on land in or in connection with a transfer operation, or 
        (b) from any apparatus or purpose-built pipeline used in or in connection with a transfer operation, whether or not it is being so used,but does not apply:  
        (c) to a discharge that occurs on the landward side of the first isolating valve on land of any apparatus or purpose-built pipeline used in or in connection with a transfer operation, whether or not it is being so used, or at any other place prescribed for the purposes of this section, or 
        (d) to a discharge to which Part 2 or 3 applies. 
        27 Prohibition of discharges to which Part applies 
        
       
       
       (1) If a discharge to which this Part applies occurs, each appropriate person in relation to the discharge, and any other person whose act caused the discharge, are each guilty of an offence punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding:  
        
         
        (a) if the offender is a natural person – 2 000 penalty units, or 
        (b) if the offender is a body corporate – 10 000 penalty units 
        
        
       (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a discharge:  
        
         
        (a) if the discharge was for the purpose of combating specific pollution incidents in order to minimise the damage from pollution and was approved by a prescribed officer, or 
        (b) if the discharge was carried out by the holder of a licence under the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 in accordance with that licence. 
        
       
      
    8 Following an alleged discharge of oil from the “Pacific Onyx” into State waters at Botany Bay on 14 November 1999, summonses were filed on 20 February 2002 against each of the applicants charging them with having committed an offence against s 27 of the Act. They each pleaded not guilty and the charges were by consent heard together by Talbot J on 20 and 21 February 2003. At the conclusion of the prosecution case, defence counsel submitted that there was no case to answer on two separate bases: first, that the prosecution evidence did not establish that the discharge had occurred in connection with a transfer operation within the meaning of s 26(a) of the Act and second, that the discharge was not a discharge to which Part 4 of the Act (including s 27) applied.  
     
      
    9 In a reserved judgment delivered 7 March 2003, Talbot J dismissed each summons, upholding the no case submission on the sole ground that, having regard to the provisions of s 26(d), the offence created by s 27 did not apply to a discharge of oil into State waters where that discharge was a discharge to which Part 2 or 3 of the Act applied, that the prosecution evidence had established a breach of s 8 (in Part 2), and accordingly there was no offence under s 27.  
     
      
    10 Eventually, the current summonses were issued on 18 November 2003 alleging breaches of s 8(1), and by a Notice of Motion filed 22 December 2003 the applicants sought, inter alia, orders that the proceedings be permanently stayed on the ground that they constituted an abuse of process. Bignold J dismissed the Motion, hence the present applications for leave to appeal.  
     
      
    11 Grounds of appeal 1 and 2 relate specifically to the issue of double jeopardy and may be considered together. They are: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) That the learned judge erred in concluding that the elements of a charge under s 8 of the Marine Pollution Act 1987 are not included in the elements of a charge under s 27 of that Act. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) That the learned judge erred in considering that the applicant was not in jeopardy of conviction on the charge brought pursuant to s 27 in the proceedings concluded before Talbot J on 7 March 2003. 
        
       
      
    12 The test for determining whether a prosecution offends rules against double jeopardy, particularly in their application to the pleas in bar of autrefois convict and autrefois acquit was described by the majority (McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ) in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [18] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear that the plea in bar goes to offences the elements of which are the same as, or are included in, the elements of the offence for which the accused has been tried to conviction or acquittal.” 
        
       
      
    13 The majority then considered whether it was sufficient that the previous offence was “substantially” the same, or an offence the “gist” or “gravamen” of which was the same “matter” or the same set of facts, but after a discussion of the authorities, concluded that the only relevant considerations were the “elements” of the two offences. Gummow J agreed with the majority on this point at [63] and as did Kirby J at [125]. The statement at [24] that the test is whether  
     
      
       
        
        “the elements of the offences charged are identical or in which all the elements of one offence are wholly included in the other 
        ” 
        
       
       
      might tend to suggest that it does not matter which offence is prosecuted first, but those words must be read in the context of that particular case where both offences were charged in the same indictment. In the context of successive prosecutions, the test is as set out in [18] quoted above.  
      
    14 It is not sufficient that the elements of one charge are all included in the other; in the case of autrefois acquit it must be shown that all the elements of the charge of which the defendant has been acquitted are included in the elements of the second charge. The example given during argument was that an acquittal on a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm would not prevent the bringing of a fresh charge of common assault, although a prior conviction for common assault would prevent a subsequent prosecution for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 
     
      
    15 Pearce v The Queen was recently applied by this Court in Adler v The Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2004] NSWCCA 352. See also State Pollution Control Commission v Tallow Products Pty Limited (1992) 29 NSWLR 517, Connolly v The Director of Public Prosecutions [1964] AC 1254 at 1305-6.16 The offence created by s 8 might be described, for want of a better word, as a “general” offence. The offence is committed whenever there is a discharge of oil or an oily mixture from a ship into State waters, but there are a number of defences available as set out in subss (2) and (4), and in this regard, particular reference might be made to subs (2)(b) which provides a defence if the escape was in consequence of unintentional damage to the ship or its equipment. The prosecution is not required in proof of its case to negative any of the available defences, proof of which lies on the defendant: s 8(6).  
     
      
    17 Section 27 (read with s 26) on the other hand creates a more “particular” offence dealing specifically with “transfer operations” (as defined in s 25) and is committed whenever there is a discharge, not only of oil or an oily mixture, but also of a liquid substance (which does not include oil: s 25(1)) from a ship or place on land or in connection with a transfer operation etc; and the defences available are much more limited: s 27(2). It follows that although the penalties for offences under s 27 are the same as for offences under s 8, the liability is much stricter.  
     
      
    18 It is apparently for this reason that the Act limits liability under s 27 to cases which do not come within s 8 by providing in s 26 (2)(d) that Part 4 (ss 25-32) does not apply to a discharge to which Part 2 (or 3) applies. Where s 8 applies, a defendant is not to be deprived of the wider range of defences available by being prosecuted under s 27.  
     
      
    19 Even disregarding s 26(2)(d), it can be seen that the elements of the current charges under s 8 are: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) a discharge 
         
        (b) of oil or an oily mixture 
         
        (c) from a ship 
         
        (d) into State waters 
        
       
       
      whilst the elements of the earlier charges under s 27 (omitting immaterial alternatives) are: 
       
       
        
        (a) a discharge 
         
        (b) of oil or an oily mixture 
         
        (c) from a ship 
         
        (d) into State waters 
         
        (e) in, or in connection with, a transfer operation 
        
       
      
    20 It follows that the elements of the two charges are not the same and the elements of the charges in respect of which the applicants have been acquitted are not all included in the elements of the second or current charges, and so pleas of autrefois acquit are not available. 
     
      
    21 The respondent’s position becomes only stronger when one takes into account the provisions of s 26(d) and the wording of s 27 which is the section creating the offence. There is only an offence under s 27 if it is a “discharge to which this Part applies”, and if it is a discharge to which Part 2 (including s 8) applies, Part 4 does not apply, and no offence is committed under s 27. 
     
      
    22 It is idle to talk of whether the same conduct violates two distinct statutory provisions when one provision expressly excludes conduct which violates the other, as is the effect of s 26(d). The discharge into State waters in respect of which the defendants had been charged under s 27 was not a discharge to which Part 4 applied because it was a discharge to which Part 2 applied. Accordingly, ground 1 fails. 
     
      
    23 It has also been said that before a plea of autrefois acquit can be available it must also be shown that the defendant has actually been in jeopardy on the earlier charge, and if the earlier charge has been dismissed because it was defective or because as a matter of law the evidence available to the prosecution could not support a conviction, the defendant has not been in jeopardy; similarly where there has been no consideration on the merits: Spencer-Bower: Res Judicata (3rd ed – 1996) at para 59, and in Broome v Chenoweth (1946) 73 CLR 583 at 600 Dixon J said:  
     
      
       
        
        “The old rule was that, if the defendant could have taken a fatal objection to the earlier indictment or information, his discharge or acquittal thereon could not afford a bar.” 
        
       
      
    24 This aspect of the rule against double jeopardy was discussed in some detail in R v Dabhade [1993] QB 329, particularly as to in what circumstances a defendant is regarded as having been in “jeopardy” in the earlier proceedings; but see also R v G [2001] 2 Cr App R 615. Although the learned primary judge referred to this aspect of the rule and was inclined to the view that the applicants were not in jeopardy of conviction under s 27 before Talbot J, he also made it clear that he was not deciding the case on this basis: [2004] NSWLEC 366 at [63]. It therefore becomes unnecessary to consider ground 2 any further. 
     
      
    25 It is now well established that even when the plea of autrefois acquit is not available, successive prosecutions arising out of the same facts may still constitute an abuse of process justifying a permanent stay of proceedings: Pearce v The Queen at [29], [117], The Queen v Carroll (2002) 213 CLR 635 at [131]; and there are a variety of other circumstances which alone or in combination may also constitute an abuse of process justifying a permanent stay. 26 The principles governing such applications have been set out in cases such as Jago v The District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23 and Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378. They were referred to by the learned primary judge in his judgment, and bear repeating. In Walton v Gardiner at 392-3 the majority (Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its proceedings on grounds of abuse of process extends to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the court, which exist to administer justice with fairness and impartiality, may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness. Thus, it has long been established that, regardless of the propriety of the purpose of the person responsible for their institution and maintenance, proceedings will constitute an abuse of process if they can be clearly seen to be foredoomed to fail. Again, proceedings within the jurisdiction of a court will be unjustifiably oppressive and vexatious of an objecting defendant, and will constitute an abuse of process, if that court is, in all the circumstances of the particular case, a clearly inappropriate forum to entertain them. Yet again, proceedings before a court should be stayed as an abuse of process if, notwithstanding that the circumstances do not give rise to an estoppel, their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive for the reason that it is sought to litigate a new a case which has already been disposed of by earlier proceedings. The jurisdiction of a superior court in such a case is correctly described as the inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which, although not inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people”. (references omitted) 
         
        
       
      At 395 their Honours also said: 
       
       
        
        “As was pointed out in  
        Jago 
         the question whether criminal proceedings should be permanently stayed on abuse of process grounds falls to be determined by a weighing process involving a subjective balancing of a variety of factors and considerations. Among those factors and considerations are the requirements of fairness to the accused, the legitimate public interest in the disposition of charges of serious offences and in the conviction of those guilty of crime, and the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice.” 
        
       
      
    27 In relation to delay, at 394 their Honours quoted what Deane J had said in Jago: 
     
      
       
        
        “The power of a court to stay proceedings in a case of unreasonable delay is not confined to the case where the effect of the delay is that any subsequent trial must necessarily be an unfair one. Circumstances can arise in which such delay produces a situation in which any continuation of the proceedings would, of itself, be so unfairly and unjustifiably oppressive that it would constitute an abuse of the court’s process. Multiple prosecutions arising out of the one set of events but separated by many years or a renewed charge brought years after the dismissal of earlier proceedings for want of prosecution could, in a case where the relevant material had been available to the prosecution from the outset and depending on the particular facts, provide examples. Where such circumstances exist, the power of a court to prevent abuse of its process extends to the making of an order that proceedings be permanently stayed.” 
        
       
      
    28 As the jurisdiction to grant a permanent stay is discretionary, an appeal against a refusal to grant such stay is governed by the well known principles established by cases such as House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. 
     
      
    29 The appellants submitted to Bignold J that the current prosecutions involved an abuse of process and should be permanently stayed on the following grounds:  
     
      
       
        
        (i) in facing a different charge they were being vexed by a repeated attempt to convict them of the same offence or another charge arising out of the same events; 
         
         
        (ii) it had been open to the Prosecutor in the earlier prosecution to have sought to amend the charge by charging the Defendants with an offence against s 8, but the Prosecutor chose not to seek amendment of the charge; and 
         
         
        (iii) by the time the present prosecutions were filed, some four years had elapsed since the commission of the alleged offence. 
        
       
      
    30 It is convenient to deal with grounds of appeal 3, 4, 5 and 6 together. They are: 
     
      
       
        
        (3) The learned judge erred in considering that the absence of a time limitation on the bringing of a prosecution was a relevant factor to be taken into account. 
         
         
        (4) The learned judge erred in making a finding that the “present charge (that is the charge under s 8) has arisen directly out of Justice Talbot’s decision to uphold the defendants’ no case to answer submission on the s 27 charge”. 
         
         
        (5) The learned judge erred in finding that the fact that the applicant has “been on notice of the discharge incident from when it occurred” was a relevant factor in determining the extent of prejudice to which the applicant has been subjected. 
         
         
        (6) The learned judge erred in failing to give the applicants the benefit of the full force and effect of their acquittal on the s 27 charge before Justice Talbot. 
        
       
      
    31 For the reasons given above, I am satisfied that the appellants are not being prosecuted for the same offence, and Bignold J was correct to so hold (at [76]). It is true that the present charges arise out of the same set of facts as the earlier charges, but the applicants on their no case submission had shown that because the case fell within s 8, the charges under s 27 were inappropriate and unsustainable. There had been no determination on the merits and there was no attempt to punish the applicants twice for the same offence; and as far as I can ascertain, the relationship between ss 8 and 27 had not previously been the subject of judicial consideration.  
     
      
    32 It is true that no application to amend was made on behalf of the prosecution, either following the letter from the applicant’s solicitors of 17 April 2002 asserting that the facts and circumstances did not fall within s 27, or during the hearing. The letter did not indicate why it was asserted that s 27 was inappropriate and did not invite an amendment, and the question of amendment does not seem to have been considered during the no case submission before Talbot J. In these circumstances, I do not consider that the mere institution of the s 8 prosecutions either alone or in conjunction with other circumstances constituted an abuse of process.33 As to ground 3, his Honour noted in para [78] that the Marine Pollution Act does not impose any time limitation for the prosecution of offences before the Land and Environment Court. It may be that his Honour apparently intended to contrast it with s 54 which does impose a time limit of 2 years for prosecutions in the Local Court. However, there is nothing in the judgment to suggest that his Honour took the lack of a time limitation into account as a factor in the exercise of his discretion. Of course, if there had been a statutory limitation the claim for abuse of process on the ground of delay would have been irrelevant.  
     
      
    34 It is true, as Bignold J observed, that the s 8 charge arose directly out of Talbot J’s decision to uphold the defendants’ no case to answer on the s 27 charge (see ground 4), but this was merely an observation of fact. It did not imply that this was in any way the fault of the applicants and merely drew attention to the fact that there had been no determination on the merits.  
     
      
    35 The main ground in support of the claim of abuse of process, apart from the double jeopardy issue, was the issue of delay. It is therefore necessary to consider the whole history of the prosecutions.  
     
      
    36 The discharge having allegedly occurred on 14 November 1999, the master and crew were interviewed the following day and, following the deposit of a security undertaking in accordance with s 52V of the Act in the sum of $500,000, the “Pacific Onyx” was allowed to leave port; but it was not until 20 February 2002 (over 2 years later) that the summonses for breach of s 27 were filed in the Land and Environment Court. 
     
      
    37 On 17 April 2002, the applicants’ solicitors wrote to the respondent’s solicitors stating that their clients intended to plead not guilty as they considered that the facts and circumstances of the incident did not fall within s 27. The proceedings were heard on 20 and 21 February 2003 and on the latter day, Senior Counsel for the applicants made the submission earlier referred to, which was upheld by Talbot J in his judgment on 7 March 2003 dismissing the summons in each case.  
     
      
    38 Following the dismissal of the summonses, the applicants’ solicitors wrote on 9 April 2003 requesting the return of the security undertaking, but in reply the respondent’s solicitors pointed out that they had 3 months in which to lodge an appeal, and by Notice of Motion filed 14 April, the respondent sought an order that questions of law be submitted to this Court for determination. On 6 May 2003, the respondent was directed to file and serve the questions it intended to submit for determination no later than 14 days before the next hearing date on 1 August 2003. Notwithstanding a number of promptings from the applicants’ solicitors, the respondent failed to provide such questions and ultimately, on 30 July 2003 notified the Court and the applicants’ solicitors that she no longer intended proceeding with the application to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  
     
      
    39 Not surprisingly, the applicants’ solicitors again by letter dated 30 July requested the return of the security undertaking, but the respondent’s solicitors refused to do so stating that the prosecutor would shortly be issuing proceedings against the applicants pursuant to s 8 of the Act. It was however, not until 28 October 2003 that the fresh summonses were filed. The delay from July to October was partly explained by the perceived need to have all the affidavits re-sworn for the fresh proceedings, and some of the deponents were difficult to relocate. The result of this was that the current prosecutions were commenced almost 4 years after the commission of the alleged offences.  
     
      
    40 Such delay reveals a desultory approach to the prosecutions which is to be deplored. Notwithstanding the applicants’ solicitors letter of 17 April 2003, the respondent and those advising her made no effort to ascertain the basis of the assertion, but pressed on with the prosecutions under s 27. After those proceedings were dismissed by Talbot J, the respondent and those advising her first considered an appeal by way of Stated case but, after wasting more time, changed their minds and decided to lay the fresh charges, which themselves took another 3 months to be instituted. This ignores the initial delay between the date of the alleged discharge and the commencement of the original proceedings in February 2002, a delay of over 2 years, which delay remains completely unexplained.  
     
      
    41 Persons being prosecuted for serious offences, and these offences each carry maximum penalties of $1.1 million in the case of a corporation and $220,000 in the case of an individual, are entitled to have any charges being preferred against them instituted promptly. This is even more so where the Prosecutor is holding a security undertaking for half a million dollars. His Honour dealt with delay at [77] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although there had been a lapse of four years from the date of the alleged offence until the laying of the present prosecutions that delay is in large part taken up by the laying of the original charge and the prosecution of the charge against each Defendant. The Defendants did not allege any particular prejudice by dint of delay and they have been on notice of the discharge incident from when it occurred (when it was investigated by the Port officials) and had been aware of the Prosecution evidence when the first charges were laid against them.” 
        
       
      
    42 Ground 5 is that his Honour erred in finding the fact that the applicant had “been on notice of the discharge incident from when it occurred” was a relevant factor in determining the extent of prejudice to which the applicants had been subjected. 
     
      
    43 Delay of itself does not constitute abuse of process or justify a permanent stay unless it can be shown that the delay is such that the defendant will suffer such prejudice as cannot be otherwise remedied and which will result in an unfair trial: Jago at 34, 59-60 and where delay is relied on it is necessary to consider whether, or to what extent the defendant is prejudiced by the delay. His Honour took into account that the applicants did not allege any prejudice to them as a result of the delay, and as a matter tending against any prejudice, the fact that they were on notice of the discharge from the time of its occurrence, and had known of the evidence to be led against them from the time of the laying of the s 27 charges. It was proper for his Honour to have regard to these matters in considering whether the applicants were prejudiced by the delay and ground 5 is not made out. 
     
      
    44 Finally ground 6 asserts that his Honour erred in failing to give the applicants the benefit of the full force in effect of their acquittals on the s 27 charges before Talbot J. 
     
      
    45 It is now well established that an acquittal may not be questioned or called into question by any evidence which would overturn or tend to overturn an acquittal, which must be accepted in future cases as incontrovertibly correct: Garnett v The Queen (1977) 139 CLR 437 at 445, The Queen v Storey (1978) 140 CLR 364, The Queen v Carroll (2002) 213 CLR 635. 
     
      
    46 In Carroll, the respondent had given evidence in his trial for murder denying that he had killed the deceased and had been acquitted. Years later, he was charged with perjury arising out of such evidence on the ground that in fact he had killed the deceased. The subsequent proceedings were permanently stayed because, although the charges were not the same and accordingly the ordinary principles of autrefois acquit and double jeopardy were not applicable, the crucial issue in each case was whether the respondent had killed the deceased; and a guilty verdict in the perjury trial would directly controvert the acquittal in the earlier murder trial, which the Crown Prosecutor conceded was the object of bringing the perjury charge. 
     
      
    47 The position here is quite different. The s 8 charges do not seek to controvert the acquittals on the s 27 charges, but rather accept them, as the ground for acquittal on the s 27 charges was that the evidence for the prosecution established that the discharge was one to which Part 2 of the Act applied and therefore Part 4 did not apply, the ground for acquittal on the s 27 charges.48 Accordingly, I am satisfied that none of the grounds of appeal has been made out and it has not been shown that his Honour, in exercising his discretion, took into account irrelevant matters or failed to take into account relevant ones. If I had been called upon to exercise the discretion myself, I would have come to the same conclusion. 
     
      
    49 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeals. 
     
      
    50 HIDDEN J: I agree with Dunford J

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The Appellants appeared for trial before Justice Studdert, and a jury, in April and May 2003, on three counts, charging them with: 
     
      
       
      (a) The murder of Shane Cole; 
       
       
      (b) Robbery in company with infliction of grievous bodily harm upon Shane Cole; and 
       
       
      (c) Robbery in company with wounding of Shane Phillips. 
       
      
    2 Each offence is alleged to have occurred on 3 March 2000, at Colies Cafe Leumeah, of which business Shane Cole was the owner.  
     
      
    3 The Appellants, who had each been arrested on 15 October 2001, were convicted of all three offences. They were sentenced by his Honour on 2 October 2003 as follows: 
     
      
       
      Mehajer 
       
       
      Imprisonment for 18 years with a non-parole period of 13 years and 6 months, each commencing on 30 July 2003 for the offence of murder, and a concurrent fixed term of 5 years for the offence of robbery in company with grievous bodily harm.  
       
       
      A fixed term of 4 years imprisonment was imposed in respect of the offence of robbery in company with wounding to commence on 30 January 2003. The effective overall sentence was accordingly one of 18 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 14 years.  
       
       
      Jacobs 
       
       
      Imprisonment for 16 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 12 years 6 months for the offence of murder, and a fixed term of imprisonment for 5 years for the offence of robbery in company with grievous bodily harm, each to commence on 15 April 2002.  
       
       
      A fixed term of imprisonment for 4 years was imposed for the offence of robbery in company with wounding, commencing on 15 October 2001. The effective overall sentence was one of imprisonment for 17 years with a non-parole period of 13 years.  
       
       
      FACTS 
       
       
      Sightings in the Vicinity of the Cafe Prior to the Offences 
       
      
    4 It was the Crown case that the Appellants, John Jacobs and Mazin Mehajer, went to the vicinity of the cafe during the early part of the afternoon of 3 March 2000, either to case the premises, or to look for Mr Cole, who was a known supplier of drugs. Two men were seen by Kelly Rideout, from her office, walking down from Hollylea Road a laneway behind the cafe at about 1:45PM, an unusual time she said, for people to be in that area. She described them as having been 23 to 25 years of age. One she said was stocky, 170 to 175 cms in height, Italian or Lebanese in appearance, with short hair, and wearing board shorts down to the knees, a white singlet and wrap around sunglasses. The other man was also wearing shorts.  
     
      
    5 Later that afternoon, at about 4 PM she saw those men in the back lane again walking towards Hollylea Road, although she said that they were now accompanied by a third man. James Spry, who was with Kelly Rideout at this time, also saw these men. One he described as fairly big fellow with a Middle Eastern or olive complexion, who was about 6 feet tall, in his early to mid twenties, with black hair, and who was wearing olive green knee length shorts and a white singlet. The other two men were shorter, but he had no further recollection of their appearance. He said that he had seen these men earlier that afternoon, he thought at about 3:15 PM, walking along the road in the direction of the Red Rooster restaurant.  
     
      
    6 Roxanne Cassar who was with Ms Rideout and Mr Spry, also saw these men, after Ms Rideout drew attention to their presence. She similarly recalled that one of them was aged between 20 and 30 years, was about 5 foot 8 inches in height, stocky with streaked light brown hair, and wearing cargo shorts or something similar.  
     
      
    7 The three men were also noticed by Jeffrey Bond, the owner of a squash and tennis racquet repair business, which was located near the cafe. He said that he saw them in the laneway at about 3:30 PM. He recalled that one was wearing a singlet and looked like he had been “working out”. He said that they were “pretty big”, “strongish” men and thought that they looked “Mediterranean or possibly Arabic”.  
     
      
    8 That it was Jacobs and Mehajer who had been the first two men who were seen in the area, during the early afternoon, and that it was each of them, together with an indemnified witness, Christian Painter, who had later joined them, the Crown contended arose from the following circumstances: 
     
      
       
      (a) Painter’s evidence that during the afternoon, Mehajer, who he knew as “Mez”, had picked him up, in his car, some time after he had finished work at 2 PM, intending that they would go to the gymnasium. Mehajer introduced him to another man, who he did not know, as “John”. They drove via the freeway to Leumeah, and stopped near the Red Rooster where they had something to eat. As they passed the Colies Cafe, either Jacobs or Mehajer said “nobody there yet”. While waiting, he said, he made a telephone call to a friend (Darren Gough), which was fixed by call charge records to have been made at 4:17 PM.  
       
       
      (b) Jacob’s evidence at trial, firstly, that Mehajer had picked him up in his car, and had driven him and Painter to Leumeah, where they had driven past the cafe, and had then spent some time at the Red Rooster, before returning to the vicinity of the cafe; and secondly, that he had been wearing long board shorts while Mehajer had been wearing three-quarter length shorts and a T-shirt; 
       
       
      (c) Evidence of telephone calls having been made between services used by Jacobs and Mehajer at 11:35 AM and 1:01 PM on 3 March 2000, but not thereafter; 
       
       
      (d) Evidence of calls having been made by Mehajer to Painter’s mobile at 1:24 PM, 1:25 PM, 1:31 PM, 1:38 PM and 2:46 PM; 
       
       
      (e) Evidence that Painter’s mobile phone had been used at 2:40 PM, and had been picked up by a tower which would have placed him as still being in the Bankstown area, at the time. His next call was the one placed at 4:17 PM to Mr Gough.  
       
      
    9 This evidence was relied upon to support Painter’s evidence, and to exclude him as having been the man who had been in the company of Jacobs at the time of the first observations. It may be noted, at this stage that there was an obvious conflict between the evidence of Painter and Jacobs as to which of them Mehajer had picked up first, as to who it was who had given the directions to Leumeah, and as to who it was who made the observation “He’s not there”. To that conflict I will return. Mehajer, in his evidence, denied having been anywhere near the cafe, at any time, so that there was a stark conflict between his evidence and that of Jacobs and Painter.  
     
      
    10 In summary then, it was the Crown case that Jacobs and Mehajer had cased the premises in the early afternoon, in the expectation of robbing Mr Cole of the drugs which he kept at the cafe, and/or of the money that he would be likely to have on his person; and that they had later returned with Painter and waited for his return before implementing their plan.  
     
      
    11 That the premises were known as a place from which drugs were sold, and that Mr Cole was a known drug supplier emerged from evidence given by Shane Phillips, and also by Brendan Denning who had spoken to the deceased at the shop, and by phone on 3 March, with the intention of buying some marijuana and speed from him. His wife Robyn Cole said that on that day the deceased had paid $3000 to $4000 to Adam Ballard for moneys owing in respect of previous dealings, that he had purchased 8 oz of Amphetamine from him, and that he had then sold half of those drugs to a man named Dennis for $500, which he had placed in his wallet. 
     
      
    12 Additionally there was some evidence from Mr Cameron and Mrs Cole to the effect that after the killing, some amphetamine was found in a plastic bag on the serving counter at the cafe; and from Mr Kent and Mr Casey that the deceased had earlier that day sold something “for recreational use” in a bag to Mr Kent, who had accidentally left it at his place of work across the road from the cafe, and who had then arranged for a workmate, Mr Casey, to give it to the deceased, who was to come over to collect the package with the intention of it being returned to him. Mr Casey said that the deceased had collected the package at about 4:50 PM. Mr Phillips also said that he had been accustomed to buying cannabis from him, while Mrs Cole gave evidence confirming his drug dealing. Another witness Herbert Taru also gave evidence of seeing cannabis at the cafe, and of occasionally buying that substance from him.  
     
      
    13 Bronwyn Reeley who worked at the cafe gave evidence that the cafe, which was located in a light industrial complex, usually operated between about 7:30 AM and 2:30 PM, and that she had locked up that day at about 3 PM, taking with her the money from the day’s sales for safe keeping overnight, as was her usual practice.  
     
      
       
      The Commission of the Offences 
       
      
    14 Shane Phillips gave evidence of having met the deceased at about midday and of having initially planned to help him with some tiling work at the cafe. They changed this plan so that Mr Phillips could help the deceased clean out his garage, and restock the cafe with the soft drinks that had been stored in the garage. He borrowed some casual clothes from the deceased and after smoking some very poor quality marijuana, which left him unaffected, he helped to clean out the garage and to load the soft drink into the deceased’s car.  
     
      
    15 By his estimation, they left for the café at about 4 PM after receiving the keys from Mrs Reely who had been asked to take them over to the deceased after closing the shop. Mr Phillips left his Nokia mobile phone in the middle console of the car, on top of his clothes, while he carried the boxes of soft drink into the café. The deceased, he said, had been carrying his own mobile phone which he left on the serving counter. The deceased had with him his wallet and three gold chains, which he was wearing around his neck. 
     
      
    16 After moving all of the boxes inside, Mr Phillips, who was standing at the door, found it being pulled from his hands and saw a man with a knife. He backed into the café. This man, he described as being a bit taller than his own height of 6 foot, muscular, with dark brown collar length hair, clean shaven, with light brown skin, and of Lebanese appearance. He was about 26 years old and wore knee length black shorts with a T-shirt and yellow singlet with a white “USA” and the number 17 printed on it. This man, on the Crown case, was Mehajer. The knife which this man carried, Mr Phillips said, had a 130 mm blade with a single edge and a curved point.  
     
      
    17 He was forced to the floor by this man who said to him “Don’t touch the knife. I will use it”. He felt the knife against his throat. He heard a lot of noise, hurried footsteps, and sounds “like things collapsing…like if something was going through a box or going through some shelves.” He heard somebody ask, “Where’s the money? Where’s the cash?” He heard the deceased, whose voice sounded laboured as if he was in pain, say that his wallet was in the console of his car. Someone said “There’s more. Where is it?” He also heard the man standing over him ask the deceased, “Where’s the stash, I’m cutting your friend’s throat here”.  
     
      
    18 The man who was standing over him also asked him where the money was? He replied that he did not know, he had only come in to assist his friend for the day. He was told to crawl toward the deceased. He began to do so but froze when he reached the front counter.  
     
      
    19 He said that he could hear noises coming from the back of the café, which were consistent with a struggle occurring. He thought there were two or three voices. At one stage he heard the words “Yalla yalla”, which in Arabic can mean “hurry up”.  
     
      
    20 He began to get scared and tried to take a look at the deceased, but was kicked to the face. He heard someone say “No. Don’t”, and then realised that the assailants were leaving. He could feel blood on his face and beneath him. He saw the deceased lying on his back, in an awkward position. The deceased did not respond when he spoke to him, and he noticed that he had a cut to his face, and that his head looked to be “caved in”.  
     
      
    21 Painter gave evidence in the trial acknowledging his presence at the cafe at the time when the robberies took place, and when the deceased and Mr Phillips were attacked. His evidence was in some respects consistent with that of Mr Phillips, and in other respects inconsistent with it. It differed significantly from the account given by Jacobs, which is summarised later in these reasons.  
     
      
    22 Painter claimed that his involvement had been unplanned and minimal, and that he had not used any violence, himself.  
     
      
    23 He said that after walking back towards the cafe from the Red Rooster, either John (Jacobs) or Mehajer had said “they’re back”. He saw that there was a car pulled up in front of the café. It was his account that Mehajer went into the café first, followed by John, and then by himself. Mehajer grabbed the “taller man with a goatee and black hair” (Phillips), who was made to lie on the floor. John was holding a small man at the back of the cafe, who was sitting on the ground. Mehajer gave him some car keys and told him to have a look in the car. John stood over the other man (the deceased) who was sitting on the floor towards the back of the shop.  
     
      
    24 He said that he went outside and took a mobile phone from the car. When he returned the two victims were in the same positions. Mehajer was at the back of the shop conducting a search, while John was standing between the two men on the floor. When one of them (Phillips) made a movement as if to get up or to have a look, John kicked him in the head and told him not to move. He heard someone say “where’s your money?” and heard the deceased reply that he did not have any. 
     
      
    25 As Mehajer returned from the back of the café he punched the other man (the deceased) to the back of the head, with a “pretty strong” blow, which caused him to slump to the ground. He did not see him move again. 
     
      
    26 As they drove away there was a discussion about the phone and gold necklaces that had been taken. John had one phone, and he kept the other one, which he later gave to his girlfriend Tennelle Mitchell. He said that he did not see any knife at the scene, and that he had only seen the deceased punched once. The punch he thought had followed the kick to Mr Phillips.  
     
      
    27 Painter accepted in cross-examination that he had initially given an induced statement to the Crime Commission, which subsequently sought and obtained an indemnity for him. Later, he accepted, he had indicated that he no longer wished to give evidence against the Appellants, after which he and his brother were charged with an offence of perverting the course of justice. He later agreed to co operate by giving evidence. He eventually pleaded guilty to the charge of perverting the course of justice. That matter was dealt with in closed court and on 29 October 2001 he received a suspended sentence, as did his brother, in the expectation of him adhering to his agreement to give evidence. His indemnity in relation to the March 2000 offences was conditional upon him telling the truth at the trial. He denied having taken up the belief of the Crime Commission that he had only been incidentally involved and to have then woven a story around that by placing Jacobs in his shoes.  
     
      
    28 Mr Phillips said that after the assailants left, he phoned Scott Cameron and then the triple-0 number. The call charge records show that the call to Mr Cameron was made at 4:52 PM, and that the 000 call was made at 4:58 PM. In the various accounts which he gave to Mr Cameron and to hospital staff, he made mention of “four blokes coming out of nowhere” and of seeing a knife and gun. 29 Mr Phillips was conveyed to Campbelltown hospital where he was treated by Dr Khan. He received three stitches above his right eye and five stitches below that eye. He was also found to have sustained bruising to his head and a scratch to the Adams apple. 
     
      
    30 The deceased was treated by a neurosurgeon, Dr Van Gelden, who found that he had suffered a widespread traumatic subarrachnoid haemorrhage, as well as a pulmonary oedema consistent with the aspiration of vomit while unconscious. He died on 10 March 2000. In the opinion of Dr Van Gelden, as confirmed by Dr Langlois who carried out the post mortem examination, the cause of death was blunt trauma to the head. Dr Langlois also found that the deceased had suffered abrasions to the back of the head, and blocks of bruising or grazing to the body, which were consistent with impact by footwear. 
     
      
    31 Dr Van Gelden said that the injury to the skull, which he thought had been the cause of death, was not the sort of injury which was sustainable from a fall because of its location. Some of the injuries seen at the post mortem, Dr Langlois said, were consistent with drag injuries.32 Mr Cameron gave evidence to the effect that when Mr Phillips phoned him he had said “Four Lebs had bashed him”. When he went to the cafe he said that Mr Phillips added: “Four blokes came out of nowhere and just hammered in, they had a knife and a gun…they were kicking into Colie and they were kicking into me, that blood is mine”.  
     
      
    33 It was later found that Mr Phillip’s mobile phone had been taken from the car, and that the mobile phone, which the deceased had left on the counter, had also been taken, as had his wallet and gold chains.  
     
      
    34 Detective Sergeant Hamshire went to the cafe at about 8:30 PM, and examined the crime scene. He noticed that the drawer of the cash register was open, and that it was empty. There were areas of blood spattering in the premises, as well as smear patterns in which there were partial shoe impressions. Some of these impressions were consistent with the shoes of Mr Phillips. No shoes were ever obtained from Jacobs or Mehajer for comparison. Shoes obtained from Painter and from Cameron Scott were not consistent with the impressions.35 No fingerprints or DNA evidence was obtained to link either Appellant to the crime. Mr Phillips was not able to identify any offender from any of the photographs (including one of Mehajer), which were shown to him in January 2001 by police, who had not become alerted to the possible involvement of the Appellants until about June 2000.  
     
      
    36 About a week after the offences police created a Comfit picture using the description which Mr Phillips had given of the man who had forced him to the floor. Mr Phillips said that the Comfit picture was about 70% accurate, but he was not happy with the hair, although he could not pinpoint what was wrong with it.37 Mehajer, it was established, was a man of Middle Eastern appearance, in his mid-twenties, with a solid build, who was about 185 centimetres tall, and who was clean-shaven with short dark hair.38 The time of the commission of these offences was fixed as occurring between 4:41 PM when Mr Kent phoned the deceased and 4:52 PM, when Mr Phillips phoned Mr Cameron. 
     
      
      Recovery of the Stolen Property 
       
      
    39 Although the mobile phone of the deceased was recovered, his wallet and necklaces were not. There was evidence of calls being made to his phone after the robbery at 6:23 PM and at 6:25 PM from the mobile of Lisa Walker, which was in the possession of Jim Hegarty (also known as Pearce, by which name he will be referred hereafter), each of which was answered. Pearce, who was described as looking like a bikie with tattooed arms, had in fact visited the cafe during the morning of 3 March and had spoken to the deceased there. He had been asked to go to the cafe by Ms Reely to pay a Telstra bill for her. He returned later to give her the receipt.  
     
      
    40 There were also calls made to the deceased's mobile at 5:28 and 5:46 PM, which Denning said had been made by him. Another associate of the deceased, Paul Franklin, tried to call him on his mobile between 4:30 and 5:00 PM to inquire about the purchase of some car parts. He said that the first call was answered by someone with a strange accent, sounding like a Negro or Asian accent. Later calls were met with an engaged signal or voice mail.41 Nathan Nilsen gave evidence of purchasing this phone from Jacobs on 10 March. He activated the phone with a Vodafone account on the following day. On 14 June 2000 a search warrant was executed at his home and the phone was found. He informed police that he had purchased it from Jacobs. Police explained to him that the phone had been stolen from the deceased.42 There was also evidence of the recovery of Mr Phillips’ phone. After it was given by Painter to Tenille Mitchell, she put her own SIM card in it. Activation began on 23 March 2000. Police discovered it during a search of Painter's home on 14 June 2000. He initially claimed to have purchased it at the Green Valley Hotel, while in the company of his brother, and a friend Neil Kohler. He later acknowledged that this account had been untrue. To the significance of his initial lies to police and to the Crime Commission concerning this phone, I will return, but it was this account, and his brother’s support of it that led, later, to the pervert the course of justice charges.43 It is sufficient, at this stage, to note that he maintained this initial lie during the first two occasions that he was examined before the New South Wales Crime Commission. When it was pointed out to him that Kohler, and the telephone call records, did not support his version, he eventually agreed to make an induced statement, and was later given the indemnity.44 His account of events was contradicted by the evidence given by each of the Appellants, who also contradicted one another. To this I will return, although not before noting that it was the Crown case that Jacobs, when giving evidence, effectively placed himself in the shoes of Painter, so as to minimise his own involvement, and to pass the blame to Painter. 
     
      
      Other Possible Suspects? 
       
      
    45 During the trial, questions arose in relation to the possible involvement of members of the Rebels motorcycle club, and of other persons such as Pearce and Brendan Denning, in the offences. It would appear from the transcript that the first suggestion of motorcycle gang involvement came in the cross-examination of Painter, by counsel for Mehajer, and that it was thereafter pursued as part of Mehajer’s defence. 
     
      
    46 There was evidence that Pearce had been a friend of Bronwyn Reely, who worked at the cafe and who had been responsible for removing the cafe’s takings at the end of each day’s trading. She said that she had told Pearce, during one of his visits to the cafe, of the expected return of the deceased during the afternoon to restock the drinks fridge. Sometime after 5PM she said, she received a call from him making an arrangement to meet her at his motel. Shortly afterwards she received a call from Mrs Cole advising her of the robbery and asking her if she still had the takings. She assured Mrs Cole that she had. It may be observed that if it had been the case that the robbery had been set up by Pearce in conjunction with Ms Reely, as counsel for Mehajer suggested, it would seem unlikely that she would have said that she still had the takings.  
     
      
    47 In any event Ms Reely went to the motel in Campbelltown, where Pearce was staying. When she arrived there, she said there was a young man in the room who was around 25 years of age, about five foot eight inches in height, wearing a football jersey and shorts, and with brown hair. He left soon after her arrival. She saw some money on the bed. She informed Pearce of the robbery. While she was there, Brendan Denning, to whom the deceased had previously sold drugs, and his girlfriend arrived. Pearce sold some drugs to Denning, who had earlier attempted to contact the deceased to purchase some speed and marijuana from him .  
     
      
    48 She said that she had no knowledge of the 6:28 PM call which had been made on Lisa Walker’s mobile to the deceased’s mobile that evening.  
     
      
    49 On the following day, she said, Pearce left the hotel saying that he had to meet “Christian”. She said that she did not know Jacobs, Mehajer or Painter. Later she had gone to stay with Pearce who had moved to Taree to work in a tattoo parlour.  
     
      
    50 Denning confirmed that having been unable to meet up with the deceased on 3 March, he had bought the drugs he wanted from Pearce that night. He said that he had tried to phone the deceased a few times. When he placed a call to the deceased’s mobile, at 5:28 PM, the phone was answered by someone who was not the deceased, who said “leave your message on the fucken’ voice mail”. When he made further calls to this phone he heard someone, with a non-Australian accent, swear. He said that he did not know Jacobs or Painter, and denied any association with the Rebels or any involvement in the offences.  
     
      
    51 There was evidence of a large number of calls to the mobile of the deceased during the evening of 3 March, several of which were made by Catherine Amos who had some sort of relationship with him and who had expected to see him that night.  
     
      
    52 Pearce acknowledged his friendship with Ms Reely and his possession of Lisa Walker’s mobile on 3 March, but denied using it to ring the deceased’s mobile at 6:28 PM. He acknowledged having had an earlier discussion with the deceased about the purchase from him of some gold jewellery. He did not remember selling any drugs to Denning that night, although he recalled him visiting his hotel room with his girlfriend. He said that he had not known Denning before this night. He had no memory of the several phone calls about which he was questioned.  
     
      
    53 He similarly denied having been involved in the robbery, but acknowledged having been a drug dealer in the past, and to having been a nominee for the Rebels, five or six years earlier. He worked as a tattooist at a tattoo shop in Campbelltown owned by some members of that club. 
     
      
    54 Painter, in his evidence, denied knowing Pearce. He said that he knew of some people in the Rebels, although not personally. He had an uncle Glen Painter who occasionally rode with this club, but he did not believe that he was a member of it.  
     
      
    55 The possible involvement of the Rebels in the offences had been initially considered by the NSW Crime Commission, whose Assistant Director, James O’Connor, gave evidence in the trial. He agreed that before Painter had given an induced statement, he had been informed, in general terms, that the Commission had believed that he had not personally been responsible for any of the violence that had occurred during the robbery.  
     
      
    56 The line which was implicit in cross examination by counsel for Mehajer was that the offences were committed by someone who had inside knowledge of the fact that the deceased had planned to return to the cafe on the afternoon of 3 March 2000, at a time after its usual closure. Mehajer’s case theory was built upon the evidence of the visits of Pearce and Denning to the premises on 3 March; of apparent telephone contact between Denning’s phone and the phone of Lisa Walker which had been in Pearce’s possession, on and after 3 March; the attendance of Denning at Pearce’s motel room on the night of 3 March; the earlier contacts that day between Ms Reely and Pearce; the making of various calls from Denning’s phone to the mobile phone used by the deceased that day; and a stream of phone calls made on Lisa Walker’s mobile during the night of 3 March, and early hours of 4 March.  
     
      
       
      Lies Told by Jacobs and Other Conduct Potentially Revealing a Consciousness of Guilt 
       
      
    57 Leaving aside, for the moment, Jacob’s account of the events at that cafe, the Crown pointed to the lies which it was established that he told; and to the false stories which were shown to have been invented, in concert with Mehajer and with Nilsen, to conceal the alleged involvement of himself and of Mehajer in the offences.  
     
      
    58 First, there was evidence from Nilson to show that he telephoned Jacobs, on 4 August 2000 at 5:25 PM and asked him to come to his home as he had been taken to the “copshop” and “drilled”. He rang again at 6:41 PM asking Jacobs to come over. At 7:01 PM Jacobs phoned Nilsen and suggested they go for a walk, indicating that he had Cameron (Roach) with him.  
     
      
    59 When Jacobs arrived at Nilsen’s home, Nilsen informed him that that he had been questioned by police about the mobile and had told them that he had purchased it from him. At various stages he apologised and explained that he had believed that the phone had belonged to Jacob’s “missus”. Jacobs then informed him, in a conversation commencing at 7:04 PM, which was recorded pursuant to a lawfully placed listening device, that he had purchased the phone, which had been “hot”, at a hotel, and suggested that Nilsen had been with him when this occurred. Jacobs asked him to tell this to the police, and observed “Fuck, I’ve gotta go man, I’m fuckin’ gunna spew.” 
     
      
    60 Significantly there was then telephone contact between Mehajer and Roach at 7:26 when they arranged to meet at Jacob’s home, followed by a call from Mehajer to Jacobs at 8:15, asking where he lived. Later that evening police surveillance observed Jacobs, Mehajer and Cameron Roach leaving Chan’s 1000 Chinese Restaurant in Casula together at about 8:49 PM.  
     
      
    61 On the next morning, Jacobs phoned Nilsen at 5:51 AM and arranged to drive him to work. In the car he gave him instructions as to the story which he wanted him to tell to the police. It was to the effect that Jacobs had purchased the phone from a bikie outside the Crossroads Hotel, where he had been drinking with Nilsen, and had then gone inside the hotel and sold the phone to him. Nilson in due course relayed this story to police, and to the Crime Commission, but later ceased to support it.  
     
      
    62 Later that day (at 3:14 PM) Nilson phoned Jacobs and said that he had told police the story, that they had made it clear that they did not believe him and that they wanted to see him again on the following Monday. Later that day (at 3:24 PM) Jacobs phoned Nilsen and said to him “Oh seriously, fuckin’ stick to it, man…I fuckin’ sold you the phone. I got it from the pub”. Jacobs did his best to calm down Nilsen who was obviously very concerned and panicking about being accused of a murder in which he had played no part. Jacobs reassured him that he had bought the phone at a hotel.  
     
      
    63 On 11 August a telephone call was intercepted between Jacobs and an unknown person, in which he indicated that he was “fuckin’ shitting” and “laying real low”. On 14 August, a listening device installed in Jacob’s home recorded him rehearsing the story that he was to tell to police (which was consistent with that which he had asked Nilsen to tell), prior to telephoning Detective Box. Later that day (at 6:22) a call was intercepted between Jacobs and a Mr Ryan, in the course of which Jacobs acknowledged that he had been speaking to police and was going to get into “big trouble”.  
     
      
    64 On 21 August Jacobs attended Campbelltown Police Station where he took part in an ERISP. In the course thereof, he gave answers to the effect that he: 
     
      
       
      (i) denied knowing or hearing of Painter; 
       
       
      (ii) denied knowing anyone of Arabic descent, including Zaheer Sanoussi, although he later admitted knowing Mehajer when it was pointed out to him that the subscriber details in the name of Zahir El Sanoussi, for a mobile, which he had contacted, on 3 March 2000, included the residential address of Mehajer; 
       
       
      (iii) disclosed that he had known Mehajer from the Whitlam Leisure Centre where Mehajer assisted him with swim training because of his shoulder problem, but said that he did not know where he lived or what sort of car he had, and that he did not know him socially or address him other than by the name “Mazin”;  
       
       
      (iv) said that he had last seen him a couple of weeks previously; 
       
       
      (v) said that he had never been to Colies Cafe and did not know the deceased; 
       
       
      (vi) told the story which he had invented and rehearsed concerning his purchase of the phone at the Crossroads Hotel and its subsequent sale to Jacobs. He said in substance that he had purchased the phone, together with a charger, for $50 from a biker of Turkish or Lebanese appearance with a Kiwi accent, outside the Crossroads Hotel and had then sold the phone to Nilsen, after going back into the hotel. This transaction, he said, had occurred on the day of Cole’s death; 
       
       
      (vii) said that he could not explain why it was that both Painter and himself, each recipients of phones stolen in the robbery, had made common contact with phone of Mehajer on the day of the offences.  
       
      
    65 Police took him home after the interview, (which concluded at 7:04 PM) arriving there at about 7:50 PM. With his consent, police examined the numbers stored on his mobile phone address book, and found the number of El Sanoussi listed against the entry “Mez” (not Mazin).  
     
      
    66 Next there was evidence of Jacobs phoning Cameron Roach, at 7:56 PM, four to six minutes after police had left his home. Jacobs asked Roach whether he had seen “Thingo” (Mez) recently. Roach asked why? Jacobs replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “They fuckin’ traced all the numbers and all that. They’ve fuckin’ linked me up to him, and ah Thingo that kept an eye on him.”  
        
       
      
    67 The reference to “Thingo” on this second occasion would seem to have been a reference to Painter, although in his evidence Jacobs denied that this was the case. Rather, he said, he was referring to Mehajer. He was, however, quite unable to explain what he had meant by the words “Thingo that kept an eye on him”.  
     
      
    68 Jacobs then asked Roach to “ring him [Mehajer] on another number” and to say that “I’m just the young bloke that hassles him at the gym, how to train, alright. He knows nothing else.” He added “Serious, please man, cause they’re fuckin’ full on bro.” 
     
      
    69 Roach said that he could not ring from where he was, so Jacobs said that he would do it himself. He then went to a service station and phoned Mehajer at 8:13 PM. In this call, which was intercepted, he said:  
     
      
       
        
        “The coppers just went through my numbers and all Chris’ numbers and your number is the only one linkin’ us two up, right, just listen for a sec bro before you flip”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    70 He then explained what their relationship was supposed to be, and asked that Mehajer change his name in his phone address book to “Unco Johny from the gym or something”. He advised him to get rid of all his “shit” and added:  
     
      
       
        
        They’re just fully onto it, bro’, they’ve fucken kept real low…don’t my other number ring it from a pay phone”. 
        
       
       
      
    71 He said that he was “ringing from the servo”, and indicated that if Mehajer was questioned about this call, he was to say to police that “I was fucken…your sister…askin’ what you wanted from Maccas”. This was obviously a suggestion for Mehajer to say to police, if asked, that the call came from his sister at a McDonalds fast food outlet, inquiring as to what he wanted from there.  
     
      
    72 He also advised him to “fucken keep low.” Mehajer asked him, during this call, whether they (the police) had mentioned his name, and he repeated the story about being from the gym and hassling him for advice.  
     
      
    73 At 8:38 PM Jacobs spoke to a man “Dingo” and indicated that he had been to the cop shop, and that “its not good at all man. I go down”. At 8:39 PM he phoned another man “Chubbsy” and again indicated that he was in trouble, and made some reference to Nilsen.  
     
      
    74 On 22 August 2000, Nilson spoke to Jacobs and inquired how he had gone, to which he replied “not too good but I fuckin’ got by”. On 24 August 2000 he rang “Mark” and discussed selling his bike and indicated that “I’m getting locked for sure, bro. It’s not good”.  
     
      
    75 On 15 September 2000 Jacobs also said to Roach, in an intercepted telephone call, that it was “not looking good” and that he felt like “leggin’ it to New Zealand”, and that they (the police) wanted to do him for conspiracy to murder. When Roach remarked that “it can only be a conspiracy if they know who it is”, he replied: “yeah, it doesn’t matter man, I’m fucked.” 
     
      
    76 In cross-examination he acknowledged having considered leaving the country, but denied that it was because he was guilty of the offences. 
     
      
    77 On 4 October 2000 Jacobs spoke to “Danny” and indicated that he might be going to gaol, but didn’t know how he was going to go yet. On 18 October 2000 a conversation was recorded via a listening device between Roach and Jacobs, between 6:25 PM and 6:31 Pm in the course of which Jacobs discussed the police investigations and at one stage said. “They know it. They talking about Mez and the drugs and everything man…they’re gunna try and hammer him…and fuck us as well”. At another point, he said “Christian’s gone for sure…they’ve got him in it everything they’ve got him fifty metres…from the place, I think he’s fucked.” 
     
      
    78 The listening device captured a further conversation between Roach and Jacobs between 9:15 PM and 9:45 PM in the course of which there was the following exchange:  
     
      
       
        
        Jacobs: I wonder if Christian’s going to fucken break man and say yeah fuck I did it? 
        
       
       
        
        Roach: What? 
        
       
       
        
        Jacobs: I reckon he will man, they’ve got more on him than me. Do you know who they think it is, I’ll tell you now man, they think it’s Mez and Chris, they only think two people went in the shop. 
        
       
       
      
    79 At another point he added, again obviously referring to his appearance before the Crime Commission: 
     
      
       
        
        “I said things differently…then corrected meself to, not making look like I lied…you know what I mean”.  
        
       
       
      He also indicted that he had said that he did not know Christopher, and that when he heard mention of a blonde haired man “It broke my heart man”. In this regard it was the fact that Jacobs had blonde hair. Later he said: 
       
       
        
        “I wish the prick didn’t die man…I’m going to break man. I’ll go Mezin…you just feel like runnin’ man, fucken leave and go man. If I had enough money I would”.  
        
       
      
    80 In a conversation recorded between 10.00 PM and 10:15 PM he said “…if I do get charged for it, then I’m going to say…who stole the phones and shit” and “…I reckon they’re, might have fucken, … trying to get Mez and then, Chris. Then get Mez and then whatever he tells them.” 
     
      
    81 On 25 October 2002 Jacobs spoke by phone to an unidentified male in the course of which he remarked that Nilson was going to the Crime Commission that day and that he expected him to be “a dog”.  
     
      
    82 In yet another conversation with Roach, on 6 November 2000, captured by listening device, he said “the problem is he bought it from my house, the phone… from my house, then he went and told ‘em we got it up the pub, and they want him to say that he wasn’t up the pub when I bought it…think he’s going to fucken’ go on their side now and fucken’ shaft me”.  
     
      
    83 The police were able to establish, through the intercepts and call charge records, the fact of regular phone communications between Jacobs and Mehajer from 14 June onwards. Notwithstanding the caution which had been given by Jacobs to Mehajer during their conversation on 21 August 2000, only to communicate by pay phone, the telephone records show that they had spoken to one another by phone, on 23 occasions between the end of September 2000 and the beginning of May 2001.  
     
      
    84 In cross-examination at the trial, Jacobs accepted that he had phoned Roach on 9 August 2000 (in a conversation that was recorded at 7 PM), after learning that Nilsen had informed police of obtaining the deceased’s mobile phone from him, and that he had said to him: 
     
      
       
        
        “If anything happens I’m gunna get someone to fucken’ go and give him [Nilsen] a good hiding.” 
        
       
      
    85 He also agreed that he had been intercepted rehearsing the story which he had planned to give to police in relation to this phone, and additionally, that he had lied to them in the ERISP about the nature of his relationship with Mehajer.  
     
      
       
      Lies by Mehajer and Matters Potentially Revealing Consciousness of Guilt 
       
      
    86 Painter gave evidence of having spoken to Mehajer at the Miller Shopping Centre in relation to the evidence which he had given to the Crime Commission concerning the mobile phone, which he had obtained in the robbery. Earlier, he said, Mehajer had asked him if he still had the phone and explained that the man who he (Mehajer) had hit on the head had died. That had occurred, he said, about two weeks after the robbery.  
     
      
    87 After telling Mehajer what he had said to the Crime Commission, at the time of his second attendance, and reporting that he had been shown photographs of Mehajer he indicated that Mehajer had encouraged him to “stick to” what he had been saying, about where he had obtained the phone.  
     
      
    88 Mehajer acknowledged in cross-examination at the trial the fact of, and the terms of, the intercepted telephone conversation between himself and Jacobs at 8:13 PM on the night of 21 August 2000 previously mentioned. He accepted that he knew that Jacobs had been interviewed by police that day, but denied that there had been any arrangement that Jacobs would report back to him after the interview with police. He suggested that he did not know what Jacobs had been talking about in this conversation, but agreed that he had not asked him what he meant.  
     
      
    89 He claimed that it was his nature to listen and not to ask many questions. A somewhat different impression might however be discerned from the many telephone calls between Mehajer and Jacobs from September 2000 onwards.  
     
      
    90 He also denied that Jacobs had been inviting him to communicate in the future by pay phone, to keep a low profile, or to give police a false explanation for this call.  
     
      
    91 Mehajer was interviewed by police in an ERISP on 17 November 2000. In the course thereof he said that he: 
     
      
       
      (i) had met Jacobs at the Whitlam Centre swimming, and that while he had been to his house three or four times he did not know where he currently lived and did not socialise with him; 
       
       
      (ii) had not spoken to Jacobs over the telephone for more than a month and did not know whether he had his current phone number;  
       
       
      (iii) knew Painter, but had never spoken to him, or to Jacobs about the police investigation into the murder, or about the mobile phones that had been stolen; 
       
       
      (iv) had never been in the vicinity of Colies Cafe, and had no involvement in the offences which had been committed there; 
       
       
      (v) was able to speak Arabic fluently; 
       
       
      (vi) would describe Painter as being about 21 to 22 years of age, stocky, with blonde hair, white skin and about 5 cm shorter than his own 185 cm (a description which would have been totally inconsistent with that given by Mr Phillips of the man who had initially seized and then stood over him); 
       
       
      (vii) could not recall the purpose of the calls which had taken place between himself and each of Painter and Jacobs on 3 March 2000. 
       
      
    92 He agreed, in cross-examination, that his answers to questions 163, 168 and 170, concerning whether or not he had spoken to Painter and Jacobs about the offences and the police investigations, had been untrue. He said that he had said what had been recorded to protect Jacobs and Painter; although he also asserted, at one stage, that while at this time he had believed that Painter had been involved in the offences, he had not held that view in relation to Jacobs. He accepted that his evidence in chief to the effect that he became aware of police interest in him only when highway police had pulled him over, on the day of his ERISP, had not been correct, although he denied that it had been a deliberate lie.  
     
      
    93 He also accepted that he and Roach had helped Jacobs to move his house on 4 August 2000 from Casula to Minerva Place and that he had lied when telling the police that he did not know where Jacobs currently lived. 
     
      
    94 He also acknowledged that he had phoned Jacobs’ mobile just after 1 PM on 3 March 2000, and that there had been six calls to Painter’s mobile from his mobile, that afternoon. He could not explain why there had been five calls in succession, and he did not accept that the sixth call at 16:29:33, which was unanswered, had been an accidental redial. He suggested that during the period between that call, and the time of the next call at 17:36:33, he had been training at the gym. Although he indicated that he had signed in at the gym, there were no records available to prove or disprove his attendance there on the afternoon of 3 March 2000. He thought that he had signed in, on the occasion of this visit, but could not explain why he had told police in his ERISP that he had “just walked in”. 
     
      
    95 As elsewhere noted there was evidence of regular telephone conversations between Mehajer and Jacobs from 28 September 2000 onwards, the terms of which were only consistent with them being close friends and socialising well beyond training and gymnasium related activities.  
     
      
       
      Jacob’s Case 
       
      
    96 It was his case that he had been present at the cafe, but that he had not had any prior knowledge of any robbery being planned and had taken only a minor part, having been unaware that he was participating in a robbery. He denied knowing Pearce, Denning or Ms Reely but acknowledged knowing Mehajer and Roach.  
     
      
    97 He said that he had been a good friend of Mehajer for six months or so before the offences and that Mehajer helped him with his training at the Whitlam Centre, where they had first met. He was working as a construction steel fixer on 3 March 2000, and usually finished work at 2 PM. 
     
      
    98 After finishing work that day, he said, he went home, having arranged to meet Mehajer to go out and to have a meal later. When Mehajer arrived he went out to his car, where he was introduced to “Chris” (Painter) who was sitting in the front seat. He was told that they were going to Campbelltown because Chris had to pick up some money. 
     
      
    99 He said that Painter directed Mehajer to Hollylea Road Leumeah, where Colies’ Cafe was located. As they drove towards the cafe, he said that Painter instructed Mehajer to slow down and then said “He’s not there. We’ll get something to eat down at the Red Rooster until he’s back”. They went to the Red Rooster and then drove closer to the cafe. He said that Painter and Mehajer left the car while he stayed in his seat. Then, he said, he left the car and went to look for a pet shop which he had remembered being in the complex, from an earlier occasion when he had worked on a job nearby.  
     
      
    100 On the way to the pet shop, he said that he heard yelling from Colies’ Cafe. He looked through the window and saw one man lying on the ground and Painter throwing punches at another man behind the counter, as he was retreating. He said that he could not see his friend Mehajer, so he ran into the cafe. He saw a smaller man (the deceased) lying on the floor in the corner, and a large man (Mr Phillips) lying on the floor near the entrance. Painter who was standing between these men, instructed him to “watch these two guys” and then ran out the door. Painter, he said, returned with his hands full of things after half a minute or so. He said that when Mr Phillips started to get up, Painter said to him “What the fuck are you looking at?” and kicked him in the face. Jacobs said “He’s hurt”. Mehajer came out and asked “what are you going on about?” 
     
      
    101 Jacobs said that as he began to leave, Painter told him to grab the phone so he seized the phone which was on the counter. He did not know whose it was. On the way back to the car, he said that he remarked to Mehajer “your mate’s a fucking idiot”, to which Mehajer replied “tell me about it”. They got into the car, followed by Painter. He said that he handed the phone to Painter. He also said that Mehajer apologised to him. He claimed to have been in the shop, himself, for only a minute.  
     
      
    102 When they arrived at his home, he said that Painter passed him a mobile phone and said “Here keep it. It’s the guy’s”. He could not explain why he took it, but said that he later gave it to Nilsen, who had previously purchased a phone from him, which was found not to be working properly. He acknowledged having later asked Nilsen to lie to police about Jacobs having acquired the phone at the Cross Roads Hotel. 
     
      
    103 He denied having answered any incoming calls on the deceased’s mobile on 3 March, specifically those made by Denning and Paul Franklin, or from Lisa Walker’s mobile. He denied having known Denning, Ms Reely, or Pearce and also denied having any personal involvement or connection with the Rebels motorcycle club, although he disclosed that his father had once been a member (before he was born). He said that he did not see a knife at the cafe. He also claimed that the reason for not telling the police or the Crime Commission what had occurred was because he was not a “dog”. He said that he had lied about the phone because he did not want to go to gaol (for receiving a stolen phone) and about his relationship with Mehajer because he did not want to “dob him in”, and wished to minimise their relationship.  
     
      
    104 He indicated, in his evidence, that he had been wearing board shorts, while Mehajer had worn three quarter length shorts and a T-shirt. He also asserted that he had no relationship with the Rebels beyond seeing them occasionally at the Cross Roads Hotel where he had a part time job.  
     
      
       
      Mehajer’s Case 
       
      
    105 It was Mehajer’s case that he had not been present during the commission of the offence and that he had nothing whatsoever to do with it. Rather, he had been training at Ace Fitness at Liverpool. As previously mentioned he raised through cross-examination, and otherwise, the possibility of some of the witnesses having had connections with the Rebels Motorcycle Club, giving rise to an inference that the offences had been committed by unidentified club members.  
     
      
    106 Although no documentary evidence was available either to support or contradict his claimed alibi, there was some evidence called in his case (from Justin Law) to show that the Appellant’s hair, at the relevant time, had been cut short. Photograph 2 in Exhibit 9 was nominated as depicting a similar hairstyle.  
     
      
    107 He gave evidence of training at gyms in the Liverpool area, and of passing on training information to others, as he had an interest in diet regimes and weight training. Among the persons he was helping were Painter and Jacobs, neither of whom he said had been good friends in March 2000, their relationship having been nothing more than that of training partners. Cameron Roach, he said, was a mutual friend of himself and Painter.  
     
      
    108 He said at some time prior to being interviewed by Police (on 17 November 2000), Painter had contacted him, and suggested that they meet at a shopping centre. Painter, he said, informed him of having been asked by the Crime Commission about a robbery and about a phone that he had purchased at a hotel. Later, Painter informed him that they had said that someone had been bashed and died, and that they had shown him a photograph and asked questions about himself (Mehajer). 
     
      
    109 On another occasion, he said that he had met Painter and his brother, Jason, in Wollongong. On that occasion, he said, Painter had informed him that he had been to the Crime Commission again, that they were “putting pressure” on him, and that he had a story, and needed his (Mehajer’s) help. Painter said that if Mehajer was asked by police, he was to say that he (Painter) had purchased the phone at the Green Valley Hotel and assured him that he would not get into trouble by doing so. Mehajer said that he agreed to help him out, and he explained that this is what he did when he was spoken to by police. He said that he did not remember any further discussions with Painter in relation to the offences.  
     
      
    110 He was cross-examined in relation to the intercepted telephone call of 21 August 2000. He explained that when Jacobs asked him to change the name under which he had him listed in his mobile address book, and had said that their relationship was simply that of someone he sees at the Whitlam Centre, swimming, this was so they had similar stories to tell to the police, and not to disguise that they had a close relationship. He explained that when Jacobs told him, during this call, to “get rid of all your shit”, he was referring to steroids rather than to the proceeds of the robbery.  
     
      
    111 He denied knowing what Jacobs meant when he told him” they’ve just fully on it bro. They’ve fucken’ kept real low…don’t’ my other number ring it from a pay phone”. He acknowledged being aware that Jacobs was phoning from a service station but denied that, if he was questioned about the call, he was to explain that his sister had called him to ask what he wanted from McDonalds.  
     
      
    112 Mr O’Connor of the NSW Crime Commission, who was called by the Crown at the request of Mehajer, was asked by the latter some general questions in relation to the Commission’s investigation into possible criminal activities by the Rebels motorcycle gang. He was then asked by counsel whether Mr Painter was suspected of having links to the gang. The Crown Prosecutor objected to the question on the grounds of relevance but it was allowed. The cross-examination proceeded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        PIKE: Q. You heard the question directed to Mr Painter?  
         
        A. I wouldn’t put it that high. But to the crime, yes, we certainly suspected initially that an outlaw motorcycle gang may have been involved in the crime, and Mr Painter was involved in the crime, so the link was that way. 
         
         
        Q. For example, one of the focuses of the inquiry, was the Cross Roads Hotel? 
         
        A. Yes, that’s correct.  
         
         
        Q. Indeed, there were persons in Campbelltown, such as Mr Hagerty, Mr Jim Hagerty now known as Mr Pearce, and he was suspected of being a member of the Rebels or - -  
         
        A. Being an associate, yes. 
         
         
        Q. Mr Jacobs, was he suspected of having connections with the Rebels? 
         
        A. Yes he was. 
         
         
        Q. Did you confirm those connections? 
         
        A. Yes we did.  
        
       
      
    113 An application was then made by counsel for Jacobs for a discharge of the jury, on the basis that this was a question going to his character which should not have been asked, and which had not been flagged in advance. He indicated that had he anticipated that Mehajer’s defence would have taken this course he would have sought a separate trial. Counsel for Mehajer sought to justify the cross examination by a submission that it did not go to Jacob’s character as such, but to the defence case that the persons involved in the offence had Rebel motorcycle gang connections, whereas Mehajer had no such connections. It was that scenario, he submitted, that he had been pursuing through the cross examination of witnesses such as Painter, Pearce, Denning, Reely and so on, from the outset.  
     
      
    114 The application for a discharge of the jury was refused by his Honour, with an indication that it would be made clear to them that it was not part of the prosecution case to associate Jacobs with the Rebels.  
     
      
    115 There was no further cross-examination of Mr O’Connor on this topic.  
     
      
    116 This aspect of the cross-examination gives rise to one of the grounds of appeal by Jacobs and I will return to it.  
     
      
       
       
      APPEALS AGAINST CONVICTIONS 
       
      
    117 The Appellants relied essentially upon the same grounds of appeal, and it is accordingly convenient to deal with them globally. Where their appeals differ they will be dealt with separately.  
     
      
       
      COUNTS 2 AND 3 (BOTH APPELLANTS) -  
       
      1. HIS HONOUR ERRED IN LAW IN DIRECTING AND/OR FAILING TO DIRECT ADEQUATELY OR PROPERLY AS TO JOINT ENTERPRISE AND THE ELEMENTS AND EVIDENCE IN RESPECT THEREOF.  
       
      2. HIS HONOUR ERRED IN LAW IN DIRECTING AND/OR FAILING TO DIRECT ADEQUATELY OR PROPERLY: 
       
       (a) AS TO THE FACT THAT COMMON PURPOSE APPLIED; 
       
      (b) IF COMMON PURPOSE APPLIED, AS TO THE DIRECTIONS IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. 
       
      3. HIS HONOUR ERRED IN LAW IN DIRECTING AND/OR FAILING TO DIRECT ADEQUATELY OR PROPERLY: 
       
        
        (a) AS TO THE ELEMENTS OF COUNT 2 i.e. ROBBERY, IN COMPANY AND INFLICT GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM . 
         
        (b) AS TO THE ELEMENTS OF COUNT 3 i.e. ROBBERY, IN COMPANY AND WOUNDING; 
         
        (c) AS TO THE FACTS SUPPORTING EACH ELEMENT IN (a) AND (b).  
        
       
      
    118 These grounds are formulated in terms which were not only very general, but also opaque. They need to be understood in the light of the arguments, which were advanced by Mr Papayani for Jacobs, and adopted by Mr Lloyd QC for Mehajer. They seem to have involved several propositions. 
     
      
    119 Firstly that, while his Honour directed the jury in relation to the joint criminal enterprise, which the Crown contended was made out in relation to the counts of robbery in company with infliction of grievous bodily harm (Count 2), and robbery in company with wounding (Count 3), in accordance with R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545, the directions were deficient in that they did not mention that the participation of the individual accused could only be proved either by his presence at the scene and physical commission of the crime, or by his presence and the provision of assistance or encouragement: R v Crozier NSWCCA 8 March 1996.  
     
      
    120 Secondly that the jury were not sufficiently instructed, in a case involving separate robbery offences, that the joint criminal enterprise had to be established in relation to each count. In this regards the submission appears also to have involved the proposition that the Crown case was not sufficiently clear as to whether the enterprise was one to rob the cafe and any person in it, or one to rob the two individuals, Cole and Phillips, and, as a result, was flawed by the absence of any evidence of an arrangement reached between the Appellants and Painter before they entered the cafe.  
     
      
    121 Thirdly, that there was error in the case being left as one which involved a joint enterprise which embraced a robbery in company which was committed with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm (Count 2) and as intention to wound (Count 3), and in the alternative, which was committed in circumstances where the accused individually contemplated the possibility of such harm being inflicted as an incident of the robbery. In substance, it seems to have been contended that the case should only have been left as one of a joint enterprise simpliciter which involved the infliction of acts of violence (R v Kalinowski; R v Timburry  (1930) 31 SR (NSW) 377) and that, as a result, the Appellant’s culpability was to be assessed solely by reference to the liability attaching to principals and accessories: R v Mohan [1967] AC 187 and R v Clough (1952) 28 NSWLR 396.  
     
      
    122 That was said to follow from the circumstance that the Crown could not prove which of the three persons present inflicted the relevant injuries. 
     
      
    123 It was also contended that the jury were not sufficiently directed that the agreement had to include an understanding that “acts of personal violence should, if necessary, be committed”.  
     
      
    124 Additionally, it seems to have been contended that, if common purpose was relied upon, then the summing up was deficient in that “no direction was given as to common purpose or as to an act foreign to the common purpose where the others are neither principals in the second degree or accessories.” 
     
      
    125 Fourthly, that the summing up was deficient in that “nothing was said to the effect that robbery was stealing or taking from the person or in the presence of another, in respect of the degree of force or terror as to induce any person unwillingly to part with his property”. This was said to have had a particular relevance for Count 3, in that the jury were not asked to determine whether Phillips’ mobile phone was taken in his presence, following demands made of him, as a result of apprehension on his part.  
     
      
    126 Associated with this ground was the contention that there was no evidence, or directions given, concerning the existence of a concert, to which the Appellants and Painter were parties, for the latter to take this phone. Painter’s act, it was argued, had been one which was a venture of his own, which had not followed upon any actual force or violence, or threat thereof, emanating from any person acting in concert. This was linked to a submission that the directions were unclear as to whether Phillips’ evidence of a knife being held at his throat was relied upon as part of the joint enterprise, or otherwise.  
     
      
    127 A similar submission was advanced in relation to Count 2 in so far as it was contended that the summing up was deficient since “no direction was given as to the facts to support robbery in company”.  
     
      
    128 Fifthly, it was submitted that the directions were deficient in relation to the element of being “in company”, in that “the facts should have been given in respect of each count and not treated in globo”.  
     
      
    129 Sixthly, a submission was advanced to the effect that while acts done by one accused in furtherance of a common purpose which constituted elements of the crime charged are admissible to prove the crime (Tripodi v The Queen (1961) 104 CLR 1), a direction should have been given that acts or declarations made after the commission of the crime were only admissible in relation to the Appellant whose acts and declarations they were.  
     
      
    130 Seventhly, it was submitted that the evidence was so complex or contradictory as to what had occurred in the cafe, that his Honour should have dealt with the facts, in support of each element of the robbery counts, separately in relation to each Appellant: R v Duong, Lu, Do and Tran (1992) 61 A Crim R 140.  
     
      
    131 Eighthly, it was submitted that the Crown case was flawed in so far as the blow to the head of the deceased was relied upon as giving rise to the element of grievous bodily harm that was necessary for Count 2, and also for the element of wounding that was required for Count 3. 
     
      
    132 Associated therewith was a submission that a question remained which was not properly addressed, concerning whether or not the blow to the head of the deceased was done before or during the robbery, or afterwards; and that, as a result, the jury were not directed as to the need to determine whether that blow was within the scope of the common enterprise or was beyond what could have been expected to occur: R v Duong at 148 per Mathews J and Markby v The Queen (1978) 140 CLR 108.  
     
      
    133 In that regard, it was contended that had the jury been properly directed, it would have been open for them to have held a reasonable doubt as to whether or not the act was an independent act by whoever was the assailant, and not something falling within the common enterprise, strictly understood, or in its extended form, so as to attract criminal responsibility to his associates. 
     
      
    134 No complaint was made at trial in relation to the directions, which were given in relation to Counts 2 and 3, and no directions of the kind now identified were sought.  
     
      
    135 In my view an examination of the summing up in relation to Counts 2 and 3 provides a complete answer to each of these submissions.  
     
      
    136 Commencing with Count 2, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You see the Crown charges in count 2 that each of the accused, being in company with each other and with Christian Painter, robbed Shane Andrew Cole of a telephone, a wallet and its contents and a quantity of jewellery. And that at the time inflicted grievous bodily harm on Shane Andrew Cole. Now the Crown has to prove all those elements. Let us look at them in turn.  
        
       
       
        
        What is robbery? Robbery, members of the jury, is an aggravated form of theft. It is an aggravated form of taking the property of another without that person’s consent. It is a crime of violence, because it involves not only theft but an element of violence, be it either of actual force of violence, or the threat of it.  
        
       
       
        
        If you were to leave your house open, doors open and you had gone off down the street and there is nobody home, and I was to sneak in and take your wallet off the table, that would not be a robbery, it would be a theft, because there is no element of violence in that, or the threat of it. So that is what robbery involves, an aggravated form of theft, with the taking of property without consent, and it being a crime of violence, because it involves an element of violence, be it actual form of violence, or the threat of it.  
        
       
       
        
        The Crown has to prove then the elements of robbery and the notion of robbery also involves the intention of permanently depriving the owner of the property of it.” 
        
       
      
    137 After summarising the Crown case in relation to this element, his Honour next dealt with the element of being “in company”, explaining: 
     
      
       
        
        “This robbery has to be in company. What does the expression ‘in company mean’? There is, of course, the need for the involvement of no less than two people and, here of course, the Crown charges (and this is the prime charge) that there were three people involved, each of the accused and the accomplice Painter. 
        
       
       
        
        If a person robs somebody and there is a third party present, who is no more than a mere passive bystander, well, that robber is not acting in company with that person. To commit a robbery in company, the participants must share a common purpose to rob.  
        
       
       
        
        If the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused whose case you are considering, shared the common purpose to rob, then that person bears criminal responsibility for those acts of his companion, or companions, including any act contemplated as being a possible incident of the common purpose to rob.  
        
       
       
        
        You have been told something, from the bar table, about the concept of a joint criminal enterprise. Let me say this to you about that. The law is that where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, each is responsible for the acts of the other, or others in carrying out that enterprise. The Crown must establish both the existence of that joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused, the case against whom you are considering. 
        
       
       
        
        A joint criminal enterprise, members of the jury, exists when two or more persons reach an understanding, or an arrangement amounting to an agreement between them, that they will commit a crime. The understanding, or arrangement need not be written down, it need not be expressed in detail, or at all. Its existence may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any particular time before the crime is committed.  
        
       
       
        
        The circumstances in which two or more people are participating in the commission of the particular crime, may themselves establish an unspoken understanding, or an arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there, to commit that crime.  
        
       
       
        
        Let me take an illustration far removed from this case. If you were walking along the street here this afternoon and you saw a person walking towards you being followed by two men, who suddenly rushed up to that pedestrian, knocked him down and systematically started going through his pockets and they then took off, you would not need to have been present at some meeting those two assailants had, before you could conclude that they were acting in a joint criminal enterprise. What they were doing reflected an understanding, or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them. I say that just to give you an illustration that is far removed from this case but to emphasize, the Crown does not have to prove that there was some express agreement reached and spelt out.  
        
       
       
        
        The Crown does not have to prove some document that records the terms of the agreement, nor does it have to call somebody who said, ‘I was present and I heard A and B discussing what they were about to do’.  
        
       
       
        
        The Crown here charges the existence of a joint criminal enterprise to which each party, each accused and Painter, was a party. The Crown has not called evidence that the accused and Painter had any conversation, or conversations to spell out an agreement to rob the deceased and/or Phillips. It does not have to do so, provided the evidence satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt, that in all the circumstances, you should infer the existence of such an agreement.” 
        
       
       
      
    138 His Honour then moved on to the next element which the Crown had to prove, namely the infliction of grievous bodily harm on Shane Andrew Cole at the time of the commission of the robbery in company, giving a conventional direction in the terms of it meaning a “really serious bodily injury”. This was followed by a reference to the evidence on that aspect of the case, and then by a direction in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now it is not necessary for the Crown to prove that the harm suffered by Mr Cole was personally inflicted by the accused whose case you are considering provided you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused whose case you are considering shared a common purpose to rob with the assailant, in which case that accused bears criminal responsibility for those acts of his companion or companions, including any act contemplated as being a possible incident of the common purpose to rob.  
        
       
       
        
        This means then unless the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused whose case you are considering personally inflicted the grievous bodily harm upon the deceased that the Crown must prove that that person contemplated the infliction of such harm as a possible incident of the common purpose to rob.  
        
       
       
        
        You see, a party to a common purpose to commit a crime bears criminal responsibility for such acts of his companion which he contemplated as being a possible incident of the crime which they agreed to commit. So the question is whether the accused whose case you are in the course of considering regarded it as possible that the infliction of grievous bodily harm would be committed.  
        
       
       
        
        It is not necessary that it be shown that he wanted the infliction of grievous bodily harm to be committed or that he intended that that harm be committed or that he thought it was likely that that harm would be committed. It suffices that the accused contemplated as a possibility that it would be an incident of the crime upon which they agreed.” 
        
       
       
      
    139 His Honour then moved on to the third count, observing: 
     
      
       
        
        “The elements to be proved in relation to the third count are very much the same, of course. The two differences are that it is a different victim and that this time the Crown does not have to prove the infliction of grievous bodily harm but robbery in company with wounding.  
        
       
       
        
        This count and, again you see it form the very expression of the indictment, charges the accused, in company with each other and with Christian Painter, of robbing Shane Phillips of a mobile phone and, at the time of doing so, of wounding him. So the Crown has to prove again the robbery of property, this concept that I instructed you on earlier – it is the very same concept – and that at the time of the robbery in company, the wounding of Shane Phillips. 
        
       
       
        
        I remind you again that what is involved in robbery involves these elements; the unlawful taking and carrying away of some property of some value. That it was taken away from under his immediate personal care and attention and protection – rather the taking of that property against the will of the person and an intention to permanently deprive him of the property.” 
        
       
      
    140 After summarising what was relied upon by the Crown to establish the robbery of Mr Phillips of his mobile phone, his Honour continued in relation to the remaining elements: 
     
      
       
        
        “Again the crown has to prove that this was a robbery in company, to which the accused were parties.  
        
       
       
        
        I remind you again of what I have already said in relation to the second count. The crown has to prove that the accused whose case you are considering, shared a common purpose to rob Mr Phillips in the execution of a joint criminal enterprise. 
        
       
       
        
        Again I direct you that if the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, whose case you are considering, did share such a common purpose to rob, then that person bears criminal responsibility for the acts of his companion engaged in that common purpose, including any act contemplated as being a possible incident of the common purpose to rob.  
        
       
       
        
        This then, leaves the issue of wounding. The Crown has to prove the wounding of Shane Phillips. To constitute a wounding, members of the jury, I direct you that there has to be an injury by which the skin is broken. That is what is necessary, in law, for there to be a wounding.” 
        
       
       
      
    141 The evidence which the Crown relied upon to establish the wounding of Mr Phillips and the manner of its infliction by a kick to his face, were summarised. His Honour then noted the difference in the versions of Jacobs, Painter and Mr Phillips as to who had kicked the latter, and concluded this aspect of the summing up with the reminder: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown, as I have made clear I trust, does not have to prove which of the offenders kicked Mr Phillips, but the Crown does have to prove that the accused, whose case you are considering, shared a common purpose with that assailant to rob Mr Phillips and, that the act of wounding him was contemplated as being a possible incident of that common purpose.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    142 In R v Tangye Hunt CJ at CL formulated a model direction in relation to a prosecution case which is based upon a “straight forward joint criminal enterprise”, in the following terms (at 556/7): 
     
      
       
        
        “So far as a straightforward joint criminal enterprise is concerned, the jury should be directed along these lines:  
        
       
       
        
        (1) The law is that, where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, each is responsible for the acts of the other or others in carrying out that enterprise. The Crown must establish both the existence of that joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused.  
        
       
       
        
        (2) A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express, and its existence may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any time before the crime is committed. The circumstances in which two or more persons are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit that crime.  
        
       
       
        
        (3) A person participates in that joint criminal enterprise either by committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at the time when the crime is committed, and (with knowledge that the crime is to be or is being committed) by intentionally assisting or encouraging another participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime. The presence of that person at the time when the crime is committed and a readiness to give aid if required is sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the other participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime.  
        
       
       
        
        (4) If the agreed crime is committed by one or other of the participants in that joint criminal enterprise, all of the participants in that enterprise are equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission.” 
        
       
       
      
    143 Immediately preceding this paragraph, his Honour pointed out that:  
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown needs to rely upon a straightforward joint criminal enterprise only where - as in the present case - it cannot establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was the person who physically committed the offence charged. It needs to rely upon the extended concept of joint criminal enterprise, based upon common purpose, only where the offence charged is not the same as the enterprise agreed. This Court has been making that point for years, and it is a pity that in many trials no heed is taken of what has been said.” 
         
        
       
       
      And subsequently (at 558): 
       
       
        
        “As I have said, common purpose becomes necessary only where there has been an agreement to carry out a particular crime (some text books call it the foundational crime) but some other crime has been committed which had been within the contemplation of the accused as a possible incidence in the execution of their agreed joint criminal enterprise (some text books call it the incidental crime) which is said to be within the scope of the common purpose.” 
        
       
      
    144 The error which occurred in Tangye arose from the intermingling of the concepts of joint criminal enterprise and common purpose in a case where there was no need for the Crown to rely upon an extension of the enterprise, since the “infliction of grievous bodily harm was clearly enough part of the joint criminal enterprise – either from the beginning or, at the latest when the participants…started to kick the victims” (at 588). 
     
      
    145 Tangye is not authority for the proposition that the doctrine of common purpose cannot be relied upon to extend culpability arising from a joint criminal enterprise to commit crime A to include crime B, where crime B was within the contemplation of the accused as a possible incident in the execution of their agreed joint criminal enterprise. Indeed, it recognises that, in a suitable case, it is entirely appropriate and permissible for the Crown to rely on extended joint criminal enterprise. There is, in any event, abundant authority to show that this is so: see for example McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108; R v Sharah (1992) 30 NSWLR 292 and R v Kyriakou and Ors (1987) 29 A Crim R 50. There is nothing in the statement of the relevant principle by the High Court in Gillard v The Queen (2003) 78 ALJR 64 at paras 109 to 112 to require any variation in this approach.  
     
      
    146 Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316, was a case concerned with a straight forward joint criminal enterprise, and not with an extended joint criminal enterprise. The discussion by McHugh J of criminal complicity was concerned with the principles of criminal liability applicable where a crime is committed by persons acting in concert, but did not extend to the type of case considered in McAuliffe.  
     
      
    147 The present case was one where the Crown was properly entitled to rely on extended joint criminal enterprise, as well as on a straight forward joint criminal enterprise.  
     
      
    148 The evidence was clearly sufficient to show a joint enterprise between Jacobs, Painter and Mehajer, to carry out a robbery, in company, of whoever was found in the cafe, with violence, in circumstances where a knife had been taken to the scene and where force was inflicted from the very outset. Whether its scope included the infliction of grievous bodily harm or wounding was a matter for determination by the jury. What was also properly to be left, was the extension of that enterprise by way of the common purpose doctrine, to include the aggravating elements of inflicting grievous bodily harm (Count 2) or wounding (Count 3), although that again was a matter for determination by the jury of what was in the contemplation of the Appellants as possible incidents of the enterprise.  
     
      
    149 That this was so was inevitable in a case where the Crown could not, or might not have been able to, establish beyond reasonable doubt which of those men had occasioned the injury to the deceased, and the wounding of Mr Phillips, and where there was no evidence of any discussion between them, in advance of their arrival at the cafe, or while they were there, as to whether the persons found on site, or any of them, were to be physically harmed, and if so, to what extent.  
     
      
    150 The case was therefore quintessentially one where a joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise were open. It was not one that needed to be confined to a case of straightforward joint criminal enterprise. The basis for the complaint, which seems to underpin most of the points advanced in respect of these grounds, none of which was taken at trial is totally misconceived.  
     
      
    151 The assertion that his Honour failed to direct the jury as to the need for the case to be considered separately in respect of each count, and in respect of each accused, does not do the summing up justice. At several points during the trial, both at its commencement, and in the summing up, his Honour emphasised that the cases against each accused were to be considered separately. In the present context, the portions of the summing up which I have extracted also show that there were clear, correct, and separate directions given in relation to Count 2 and Count 3.  
     
      
    152 It is also clear that his Honour instructed the jury that the mere presence of an accused at the scene of a robbery is not enough to establish a common purpose or joint enterprise, and is also not enough to satisfy the element of being “in company”, as to which a perfectly appropriate direction was given. Clearly these directions complied with the decision in R v Brougham (1986) 43 SASR 187 at 191, where King CJ provided the definition of this expression which was adopted by this Court in R v Crozier NSWCCA 8 March 1996 and in R v Button (2002) 54 NSWLR 455, to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “…A person commits a robbery, or an assault with intent, in company where that person participates in the robbery or assault together with another or others in the sense that the victim is confronted by the combined force or strength of two or more persons or that the forces of two or more persons are deployed against the victim. It is not necessary that more than one participant actually strike or rob the victim; it is sufficient that the accused and one or more other participants be physically present for the common purpose of robbing, or assaulting with intent, and of physically participating if required.” 
        
       
       
      
    153 In R v Leoni [1999] NSWCCA 14, the concept of “company” was developed even further in so far as Adams J (with whom Abadee and Barr JJ agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, presence at the scene with the intention of physically participating, if required, is sufficient to satisfy the section, even if that presence is unknown to the victim. However, if the offender makes his presence known to the victim so that, to use the words of the Chief Justice in  
        Brougham 
         ‘the victim is confronted by the combined force or strength of two or more persons’ that will be sufficient to satisfy the section  
        even if the offender did not, as it happened, intend to physically participate if required. 
        ”  
        
       
       
      See also  
      R v Villar and Zugecic 
       [2004] NSWCCA 302.  
       
      
    154 It is equally clear from the way in which his Honour dealt separately with Counts 2 and 3 in the directions, that it was made crystal clear to the jury that they had to be satisfied of the existence of a joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise which extended to each offence. 
     
      
    155 It is not the case that this required the proof of separate enterprises. In that respect, it seems to me that the submission which sought to draw a distinction between an enterprise to rob anyone in the cafe, and one to rob either or both of the victims who were there, is not one of substance.  
     
      
    156 It is entirely consistent with authority for separate counts to be proffered where there are individual victims who are robbed of their property at the one location and at the same time. The defence submission otherwise overlooks the fact that a joint criminal enterprise need not be pre-planned. It can develop and be formed instantaneously. Once again, entirely appropriate directions were given in that respect. Had a single count been proffered, which was confined to the robbery of the deceased, the robbery of Mr Phillips would have gone unpunished. He had his property stolen and he was wounded, and there is no reason in law, or in common sense, why there should not have been separate offences charged as occurring during a joint enterprise to which the Appellants were parties. 
     
      
    157 The submissions in relation to whether there was sufficient evidence, and whether sufficient directions were given in relation to the taking of Phillips’ phone from his person by force or through terror, and in relation to whether this had effectively been a frolic of Painter, acting on his own and without the degree of force or terror required for the offence, are equally unmeritorious.  
     
      
    158 The offence of robbery extends not only to property taken from the person of a victim, but also to property taken in his presence. In Smith v Desmond and Hall [1965] AC 960 robbery was held to have been committed where the maintenance engineer and nightwatchman were 33 yards and 2 doors away from the safe which was robbed. Lord Morris of Borthiy-Gest said that the fact that: 
     
      
       
        
        “…Scott and Lai were some yards away from the safe and were imprisoned in another room and were unable to see what was happening did not, in my view, prevent the crime from being that of robbery. The important moment in time which has to be considered is the moment when by the application of force (or its equivalent) the care and protection of a custodian is overborne. If someone had a number of chattels in his immediate care and protection and was then overpowered and was taken some distance away and was then left bound, gagged and blindfolded it would still be robbery even though at the actual moment when the chattels were taken away he could neither hear anything nor see anything, and even though the actual removal of the chattels only took place some time later than the initial application of the force…Questions as to distance may in some cases arise. All such questions of degree will be for the jury to determine. In the present case there can be no doubt that the violence and the theft were essentially linked.” 
        
       
      
    159 Lord Pearce, in the same case, said (at 998): 
     
      
       
        
        “…A thief cannot escape the charge of robbery by merely planning his crime in two stages, namely, first violently removing the owner or custodian of the property from its vicinity to a distance at which he cannot see or hear the actual stealing of the property and then, secondly, stealing the property. For that reason, I do not think that it is of any relevance how great the distance to which the custodian of the property is removed…” 
        
       
       
      
    160 Smith v Desmond and Hall has been followed in this Court: see for example R v Foster (1995) 78 A Crim R 517.  
     
      
    161 In this instance, Mr Phillips was seized by force and restrained, at a time when he had been walking between the cafe and the car, which had been parked outside those premises, and in which his mobile phone, wallet and clothes had been left. It was while he was restrained that the search for property was made, in the course of which his phone was found and taken, without his consent. The phone was clearly under Mr Phillips’ care and protection at that time, and the ability of Painter to take it could only have been carried into effect by the restraint continuing. As the extracted portion of the summing up shows, the jury were appropriately directed that the Crown had to prove that the phone was taken “from under his [Phillips’] immediate personal care and attention and protection.” 
     
      
    162 Moreover, Phillips was himself asked where the money was at a time when he had been forced to the floor and had a knife pressed to his throat. He had replied that he did not know, and it was, after this, in the course of a search for money or drugs that his phone was taken. It is impossible to argue, in those circumstances, that no demand was made of him, or that he parted with, or more appropriately was parted from, his property without an apprehension of violence to his person. In any event there is no requirement for a demand to be made to constitute a robbery. What is required is the taking of property without consent, and with violence. In that regard consent obtained by force or violence does not amount to consent.  
     
      
    163 The classic definition of robbery was given by Lord Pearce in Smith v Desmond as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The essence of the offence is that violence is done or threatened to the person of the custodian who stands between the robber and the property in order to prevent or overcome his resistance and oblige him to part with the property and submit to the thief stealing it. Thus the offence against the person and the theft are combined…the offence can only exist where the victim has sufficient care or personal possession of the goods to allow the court to say that constructively the goods were taken ‘in his presence’ … It is a question of degree for the jury to decide whether the victim of the violence was sufficiently the custodian of the property stolen, whether he had sufficient possession and care of it, to constitute the stealing as being in his presence.” 
        
       
      
    164 Further, as his Lordship said (at 998): 
     
      
       
        
        “The only relevance of the victim’s awareness is this. Is he aware of the theft or intended theft and is he compelled by force or fear to submit to it? Or has he been prevented by violence or threat from becoming aware of the theft and has that enabled the thieves to steal? If the answer to either of these questions is yes, the offence against the person and the theft are combined and the offence of robbery is constituted.”  
        
       
       
      
    165 The jury were given appropriate instructions in relation to what was involved in the robbery element, and the evidence was well capable of making that element good.  
     
      
    166 Finally, this is a case where appropriate instructions were given in relation to joint criminal enterprise and the meaning of the expression “in company”, such that it would have been perfectly clear to the jury that had the taking, by Painter, of Mr Phillips’ phone been a frolic of his own, the count would not have been made good. In any event it borders somewhat on the absurd for the Appellants to now contend that the taking of the phone in circumstances where the car and the cafe were being searched for money and/or drugs, while the victims were restrained and assaulted, fell outside the joint enterprise and was a frolic by Painter of his own. Even if Painter had not gone to the premises with any appreciation that he was to take part in a robbery in company, his conduct once he was there led inevitably to only one conclusion, namely that he had joined the enterprise.  
     
      
    167 So far as it is asserted that insufficient directions were given differentiating between acts done in furtherance of the enterprise which constituted elements of the crimes charged (admissible against each Appellant), and subsequent acts and declarations (which were admissible only against the Appellant whose acts or declarations they were), a complete answer is provided by the directions that were given: 
     
      
       
        
        “You will remember I told you during the course of the trial that a record of interview, an ERISP given by a particular accused to the police, is not admissible against the other accused. Where the accused Jacobs undergoes an interview with the police, what he tells the police at that interview is not admissible against the accused Mehajer and vice versa. So that you only have regard to the ERISP, the record of interview made by a particular accused, against that particular accused. 
        
       
       
        
        Then in this case there are many intercepted telephone conversations and conversations recorded pursuant to listening devices. You have those in exhibits T and Y.  
        
       
       
        
        Now the evidence in those categories is available against the accused who participated in the particular conversation. For instance, there have been a lot of recorded conversations involving Mr Jacobs and his friend Nathan. They are conversations in which Mr Mehajer played no part and what took place between Mr Jacobs and his friend Nathan in those conversations is not admissible against Mr Mehajer and, likewise, where you find that Mr Mehajer and, likewise, where you find that Mr Mehajer participated in the conversation in which Mr Jacobs was not involved such a conversation is available against Mr Mehajer but not against Mr Jacobs.  
        
       
       
        
        Now when you are looking at the transcripts you are guided at the top of each transcript by an identification of who were the participants and, members of the jury, it is important that when you are looking at these transcripts that you remind yourself, get into the habit of looking at them and saying: Well now, who are the parties to this, who is this available against? If Mr Jacobs is a party to the conversation, it is admissible against him. If Mr Mehajer is a party to the conversation, it is admissible against Mr Mehajer but no transcript or conversation is admissible against an accused person who was not a party to that conversation.” 
        
       
       
      
    168 When his Honour came to direct the jury in relation to lies he did so in terms that made it clear that lies told by Jacobs were relevant for the case in relation to him, and that lies told by Mehajer were relevant for the case in relation to him.  
     
      
    169 So far as there was any course of lying that was common to each, and which arose as a result of their agreement to provide a common account that was untrue, and so far as there was evidence relating to their post offence conduct that went to their relationship or meetings, or conversations, then that was clearly admissible against each.  
     
      
    170 This was a case where the subsequent conduct and declarations of the parties properly went to the issue of their consciousness of guilt. This argument is not made good.  
     
      
    171 Finally, in relation to the multiplicity of arguments that were brought within the umbrella of these grounds, there was the submission concerning whether the blows to the deceased were relied upon as causing the harm or injury charged under both Counts 2 and 3, and as to whether those blows were done within the scope of the enterprise.  
     
      
    172 These arguments have been largely dealt with already. The first is a somewhat surprising contention, it being perfectly clear that separate acts occasioning harm to the two victims, were relied upon for Counts 2 and 3. Secondly the Crown case was unequivocal in so far as it alleged that the relevant injuries were inflicted in the course of the commission of the robberies, either as part of a straightforward joint criminal enterprise, or as part of an extended joint criminal enterprise. Whether that was made good was a jury question, it being one of the elements that were properly and sufficiently explained by his Honour.  
     
      
    173 Although I have considered it necessary to deal with these grounds somewhat extensively, I would refuse leave under Rule 4, since I am persuaded that no error was discharged.  
     
      
       
      GROUND 4 (BOTH ACCUSED): HIS HONOUR ERRED IN LAW IN DIRECTING AND/OR FAILING TO DIRECT ADEQUATELY OR PROPERLY IN RESPECT OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.  
       
      
    174 It was submitted that the directions were deficient in failing to point out that any inference drawn “had to be the only inference”, and in that “nothing was said as to what facts were relied upon to support that inference beyond reasonable doubt”. 
     
      
    175 No complaint was made at trial in relation to the directions which were given in relation to circumstantial proof, and no request was made for any additional directions. His Honour provided a conventional direction in relation to inferences, pointing out that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Inferences are conclusions of fact rationally drawn from a combination of proved facts. If facts A, B and C are proved then you may rationally conclude from their proof that fact D is a fact event thought there is no direct evidence about fact D.” 
        
       
      
    176 He next referred to the example commonly given in relation to a person making an unanswered telephone call, to illustrate the need to consider with care the inferences which might be available in that situation, cautioning: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now this is a criminal trial and proof beyond reasonable doubt is required and it means that you should not draw any inference from the direct evidence unless it is the only rational inference to draw in all the circumstances. It is important that you bear that in mind here.” 
        
       
      
    177 His Honour then focussed upon circumstantial evidence, noting that while the Crown relied on the direct evidence of Mr Phillips and Painter, it also placed reliance in part upon circumstantial evidence. He explained that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Circumstantial evidence is evidence of some fact, or facts, from which you are to draw a conclusion as to further fact or facts.” 
        
       
       
      
    178 His Honour then gave an example: 
     
      
       
        
        “Let us suppose that what the Crown was seeking to prove was that X stole a computer from a house belonging to Y. Let us suppose that the crown set about proving that theft in this way, firstly, by calling evidence that fingerprints of X were found on the front door of Y’s house. Secondly, that X’s car was seen in the next street at just about the same time that the computer was taken and, thirdly, that shortly after the theft of the computer, X was found to have possession of a computer that matched the description of that taken from Y’s house. That would be a case based entirely upon circumstantial evidence, because it is not a case where someone said, “I saw X there. I saw him force his way into that house and I saw him run off with the computer and put it in his car”.  
        
       
       
        
        Circumstantial evidence then is evidence of a group of circumstances which point to the guilt of the accused, because those circumstances exist in combination, only because the fact which the Crown was seeking to prove, also existed.  
        
       
       
        
        I tell you that circumstantial evidence need not be any less reliable than direct evidence from an eyewitness. Indeed, because it does not depend to any great extent upon the reliability of a witness who could be a mistaken or maliciously false, circumstantial evidence can, in particular cases, be of greater probative value than the evidence of an eyewitness.” 
        
       
       
      
    179 His Honour then noted that the evidence in the category of circumstantial evidence, upon which the Crown relied was the evidence of the various intercepted conversations, the phone records between Mehajer and Painter, and between Mehajer and Jacobs, and the sighting of the three men in the vicinity of Colie’s Cafe on 3 March 2000, before reminding the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “What is important, members of the jury and, I stress this, is that you must avoid resort to suspicion, or speculation, or conjecture in arriving at your verdicts.” 
        
       
       
      
    180 It is clear from the foregoing that conventional directions were given as to the drawing of inferences, including the direction that an inference can only be drawn where it is both a rational inference, and the only such inference available. This provides a complete answer to the first complaint, which is made by the Appellants.  
     
      
    181 The second complaint is also not made good, since this was not a case depending upon links in a chain of reasoning towards guilt, or one where there were essential intermediate facts to be established through circumstantial evidence.  
     
      
    182 I would refuse leave to argue this ground.  
     
      
       
      GROUND 5 (BOTH APPELLANTS) – HIS HONOUR ERRED IN LAW IN DIRECTING AND/OR FAILING TO DIRECT AS TO THE ALTERNATIVE BASES OF MURDER HAVING REGARD TO THE FORM OF THE INDICTMENT 
       
      (a) IN THAT COUNTS 2 AND 3 SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE INDICTMENT. 
       
      (b) THAT MURDER WAS NOT AVAILABLE IN RESPECT OF COUNTS 2 AND 3 AS DIRECTED BY HIS HONOUR.  
       
      
    183 The submissions which were advanced on appeal did not reflect these grounds, it having been submitted, in substance that: 
     
      
       
      (a) The summing up was deficient in so far as his Honour did not direct the jury to consider the facts in relation to Counts 2 and 3 separately; 
       
       
      (b) The evidence in relation to Count 3, if considered separately, could not have supported a verdict on that count; 
       
       
      (c) The alleged robbery of Phillips had nothing to do with what happened to the deceased (either in respect of Counts 1 and 2); 
       
       
      (d) The blow to the deceased was not relevant for what happened to Phillips (Count 3). 
       
      
    184 No complaint was made at trial in relation to the way in which the jury were directed in relation to Counts 2 and 3. This submission needs to be examined in the light of the way that the case was left to the jury. His Honour gave some initial directions in relation to Count 1, to which he returned after having given the extensive directions in relation the foundational offences charged in Counts 2 and 3, which I have earlier noted. He initially reminded the jury of his earlier observations, emphasising that: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the Crown has failed to prove the guilt of the accused on either of those two counts, then the Crown has failed to prove the commission of a foundational crime, fundamental to proof of the crime of murder.  
        
       
       
        
        If you were to acquit an accused before this court on count 2 and count 3, you must acquit that accused person on count 1, because that foundation has gone for the crime of murder. It has not been proved.  
        
       
       
        
        Conviction on count 2 and/or count 3 – and I remind you that the Crown does not need both of them to move on to count 1 – but conviction on count 2 and/or count 3, would not necessarily lead to conviction on count 1, because there are other elements that you have to consider, and I am now going to give you some further instruction about what the Crown has to prove in order to prove the crime of murder.  
        
       
       
        
        At the risk of being tedious, again I must remind you that just as with counts 2 and 3, you must consider the case against each accused person discretely when you are looking at count 1.” 
        
       
       
      
    185 He then gave a general direction in relation to constructive murder: 
     
      
       
        
         “… murder is committed where the act causing the death of the deceased, is done during the commission by the accused, or some accomplice with him, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for 25 years and here the Crown relies upon proof of the crimes charged in count 2 and/or count 3. Each of those crimes charged in those counts, is in a category punishable by imprisonment for 25 years.” 
        
       
      
    186 This was first applied to the foundational offence, which was the subject of Count 2: 
     
      
       
        
        “To establish the crime of murder here the Crown must prove the following: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          1. That there was a common purpose shared by the accused in company, to rob Shane Cole. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2. That during the course of that robbery in company, grievous bodily harm was inflicted upon Shane Cole. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          3. That the infliction of such grievous bodily harm was a contingency, that is a possible happening, which the accused had in mind might occur during the robbery in company. Might occur.  
          
         
         
          
          The Crown does not have to prove that it was necessarily the accused whose case you are considering, who personally inflicted the grievous bodily harm. It is sufficient that the harm was occasioned either by that accused, or by another party to the enterprise. Provided the infliction of that harm was a possible happening which the accused, whose case you are considering, had in mind as something that might occur during the robbery. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          4. The Crown has to prove that the infliction of that harm caused the death of Shane Cole. The Crown does not have to prove, members of the jury, that the act, or acts causing death was, or were done with an intent to kill, or indeed with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. But it must prove that such act, or acts, were voluntary not accidental. And it must prove that such act, or acts, was or were done, during the commission of robbery in company. When I say that it has to prove that the acts were voluntary, by that I mean that the act, or acts were conscious, deliberate, as opposed to accidental. I will come back to this question of causation in just a moment. But they are the elements that have to be proved, based upon the foundational crime charged in the second count.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    187 His Honour next applied the general direction in relation to the foundational crime charged in the third count, explaining that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The elements to be proved are the following: 
        
       
       
        
        1. That there was a common purpose, shared in company, to rob Shane Phillips; 
        
       
       
        
        2. That during the course of that robbery in company the accused or another party to that enterprise wounded Shane Phillips and during the course of that robbery in company with wounding the accused or another party to that enterprise caused grievous bodily harm to Shane Cole causing his death; and  
        
       
       
        
        3. That the infliction of grievous bodily harm to Shane Cole during the robbery in company with wounding of Shane Phillips was a possible happening, a possible happening which the accused whose case you are considering contemplated might occur.” 
        
       
      
    188 The Appellants submitted that the present was not a case where constructive murder (or felony murder as it was previously known) was available. This submission turns upon the proper interpretation of s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    189 It was asserted that, on its natural reading, the opening words to the section “murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him or her omitted to be done, causing the death charged” govern the section, and mean that murder can only be established where it was the act or omission of the accused that caused the death.  
     
      
    190 It was further asserted that the category of constructive murder, which is brought within the section (in addition to cases of specific intention or reckless indifference to human life) by the closing words “or done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her” of a crime punishable for life or for 25 years, are directed to the commission of the foundational crime, and not to the act causing death.  
     
      
    191 At the outset it is to be observed that the first proposition that was advanced is somewhat startling, since if it is correct, then in a case of joint enterprise, where the parties shared an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, murder would only be committed by the accused whose act in fact brings about the death.  
     
      
    192 Such a proposition would fly in the face of long standing authority that a person may be found guilty of murder, although he or she did not commit the act bringing about death, so long as that person was acting in concert with the perpetrator. That was recognised in Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316 at 341 to 351 and in McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108, and there are numerous examples in the case law, including for example R v Mohan [1967] AC 187 where offenders acting in concert have been convicted of murder, even thought the Crown is not able to prove which of them carried out the act causing death.  
     
      
    193 Prior to 1883, murder in New South Wales, was murder as defined in the common law. In the 13th Century, homicide was culpable if the death occurred during the commission of an unlawful act. In Foster’s Discourse of Homicide in 1762, the felony murder rule was relaxed to the extent that it was confined to the case of a killing in the course of an act with intent to commit a felony.  
     
      
    194 This strict approach is illustrated by the case of R v Horsey (1862) 3 F & F 287; 176 ER 129 where the accused was charged with murder after setting fire to a stack of straw. There was no evidence that the accused had any idea of the presence of the deceased, who was sleeping in the stack and who was burned to death. The trial judge, Baron Bramwell, instructed the jury that where an accused, in the course of committing a felony, caused the death of a human being, that was murder, even though he did not intend it.  
     
      
    195 This approach was criticised by those who disliked making death, occasioned during the course of a felony, murder when violence was neither likely nor intended.  
     
      
    196 Stephen J expressed his dislike of the strict approach in R v Serne (1887) 16 Cox CC 311 when instructing the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “…Now when it is said that murder means killing a man by an act done in the commission of a felony, there mere words cover a case like this, that is to say, a case where a man gives another a push with an intention of stealing his watch, and the person so pushed , having a weak heart, or some other internal disorder, dies. To take another very old illustration, it was said that if a man shot at a fowl with intent to steal it, and accidentally killed a man, he was to be accounted guilty of murder, because the act was done in the commission of a felony. I very much doubt, however, whether that is really the law, or whether the Court for the Consideration of Crown Cases Reserved would hold it to be so. …In my opinion the definition of the law which makes it murder to kill by an act done in the commission of a felony might and ought to be narrowed…I think that, instead of saying that any act done with intent to commit a felony and which causes death amounts to murder, it would be reasonable to say that any act known to be dangerous to life, and likely in itself to cause death done for the purpose of committing a felony which caused death, should be murder. As an illustration of this, suppose that a man, intending to commit a rape upon a woman, but without the least wish to kill her, squeezed her by the throat to overpower her, and in so doing killed her, that would be murder…If a man once begins attacking the human body in such a way, he must take the consequences if he goes further than he intended when he began…If a person chose, for some wicked purpose of his own to sink a boat at sea, and thereby caused the deaths of the occupants, it matters nothing whether at the time of committing the act he hoped that the people would be picked up by a passing vessel. He is as much guilty of murder, if the people are drowned, as if he had flung every person into the water with his own hand.” 
        
       
      
    197 In New South Wales, the strict rule was ameliorated in 1883 in the Criminal Law Amendment Act. Section 9 of that Act expressly defined murder in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “9. Whosoever commits the crime of murder shall be liable to suffer death and murder shall be taken to be where the act of the accused or thing by him omitted to be done causing the death charged was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life – or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm during or immediately after the commission by the accused or some accomplice with him of an act obviously dangerous to life or a crime punishable by death or penal servitude for life. Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be Manslaughter.” 
        
       
      
    198 This definition was reproduced in s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. Smart J in R v Downs [1985] 3 NSWLR 312 noted that in the 1883 Act the legislature had been at pains to specify (in s 9) any change to the common law concerning murder. Lee J pointed out in the same case (at 316) that the various acts resulting in death described in s 18(1)(a) were themselves all acts which at common law gave rise to murder. Relevantly his Honour at 318 stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “In one respect, the terms of the section brought about a difference from the common law of murder and that was in regard to a killing during the commission of a felony. The accidental taking of life by a person committing (or about to commit) a felony of any kind was at one time murder at common law, but, as pointed out earlier, this was ameliorated as time when by and the felony had to be one dangerous to life and likely to cause death. Under s 18(1)(a) it would amount to murder if the felony was one punishable by penal servitude for life. This matter is dealt with at some length by Windeyer J in  
        Ryan v The Queen 
         (1967) 121 CLR 205 at 240-241. The definition of murder at common law was thus replaced by a definition in accordance with the subsection, but the subsection did no more than attach to an act of homicide states of mind (intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, or reckless indifference) or descriptions (obviously dangerous to human life, or committed during or immediately after a felony punishable by death or penal servitude for life) which would, in any event, at common law have made the act of homicide murder.” 
        
       
      
    199 As is discussed later in these reasons, it is a principle of long standing that a person may be found guilty of murder although he or she did not commit the act or acts which physically caused the death of the victim, provided that the or she was acting in concert with the perpetrator.  
     
      
    200 The wording of s 18 did not alter the operation of the common law rules of complicity. It is a general rule of statutory interpretation that a basic common law doctrine is not to be disturbed unless the statute expressly requires that result.  
     
      
    201 In their commentary on the Act, the draftsmen, Sir Alfred Stephen and Alexander Oliver, noted in their Criminal Law Manual published at the time (at 199): 
     
      
       
        
        “The accidental taking of life, by a person committing (or about to commit) a felony of any kind is by the Common Law murder. Under the ninth section it will not amount to that crime, unless the felony was a capital one, or punishable by penal servitude for life. Such last-mentioned act or crime, attempted or committed, may, within the last member of this section, be either by the accused or by an accomplice with him.” 
        
       
      
    202 Later they said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So far, it is believed that in effect the English and the Colonial law are the same. But in one particular there is an important difference. The accidental taking of life, by a person committing (or about to commit) a felony of any kind, is by the Common Law murder. Under the ninth section it will not amount to that crime, unless the felony was a capital one, or punishable by penal servitude for life.” 
        
       
      
    203 There is nothing in the amended provision to disclose any intention to alter the common law principles of complicity. All that the Act did was to require a capital felony or one involving punishment by penal servitude for life, and to that extent, but only to that extent, it parted from the common law: cf R v Burke [1983] 2 NSWLR 93 per Miles J at 103. 
     
      
    204 While the Appellant sought to call in aid the rule of statutory interpretation noted by Hodges J in Craig Williamson Pty Limited v Barrowcliff [1915] VLR 450 at 452 to the effect that a statute should be construed as far as possible so as to give the same meaning to words wherever those words appear in the instrument, more relevant is the rule noted in Saraswati v The Queen (1991) 65 ALJR 402 per McHugh J at 410: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 33 of the Interpretation Act directs a court in interpreting a provision in an Act to give preference to a construction “that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act” over a construction “that would not promote that purpose or object”: cf  
        Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd 
         (1990) 170 CLR 249 at 261–2 … Sometimes the purpose of the legislation is expressly stated; sometimes it can be discerned only by inference after an examination of the legislation as a whole; and sometimes it can be discerned only by reference to the history of the legislation and the state of the law when it was enacted. It need hardly be said that a particular Act may have many purposes.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    205 In this instance it is perfectly clear that the reference to “the accused” when used twice in s 18 is a reference to the accused who is on trial and is not intended to give rise to the consequence that it must be his act, rather than the act of a person acting in concert, which causes death.  
     
      
    206 It is equally clear that the 1883 Act was passed to ameliorate the harsh common law approach to felony murder, and was not intended to restrict the principles of complicity, which were well entrenched in the 19th Century, so as to confine culpability for felony murder to the case of the offender whose act caused death.  
     
      
    207 Later amendments to the Crimes Act do not require any different approach. By Act No. 50 of 1974 the words “of an act obviously dangerous to life or” were omitted from s18. The Second Reading Speech of the Minister (Hansard, 1974 at 1355-6, 1829) indicates it was thought that the concept either unnecessarily increased the Crown’s difficulty of proof to an absurd degree, or was mere surplusage because the selection already included the concept of an act done with reckless indifference to human life, or operated with undue harshness against an accused. By Act No. 218 of 1989 the class of felony that came within the section was extended to those that attracted a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 25 years. The amendments also changed the maximum sentence for a number of offences from penal servitude for life to one of 25 years; for example, robbery with wounding. 
     
      
    208 The limited authority that exists in this regard also does not support the conclusion for which the Appellants contend.  
     
      
    209 In R v Surridge and Anor  (1942) 42 SR (NSW) 278, the victim, who had visited a prostitute, was assaulted by a number of persons intent on robbing him. The prostitute hit him on the side of the head after he objected to the presence of another female who had entered the room and rifled through his pockets taking his money. The prostitute then left the house and brought back her husband, the Appellant, and another man. A witness saw both men go into the house, heard sounds of violence coming from within and then saw the two men carry the victim around the corner to a vacant allotment. He died sixteen days later from his injuries.  
     
      
    210 On appeal this Court considered the question, whether “it was necessary to direct the jury that if they found that [the Appellant] was an accomplice of those who committed the actual acts of violence they must or might return a verdict of manslaughter only”. Jordan CJ (with whom Halse Rogers and Maxwell JJ agreed) said (at 282): 
     
      
       
        
        “The following considerations are material in considering whether an accomplice has incurred liability to conviction upon a charge of murder. At common law, killing constituted murder in two classes of case which, stated broadly, were (1) where the killing was intentional, and (2) where it was done unintentionally in the course of committing certain crimes which did not necessarily involve killing. This distinction is maintained in the definition of murder contained in s 18, which provides that murder shall be taken to have been committed only in two classes of case which, stated broadly, were (1) where the killing was intentional, and (2) where it was done unintentionally in the course of committing certain crimes which did not necessarily involve killing. This distinction is maintained in the definition of murder contained in s 18, which provides that murder shall be taken to have been committed only in two classes of cases, (1) where what caused the death was done or omitted (a) with reckless indifference to human life, or (b) with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, or (2) where it is done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with in, (a) of an act obviously dangerous to life, or (b) of a crime punishable by death or penal servitude for life. Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be manslaughter.  
        
       
       
        
        The special mention of an accomplice in the second group does not exclude accomplices from liability for murder for killings incurred in the first group.” 
        
       
      
    211 Speaking of an agreement between two or more persons falling into the second class of cases, Jordan CJ said (at 283): 
     
      
       
        
        “If, however, their agreement does not involve the doing of something in the first group, it is necessary, in order that the person who is an accomplice only may be guilty of murder, that it should have been within the common purpose of both that an act obviously dangerous to life, or a crime punishable by death or penal servitude for life, should be committed, and the cause of the death must have been something done by the other in an attempt to commit or during or immediately after the commission of that act or crime.  
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion, upon the evidence given in the present case, there is nothing in s 18 of the  
        Crimes Act 
        , 1900, which prevented the conviction of [the Appellant] of murder if the jury took the view that he was an accomplice only…” 
        
       
       
      
    212 The point also arose in R v Bell (1987) 8 NSWLR 311, upon an application to this Court to go behind a notice of abandonment. The Court said (at 315): 
     
      
       
        
        “The third proposed ground of challenge is that the Appellant had been convicted of a felony murder in circumstances which the actual act causing death had not been established as being the act of the Appellant, but rather the act of an accomplice. The factual basis for this challenge is that a series of alternative approaches had been set out in writing for the jury’s guidance and the verdict chosen by the jury indicated that it was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the Appellant who actually wielded the knife in the fatal wounding of the deceased.  
        
       
       
        
        We have had the assistance of submissions at some length from both the Appellant and the Crown on these three heads of challenge. In relation to each of the three, it cannot be said that the challenge is so clear as to demand the intervention of the Court. Nor can it be said that the point is so insubstantial as to be able to be brushed aside. Each one presents an arguable matter of challenge, but ultimately on the overall merits of the case, it is difficult to see how the jury properly instructed could have failed to convict the Appellant of the armed robbery, of which he was guilty. Likewise, the matter of the felony murder is, in our view, one on which the Appellant would not be able to count with great confidence as a basis of challenge to the conviction.” 
        
       
      
    213 Text writers also lend no support to the Appellant’s submission. Howard Australian Criminal Law (1965) in a footnote at page 226 states: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Surridge 
         (1942) 42 SR (NSW) 278. This case decided inter alia that the special mention of accomplices in  
        Crimes Act,  
        1900 (NSW), s 18 does not affect the application of the common law of complicity in murder in New South Wales. Similarly  
        Grand 
         (1903) 3 SR (NSW) 216, 223-224.” 
        
       
      
    214 A similar footnote is to be found in the most recent Fifth edition of Howard (Fisse) at page 321. 
     
      
    215 Finally, there are any number of cases of felony murder where the act causing death was that of an accomplice and not the accused, where an interpretation of s 18 advanced by the Appellants has not been applied: see R v Vandine [1970] 1 NSWR 252; R v Elliot and Hitchins (1983) 9 A Crim R 238; R v Shannon Foster (unreported, NSWCCA 7 April 1995); and Regina v Spathis and Patsalis [2001] NSWCCA 476.  
     
      
    216 The Appellants’ primary submission is accordingly not made good. Although the submissions in relation to the alternative challenge are somewhat cryptic, they seem to involve a proposition that felony murder would not be available in a case where the foundational crime depends upon the doctrine of common purpose. To some extent this submission appears to overlap with the primary submission and to that extent it calls for a further examination of the basis upon which culpability may be attracted to persons whose own acts were not the immediate cause of death.  
     
      
    217 In Osland v The Queen McHugh J at 341 to 351 gave consideration to the basis upon which a party may incur criminal liability, not only for his own acts that constitute the whole or part of the actus reus of a crime, but also for the acts of others that do so. That liability, as his Honour pointed out, can be primary, as in the case of the party whose own act constitutes the crime and in the case of the party who is present, and acting in concert with the primary perpetrator; or derivative, as in the case of the accessory before the fact who was not present at the scene of the crime, and in the case of the person who was merely present, encouraging but not participating physically in the acts constituting the actus reus.  
     
      
    218 As his Honour also pointed out (at 342): 
     
      
       
        
        “However, there is a third category where a person was not only present at the scene with the person who committed the acts alleged to constitute the crime but was there by reason of a pre-concert or agreement with that person to commit the crime. In that category, the liability of each person present as the result of the concert is not derivative but primary. He or she is a principal in the first degree. In that category each of the persons acting in concert is equally responsible  
        for the acts 
         of the other or others.” 
        
       
      
    219 His Honour observed (at 343) that, in such a case, the accused are all equally liable or responsible for the acts that constitute the crime, and in that respect he confirmed the correct statement of the law by this Court in R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545. 
     
      
    220 As a result, his Honour explained: 
     
      
       
        
        “a person may be found guilty of murder although he or she did not commit the acts which physically caused the death of the victim and the person who did is found guilty only of manslaughter.” (at 343); 
        
       
       
      and even where the actual perpetrator is acquitted of the offence, so long as it was that party’s act that is shown to have caused the death. In this respect his Honour said, citing in support the Privy Council decision in  
      Hui Chi-Ming v The Queen 
       [1922] 1 AC 34, and the decisions of the High Court in  
      Matusevich v The Queen 
       (1977) 137 CLR 633 and  
      Markby v The Queen 
       (1978) 140 CLR 108, that: 
       
       
        
        “ 
        it is the acts 
        , and not the crime,  
        of the actual perpetrator which are attributed to 
         the person acting in concert. If the latter person has the relevant  
        mens rea 
        , he or she is guilty of the principal offence because the  
        actus reus 
         is attributed to him or her by reason of the agreement and presence at the scene. It is irrelevant that the actual perpetrator cannot be convicted of that crime because he or she has a defence such as lack of  
        mens rea 
        , self-defence, provocation, duress or insanity.” (at 344).  
        
       
      
    221 His Honour observed, additionally (at 346/7): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Markby v The Queen 
         also supports the conclusion that it is the  
        wrongful acts of the perpetrator which are attributed 
         to the person acting in concert and present at the scene.  
        Markby 
         establishes that if violence is one of the contemplated incidents of a joint criminal enterprise and one of the accused kills a person, the other accused can be convicted of manslaughter even though the killer is guilty of murder. This decision is consistent only with the conclusion that it is the acts constituting the  
        actus reus 
        , and not the crime, of the actual offender which are attributed to the other party. The liability is direct or primary, not derivative.  
        
       
       
        
        This was the view of the Judicial Committee in  
        Chan Wing-Siu v The Queen 
         [1985] AC 168 where Sir Robin Cooke, giving the advice of the Judicial Committee, said:  
         
         
          
         
          
          ‘The case must depend rather on the wider principle whereby a secondary party is criminally liable for  
          acts 
           by the primary offender of a type which the former foresees but does not necessarily intend. 
           
           
          That there is such a principle is not in doubt. It turns on contemplation or, putting the same idea in other words, authorisation, which may be express but is more usually implied. It meets the case of a crime foreseen as a possible incident of the common unlawful enterprise. The criminal culpability lies in participating in the venture with that foresight.’ (emphasis added) 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The principle was recently reaffirmed by the House of Lords in  
        R v Powell  
        [1997] 3 WLR 959.  
        
       
       
        
        This Court had earlier applied the principle to the case of an accessory before the fact engaged in a joint criminal enterprise. In  
        Johns v The Queen 
         Mason, Murphy and Wilson JJ said:  
         
         
         
          
          ‘In our opinion these decisions support the conclusion reached by Street CJ, namely, 'that an accessory before the fact bears, as does a principal in the second degree, a criminal liability for an act which was within the contemplation of both himself and the principal in the first degree as an act which might be done in the course of carrying out the primary criminal intention - an act contemplated as a possible incident of the originally planned particular venture'. Such an act is one which falls within the parties' own purpose and design precisely because it is within their contemplation and is foreseen as a possible incident of the execution of their planned enterprise.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    222 Consideration was also given to this question in the earlier decision of this Court in R v Sharah (1992) 30 NSWLR 292 which has some similarity to the present case. Carruthers J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Smart J agreed) explained the way in which the relevant principles were to be applied in a case of common purpose murder and also in a case of constructive murder (there referred to as “felony murder”). Sharah was a case where there was a joint enterprise between the Appellant and a co-accused Attard, who was armed with a shotgun, to rob a man “John”, in the course of which the weapon was discharged by Attard twice, wounding “John”, and killing another man “Nick”.  
     
      
    223 His Honour summarised the elements which the Crown needed to prove to establish the offence of murder against the Appellant, who, although present at the time of the offences, had not himself caused the death or wounding, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “As to common purpose murder, it was incumbent upon the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt:  
         
         
        (i) that there was a common purpose between the appellant and Attard in company to rob John whilst Attard was, to the knowledge of the appellant, armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun;  
         
         
        (ii) that during the course of the armed robbery Attard discharged the gun intending to kill or cause serious bodily harm to Nick;  
         
         
        (iii) that the appellant contemplated that in the carrying out of the common unlawful purpose of armed robbery, Attard might use the gun with the intention of causing really serious bodily harm. 
         
         
        As to felony-murder (upon the assumption that the foundational crime was the offence under s98) it was incumbent upon the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt:  
        
       
       
        
        (i) that there was a common purpose between the appellant and Attard in company to rob John whilst Attard was, to the knowledge of the appellant, armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun;  
        
       
       
        
        (ii) that during the course of the armed robbery Attard wounded John and during the course of such armed robbery with wounding or immediately thereafter, Attard discharged the gun causing the death of Nick;  
        
       
       
        
        (iii) that the discharge of the gun by Attard during or immediately after the armed robbery with wounding of John, was a contingency which the appellant had in mind, whether or not the gun was fired intentionally and whether or not in furtherance of the common unlawful purpose. 
        
       
       
        
        As to the final element, see especially the judgments of this Court in  
        Regina v Johns (1978) 1NSWLR 282, 
         particularly at 294-295, where Begg J quotes with approval the directions of the trial judge. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to the s98 count, it was incumbent upon the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt:  
        
       
       
        
        (i) that there was a common purpose between the appellant and Attard in company to rob John whilst Attard was, to the knowledge of the appellant, armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a sawn-off, double-barrelled shotgun;  
        
       
       
        
        (ii) that during the course of the armed robbery Attard wounded John;  
        
       
       
        
        (iii) that the appellant contemplated that in the carrying out of the common unlawful purpose of armed robbery such wounding might occur.” 
        
       
      
    224 His Honour approved the directions, which the trial judge had given in relation to felony murder, as well as the explanation which was given as to the policy reasons for its presence in the statute books.  
     
      
    225 His Honour rejected the submission which was advanced, on appeal, in relation to both limbs of the way that the Crown pursued its case of murder against the Appellant, that it was necessary for the Crown to prove that he knew, or alternatively contemplated as a possibility that the gun was loaded and actually authorised its use. In relation to this submission, his Honour said (at 301): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is well established that there are two classes of common purpose murder. The first class is where the Crown proves that the accused was present and that the deceased was killed in accordance with an understanding or arrangement to which the accused was a party and that that understanding or arrangement included the intent charged, that is, either to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. The second class of case is where the accused lends himself to a criminal enterprise knowing that a potentially lethal weapon was being carried by one of his companions and in the event that it is in fact used by one of his partners with an intent sufficient for murder, then the accused too will be guilty of that offence of murder if the Crown establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the accused contemplated that in the carrying out of the common unlawful purpose, one of his partners might use a lethal weapon with the intention of at least causing serious bodily harm. In the recent case of  
        Hui Chi-ming v Regina [1991] 3 All ER 897 
         (a case to which I regret to say, this Court was not referred by either party) the Privy Council were concerned with a case of the second class. The present case is also within the second class.  
        
       
       
        
        Counsel for the appellant in  
        Hui Chi-ming 
         referred the Board to the observations of Sir Robin Cooke in  
        Chan Wing-siu v Regina [1985] AC 168, at 175: 
         
          
           
          ‘It turns on contemplation or, putting the same idea in other words,  
          authorisation, 
           which may be expressed but is more usually implied. It meets the case of a crime foreseen as a possible incident of the common unlawful enterprise. The criminal culpability lies in participating in the venture with that foresight.’"" 
          
         
        
       
      
    226 As his Honour noted, the Privy Council in Hui Chi-Ming rejected the contention that the equation, in this observation, of “contemplation” with “authorisation”, means that the accomplice who merely foresees the further and additional act of the principal is not liable for this act.  
     
      
    227 Carruthers J noted, applying Hui Chi-Ming, that authority established that it was sufficient for the Crown in the instant case to prove common purpose if the Appellant participated in the unlawful common purpose realising (without agreeing to such conduct being used) that Attard may kill or inflict serious injury with the loaded gun. The submission that the Crown had to prove that the Appellant actually authorised the use of the weapon if necessary therefore did not stand with authority.  
     
      
    228 While these decisions establish the fallacy in the Appellant’s submissions, in the light of the way in which the Crown case was put, it is convenient, finally to dispose of the suggestion that the approach adopted could give rise to an absurdity. This depended upon the example that was postulated in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “A & B agree to assault V1 and V2 and in carrying out this joint enterprise A hits V1 with no intention of inflicting serious bodily or to kill and V1 dies – an obvious case of manslaughter. B also hits V2 with no such intention as above and V2 dies – an obvious case of manslaughter. AB are charged with murder under s 18(1)(a) on the basis that in respect of A the accomplice B committed manslaughter an offence carrying the penalty of 25 years and the death of V1 occurred during or immediately after the offence by B and similarly in respect of B.” 
        
       
      
    229 The problem with this example, however, is that the relevant joint enterprise between A and B was one to assault V1 and V2, and that would not qualify as a foundational crime for felony murder, since it is not a crime that carries a penalty of imprisonment for 25 years.  
     
      
       
      GROUND 6 (BOTH APPELLANTS) – THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A DIRECTED VERDICT OF ACQUITTAL ON COUNTS 3 AND 1. 
       
      
    230 In substance this was said to follow from the preceding grounds, in that: 
     
      
       
      (a) “in company” was not proved; 
       
       
      (b) stealing from the person or in the presence of the victim (Phillips) was not proved; 
       
       
      (c) there was no evidence of any intention to rob Phillips; 
       
       
      (d) the theft of Phillip’s mobile was an independent act of Painter; 
       
      
    231 Each of these submissions has been dealt with so far as they focus upon Count 3 as a separate offence, and also so far as that offence was relied upon as a foundational offence for Count 1. In the latter regard the submissions concerning the availability of felony murder have also been dealt with under Ground 5. Since none of the submissions concerning those grounds has been made good, this ground also fails.  
     
      
       
      GROUND 7 (BOTH APPELLANTS) – COUNTS 1, 2, 3: THE VERDICTS OF THE JURY WERE UNREASONABLE AND CANNOT BE SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE BEING ALSO UNSAFE AND UNSATISFACTORY GIVING RISE TO A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE.  
       
      
    232 This effectively depended upon the remaining grounds being made good, although reliance was also placed upon a general submission that the evidence having been dealt with “globally” as applicable to all counts, and not directed to the individual counts, the jury was left with a confused picture.  
     
      
    233 The Crown case against Jacobs was very strong. In brief summary, the combination of the following facts and circumstances establish that this was not a case where the jury should, on the whole of the evidence, have entertained a reasonable doubt as to his guilt: M v The Queen (1994) 69 ALJR 83: 
     
      
       
      (a) Jacobs acknowledged his presence at the scene, and at least his participation in watching over the victims while the search was being made for property to take; 
       
       
      (b) He told a large number of lies about the matter, he was party to having others tell lies, he rehearsed his lies, and he asked Mehajer to tell lies and to take steps to lessen the risks of their detection; 
       
       
      (c) He acknowledged on several occasions being in serious trouble in relation to the matters and to having contemplated flight; 
       
       
      (d) He took from the premises the phone of the deceased and sold it to Nilsen; 
       
       
      (e) Painter gave evidence which was capable of being accepted by the jury, and which very clearly implicated him in the offences;  
       
       
      (f) His evidence did not fit within the evidence of Phillips as to what occurred in the cafe; and  
       
       
      (g) The terms of his several conversations with Cameron Roach and Mehajer, particularly those of 21 August 2000, 18 October 2000 pointed strongly to his complicity.  
       
      
    234 This ground is not made good in relation to this Appellant.  
     
      
    235 I have reached the same conclusion in relation to Mehajer, although the case was not quite so strong in relation to him, in the absence of any evidence establishing his post offence possession of any of the stolen property. In his case the following circumstances lead me to this view: 
     
      
       
      (a) The coincidence of telephone calls between his mobile phone on the day of the offence and the phones of Jacobs and Painter (including multiple calls to Painter), each of whom were shown to have had possession of property taken from the two victims; 
       
       
      (b) Mr Phillips’ evidence in relation to the conduct, as well as the physical description of the man who threatened him with the knife, and the Comfit picture, the features of which were remarkably close to Mehajer’s appearance, apart from the length of his hair, a matter as to which Mr Phillips expressed a concern from the outset; a description which did not match that of Painter and Jacobs; 
       
       
      (c) Mehajer’s lies to police; 
       
       
      (d) The meeting between Mehajer, Roach and Nilsen after Nilsen’s interview with Police on 4 August 2000; 
       
       
      (e) The terms of the telephone conversations between Jacobs and Mehajer, particularly those of 4 August 2000 and 21 August 2000; 
       
       
      (f) The sighting by independent witnesses of two and later three men, in the vicinity of the cafe before the offences, in circumstances that were consistent with the evidence of Jacobs and Painter, one of whose description fitted that of Mehajer; and  
       
       
      (g) The evidence of Painter and Jacobs which implicated him centrally in the offences and which was capable of acceptance by the jury. 
       
      
    236 Counsel for this Appellant provided an extensive analysis of what were said to be the major inconsistencies between the objective evidence and the evidence of Mr Phillips, on the one hand, and the evidence of Mr Phillips on the other hand, such that, in his submission, the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. It may be observed that this submission does not address the circumstances that Jacobs’ evidence, once given at trial, was available in relation to Mehajer.  
     
      
    237 Leaving that aspect aside, I turn to the inconsistencies that were said to exist: 
     
      
       
      (a) Painter’s account of his role in the robbery: 
       
      
    238 This was said to be inherently improbable, in that had he not indicated a willingness, in advance of arriving at the cafe to engage in a robbery, then it was unlikely that he would have been co-opted for the venture. Further it was said to be improbable that the only link between Painter and Jacobs had been Mehajer in view of their common friendship with Mr Roach; and that suspicion arose as to Painter’s greater involvement from the fact that Ms Reely had a relationship with Pearce, who disclosed an intention on the day after the robbery, to meet a man whom he described as “Christian”.  
     
      
    239 Clearly enough this gave rise to issues which were properly before the jury, which were the subject of addresses. The jury was not obliged to accept everything which Jacobs and Painter said, concerning whether or not there were discussions in the car as to what was planned. Clearly enough, however, they accepted the evidence of each of Painter and Jacobs as to Mehajer’s presence. The issues concerning Ms Reely and Pearce, and possible contact between Pearce and Painter, were side issues. It remains possible that other persons were involved in the planning of the offences, yet even if that be true, what was the issue for this jury was confined to the participation of those before the Court. 
     
      
       
      (b) Painter’s account of their arrival at Leumeah: 
       
      
    240 This related to the fact that Painter had not mentioned to the Crime Commission the fact of the preliminary reconnaissance of the cafe, of the wait for the deceased to arrive, and of seeing the deceased's car pulling up followed by the men entering the cafe. It was accepted that there had been a mention in the recorded walk through by Painter of Mehajer or Jacobs saying, “he’s gone up there”.  
     
      
    241 It is not entirely clear that Painter did say in his statement to the Crime Commission that he first saw the victim inside the cafe. In cross-examination he made it clear that he was not 100% sure if he had seen the car pull up, indicated that he assumed that had been the case, but asserted that he had seen the men outside the front of the cafe. The conflict in this part of Painter’s evidence was brought to the attention of the jury, but it was hardly a matter of any great moment.  
     
      
       
      (c) Timing of the robbery: 
       
      
    242 This related to the evidence of Painter that he placed a call to a Mr Gough at 4:17 PM and that they then left to go to the cafe a few minutes later, which the Appellant suggested would have had them there at about 4:23 PM. This was said to be inconsistent with the fact that the deceased took a call from Mr Kent at 4:41 PM, which must have occurred before the robbery, and with Mr Phillips’ evidence of the unloading of the soft drink after their arrival taking 20 minutes or so to complete. This period, it was submitted, would also not fit in with Painter’s evidence of seeing the car pull up. Reference was also made to the fact that Mehajer’s mobile rang Painter’s mobile at 4:29 PM.  
     
      
    243 Apart from giving rise to an apparent inconsistency in timing, this body of evidence seems to have also been relied upon to show that Painter had a somewhat greater involvement than he was prepared to acknowledge, in that it would tend to suggest that he had been engaged, himself, in some form of surveillance over this period, which he omitted to disclose. 
     
      
    244 The apparent discrepancy is equally explicable upon a simple inaccuracy on Painter’s part in estimating the timing of the relevant events, in circumstances where there was no reason for him to make any particular notice of the time at which various things happened.  
     
      
    245 The 4:29 PM call was one that lasted for only a matter of seconds and was not answered. Any number of possibilities exist as to why it was made, and to select any of them would involve speculation. What is however clear is that the robberies occurred somewhere between 4:41 Pm and 4:52 PM. Whether the credibility of Painter’s account was affected adversely by the matters mentioned, or whether it was a matter of unimportant detail, was properly to be determined by the jury, which heard detailed argument in relation to it.  
     
      
       
      (d) Painter’s account of his first encounter with the victims: 
       
      
    246 This has already been addressed. 
     
      
       
      (e) Painter’s evidence concerning the knife: 
       
      
    247 This relates to the fact that Painter’s evidence that he did not see anyone with a knife, and did not hear any mention of a threat concerning its use to cut someone’s throat, was inconsistent with the evidence of Mr Phillips. This was said to indicate an unwillingness on his part to acknowledge the occurrence of aggravated violence, and his acquiescence in it, lest that contradict his asserted minor role or threaten his indemnity. It is not easy to understand why this should be so, since there was no suggestion by anyone that he personally used the knife. The indemnity was not given in circumstances where the Crime Commission or Police were unaware of its use.  
     
      
       
      (f) Painter’s evidence of his search of the car of the deceased: 
       
      
    248 It was asserted that Painter’s evidence to the effect that he did not know what he was looking for in the car and made only one search, did not sit with Mr Phillips’ evidence of hearing someone say after the search “there should be more”, or with his suggestion that the car was searched twice. Again this was relied upon to suggest that Painter had a greater knowledge and involvement than he was prepared to admit.  
     
      
    249 It is not at all clear that Mr Phillips said that the car was searched twice. Nor was it necessarily the case that Painter needed to know what was in the car, if it became perfectly clear to him, from what was occurring, that a search was being made for money. As events turned out all that he found would seem to have been a mobile phone, having missed the wallet of Mr Phillips that was in the vehicle.  
     
      
       
      (g) Painters’ evidence that Mehajer was searching the shop: 
       
      
    250 This related to the fact that Mr Phillips said that the Lebanese man effectively overpowered him and restrained him while the search was being undertaken of the premises and while the deceased was attacked, and that this man tried to discourage any further assault of himself after he had been kicked; while Painter said that it was Mehajer who was out the back searching the premises. This, it was submitted, he had said in order to be able to assert that it was Mehajer and not he who struck the fatal blow.  
     
      
    251 This was an important matter for the jury, which was clearly brought to their attention. It was not necessarily fatal to the credibility of Painter since it remained possible for Mehajer to have been seen by Painter carrying out the act, which Painter described, during the time that Mr Phillips had lost consciousness. 
     
      
       
      (h) The order and manner in which the assaults on the deceased and Mr Phillips occurred: 
       
      
    252 This relates to the fact that, in his first statement, Painter said that Jacobs kicked Mr Phillips after the deceased had been pushed by Mehajer, whereas at the trial he said that Mr Phillips was the first to be kicked. This also related to the fact that he said that he only saw one blow being inflicted to the deceased, whereas the medical evidence showed that there were multiple blows to his head and body and that the deceased had been dragged and/or flung about, happenings which were consistent with Mr Phillips’ evidence. 
     
      
    253 Again it was submitted that Painter tailored his evidence so as to minimise his involvement, and so as not to jeopardise his indemnity. This was similarly a matter that required attention by the jury, but it did not necessarily involve a significant challenge to Painter’s credibility, having regard to his evidence that he had not gone out to the back of the cafe and that he had been outside for a time searching the deceased’s car. This does need also to be considered in the context of the time frame within which the offences had to be committed, that is, between at most, the eleven minutes between 4:41 PM and 4:52 PM, and most probably a shorter period having regard to the fact that before his death the deceased had to complete the 4:41 PM call and walk over to Mr Casey’s shop and back (Mr Casey thought at about 4:45) to collect the package which Mr Kent had asked him to collect. 
     
      
       
      (i) Painter’s understanding that the NSW Crime Commission had believed his role to have been a minimal one.  
       
      
    254 This arose from the fact that on 6 April 2001 Painter was advised by the Commissioner of the NSW Crime Commission, that it had not believed him to have been responsible for any of the violence, and considered that he had been “unlucky” and that “somebody went too far but we don’t think it was you.”  
     
      
    255 Prior to this Painter had consistently lied to the Commission, but those lies had been exposed. He acknowledged at trial that he understood that the basis for the Commission’s assessment of his culpability lay in an intercepted conversation between a girlfriend and a family friend, and also acknowledged that such information as the Commission had, was derived from what he had himself said to those persons to the effect that his role had been minor and that he had not had anything to do with the killing of the deceased. 
     
      
    256 This combination of circumstances was relied upon in support of an argument that Painter had been encouraged by the Commission, and had the confidence, to give an account which minimised his role and shifted the blame to others.  
     
      
    257 Clearly this was an issue which was important for an assessment of his credibility and which led to the strong warning which was given to the jury. Nevertheless it remained a jury issue, and it did not of itself displace the remaining evidence concerning Mehajer’s involvement, most particularly that of Jacobs.  
     
      
       
      (j) Calls made to the deceased’s mobile after the robbery 
       
      
    258 This related to the several calls made to the deceased’s mobile from 5:28 PM after the robbery including those traced to Denning’s mobile, to Joel Daddo’s phone, and to the phone of Ms Walker, which apparently was available to Pearce; and to the fact that Painter gave evidence to the effect that the deceased’s phone, which was then in his possession, had rung after the robbery, and that this call had been made by Mehajer. It was his evidence that this call had been made while they were driving home from the cafe to the stolen mobile into which he had placed his own SIM card, in order to see whether it worked. This was said to be untrue since there was no evidence of Mehajer’s phone being used to place a call at that time; moreover, it was pointed out that although Painter had given this explanation, when asked about the call that had been made from Mehajer’s mobile to his phone at 4:29 PM, yet, on any view, that call must have preceded the robbery. 
     
      
    259 Attention was also drawn to the fact that each of Painter and Jacobs denied having taken calls on the deceased’s mobile phone at 6:25 PM and to the fact that Jacobs said that he had been given the phone without a SIM card; and to the fact that the call made on Denning’s phone at 5:28 PM to the deceased’s phone had been answered, and did not go to a message bank or to a service using Painter’s SIM card. 
     
      
    260 In the result it was contended that there was material capable of suggesting that each of Denning, Pearce, Painter and Jacobs had some kind of guilty connection in that they had given evasive or untrue evidence concerning the phone calls, such that Painter should not have been believed in relation to Mehajer’s involvement, having regard particularly to the absence of any evidence connecting Mehajer to Denning or Pearce, or of any other evidence showing that Mehajer ever had either of the stolen phones in his possession.  
     
      
    261 It is not to be overlooked that, on Painter’s evidence, the phone which he had was that of Mr Phillips, not the phone of the deceased, and that it was into this phone that he placed his SIM card. Jacobs had the phone of the deceased which he later sold to Nilsen. It follows that so much of this argument as is relied upon to suggest that Painter lied when suggesting that Mehajer rang the deceased’s phone to see whether it worked using Painter’s SIM card is in error. What he was saying was that it was Mr Phillips’ phone that rang on the way home, not the phone of the deceased.  
     
      
    262 The possible involvement of Pearce, Denning and of unidentified members or associates of the Rebels in the offence was raised by the defence, and it was a matter which was fully ventilated and left to the jury. 
     
      
    263 In summary, there were good forensic arguments available to the defence in relation to the credibility of the evidence of each of Jacobs and Painter. However there was independent support for their accounts, and the jury, who were in a position to see and hear them, had a distinct advantage over this Court, in making an assessment of them. I am not persuaded, having exhaustively reviewed and examined the whole of the evidence, that the various aspects which have been raised in relation to this ground were sufficient to lead to the conclusion that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt in relation to Mehajer’s guilt.  
     
      
    264 This ground is not made good in respect of either Appellant.  
     
      
       
      GROUND 8A (MEHAJER) – The Trial Judge Failed to Give a Section 165 Evidence Act Direction in Relation to the Evidence of the Co-Accused Jacobs 
       
       
      
    265 Section 165, relevantly, is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""s165 Unreliable evidence 
        
       
       
        
        (1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
           (d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and 
           
          (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and 
           
          (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so. 
         
         
        (4) ... 
        
       
       
        
        (5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury."" 
        
       
       
      
    266 According to this appellant, two directions were necessary: 
     
      
    · First, the jury should have been told that the evidence of the co-accused (Jacobs) may have been unreliable. 
     
      
    · Secondly, the jury should also have been told that they should not use the evidence of Painter to corroborate the evidence of Jacobs, since they were both accomplices. 
     
      
    267 Neither direction was sought (cf s165(2)). Rule 4 applies. It was said that counsel's failure to seek these directions was an oversight. There was no other forensic purpose. The Crown accepted that this was so. It is nonetheless instructive that, in the atmosphere of the trial, it did not occur to Counsel that it was necessary to seek the directions that it is now suggested should have been given. His Honour had the power to give warnings, notwithstanding the absence of a request (cf s165(5)).  
     
      
    268 Painter and Jacobs each asserted that Mehajer was at the scene. The evidence of Painter was subject to a warning. The evidence of Jacobs, however, was not. 
     
      
    269 It may be accepted that the evidence of Jacobs was important in the case presented by the appellant Mehajer. Did the failure to provide a warning give rise to the possibility of a miscarriage of justice? It cannot be doubted that Jacobs fell within s165(1)(d), or the common law rule in respect of accomplices. There plainly were reasonable grounds for supposing that he was ""criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings"". However, that is not determinative. There is a discretion as to whether a warning should be provided. In Webb and Hay v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41, the principle was stated by Toohey J (with whom other members of the Court agreed). That principle was conveniently set out in the headnote in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Per curiam 
        
       
       
        
        (1) When an accused gives evidence implicating another accused, the question whether an accomplice warning should be given and, if so, in what terms, cannot be answered without reference to the unique circumstances of the case. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) If in such a case the judge considers it necessary or appropriate to give a warning to protect the co-accused, it must be done in a way which makes clear that the warning relates only to the use of the evidence as against the co-accused and does not lead the jury to believe that the warning attaches to the accused's evidence in his own case."" 
        
       
      
    270 In formulating that principle, the Court approved the following statement in R v Henning (CCA, unreported, 11.05.90) where the Court (Gleeson CJ, Campbell and Mathews JJ) said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""But different principles apply when the supposed accomplice who gives evidence against a co-accused is himself an accused giving evidence in his own case. It would be difficult indeed to seek to apply inflexible rules to such situations. For the interests of justice will almost certainly require different responses in different circumstances. Considerable latitude must be allowed in order to enable trial judges to address the situation in a manner which will adapt to the competing interests in the particular case."" 
        
       
      
    271 In R v Johnston [2004] NSWCCA 58, James J considered a situation where the trial Judge had not given a warning against the co-accused who had given evidence implicating the appellant. As here, no warning had been requested. James J (Santow JA and Whealy J agreeing) determined that there had been no error. Rule 4 should be applied. Had the trial Judge given a warning, a corresponding warning would have been given against the appellant. James J said this: (para 149) 
     
      
       
        
        ""If similar directions had been given about both the applicant's evidence and Watts' evidence, the applicant would have been in much the same position as if no direction at all had been given."" 
        
       
      
    272 Here there was no potential for a corresponding warning against Mehajer. His evidence did not incriminate his co-accused Jacobs. There was no forensic disadvantage in seeking the warning. The warning, therefore, on the Appellant's argument, ought to have been given. 
     
      
    273 It is instructive to examine the reasons warnings are given for certain categories of evidence and not others. The issue was examined by Howie J in R v Stewart  (2001) 124 A Crim R 371. In Bromley v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 315, Brennan J made the following statement: (at 325) 
     
      
       
        
        “When the danger in acting upon the evidence is real and substantial and when the conduct of the trial and evidence … are such that the jury may not have fully perceived or the jury’s attention may have been diverted from the danger, a warning should be given.” 
        
       
      
    274 Elsewhere Brennan J said: (at 324) 
     
      
       
        
        “If the danger is equally obvious to the lay mind, a failure to warn of its existence is much less likely to result in a miscarriage of justice and thus much less likely to provide a ground for quashing a conviction than if the court has a special knowledge of the danger. If the danger is so obvious that the jury are fully alive to it without a warning, no warning need be given.” 
        
       
      
    275 In Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79, Deane J made a similar observation: (at 95-96) 
     
      
       
        
        “[The] responsibility [of a trial judge] includes the giving of an appropriate caution or warning in circumstances where there are potential dangers in acting upon particular evidence which may not, without such a caution or warning, be appreciated by the jury.” 
        
       
      
    276 These passages are a commentary upon the common law. In the context of s165 of the Evidence Act 1995, in R v Baartman [2000] NSWCCA 298, Kirby J said this: (para 62) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In the nature of things, evidence given by all witnesses may be unreliable. Evidence is necessarily dependent upon observation and recollection. Both are fallible. However, s165 is not dealing with unreliability in this sense. Rather, the need for a warning typically arises either because the jury needs to be acquainted with the accumulated experience of courts in dealing with certain types of evidence, or because there is the danger that the jury may over-estimate the probative value of certain evidence (see ALRC 26, Vol 1, para 1017)."" 
        
       
      
    277 In R v Stewart (supra), Howie J made the following comments in the context of an ""accomplice"" warning under s165(1)(d): 
     
      
       
        
        ""127 In respect of accomplices or persons otherwise implicated in the offence before the jury, the matters which were considered by the common law as rendering their evidence suspect and which gave rise to the need for a warning were two-fold: firstly, they may have a reason to implicate another person even to the extent of implicating a person who is in fact innocent of the crime and, secondly, they may tend to exaggerate the role of another while minimising their own involvement and fabricate evidence to achieve this end:  
        R v McLachlan 
         [1999] 2 VR 553 at 562;  
        R v Kendrick 
         [1997] 2 VR 699 at 705;  
        Downey 
         (1997) 97 A Crim R 41 at 44;  
        Ware 
         (1994) 73 A Crim R 17 at 28.  
        
       
       
        
        128 As the trial judge in the present case told the jury, these are the matters within the special experience of the courts. Therefore, they are matters which should be drawn to the attention of the jury whenever a warning under the section is given in respect of evidence of a witness falling within this category. These are the matters about which the trial judge is required to inform the jury under s 165(2)(b) unless there is good reason not to do so. ..."" 
        
       
      
    278 However, the tendency in human nature to downplay one's own role, and shift the blame to others by exaggerating their role, may be thought to be obvious, and one which the jury would recognise. Indeed, James J in R v Johnston (supra) said this:  
     
      
       
        
        ""150 There was no need for the trial judge to tell the jury that Watts (or the applicant) had an interest in giving evidence exculpating himself by inculpating the other accused. That would have been blindingly obvious to the jury."" 
        
       
      
    279 That is precisely what was done by Painter, in giving evidence in the Crown case, and by Jacobs, in giving evidence in his own case. Each asserted that he either had no role or a minimal role in the misdeeds of that day. 
     
      
    280 However, whether this aspect was obvious or not, the warning which the trial Judge gave in the context of Painter’s evidence expressed the principle in very general terms. Its application to others, who might be reasonably supposed to have also been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings, would have been immediately apparent. His Honour said this, in his summing up: (SU61/62) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Can I turn to say something to you now about the evidence that was given by the witness Christian Painter ... I warn you that the evidence of this witness is of a kind that may be unreliable. 
        
       
       
        
        You appreciate that the Crown contends that Christian Painter was an accomplice to the robberies in company. After all, he is named here in the indictment in the second and the third counts. Evidence given in criminal proceedings, by a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the counts charged in the indictment, is in a category that maybe unreliable.  
        Where a crime has been committed, especially a serious one and one involving a number of people, it must be recognised and you would doubtless appreciate it, that there is a temptation for someone involved in describing what occurred, to minimise his own role and to maximise the roles of others, because he was, on the Crown case, an accomplice.  
         That feature, of itself, requires that I warn you that the evidence of Christian Painter is of a kind that may be unreliable."" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    281 His Honour went on to deal with other aspects which were important to the ""accomplice"" direction given in respect of Painter, but had no relevance to the co-accused Jacobs, namely the discount on sentence given to Painter. 
     
      
    282 I am not persuaded that the absence of a warning in respect of Jacobs created the risk of a miscarriage of justice. I would refuse leave under Rule 4 on the first aspect. 
     
      
    283 The second complaint concerned the absence of a direction that the evidence of one accomplice could not be used to corroborate another. The Crown disputed that there was an absolute requirement to this effect, even before the Evidence Act. The principle was stated by Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Pollitt v The Queen (1991-1992) 174 CLR 558 in these terms: (at 600) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The rule that one accomplice cannot corroborate another is based in large part on the common interest of accomplices in minimizing their involvement in the offence charged. The common interest raises the possibility that they may have conspired to give an identical but false account ( 
        R v Button 
         (1991) 54 A Crim R 1 at 8, per Byrne J. See also Heydon, ""The Corroboration of Accomplices"" [1973]  
        Criminal Law Review 
         264.) It is for this reason that a direction is given that accomplices cannot corroborate each other ( 
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Hester 
         [1973] AC at 325, per Lord Diplock;  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Kilbourne 
         [1973] AC at 750-751, per Lord Reid.) Thus, if there is no possibility of joint fabrication, as, for example, where the witness was an accomplice in other offences and is called to give similar fact evidence, a direction to this effect is not required (See  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Kilbourne 
         [1973] AC at 748, per Lord Hailsham.) Equally, there may be cases not involving accomplices where, because of the possibility of joint fabrication, it is necessary to direct a jury to look elsewhere for corroboration. But there was no basis for any suggestion of joint fabrication in this case and, thus, there was no need for a direction that Denning and Jones could not corroborate each other."" 
        
       
      
    284 That is a statement of the common law. Section 164(1) of the Evidence Act abolished the need for corroboration. There was therefore no need to give a warning relating to the absence of corroboration (s164(2)(b)). However, the ""inclusive"" nature of s165(1) may still make it appropriate to warn the jury in the terms contemplated by the common law, as set out in Pollitt, where the evidence may be unreliable. 
     
      
    285 Here, the evidence of Jacobs was not adverse to Mehajer, except in two respects, although both were important. First, Jacobs placed Mehajer at the scene. He therefore contradicted the account given by Mehajer in his evidence. Secondly, he said that he saw Mehajer emerging from the back room, implicating him in the injuries received by the deceased. In other respects his evidence was favourable. He did not witness any violence on the part of Mehajer. Such violence as he saw was perpetrated by Painter. 
     
      
    286 The Crown submitted that, even on the common law principle, there was no real possibility of joint fabrication between Painter and Jacobs. The accounts each gave, except in one or two respects, were utterly different. A direction along the lines suggested was, therefore, not required. 
     
      
    287 Again, I am not persuaded. I would refuse leave under Rule 4. 
     
      
       
      GROUND 8 (BOTH APPELLANTS) – His Honour Failed to Direct Properly or Adequately as to the Jury Consideration of Painter’s Evidence 
       
      
    288 It was submitted that while his Honour gave directions in relation to the potential unreliability of Painter’s evidence in accordance with s 165 of the Evidence Act, an additional direction should have been given to the effect that it was dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of this witness, by reason of his position as an accomplice. The common law rule of practice was said to have been preserved, notwithstanding the enactment of the Evidence Act. Alternatively it was submitted that by reason of the “counter allegations”, and in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice, the case was appropriate for a Longman warning: Regina v Stewart (2001) 124 A Crim R 371.  
     
      
    289 In that regard it was also contended that so important was Painter’s evidence for the Crown case, that in circumstances where he was an admitted liar, a strong direction was required as to the dangers of convicting on his uncorroborated evidence (R v Chen [2002] NSWCCA 174 at para 58). A Longman direction was in fact sought by counsel for the Appellants but refused by his Honour.  
     
      
    290 This submission must be considered in the light of the detailed and explicit directions which were given. His Honour said in addition to the general warning extracted in the preceding ground. 
     
      
       
        
        “There are other matters, further matters that may cause the evidence of Mr Painter to be unreliable. You will remember, after the police took possession of the mobile phone which Painter had taken from the crime scene, he lied in his statement to the police about the circumstances in which he came into possession of that phone. He also had his brother lie about this and he also had his friend, Mr Kohler, lie about it. Then when he was required to give evidence in the Crime Commission, Painter lied again on 22 June and 16 October 2000. 
        
       
       
        
        It was not until 6 April 2001, over a year after these crimes were committed, that Mr Painter changed his account of events on 3 March 2000 and in doing so, he understood that by co-operating he would not be charged for any involvement in what had taken place. After indicating he would co-operate, you remember Mr Painter changed his mind about that and then the police proceeded to charge him with perverting the course of justice, because of the concoction of the tale about where the phone came from. 
        
       
       
        
        Eventually, after he was charged and before he came before the District Court to be dealt with for that offence, Painter again decided to co-operate. He told you that he did so because he was concerned for himself and his brother Jason. What he did was to plead guilty in the District Court, to the charge that had been laid as to the perversion of the course of justice.  
        
       
       
        
        On 29 October 2001 Painter was given a suspended sentence, which was conditional upon his telling the truth in these proceedings. Had he not offered to assist the authorities, he could have expected to have been given a significantly heavier sentence. Now that he was given lighter sentence in the District Court than he would have been given had he not offered to assist in the proceedings now before this court is, I tell you, consistent with sentencing policy administered by the courts in this state. The policy is this, a person who is liable to be punished for a criminal offence, is entitled to have his sentence reduced if he gives assistance to the authorities. The extent of the reduction may depend upon the value of the assistance as a matter of principle.  
        
       
       
        
        One form of assistance is an undertaking to give evidence about events that the person has witnessed and if such an undertaking is given, it is expected that the undertaking will be complied with. Typically, one person in a group named in the joint criminal enterprise, may agree to name others involved and to give evidence of their involvement.  
        
       
       
        
        The reduction of punishment for a crime depends in part, upon the provision of such information and assistance and hence, the courts have pursued a policy of providing an incentive for the giving of assistance. Discounts on sentence are given to encourage those with information to come forward. Painter was given a discount off his sentence, because of his expressed willingness to assist the authorities in relation to the events of 3 March. 
        
       
       
        
        Where a witness gives assistance to authorities in circumstances such as exist here, the evidence given may be unreliable. Having provided a version of events to the authorities, there is a danger that the person offering assistance may feel locked into that version and is obliged to repeat it, even if it is untrue.  
        
       
       
        
        I am not suggesting, in this case, that Painter has locked himself into giving a false version of events. What you make of his evidence is a matter for you, because I am not the tribunal of fact, you are. However, I am pointing out the circumstances in which Mr Painter came to give his evidence in this court, as being circumstances which may render his evidence unreliable. Whether you find his evidence unreliable, or reliable, is for you to determine as the tribunal of fact. But in assessing his evidence you must appreciate the need for careful scrutiny. 
        
       
       
        
        There is yet another matter which may cause the evidence of Mr Painter to be unreliable. He has been provided with an indemnity. Although Mr Hoenig has reminded you of this, I am going to remind you of it again in the context of this direction. The indemnity is Ex K, and you will have it before you, and the indemnity is expressed to have been given subject to these conditions. Firstly, that Painter actively co-operates in these criminal proceedings, that is, by giving evidence. And secondly, that his evidence in these proceedings is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  
        
       
       
        
        It is important that you have regard to the terms of that indemnity., Where a witness gives evidence pursuant to a conditional indemnity, that evidence may be unreliable, because a person giving evidence under a conditional indemnity, such as that provided in this case, may feel locked into giving a particular account, even though it is not true. Once again thought, I stress whether you find Mr Painter’s evidence is true or note, is a matter for you to determine.  
        
       
       
        
        The importance of the evidence of Mr Painter to the Crown case is obvious. He has given evidence, the acceptance of which the Crown relies upon to establish the participation of each accused in the robbery in company, and each accused denies such participation.  
        
       
       
        
        For the reasons I have stated, members of the jury, it is necessary that you scrutinise the evidence of Mr Painter with extreme care. You should examine it most closely, conscious of the fact that it may be unreliable, in order to determine whether to accept his evidence and in determining what weight you should give to such of his evidence as you do accept.” 
        
       
      
    291 These directions were so comprehensive that it was not, in my view, necessary for his Honour to have given a Longman warning. In any event, there was some corroboration of Painter’s evidence in so far as it accorded with that of Mr Phillips, and in so far as Mehajer and Jacobs individually revealed a consciousness of guilt by their subsequent behaviour including the fabrications for which they were responsible.  
     
      
    292 As is apparent from the extract, there was a reference by his Honour to the circumstance that, on the Crown case, Painter had been an accomplice. In R v Stewart (2001) 52 NSWLR 301 at paras 21 and 126 a caution was given that it is preferable for a trial judge to avoid using the expression “accomplice” lest it inadvertently lead the jury to assume that the trial judge has reached a conclusion that the witness was in fact an accomplice of those standing trial, and that they are themselves guilty. However in R v Gutierrez [2004] NSWCCA 22 at para 103 the use of this expression was not held to have involved appellable error. In the present case, the position is perhaps even stronger, since his Honour was not attaching this tag to the witness as being his own description. Rather, he was pointing out that this is what the Crown had asserted and had charged. 
     
      
    293 Next there was, in my view, a sufficient indication to the jury of the significance of his undertaking to give evidence, in so far as it was pointed out that it was conditional upon him “telling the truth in these proceedings”, and that absent his offer to assist he would have received a significantly heavier sentence for the charge of perverting the course of justice. While it may have been desirable for the jury to have also been informed of the ability of the Crown to appeal against that sentence, had he failed to comply with his undertaking, I would not regard this as having been essential to a sufficient s 165 direction. Particularly is that so when it was also pointed out that his indemnity for the offences at Colies Cafe was similarly conditional upon him giving truthful evidence in these proceedings. 
     
      
    294 The need to give the common law accomplice direction has been removed by virtue of s 164 of the Evidence Act, and replaced by a requirement, in accordance with s 165, to give the jury a warning that the evidence may be unreliable, and to scrutinize it with great care: R v Spedding NSWCCA 11 December 1997, R v Paek [1999] NSWCCA 184 and  R v Stewart (2001) 52 NSWLR 301. 
     
      
    295 Section 165(5), however, leaves it open for a judge to give a Longman warning, or indeed any other warning that is appropriate to the case. This was recognised in R v Stewart at para 85 per Howie J; and also see  R v Chen (2002) 130 A Crim R at para 58 and R v Ngo [2003] NSWCCA 82 at para 168. 
     
      
    296 In the present case the trial judge identified the several matters which were relevant for Painter’s credibility, which went beyond his potential role as an accomplice and which may have provided an incentive for him to minimise his role and to implicate others. He also instructed the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “You should not look at Painter’s evidence in isolation. You should look at all the other evidence in the case, to see whether you find support for his evidence in other evidence, which you accept as being reliable and accurate”.  
        
       
      
    297 Warnings are not to be approached as mere matters of ritual. What needs to be said to a jury, in order to ensure that they bring a full appreciation to the case, not only of those matters that might be obvious to them as members of the community, but also those matters which are likely to be better known or understood by judges, will depend upon the individual case. 
     
      
    298 In this instance where there was a very strong and comprehensive warning given in relation to Painter, and there were aspects where his evidence had support, I am not persuaded that any more was required.  
     
      
    299 This ground is not made good.  
     
      
       
      GROUND 9 (JACOBS) - His Honour Erred in Law in Failing to Discharge the Jury on 13 May 2003 Following Questions by the Co-Accused’s Counsel as to the Connection of the Appellant with the Rebels Motorcycle Gang.  
       
      
    300 An application was made by counsel for Jacobs, for a discharge of the jury, once this line of questioning was developed by counsel for Mehajer. It was refused, and although directions were later given by his Honour to neutralise the cross-examination, it is now submitted that the evidence was so prejudicial that it could not have been cured by those directions.  
     
      
    301 After referring to the substance of the cross-examination, and after reminding the jury that the Crown had not sought to introduce this material, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “There is obvious tension, you may think, between the positions of the co-accused in this case. You may think that their evidence makes this clear, but I want to say something to you about the evidence given by Mr O’Connor to which I have just referred. There, is, I suppose, a danger that that evidence might set off in your minds a chain of reasoning that would be improper and which is prohibited; namely, a course of reasoning like this: The evidence of Mr O’Connor indicates that the accused Jacobs had an association with a motor cycle club which club has an undesirable reputation and is known to be involved in criminal activity. 
        
       
       
        
        Crimes are more often committed by bad people than good people. Jacob’s association with the Rebels would make it more likely that he was guilty of the crime charged than if he had no such association. Well, members of the jury, that in effect is reasoning by association only and you must not adopt such an approach in this case. Were you to do so this trial would miscarry. That would be altogether wrong as an approach.  
        
       
       
        
        Of course you have direct evidence from Mr Jacobs and it is a matter for you to evaluate it, that he is not and has never been a member of the Rebels motor cycle club.” 
        
       
      
    302 The cross-examination was somewhat imprudent, particularly as none of the witnesses, who had otherwise been accused by Counsel for Mehajer of having an association with the Rebels, had accepted that to have been the case. There was no prospect of any Rebels involvement being established, and at best the cross-examination was of the speculative kind that was designed to throw dust into the air. However, imprudent as it was, I am satisfied that it was effectively neutralised by the directions that were given, and that this ground has not been made good. Additionally it was the case that the evidence which was adduced was somewhat vague being cast in terms of this Appellant “having connections with the Rebels”, a concept falling short of him being a member, or a nominee or an associate of the Rebels. Moreover the matter seems not to have been taken up at any later stage of the trial.  
     
      
    303 I am not satisfied that his Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion in declining to discharge the jury. This ground is not made good.  
     
      
       
      GROUND 10 (BOTH APPELLANTS) – His Honour Erred in Law in Failing to Direct on Manslaughter 
       
      
    304 It was submitted that, in the absence of any intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, and in circumstances where the evidence was confusing in respect of the roles of those involved, manslaughter should have been left as an alternative to Count 1. This was necessary, so it was argued, in case the jury were not satisfied as to which of the persons had done the act causing death.  
     
      
    305 Although it was recognised that this would have given “an air of unreality to the case (of the Appellants), nevertheless it was submitted that the issue of manslaughter should have been left, consistently with the decisions in Gillard v The Queen (2003) 78 ALJR 64; Gilbert v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 414 and R v Stokes and Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25.  
     
      
    306 So far as this ground depends upon a submission that there was no case to answer of constructive murder because the Crown could not prove which offender struck the fatal blow, this has already been addressed.  
     
      
    307 The principal submission relates to the question whether, even though defence counsel had not made a request that manslaughter be left, nevertheless it was mandatory for his Honour to have done so, of his own motion.  
     
      
    308 Smart AJ gave consideration to this question recently in R v King [2004] NSWCCA 20 at [110], where he suggested that the following principles emerge on the authorities (particularly Gilbert v The Queen and Gillard v The Queen: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) Where on a trial for murder, there is a viable case of manslaughter to be left to the jury, the refusal to do so constitutes a wrong decision on a question of law:

        (b) This raises the question of the proviso. It is not an answer to such refusal or failure that the jury were correctly instructed on the elements of murder and that since they convicted the accused (appellant) of murder there is on that account alone, no miscarriage of justice. The jury were deprived of the opportunity to consider an intermediate position. 
         
         
        (c) The principle stated in  
        Gillard 
         is not limited to instances of murder and manslaughter, but applies where a serious offence is charged and there is a lesser alternative offence, the conviction for which would be a viable outcome on the evidence, that is, the evidence is such that a conviction for the lesser alternative offence would represent a rational result.

      RICKARD HAILS MORETTI PTY LIMITED & ORS 
       
      
    JUDGMENT 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff (“Rickard Constructions”) constructed a pavement for a container depot (“the container depot” or “Lot 1”) at Port Botany. The pavement was designed by the first defendant (“Rickard Partners”). The second defendant (“Jeffery & Katauskas”) provided geotechnical services. The third defendant (“Allianz”) issued a contract works insurance policy (“the policy”) for the project in favour of Rickard Constructions. The pavement failed shortly after it was put into service. Rickard Constructions rebuilt it. The question is, who should bear the loss? 
     
      
    Background 
     
      
    2 The container depot is located at Lot 1, 55 Friendship Road, Port Botany. Lot 1 was leased initially to Port Botany Container Park Pty Ltd (“Container Park”). Rickard Constructions and Container Park entered into a building contract, for the construction of the pavement, on 23 April 1998. Rickard Constructions’ obligation was to execute the works – namely, the construction of the pavement – in a workmanlike manner in accordance with the design shown in the drawings and specifications prepared by Rickard Partners. 
     
      
    3 Thereafter, Container Park sold its business to Mayne Nickless Ltd (“Mayne Nickless”) and MPG Logistics Pty Limited (“MPG Logistics”), a subsidiary of Mayne Nickless. (Unless for some reason it is necessary to distinguish between Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics, I shall refer to them both for simplicity as Mayne.) As part of that transaction, Container Park assigned its interest in lot 1 and its interest in the building contract to Mayne Nickless. 
     
      
    4 Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas provided services in connection with the construction of the pavement both before and after 18 December 1998. Rickard Constructions continued, after that date, to perform its obligations under the building contract. After considerable delay (in part due to heavy rainfall in the first half of the calendar year 1999), it handed the works over to Mayne on 26 August 1999.  
     
      
    5 The container depot was to be used for the storage of shipping containers. That business involved the use of heavy forklift trucks, to shift and place the containers. The design of the pavement sought to take into account the loads that this usage would impose. However, the pavement failed within three days of being put into service, when substantial portions of it collapsed. 
     
      
    6 Not surprisingly, the failure of the pavement led to some difference of opinion between Rickard Constructions and Mayne. The former maintained that it had complied with its obligations under the building contract. (I reiterate that those obligations were to construct the pavement in accordance with the design prepared by Rickard Partners; it was not a design and construct contract.) Mayne seemed inclined to disregard the separate legal personalities of the builder and the designer, and to focus on the fact that both were effectively directed by Mr Charles Rickard, the principal of both companies at that time. In any event, on 3 May 2000, Rickard Constructions, Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics entered into an agreement (“the 3 May agreement”) for Rickard Constructions to carry through to completion the rectification of the failed pavement. 
     
      
    7 Under the 3 May agreement, Rickard Constructions agreed to complete the rectification works. Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics agreed that the rectification works would constitute a variation under the building contract. However, Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics were not to pay Rickard Constructions in cash for that variation. Instead, they agreed to assign to Rickard Constructions any right that they might have against the designer of the pavement or the supervisors of the pavement construction “to recover … the amount payable [by them to Rickard Constructions] in connection with” the variation. Rickard Constructions agreed to accept that assignment in full satisfaction of its claim for payment.  
     
      
    8 There have been two subsequent assignments, purporting or attempting to perfect Rickard Constructions’ rights under the assignment in the 3 May agreement. 
     
      
    9 There was a substantial body of expert evidence directed to identifying the cause or causes of the failure of the pavement. It will be necessary, in due course, to turn to some of the detail of that evidence. However, it is sufficient for present purposes to note that I have concluded (in line with the majority of the experts) that the primary cause of failure of the pavement was the presence of excessive moisture in the base course material which, with the loading of the pavement through the operation of the forklift trucks, led to a build up of excessive pore pressure. That in turn diminished the stiffness of the base course and hence of the pavement, and caused it to fail under load. 
     
      
    The issues 
     
      
    10 In summary, Rickard Constructions’ case is that: 
     
      
       
      (1) It constructed the pavement in a good and workmanlike manner and in accordance with the design and specification prepared by Rickard Partners. 
       
       
      (2) It was, therefore, entitled to be paid for the cost of executing the rectification works.  
       
       
      (3) Rickard Partners owed, and breached, a duty of care to Mayne in connection with the design of the pavement and in connection with the supervision of the construction of the pavement. 
       
       
      (4) Jeffery & Katauskas owed, and breached, a duty of care to Mayne in connection with the geotechnical advice that it provided, and the geotechnical services that it rendered, relating to the construction of the pavement. 
       
       
      (5) Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas were, therefore, liable to Mayne for the cost of the variation. 
       
       
      (6) Rickard Constructions was entitled, under the assignment, to recover the amounts payable by them to Mayne in respect of that liability. 
       
       
      (7) Alternatively, the collapse of the pavement was “sudden and unforeseen physical loss of or damage to Insured Property from any cause … “ within the insuring clause of the policy so that Rickard Constructions was entitled to be indemnified by Allianz in respect of the cost of rectification. 
       
      
    11 Against that summary, I set out the issues agreed by the parties (the issues reflect the fact that there were a number of cross-claims between the defendants):

    The role of Rickard Partners 
     
      
    12 Rickard Partners carries on business as civil engineers. It was known at the time as Rickard & Partners Pty Limited. Since then, it has changed its name, first to Bonacci Rickard (NSW) Pty Limited, and thereafter to its present name, Rickard Hails Moretti Pty Limited. Rickard Partners had expertise in 1998 in the design of heavy duty pavements. In particular, it had designed the pavement on a container depot situated across the road from lot 1, at 60 Friendship Road, Port Botany (“60 Friendship Road”). That pavement was constructed some years before the construction of the subject pavement, and it appears to have performed satisfactorily. 
     
      
    13 Rickard Partners undertook the design of the pavement for lot 1. In outline, that design comprised (from the lowest level up): 
     
      
       
      (1) A sub-grade layer, namely compacted sand that was present on the site (but which, it appears, may have been imported to the site in the course of earlier reclamation works carried out by others). 
       
       
      (2) A sub-base layer, comprising compacted crushed sandstone.  
       
       
      (3) A base course layer, comprising compacted DGB20 (essentially, a gravel material meeting a particular specification of the Roads & Traffic Authority; the initials “DGB” refer to densely graded base course and the figure “20” refers to the average size, in mm, of the gravel particles).  
       
       
      (4) An asphalt layer, which provided both sealing to the underlying layers and a wearing surface. 
       
      
    14 The design of the pavement was undertaken by Mr Brett Hails. It will be necessary to turn later to the detail of the design and to the criticisms made of it. 
     
      
    15 Rickard Constructions also suggested that Rickard Partners provided some services relating to the supervision of the construction of the pavement. However, such evidence as there is (and it is very limited indeed) suggests that the extent of the “supervision” performed by Rickard Partners may have been limited to: 
     
      
       
      (1) Upon request by a representative of Rickard Constructions, arranging for Jeffery & Katauskas to inspect and test a section of a pavement layer that was said to have been completed and fully compacted. 
       
       
      (2) Examining the test results produced by Jeffery & Katauskas. 
       
       
      (3) Informing Rickard Constructions whether the tested section of pavement layer was adequate, or whether there was a need for further work to be done. 
       
      
    16 Finally, when (as it was thought) the pavement works were complete, Rickard Partners certified completion to Rickard Constructions. Rickard Constructions in turn certified practical completion to Container Park. In consequence, the relevant certifying authority under the Environmental Planning & Assessment Act 1979 (NSW), Randwick City Council, issued an occupation certificate on 27 August 1999. 
     
      
    The role of Jeffery & Katauskas 
     
      
    17 Jeffery & Katauskas carries on business as geotechnical engineers. It was retained as a geotechnical testing sub-consultant to Rickard Partners. That retainer was what is known as a “level 2” retainer: a reference to Australian Standard AS 3798-1990. The reference is to the level of certification required: 
     
      
       
        
        “The geotechnical testing authority carries out sampling and testing as required or specified. The geotechnical testing authority is responsible for selecting the timing and location of sampling and testing operations within each visit he/she makes to the site, but will rely upon the superintendent to advise when such visits are required and to ensure that sufficient samples and tests are taken over the project.  
        
       
       
        
        On completion of the earthworks, the geotechnical testing authority may be required to provide a report setting out the sampling and testing which it has carried out, and the locations and results thereof. It will not be in a position to express any opinion beyond this as to the compliance of the works with the specification or their suitability for any particular purpose.” 
        
       
      
    18 Jeffery & Katauskas had provided geotechnical testing services in connection with the 60 Friendship Road project. Those services were level 1 services. That is a higher level of certification than level 2: 
     
      
       
        
        “The geotechnical testing authority provides a full-time inspection and testing service on all earthworks (including stripping, test rolling and associated operations) on the project, and decides the locations and timing of sampling and testing operations. 
        
       
       
        
        On completion of the earthworks the geotechnical testing authority may be required to provide a report setting out the inspections, sampling and testing it has carried out, and the locations and results thereof. Unless very unusual conditions apply, the authority may also be required to express an opinion that the works, so far as it has been able to determine, comply with the requirements of the specification and drawings.” 
        
       
      
    19 It may be noted that, when Jeffery & Katauskas were asked to provide a proposal for geotechnical services on lot 1, it suggested that the services should be level 1 services. It said: 
     
      
       
        
        “We consider Level 1 Certification is essential since it is the fill and pavement materials’ quality and density which is so relevant to the ultimate paving performance.” 
        
       
      
    20 Nonetheless, apparently for reasons of cost (and, no doubt, because of the experience gained on 60 Friendship Road), the retainer was to provide level 2 services.  
     
      
    21 In addition, at a time when the project had been experiencing very heavy rainfall, Jeffery & Katauskas was asked to provide what was called “Wet Weather Procedures”. That was done initially at a meeting on 29 April 1999, with the results being confirmed in a letter from Jeffery & Katauskas to Rickard Constructions dated 3 May 1999.  
     
      
    22 Jeffery & Katauskas did not have any part in the formulation of the design of the pavement, nor was it asked to review or check the design. It did, however, suggest to Rickard Partners that Mr Hails should obtain an independent review of the design. 
     
      
    The assignments 
     
      
    23 The first assignment (from Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics to Rickard Constructions) relied upon is that found in the 3 May agreement. In considering the terms of that assignment, it is necessary to bear in mind that Rickard Constructions had carried out work for Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics in respect of other parts of the 55 Friendship Road site (known as lot 2 and lot 3) and had outstanding claims for that work. By clause 2 of the 3 May agreement, those claims were settled for $650,000 (payable to Rickard Constructions), with a release given by Rickard Constructions to Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics for all claims other than what were called “the Variation Claims”, and a small and presently irrelevant claim for an outstanding invoice. 
     
      
    24 The expression “Variation Claim” was defined to mean: 
     
      
       
        
        “Any claim (including extension of time claims) by Constructions, MNL or MPG for payment for works done and loss suffered in consequence of the failure of the lot 1 pavement including, without limitation, the Rectification Works done or agreed to be done pursuant to this Agreement on lot 1.” 
        
       
      
    25 The “Rectification Works” were defined by reference to an annexure that is not in evidence, but they may be taken to be works agreed to be necessary for the rectification of the failed pavement. I assume that they were, at least in substance, the works described in a specification prepared by Rickard Partners in November 1999. 
     
      
    26 Clause 3 of the 3 May agreement dealt with the “Variation Claims”. It read, relevantly, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “3 Variation Claims 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          3.1 Claims made 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            Construction claims that under the Construction Contract the Variation Claims are recoverable from MNL and MPG as a variation or latent condition or otherwise. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          3.2 Settlement of Variation Claims 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            MNL and MPG accept the Variation Claims by Constructions on the basis that Constructions accepts in full payment of the Variation Claims the amount (if any) recovered pursuant to any Assigned Action. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          3.3 Assignment of MNL Rights 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) In consideration for Constructions entering this Agreement and accepting the payments and rights under this Agreement in full and final settlement of any claim for the Variation Claims, MNL and MPG assign the Assigned Actions to Constructions. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) To the extent to which any of the Assigned Actions are not assignable, MNL and MPG hold them on trust for the benefit of Constructions. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … “ 
          
         
        
       
      
    27 The “Assigned Actions” were defined as: 
     
      
       
        
        “Any right, claim, action or cause of action which may be brought by MNL or MPG to recover from the designers of the pavement on Lot 1 or the supervisors of the pavement construction on Lot 1 (including Jeffery & Katauskas and Rickard & Partners Pty Limited) the amount payable by MNL or MPG to Constructions in connection with a Variation Claim (other than any right, claim, action or cause of action against Constructions, its contractors, agents or employees)”. 
        
       
      
    28 Clause 3.4 dealt with “Carriage of Assigned Actions”. It made provision for the events that Rickard Constructions did not pursue an assigned action, or did not do so in a timely manner; and for the event that Rickard Constructions did pursue any assigned action. In this latter event, sub para (5) provided that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The amount (if any) recovered pursuant to the Assigned Action after payment of all costs incurred by Constructions in connection with the Assigned Action (including the payment of any costs paid by Constructions to MNL or MPG) may be contained by Constructions (up to the amount of the relevant Variation Claim) and any excess divided equally between MNL or MPG and Constructions”. 
        
       
      
    29 On 22 September 2003, Rickard Constructions, Mayne Nickless, MPG Logistics and others entered into an “Assignment Deed” (“the second assignment”). The purpose of that deed was expressed, by recital E, to be “to confirm the assignment of the Assigned Causes of Action and, to the extent (if any) that the Assigned Causes of Action have not been assigned to Constructions, to effect that assignment.” 
     
      
    30 By the time the second assignment was made: 
     
      
       
      (1) These proceedings had been commenced. 
       
       
      (2) Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas had raised, as issues, the limited character of the assignment under the 3 May agreement. 
       
       
      (3) Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics had sold their interest in the business conducted on and from lot 1, and Mayne Nickless had assigned its leasehold interest in lot 1, to an unrelated third party.  
       
      
    31 At that time, Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics had been joined, as defendants, to these proceedings. The relief claimed against them was, in substance, declarations as to either the efficacy of the first assignment or as to their obligations if it were held to be inefficacious. 
     
      
    32 By cl 2(a) of the second assignment, and with a presently irrelevant exception, Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics assigned to Rickard Constructions “the whole of the Assigned Causes of Action to the extent that all or any part of the Assigned Causes of Action have not already been assigned to Constructions.” 
     
      
    33 The assigned causes of action were defined to mean: 
     
      
       
        
        “Any right, claim, action or cause of action which MNL or MPG has or might have to recover from the designers of the pavement on Lot 1 or the supervisors of the pavement construction on Lot 1 (including Jeffery & Katauskas and Rickard & Partners Pty Ltd) which is connected with the pavement on Lot 1 (other than any right, claim, action or cause of action against Constructions, its contractors, agents or employees).” 
        
       
      
    34 In short, the second assignment purported, somewhat at odds with Recital E, to remove the restriction, in the definition of what was assigned, to a claim in connection with a “Variation Claim”.  
     
      
    35 By cl 4 of the second assignment, Constructions was obliged to discontinue these proceedings as against Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics, and undertook not to “commence other proceedings or seek to join MNL or MPG to proceedings which have the same or similar relief to that sought against MNL and MPG in” these proceedings.  
     
      
    36 Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas suggested that the second assignment was ineffective because, at its date, Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics had no assignable interest in any cause of action relating to the container depot. (That followed, they said, from the sale of that business.) Accordingly, on 15 October 2004 (ie, during the hearing of these proceedings), Rickard Constructions, Mayne Nickless, MPG Logistics and the purchasers (known collectively as “the Patrick Parties” and others) entered into a “Deed of Clarification and Assignment” (“the third assignment”). By cl 2 of the third assignment, Mayne Nickless, MPG Logistics and the Patrick Parties acknowledged and agreed that they did not intend that the sale of business agreement would have the effect of transferring to the Patrick Parties any part of the Assigned Causes of Action (an expression defined to have the same meaning as it had in the second assignment: see para [33] above).  
     
      
    37 Clause 3 was a further assignment: 
     
      
       
        
        “To the extent that any part of the Assigned Causes of Action has not already been assigned to Constructions pursuant to the First Assignment Deed or the Second Assignment Deed, the Patrick Parties assign that part of the Assigned Causes of Action to Constructions.” 
        
       
      
    38 Finally in this context, near the end of the hearing, Rickard Constructions sought to join Mayne Nickless as a plaintiff (it was said, with its consent; but there was no direct evidence of this), and further to amend its summons so as to include a claim for relief by Mayne Nickless in respect of any unassigned cause of action against Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas. That application was opposed. 
     
      
    The assigned claims 
     
      
    39 Rickard Constructions submitted that there were assigned to it, and it was entitled to enforce, causes of action against Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas for: 
     
      
       
      (1) Damages for breach of contract; 
       
       
      (2) Damages for breach of duty of care; and 
       
       
      (3) Damages for misleading or deceptive conduct. 
       
      
    40 Rickard Constructions claimed its interest as assignee pursuant to one or other of the assignments that I have described. 
     
      
    41 Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas submitted that the assigned claims must fail. They submitted that: 
     
      
       
      (1) Their causes of action were not assignable at law or in equity; 
       
       
      (2) Alternatively, Rickard Constructions had no interest sufficient to justify the assignments to it; and 
       
       
      (3) In any event, for the purposes of ss 52 and 82 of the  
      Trade Practices Act  
      1974 (Cth), Rickard Constructions, as assignee, could not be said to have suffered damage “by” the alleged contraventions of s 52. 
       
      
    Assignment of causes of action: the principles 
     
      
    42 The following propositions appear to be uncontroversial: 
     
      
       
      (1) A debt arising under a contract is regarded as property, and is assignable; and this is so even if the debt is overdue for payment:  
      Comfort v Betts  
      [1891] 1 QB 737;  
      Fitzroy v Cave  
      [1905] 2 KB 364;  
      County Hotel and Wine Company Limited v London and North Western Railway Company  
      [1918] 2 KB 251;  
      Re Daley; Ex parte National Australia Bank Ltd  
      (1992) 37 FCR 390. 
       
       
      (2) The benefit of a contract, whether a claim to which that benefit gives rise is liquidated or unliquidated, may be assigned before breach:  
      Torkington v Magee  
      [1902] 2 KB 427.  
       
       
      (3) A cause of action (at least, in contract:  
      Defries v Milne  
      [1913] 1 Ch 98) that is annexed to a right of property may be assigned along with that property:  
      Ellis v Torrington  
      [1920] 1 KB 399;  
      Re Kenneth Wright Distributors Pty Ltd (in liq); W J Vine Pty Ltd v Hall  
      [1973] VR 161;  
      Camdex International Ltd v Bank of Zambia  
      [1998] QB 22. 
       
      
    43 In Poulton v The Commonwealth (1952-1953) 89 CLR 540, it was said that causes of action in tort are not assignable at law or in equity: see Fullagar J (at first instance) at 571, and Williams, Webb and Kitto JJ (on appeal) at 602. Since their Honours all considered that there had been no assignment (or purported assignment), what they said was obiter. I recognise that, as it is put in Meagher, Gummow & Lehane’s Equity Doctrines and Remedies, (4th ed by Meagher, Heydon and Leeming, Butterworths LexisNexis, 2002) at 281 [6-480]), “It is not easy for courts below the High Court legitimately to depart from the considered dicta of three [sic] High Court justices”.  
     
      
    44 In Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679, the House of Lords concluded that a cause of action in contract could be assigned where the assignee has a genuine and substantial, or genuine commercial, interest in the enforcement of that cause of action. The principle established in Trendtex was applied, in the related area of champerty in connection with a cause of action in tort, in Giles v Thompson [1994] 1 AC 142. 
     
      
    45 The application of the Trendtex principle in Australia has been considered in a number of first instance decisions but not, so far as my own researches or those of counsel show, by any intermediate appellate court. A number of those decisions suggest that it should be followed (and that the obiter remarks of the High Court in Poulton should be distinguished or regarded as no longer applicable); and a number suggest the contrary. 
     
      
    46 Decisions that support the adoption of the Trendtex principle in Australia include: 
     
      
       
      Re Timothy’s Pty Ltd and the Companies Act 
       [1981] 2 NSWLR 706 (Needham J); 
       
       
      Monk v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd  
      (1994) 34 NSWLR 148 (Cohen J); 
       
       
      South Australian Management Corporation v Sheahan  
      (1995) 16 ACSR 45 (Debelle J); 
       
       
      Beatty v Brashs Pty Ltd  
      [1998] 2 VR 201 (Smith J);  
       
       
      Singleton v Freehill Hollingdale & Page  
      [2000] SASC 278 (Olsson J); 
       
       
      Vangal Pty Ltd (in liq) v Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd  
      [2002] QSC 137 (Mullins J). 
       
      
    47 Support for the application of Trendtex is also found in New Zealand in the decision of Gault J in First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1989] 3 NZLR 710.  
     
      
    48 Decisions declining to apply the Trendtex principle in Australia include: 
     
      
       
      Park v Allied Mortgage Corporation Ltd  
      (1993) ATPR (Digest) ¶ 46-105 (Davies J); 
       
       
      Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd  
      (Federal Court of Australia, 7 November, 1994, unreported: BC9400129) (Beaumont J); 
       
       
      National Mutual Property Services (Australia) Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Ltd  
      (1995) 132 ALR 514 (Lindgren J);

      Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Cridlands Pty Ltd 
       (2003) 204 ALR 281 (Selway J). 
       
      
    49 Neither list may be comprehensive. 
     
      
    50 The reasoning in the first category of cases may be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
      (1) The relevant remarks by the High Court in  
      Poulton  
      were obiter. In any event, they do not bear on the question of assignment of a bare cause of action (ie, one not annexed to or associated with a proprietary right) for breach of contract.  
       
       
      (2) There is no public policy ground for distinguishing between assignment of a cause of action for unliquidated damages for breach of contract on the one hand and, on the other, a cause of action for damages in tort (at least where the tort is not of a personal nature). 
       
       
      (3) The obiter remarks in  
      Poulton  
      may be distinguished because the assignee lacked the requisite interest to support the assignment; alternatively, because the High Court said nothing about assignment to persons possessing the requisite interest, what was said may be distinguished on that basis. 
       
       
      (4) What was said in  
      Poulton  
      reflects the effect of considerably older English authority, and (self evidently) does not take into account the review of that earlier line of authority by the House of Lords in  
      Trendtex. 
       
       
      (5) Further,  
      Poulton  
      was decided before modern developments in the law of negligence; the tort of negligence is frequently involved in commercial disputes and cannot be regarded as peculiar to personal claims. 
       
      
    51 It will be noted that the cases against the introduction of the Trendtex principle in Australia are all decisions of the Federal Court of Australia. Those decisions are to some extent complicated because, to the extent that they involve a claim under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) for damages for contravention of s 52, it has been held consistently that an assignee of the cause of action is not, for the purposes of s 82, a person who suffers damage “by” the contravention: see Davies J in Park at 53, 469. However, that aside, the consistent approach is that it is not open to courts of first instance to depart from a considered statement of the High Court, and that bare rights of action in tort should be regarded as incapable of assignment (whether or not the tort is of a personal kind). 
     
      
    52 What was said in Poulton was confined, in terms, to the assignment of bare rights of action in tort. In principle, therefore, it should not be taken to extend to the assignment of bare rights of action in contract; although, as Cohen J put it in Monk at 152, “there seems no logic in making a distinction between a cause of action in tort and one in contract if the basis of the claim is a commercial one”. (This view was shared by Gault J in First City Corporation (at 757), Debelle J in South Australian Management Corporation (at 57) and Smith J in Beatty (at 209).) 
     
      
    53 If it were necessary for me to reach a concluded view, it would be that I am at liberty to depart, and should depart, from the dicta of the High Court in Poulton. I have come to this view for a number of reasons: 
     
      
       
      (1) Their Honours were doing no more than identifying the law as it then stood. It was unnecessary for them to decide whether the principle that they identified should be applied to the facts of the case before them (because, as they said, there was in fact no assignment). 
       
       
      (2) In terms, what their Honours said applies only to an assignment of a cause of action in tort. 
       
       
      (3) Their Honours did not consider (because they did not need to consider) whether there were any exceptions to the rule.  
      Trendtex  
      does not deny the rule; it establishes that there is an exception, at least in relation to causes of action in contract, where the assignee has the requisite interest to support the assignment. 
       
       
      (4) The rule is at base a reflection of the policy of the common law against maintenance. The content of that policy, and its application, change from time to time. It is a likely that a re-examination of the rule, in the light of changing social, commercial and economic conditions, will indicate exceptions that had not existed, or had not been perceived, in earlier times. 
       
       
      (5) I therefore regard it as open to me to have regard to the analysis of the policy considerations in  
      Trendtex  
      and  
      Giles  
      (and in cases in England that follow them), and to the recognition of those changed, or revealed, policy considerations in decisions in this country. 
       
      
    54 In relation to contractual causes of action, I find the distinction between liquidated and unliquidated claims difficult to follow. I have already noted that a debt is assignable even if it is overdue. As is pointed out in Meagher, Gummow & Lehane at 281 [6-480], where the debt is overdue, “there has been a breach of the contract to pay and … in fact, all that is assigned is the right to sue to recover the debt. The case of an overdue debt merely points up the problem inherent in the distinctions drawn in this breach [sic] of the law: for what is a debt but a right to sue to recover a sum certain? In what other sense is a debt to be regarded as property?” I do not think that a rule based on public policy which encourages illogical distinctions of this sort should be applied unless there is no alternative. I do not regard the obiter statements in Poulton, limited as they are to assignment of bare causes of action in tort, as providing a compelling reason to accept such illogical distinctions and their consequences. 
     
      
    55 If then, in principle, an assignment of a cause of action in contract (to recover unliquidated damages) should be accepted where the assignee has a sufficient interest to support the assignment, what justification is there for denying the same view where the cause of action is one in tort? As Debelle J said in South Australian Mangement Corporation at 57-58, the distinction between causes of action for unliquidated damages for breach of contract and for damages in tort “has little weight in an action where … the causes of action in both contract and in tort both [sic] stem from the same facts, where the test of causation will be the same, and where, in large part, the measure of damages for the pecuniary loss which directly flows from the breach will be the same … For the purpose of determining whether an assignment is valid, it is possible to draw a valid distinction between torts of a personal nature and torts which affect the plaintiff’s commercial interests or his interests in property.“ 
     
      
    56 My conclusion makes it necessary to consider the nature of the interest required to support an assignment of a cause of action. As Lloyd LJ (with the concurrence of Sir John Donaldson MR) said in Brownton v Edward Moore Inbucon Ltd [1985] 3 All ER 499 at 509, “[t]here is no difference between the interest required to justify maintenance of an action and the interest required to justify the taking of a share in the proceeds, or the interest required to support an out-and-out assignment.” 
     
      
    57 In Giles (a case of alleged champerty), Lord Mustill said at 163 that it is necessary to consider “whether the transaction … is validated by the existence of a legitimate interest in the person supporting the action distinct from the benefit which he seeks to derive from it”. That is consistent with the approach in Trendtex, where their Lordships suggested that the interest acquired was one arising other than by the terms of the assignment.  
     
      
    58 In Re Timothy’s, Needham J concluded at 712 that “the principle of the Trendtex case can be applied to an assignment of a right of action by a debtor to a creditor where the evidence shows that, without that assignment, the creditor is not likely to be paid his debt. In such a case the rule of public policy would be inapplicable because the assignment would not be champertous.” His Honour concluded that the debtor did not have the capacity to pay, so that, without the assignment, the creditor would remain unpaid. Thus, his Honour concluded that the creditor “had a sufficient commercial interest in the proceedings to entitle it to accept an assignment of them.” It cannot be suggested that Mayne Nickless is or was unable to pay any debt properly owing to Rickard Constructions for the rectification works. Thus, in the sense identified by Needham J, it cannot be said that, without the assignment, Rickard Constructions was not likely to be paid its debt. 
     
      
    59 Cohen J analysed the concept of “genuine commercial interest” in Monk. In that case, the plaintiff sought to take an assignment of a cause of action against the defendant so that he would have something to set off against a judgment debt recovered by the defendant against him. Cohen J said that this was not the requisite genuine commercial interest. He said that what was required was something beyond a mere personal interest in profiting from the outcome of the proceedings; an interest by the assignee in the assignor or its business affairs or activities which might be protected by the assignment:  
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion [the interest claimed by the plaintiff] is not a genuine commercial interest in the way that the phrase has been used in the judgments. Examples may be given from the facts in the various cases concerned. For instance it was held that there was such an interest where the assignee was already a substantial creditor of the assignor with a right to enforce the debt ( 
        Trendtex, Re Timothy’s) 
         or where the assignee was the sole shareholder who was a guarantor of the overdraft of the assignor ( 
        Re Daley)  
        or where the assignee was a debenture holder with an interest in protecting the value of its security ( 
        First City Corporation). 
        
       
       
        
        The plaintiff’s only apparent interest is in the possibility of his becoming a creditor of the bank. That is, his interest is in using the debt which might arise from the cause of action for his personal benefit. That no doubt is the interest of any assignee. The using of the debt as a set-off against the judgment debt is merely an example of obtaining some personal benefit. … In the authorities where the  
        Trendtex  
        test has been applied, the commercial interest has gone beyond a mere personal interest in profiting from the outcome in the proceedings and has required an interest by the assignee in the assignor or its business affairs or activities which the assignment may in some way protect. … “ 
        
       
      
    60 In Beatty, Smith J at 215 emphasised that the interest relied upon must exist prior to the assignment. He concluded that such an interest existed where, prior to the assignment, the creditors were owed money by Brashs and they were only likely to be paid if the debtor succeeded in recovering damages. That interest, his Honour held, was sufficient; and clearly it predated the assignment. 
     
      
    61 In National Mutual Property Services, Lindgren J held that, even if the Trendtex test applied, there was no requisite interest. He said at 540 that the interest must exist independently of the assignment: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … the genuine commercial interest referred to in  
        Trendtex  
        is not a nebulous notion of the general commercial advantage of the assignee but something more specific and limited. In particular, it does not embrace an interest arising from an arrangement voluntarily entered into by the assignee of which the impugned assignment is an essential part, like the arrangement in the present case. Rather, the expression refers to a commercial interest which exists already or by reason of other matters, and which receives ancillary support from the assignment.” 
        
       
      
    Rickard Constructions has no sufficient interest 
     
      
    62 It is clear that the “Timothy’s” or “Beatty” interest does not exist. As I have noted, it cannot be suggested that Mayne Nickless would be unable to pay (assuming, of course, that it was liable to pay) unless it recovered damages (and the payment of those damages) in an action against Rickard Partners or Jeffery & Katauskas. In this context, it is necessary to bear in mind the position as between Rickard Constructions on the one hand and Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics on the other. If Rickard Constructions had performed the work required by the contract in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with the drawings and specification, then it had fulfilled its contract. Rickard Constructions had no part in the design of the pavement and was not liable for any deficiencies in the design. On the assumption that the original work was properly done, Rickard Constructions was entitled to be paid for the rectification works done at the request of Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics. If, on the other hand, Rickard Constructions had not fulfilled its obligations under the building contract, and if the failure of the pavement were a result of that, then Rickard Constructions would have been obliged to rectify the defective works at its own cost. 
     
      
    63 The position taken by Rickard Constructions is, and so far as I know has always been, that it fulfilled all its obligations under the building contract. Thus, its position is that it was entitled to be paid for the works as a variation. It appears from the recitals to the 3 May agreement that Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics may have taken a different view. However, by cl 3.2, they agreed to accept Rickard Constructions’ “Variation Claims” – including its claim for the cost of the Rectifications Works: although they did so on the basis that Rickard Constructions would take in full payment any amount that it recovered pursuant to any Assigned Action. 
     
      
    64 In substance, it was the 3 May agreement by which Rickard Constructions undertook to carry out the Rectification Works (see cl 4) and by which the assignment was effected. In my judgment, it follows necessarily that the genuine commercial interest claimed by Rickard Constructions in the subject matter of the assignment is an interest arising under and by virtue of the instrument of assignment.  
     
      
    65 It does not appear that, prior to 3 May 2000, Rickard Constructions had performed any substantial work of rectification, that it had made any demand for payment, or that payment had been refused. There is no basis, in the evidence or as a matter of reasoning from what is known, for thinking that, prior to 3 May 2000, Rickard Constructions had any interest in any action that Mayne might have against Rickard Constructions or Jeffery & Katauskas. 
     
      
    66 There may have been commercial advantages to Rickard Constructions in reaching the agreement that it did; in particular, it may have assisted in the resolution of the other claims that was effected by cl 2 of the 3 May agreement. However, those other claims did not relate to lot 1 or to the failed pavement; and it could not be said that the existence of those claims, relating as they did to other properties and other works under other contracts, gave Rickard Constructions any interest in any action relating to work done on lot 1 under the building contract. 
     
      
    67 I therefore conclude, applying the Trendtex test, that Rickard Constructions had no interest sufficient to justify the assignment effected by cl 3 of the 3 May agreement.  
     
      
    68 If I am wrong in thinking that Trendtex applies, then the same result would be reached, at least in respect of the assigned claims in tort, by application of the dicta in Poulton. 
     
      
    69 Finally, to the extent that the claims purportedly assigned included claims under the Trade Practices Act for misleading or deceptive conduct, then the assignment fails, alternatively, for the reasons given by Davies J in Park: namely, that Rickard Constructions, as an assignee, is not a person who has suffered damage “by” such misleading or deceptive conduct as is proved so as to give it a claim for damages under s 82. 
     
      
    70 The second and third assignments were intended, in substance, to perfect or complete the assignment effected by the 3 May agreement. They are not supported by any separate interest, and in my judgment they must fail for the same reason. 
     
      
    71 Further, the second assignment fails because, at the time it was purportedly effected, the assignors (Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics) had no interest in the purported subject matter of the assignment. Whatever interest they had, had passed to the Patrick Parties under the business sale agreement made on 23 November 2000.  
     
      
    Conclusion on the assigned causes of action 
     
      
    72 I therefore conclude that the assigned causes of action fail, because the assignments relied upon are ineffective for the reasons that I have given. This makes it necessary to consider the application to join Mayne Nickless as a plaintiff, and to amend consequentially.  
     
      
    The joinder application 
     
      
    73 Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics were joined as defendants by the filing of a further amended summons on 13 July 2001. The relief claimed against them (either alone or in conjunction with other defendants) included declarations as to the efficacy of the assignment effected by the 3 May agreement and, in the alternative, a declaration that to the extent that the assignment was ineffective, they held the relevant rights and causes of action on trust for Rickard Constructions. Alternatively, Rickard Constructions sought an order that Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics take proceedings against Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas to enforce the rights and causes of action that (it said) they held on trust for it. The proceedings were discontinued as against Mayne Nickless and MPG Logistics at some time after the making of the second assignment, whereupon they ceased to be parties.    
     
      
    74 At the end of the hearing before me, Rickard Constructions sought leave further to amend the summons so as to include a direct claim by Mayne Nickless against Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas to enforce, in the event that the assignments were ineffective, the causes of action that were purportedly assigned. 
     
      
    75 Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas submitted that Mayne Nickless should not be joined as a plaintiff and that leave to amend should not be given. 
     
      
    76 Rickard Partners submitted that Mayne Nickless was not a party that “ought to have been joined” within SCR Pt 8 r 8(1)(a), and was not someone “whose joinder as a party is necessary to ensure that all matters in dispute in the proceedings may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon” within SCR Pt 8 r 8(1)(b). It submitted that the purpose of Pt 8 r 8 was not to permit the substitution of a new plaintiff with a new cause of action for an existing plaintiff whose action is not maintainable: relying upon the decision of McClelland J in Knight v McCann Erickson Pty Ltd (26 August 1991, unreported; BC-9101623).  
     
      
    77 In Knight, McClelland J said (at BC 4): 
     
      
       
        
        “Pt 8 R 8(1)(a) applies where the party to be added ought to have been made a party in the first instance … 
        
       
       
        
        Pt 8 R 8(1)(b) cannot properly be construed to authorise the reconstitution of proceedings by the substitution of a new plaintiff with a new cause of action for an old plaintiff whose cause of action is no longer maintainable. 
        
       
       
        
        The addition of parties contemplated by Pt 8 R 8 is an addition which is ancillary to, not in substitution for, the proceedings as theretofore constituted.” 
        
       
      
    78 I do not think that the joinder of Mayne Nickless is justified under para (a). Rickard Constructions’ case is that it, as assignee, is entitled to enforce the cause of action in question. A decision on that claim (including the decision indicated in the preceding section of these reasons) will not impact in any way on such rights as Mayne Nickless may have, or retain. Compare Pralle v Scharka [1978] 2 NSWLR 450, where a person ought to have been joined because his rights in land might be affected by the outcome of the litigation; and Cambridge Credit Corporation Ltd v Parkes Developments Ltd [1974] 2 NSWLR 590, where a land owner ought to have been joined because its interests might be affected by proceedings concerning the validity of a planning approval. 
     
      
    79 Nor do I think that Mayne Nickless is a “necessary” party under para (b). The question of Rickard Constructions’ entitlement under the deed of assignment can be litigated effectually and completely without the joinder. Again, no commercial or other interest of Mayne Nickless will be affected by that process. See Gordian Runoff v Price & Ors [2004] NSWSC 535 at [10] and following, where I analysed the cases on SCR Pt 8 r (1)(b) and its equivalents. For the reasons that I there gave, I think that the test expressed by Lord Diplock in Pegang Mining Company Ltd v Choong Sam [1969] 2 MLJ 52 at 55-56 is appropriate. His Lordship said, in substance, that the test required by the rule was whether the rights or liabilities of the person sought to be joined against or to any party to the action in respect of the subject matter of the action be directly affected by any order which might be made. As I noted in paras [12] and [13], his Lordship’s test was cited with approval by the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League (1996) 64 FCR 410, and by McHugh J State of Victoria v Sutton (1998) 195 CLR 291 at 316-317, [77] to [78]. 
     
      
    80 On that analysis, Mayne Nickless is not someone whose joinder is “necessary” within para (b). Its rights (if any) remain unaffected by any decision (including that set out in the preceding section of these reasons) on Rickard Constructions’ claims against Rickard Partners and Jeffery and Katauskas.  
     
      
    81 Even if, contrary to my conclusions, there were power under SCR Pt 8 r 8 to join Mayne Nickless as a plaintiff, I would have declined on discretionary grounds to do so. 
     
      
    82 The sole purpose of the joinder would appear to be to enable Mayne Nickless to seek to recover the rectification costs. However, in substance, it would not be doing so for its own benefit (because it incurred no rectification costs), but for the benefit of Rickard Constructions (which carried out the Rectification Works in consideration only of the assignment). Mayne Nickless had been a party but it agreed with Rickard Constructions to be let out of the proceedings following the making of the second assignment. That is the clearest indication that Mayne Nickless did not regard itself as having any interest to be protected by its continuing presence as a party in the proceedings.  
     
      
    83 I have not overlooked the fact that, under cl 3.4(b)(5) of the 3 May agreement, Mayne Nickless has a contingent interest in the fruits of the action: if they exceed all costs incurred by Rickard Constructions in connection with the Assigned Action and the amount of the Variation Claim. But in circumstances where Mayne Nickless did not think that its presence as a party was necessary to protect whatever the real value of that contingent interest might be, I do not think that the Court should substitute its own judgment.  
     
      
    84 In the absence of any explanation for the lateness of the application to join Mayne Nickless as a party, it could be inferred (as both Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas submitted) that it stood aside from the proceedings so as to avoid exposing itself to any adverse costs order. It is possible that (if the joinder were authorised by SCR Pt 8 r 8) leave to join Mayne Nickless could be on terms that it was liable for any costs ordered in favour of the defendants, including costs relating to work done or things happening before its joinder. But Mayne Nickless has not indicated that it would accept such a term; and has not been heard in opposition to the imposition of it.  
     
      
    85 There are two other matters that I regard as of greater – indeed dispositive – significance on the discretionary issue (assuming, as I have indicated, that one gets so far as considering discretionary issues). The first is that, because Mayne Nickless has not been a party for most of the time that these proceedings have been current, it has not been exposed to orders for discovery. The second is that Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas have not had the opportunity of considering their position as against Mayne Nickless and (for example) making an offer of compromise or otherwise seeking to reach some resolution with it. 
     
      
    86 In answer to these propositions, Rickard Constructions submitted that subpoenas for production had been directed to Mayne Nickless and it had produced documents; and that there was no evidence to show that Rickard Partners or Jeffery & Katauskas might have sought to make an offer of compromise, or otherwise to treat, with Mayne Nickless.  
     
      
    87 The first of those responses does not seem to me to deal with the problem. The effect of an order for discovery is to require the party obliged to give discovery to produce all available documents that fall within the terms of the order. It does not put upon the party seeking discovery any requirement to forecast, or more accurately guess, what documents or classes of documents might be held. However, a subpoena must be directed towards clearly defined documents or classes of documents. It is no substitute for discovery; indeed a subpoena that is cast so wide as in effect to require the party to whom it is addressed to give discovery is liable to be set aside as an abuse of process. I do not regard the ability to serve subpoenas as any substitute for the inability to require discovery; and, having regard to the issues in these proceedings, the inability to require discovery is a real, rather than a theoretical, detriment to Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas. 
     
      
    88 Nor do I think that the second proposition answers the submission to which it was responsive. The application to join Mayne Nickless as a party was intimated after the conclusion of the evidence. The parties were then engaged in the preparation of written submissions. It is hardly to be expected that Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas should have diverted themselves from that task (a task that, it will be seen from the written submissions that were filed, was onerous and, no doubt, time-consuming) and turned their attention to the application for leave to join Mayne Nickless. It is unrealistic to expect Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas to have dropped what they were doing and to have turned to preparing evidence in opposition to the joinder application. In some circumstances, the courts have said that prejudice (in relation to amendments) may be inferred even in the absence of direct evidence: see Bishopsgate Insurance Australia Ltd (In liq) v Deloitte Haskins & Sells [1999] 3 VR 863. Although the circumstances of this case, and the nature of the prejudice suggested by the relevant defendants, are far removed from the circumstances and suggested prejudice of that case, I think that the general principle is applicable. Some kinds of prejudice are demonstrable by argument; others may require evidence. The particular prejudice – inability to serve an offer of compromise, or otherwise to treat with Mayne Nickless - falls into the former category. 
     
      
    89 Further, the loss of that opportunity constitutes real and not merely hypothetical prejudice. As I have said, it is open to infer that Mayne Nickless has no real continuing interest in the outcome of this litigation. Had it been joined as a plaintiff at some earlier stage, I consider that it is quite plausible to think that the relevant defendants would have sought to compromise with it and that, if they were not able to do so, they might have sought to put pressure – legitimate pressure – on it by serving offers of compromise. I therefore think that the loss of that opportunity is, as I have indicated, a source of real prejudice.  
     
      
    90 Accordingly, even if, contrary to my view, there were power to join Mayne Nickless as a plaintiff, I would have exercised my discretion to do so adversely to the application. 
     
      
    Conclusion on the assigned claims 
     
      
    91 Because I have concluded that the assignments are ineffective, and because I have concluded that Mayne Nickless can not be joined (and that, even if it could be joined, it should not be), the assigned claims must fail. Because the assignments are ineffective, Rickard Constructions cannot enforce them. Because Mayne Nickless is not to be joined as a plaintiff, it cannot enforce them in these proceedings, either for the benefit of Rickard Constructions or otherwise. 
     
      
    92 I therefore do not propose to consider the merits of those assigned claims. This means that issues 23 to 25 and 51 to 53 should be answered adversely to Rickard Constructions and that, accordingly, it is not necessary to deal with issues 12 to 22 and 43 to 50. That having been said, at least some of the issues that remain for consideration involve questions that would also be relevant to issues 12 to 22 and 43 to 50.  
     
      
    93 That leaves for consideration, apart from the direct claims by Rickard Constructions against the defendants, the subrogation claims (issues 26, 27 and 54) and the contribution claims (issues 28 to 31 and 55 to 57). I will deal with the direct claims and then return to the subrogation and contribution claims. But before I turn to the detail of the direct claims, I will deal with the pavement design and the criticisms of it, and with the cause of the collapse. 
     
      
    The pavement design and the criticisms of it 
     
      
    94 The person within Rickard Partners who had principal responsibility for design was Mr Hails, then a senior associate. Mr Rickard, however, agreed that it was he who had instructed Mr Hails to prepare the design and that he “oversaw and controlled the work that was carried out” by Mr Hails pursuant to that instruction (T 133.19-.30). 
     
      
    95 The starting point of the design was the (apparently successful) pavement constructed at 60 Friendship Road. However, in the case of lot 1, Container Park wanted an asphalt layer 100 mm thick overall, compared to the 50 mm asphalt wearing layer at 60 Friendship Road. 
     
      
    96 Mr Hails was not called to give evidence, a circumstance that excited some criticism from some parties. However, his working papers, showing the evolution of the design, were proved. As I have noted, the basic design comprised an asphalt wearing layer over a DGB20 base course over a crushed sandstone sub-base over compacted sand sub-grade. Mr Hails appears to have produced a number of articulations of that scheme, with different thicknesses for the various layers. In doing so, he made certain assumptions as to the weight of the forklift machine that would be used on the pavement, so as to assess the loading that would be applied to the pavement. 
     
      
    97 The draft (for want of a better word) designs were analysed and tested by a computer programme known as “CIRCLY”. A number of design variables (or, in the jargon of the trade, “parameters”) are input to the programme: including the likely loading, the thickness, degree of compaction and stiffness of the layers – and the programme calculates the number of repetitions (ie, the number of times that the pavement is subjected to the design loading) before it will fail. If assumptions are made as to the number of repetitions that will occur over an average working week and year, this produces a projection of the design life of the pavement. 
     
      
    98 The design upon which Mr Hails settled comprised the following layers (from the sub-grade up): 
     
      
       
      Subgrade (compacted sand) having a California Bearing Ratio (a measure of stiffness or resistance to load, usually abbreviated to CBR) of 12% when soaked. The compaction specified for the sub-grade was 98% standard compaction. (I will deal with standard compaction, and its relative modified compaction, shortly.) 
       
       
      A crushed sandstone sub-base with an overall thickness of 750 mm, comprising three levels. The lowest and intermediate levels were each specified to be 200 mm thick and compacted to 98% standard. The highest level was specified to be 150 mm thick and compacted to 100% standard.  
       
       
      A base course of DGB20 105 mm thick and compacted to 100% standard. 
       
       
      An asphalt wearing layer (specified to be AC 28 – a reference to asphaltic cement comprising asphalt and blue metal, or similar material, with an average particle size of 28 mm) 100 mm thick. 
       
      
    99 The overall pavement thickness as specified was, therefore, 800 mm. However, the evidence was that this was the minimum thickness and that over most of its area the pavement was in fact thicker: this, apparently, reflecting the need for there to be a slight gradient in the pavement to enable water to drain off.  
     
      
    100 Mr Hails’ CIRCLY analysis of this design, making certain assumptions as to the CBR of the sub-grade, sub-base and base course, gave a design life of 3.13 x 105 repetitions, or 25 years. It was not suggested that this was an inadequate design life for a pavement of this character. 
     
      
    101 It was, however, suggested by Allianz that in fact the design life was substantially less, because of what it alleged were defects in the design. Allianz relied on expert evidence adduced from a consulting engineer, Mr Lyle Marshall, and a geotechnical engineer, Mr Peter Waddell.  
     
      
    102 The principal criticisms made of the design by Messrs Lyle and Waddell focused on the allegedly insufficient stiffness of the base course and sub-base components and on the alleged failure to design the pavement in accordance with the principle that that each layer should be stiffer than the layer beneath it. There were, however, other criticisms including: 
     
      
       
      (1) The failure to specify modified compaction for the base course and lower layers. 
       
       
      (2) The failure to specify constant testing of the crushed sandstone delivered to site for use in the sub-base, so as to ensure that it complied with the composition and stiffness assumptions in the design. 
       
       
      (3) The assumption said to underline the design, that it was appropriate to use the same design theory as had been used on prior projects, including 60 Friendship Road. 
       
       
      (4) The failure to specify the testing of DGB20 delivered to site for use in the base course, to ensure that it complied with the relevant specification. 
       
       
      (5) The failure to specify stabilisation of the sub-base by the use of cement or fly ash. 
       
       
      (6) The use of the Austroads Pavement Design Guide which, it was said, was not suitable for a heavy duty pavement required to carry a fully laden forklift weighing in excess of 90 tonnes.  
       
       
      (7) Failure to heed advice from Jeffery & Katauskas as to plate load bearing tests undertaken to establish the vertical modulus (another measure of stiffness, or bearing capacity) of the sandstone material. 
       
       
      (8) The failure to take into account the variable quality and relatively lower stiffness of the sandstone sub-base material. 
       
      
    103 The experts called by the other parties, Dr Brian Burman (called by Rickard Constructions), Mr Michael Thom (called by Rickard Partners) and Mr Andrew Leventhal (called by Jeffery & Katauskas), did not agree with Messrs Marshall and Waddell that the design was defective in any of the ways that I have outlined. Further, Jeffery & Katauskas called one of its then principals, Mr Rod Jeffery. He gave both evidence of fact and evidence of an expert nature. To the extent that he was able to express an opinion (and he had not reviewed all the matters raised by Messrs Marshall and Waddell), he did not agree that there were design deficiencies. 
     
      
    104 I do not accept the evidence of Messrs Marshall and Waddell that there were design defects of the kinds alleged. There are three reasons. Firstly, as I have indicated, their view is inconsistent with the views of the other experts. Secondly, it is apparent, on analysis, that their views are based on inadequate CIRCLY analysis undertaken by Mr Waddell on the basis of inadequate information. Further, as will be seen in the next section of these reasons, I think that there is a logical flaw in the reasoning of Messrs Marshall and Waddell on the question of the cause of the collapse of the pavement. Although that does not, as a matter of logic, necessarily impinge on the acceptability of their evidence as to the alleged existence of design flaws, I take it into account in concluding that, as I have said, I favour the majority approach. 
     
      
    105 Mr Marshall was a civil rather than a geotechnical engineer. He had substantial experience in the design of industrial pavements. However, he said, when undertaking such a design, he would normally obtain geotechnical assistance. It is I think clear, on an analysis of the whole of Mr Marshall’s evidence, that his view as to the existence of design inadequacies is based on two things. The first is an empirical matter: his own design experience over the years. The second is his reliance on the evidence of Mr Waddell: including, in particular, on Mr Waddell’s CIRCLY analysis. 
     
      
    106 Mr Waddell carried out his CIRCLY analysis taking what he suggested were typical CBR values of the sandstone sub-base material. The result, in Mr Waddell’s opinion, was to demonstrate that the sandstone sub-base was inadequately stiff; and also (in contravention of the design principle referred to in para [102] above) to show that it was less stiff than the underlying layer, mainly the sub-grade. 
     
      
    107 However, it became apparent that Mr Waddell had chosen the lowest CBR values from materials at particular portions of the site, and had not used other, and considerably higher, CBR values from other materials at other portions of the site. Mr Waddell ignored those additional values, as did Mr Marshall also. Neither was able to justify their failure to take that additional material into account. The effect was that Mr Waddell (and also Mr Marshall) ignored data which must have suggested to them that the CBR values chosen by Mr Waddell for his CIRCLY analysis were not only unrepresentative but also low. In this context, it is worth bearing in mind that Mr Marshall acknowledged that one should not use either the lowest nor the highest of varying values obtained (T 827.1, T 832.13); but this was in substance precisely what Mr Waddell and he did. 
     
      
    108 Discarding the highest and lowest CBR values in the material available to Messrs Marshall and Waddell, it was nonetheless the case that the average CBR value was double the value selected by them for the purposes of analysis (T 831.30). (It was also the case that those higher average values were obtained using standard compaction rather than modified compaction as advocated by Messrs Marshall and Waddell.) 
     
      
    109 Neither Mr Marshall nor Mr Waddell offered any intellectually respectable, let alone persuasive, reason for their selection of values that were not only unrepresentative but also low – ie, most likely to produce an outcome critical of the design of the pavement. This aspect of their evidence is unacceptable. Although each of them denied that he had taken this course so as to produce the outcome most favourable for the party by whom he was called, and most adverse to the interests of the party against whom, in effect, he was called, I am left with the uneasy feeling (particularly having regard to the inability of either of them to produce an acceptable reason for what was done) that this may have been at least a subconscious motiving factor. 
     
      
    110 Whatever the reason, I regard this as affecting, in a very serious and adverse way, the reliability of the evidence given by them not just on this point but overall, and as a sufficient reason for declining to accept the opinions expressed by each of them to the extent that they differ from the opinion of the majority. 
     
      
    111 That is sufficient to dispose not only of the principal criticisms that they make but also of the individual criticisms (because none of the other experts agreed with those individual criticisms). However, in my view, the other criticisms should be rejected on their merits.  
     
      
    112 The criticism dealing with the selection of standard rather than modified compaction goes nowhere. It is correct to observe that the same material, if compacted to (say) 95% modified compaction, will be stiffer – more resistant to load – than if compacted to 95% standard. The tests, or methods of compaction, are different; and modified compaction produces, at the same percentage figure, a stiffer material. But it does not follow that material compacted at (say) 100% standard will not be at least as stiff as material compacted at (say) 95% modified. The issue is not one of the method of testing compaction, but whether, one method or the other having been chosen, compaction to the specified percentage using the specified method will produce a material of sufficient stiffness. All the experts agreed that this was so; but the submissions for Allianz did not deal with this rather obvious proposition. 
     
      
    113 The criticism based upon the alleged fundamental principle of pavement design – that each layer should be stiffer than the layer immediately below it – goes nowhere. The principle, as a principle, may be accepted. However, it has not been demonstrated that the fundamental principle was breached. That is because the argument that it was dependent upon assumptions as to the stiffness of the sandstone sub-base layer that, as I have just said, relied on unrepresentative and low CBR values. 
     
      
    114 The criticisms relating to the testing of sandstone and DGB20 material go nowhere. It might be accepted, in principle, that strength or integrity critical to the success of a particular design should be tested regularly and comprehensively, to ensure that it possesses the qualities that have been assumed as a component of the design. But (for the reasons that I give in the next section) it has not been shown that the omission of testing, or the failure to specify sufficient testing, has any causal relationship to the collapse that occurred. Nor, for the reasons just given, has it been shown that the material that was in fact delivered and incorporated into the pavement was of inferior quality, such that it would have been picked up by proper testing. 
     
      
    115 The criticism based on reliance on previous designs goes nowhere. I accept that, in principle, it would be insufficient to copy across unchanged a prior design, without ensuring firstly that the material to be used in the new project would be equivalent to the material assumed in the prior design, and secondly that the prior design in any event met the design life requirements of the new project. But this criticism ignores the fact that Mr Hails’ design evolved from the earlier designs, and that it was tested by CIRCLY analysis – a method of analysis that all experts agreed was appropriate. I see nothing wrong in taking, as a starting point, a design that has been shown to work in an equivalent situation elsewhere, and using that as the basis for a new design. There would be a problem (certainly in principle and perhaps in practice) with the unquestioning adoption of a prior design; but that is not what happened in the present case. 
     
      
    116 The criticism of the failure to stabilise the sub-base material is valid only if it is assumed that it was the moisture in that material that caused the failure. Only Messrs Marshall and Waddell adopted that theory. For the reasons that I give in the next section of these reasons, I do not accept that theory. In any event, the criticism suffers from the defect that it has not been shown that the failure to stabilise the sub-base contributed to the failure of the pavement. 
     
      
    117 The criticism relating to the thickness of the base course is critically dependent upon the unrepresentative and low CBR values taken by Mr Waddell in his analysis. It cannot stand, for the reasons already given. 
     
      
    118 The criticism based on the use of the Austroads pavement design criteria is fallacious. I accept that there is a significant difference between road pavements (even those designed for roads carrying very heavy traffic) and a pavement of the kind required for lot 1. However, the critical question is whether the design was adequate, not whether the design was produced by the use of theoretically appropriate criteria. In the present case, Mr Hails’ CIRCLY analysis (which did not depend on any assumption as to the source of the design) showed that the pavement would meet the design life required of it. Mr Waddell’s contrary analysis is unacceptable because, as I have said more than once, it was based on the lowest, and unrepresentative, CBR values available. 
     
      
    119 It is correct to say, as Allianz does in its written submissions, that Mr Leventhal gave evidence that use of the Austroads pavement design guide would lead to a significant reduction in the life of pavement. However, it is necessary to bear in mind that this was a criticism of a theoretical nature, and not one that was related to the actual design of the pavement and the actual design life predicted by CIRCLY analysis. Mr Leventhal’s opinion, which was effectively an off-the-cuff response in cross-examination, assumed that if a pavement designed according to the Austroads guide was to be subjected to a substantially higher loading than that appropriate for road pavements, the design life would be reduced very substantially. That may be taken as correct. But by focussing on one element only of the CIRCLY analysis, it fails to take account of the interrelationship between all the elements that CIRCLY analysis requires to be undertaken. (In saying this, I mean no criticism of Mr Leventhal.) He was asked to consider only the impact of a change in one variable, presumably upon the assumption that all other variables (which produced the overall outcome) were unchanged. (He was not asked directly – and neither was any other expert – to express a view on the adequacy, or otherwise, of Mr Hails’ CIRCLY analysis upon the basis of the totality of the values that he used.) 
     
      
    120 The alleged failure to heed the advice of Jeffery & Katauskas again goes nowhere. I accept that Mr Hails, having been given the advice in question (and having had that advice in substance confirmed by another geotechnical consultant), should have queried his design – more specifically, the assumptions within his design. However, again, this theoretical deficiency in the design process has no relationship to what I find (in the next section of these reasons) was the reason for the failure of the pavement. 
     
      
    121 The last criticism made, relating to the vertical modulus value of the sandstone, is in effect a combination of a number of the previous criticisms. It has no greater validity than they do.  
     
      
    The failure of the pavement 
     
      
    122 The majority of the experts (Dr Burman, Mr Thom and Mr Leventhal) thought that the pavement had failed because of the build-up of excessive moisture in the DGB20 base course. The postulated failure mechanism was that, when the pavement was loaded by the operation of the heavy forklift trucks, there was a build-up of pore pressure in the base course which, in simple terms, caused its stiffness, or ability to resist load, to diminish sharply. Thus, the base course was unable to support the loaded asphalt wearing course and the pavement collapsed. Mr Jeffery agreed that excessive moisture in the base course was the primary cause of the rapid failure.  
     
      
    123 Messrs Marshall and Waddell said that the primary reason for the failure was the defective design, although Mr Marshall added, somewhat curiously, that “construction issues are also a primary cause”. Dr Burman and Messrs Thom and Leventhal did not agree. Mr Jeffery indicated some agreement with the position taken by Messrs Marshall and Wadell, but he was uncertain because he had not done a design check. 
     
      
    124 I prefer the majority view. In this context, I do not think that Mr Jeffery’s propensity to accept the “design defect” theory can be regarded as significant support, given that, as the joint report indicated, he had not done a design check. My preference for the majority view is not based simply on the fact that it is a majority view. I think that the majority view is clearly reasoned and rational: that is to say, I think that Dr Burman, Mr Thom and Mr Leventhal have provided clear and persuasive reasons in support of their theory. Further, the majority view is supported by empirical evidence of failures in other circumstances where the base course had become excessively moist. Finally, it is consistent with the observed phenomena, including that there had been heavy rain over a period of months before the failure; that in at least some areas the base course was sealed (ie, the 100 mm asphalt layer was placed over it) while it was still wet and “heaving”; and that it is unlikely, having regard to the weather conditions and other matters of which the experts gave evidence, that the base course could have dried out between the time when it was sealed over and the time when the pavement failed.  
     
      
    125 In support of the majority view is the circumstance that, on the evidence, there is a very significant correlation between the failed areas of the pavement and the areas that were observed to be wet and heaving before they were sealed. In other words, there is empirical support for the theory based on observations made at the time.  
     
      
    126 By contrast, I find the evidence of Messrs Marshall and Waddell on this topic entirely unconvincing. There are three principal reasons: 
     
      
       
      (1) Firstly, as I have indicated in the preceding section of these reasons, I do not think that the design defects alleged by them have been substantiated.  
       
       
      (2) Secondly, they have not demonstrated that the design defects (if indeed they existed) were likely to have led to the failure that in fact occurred; and 
       
       
      (3) Thirdly, on their evidence, the design defects are likely to have led to a failure of a different kind. 
       
      
    127 I have already dealt with the first problem. The second and third may be considered together. 
     
      
    128 The effect of the design defects (assuming them to have been substantiated) would be to reduce the design life of the pavement. That means, in substance, that the pavement would fail at a time – on one view of the evidence, much earlier – than it would have been expected to fail in the absence of those defects. However, that does not explain the failure that in fact occurred. Indeed, at one point Mr Marshall’s evidence appeared to be, in substance, that the failure was the inherent inability of the pavement (on his and Mr Waddell’s theory) to achieve its design life.  
     
      
    129 Further, the evidence of all experts (and Messrs Marshall and Waddell are included) is that the alleged design defects would have led to what was called a “rutting” failure. In other words, as the pavement deteriorated, ruts would have formed along the paths traversed by the loaded forklift trucks. But that was not the kind of failure that occurred. 
     
      
    130 The evidence of Messrs Marshall and Waddell on this point was so illogical, in their failure to recognise, let alone accept, that the cause postulated by them would not explain the failure that in fact occurred, that, as I have already indicated, it leads me to have considerable hesitation in accepting their evidence not only on this point but overall. 
     
      
    131 In substance, then, I conclude that the pavement failed because the asphalt layer was placed over base course that was, in sections, excessively wet; and the pavement was put into use before the base course had any opportunity to dry out. (There was some difference between the experts as to whether, firstly, the base course could dry out; secondly, whether it should have been allowed to dry out before the pavement was put into use; and, thirdly, whether the preferable alternative would have been to remove, dry and replace and recompact any base course material that was excessively moist. I will deal with this dispute later in these reasons.)  
     
      
    Responsibility for the failure of the pavement 
     
      
    132 So far, I have dealt with the cause of the failure of the pavement. Not surprisingly, an issue much in dispute between the parties was that of responsibility for the failure: more accurately, responsibility for the circumstances that caused the failure. 
     
      
    133 I have concluded that primary responsibility for the failure must be attributed to Rickard Constructions. The conditions that caused the failure occurred because, in substance, Rickard Constructions permitted the asphalt wearing layer to be placed over the base course, thereby sealing the base course (and the underlying layers), whilst the base course was excessively wet. 
     
      
    134 I have no doubt that Rickard Constructions well appreciated that it was not good construction practice to apply an asphalt wearing layer over base course material that was excessively wet. Mr Rickard certainly understood this. Mr Thom confirmed that “if [the base course] becomes saturated, all contractors know it has to be dried back” (T 466.40). 
     
      
    135 As I have mentioned, Rickard Constructions’ personnel on site, apart from Mr Rickard, were not called. I draw the usual inference from the failure to call them in relation to a matter that was in contest.  
     
      
    136 Further, on a number of occasions, Rickard Constructions was warned by the asphalting contractor, CSR Emoleum, of the risk of asphalting over soft pavement layers. Those warnings were not heeded. 
     
      
    137 Thus, I conclude, Rickard Constructions failed to adopt good construction practices when it caused the asphalt wearing layer to be placed over the finished base course when, to its knowledge, that base course (at least in parts) was wet and soft.  
     
      
    138 But the problem is more general. Rickard Constructions arranged for the sub-base and base course layers to be placed and compacted and, thereafter, tested. It knew that, after those tests were carried out, there was heavy rainfall. The rainfall records for a nearby site, Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport, were proved. They, together with site diaries, show that there were many very wet days during the construction of the sub-base and base course layers of the pavement.  
     
      
    139 It is clear that Rickard Constructions was aware of the problem. That is why it consulted Jeffery & Katauskas in late April 1999, and retained (or through Rickard Partners retained) Jeffery & Katauskas to give the advice in its letter of 3 May 1999 on the questions that were raised. (I deal with the genesis of this letter and its significance later, when considering the direct claim against Jeffery & Katauskas.) But Rickard Constructions did not request that sections of the pavement layers that had been tested by Jeffery & Katauskas be retested following sustained heavy rain. Nor did it arrange for Rickard Partners to do so. There was no basis shown in the evidence for Rickard Constructions, or a reasonable and competent civil engineering contractor in its place, to assume that the tested material would (after heavy and sustained rain) remain sound and adequate to play its part contributing to the overall strength of the pavement. Yet, by sealing over the base course without retesting, Rickard Constructions effectively assumed that the base course and sub-base layers remained effective. Not only was there no basis for this assumption; it was directly inconsistent with the tenor of the advice, requested of Jeffery & Katauskas, given in the letter of 3 May 1999. 
     
      
    140 It is apparent that Mayne wished to occupy the container depot as soon as possible. I have no doubt that Mayne was putting pressure on Rickard Constructions to achieve practical completion as soon as possible. I have the uneasy feeling that Rickard Constructions may have reacted to that pressure by taking shortcuts: specifically, by deciding not to retest finished sections of work that had been affected by rain. It may well be that the construction personnel who effectively made the decision (and who were not called) feared that, if retesting were undertaken, it would reveal the need for very substantial reworking of the finished layers, and would thereby delay the achievement of practical completion. In the absence of direct evidence or cross-examination on this point, I do not think that it is open to me so to conclude; but I do not need to go so far to find that Rickard Constructions, in sealing the pavement knowing that portions of it were wet and soft and in any event without retesting the whole, knowing it to have been severely affected by moisture, did not follow good construction practice. 
     
      
    141 I therefore conclude that the effective responsibility for the creation of the conditions that led to the failure of the pavement, through the mechanism that I have described, must be attributed to Rickard Constructions.  
     
      
    142 There is empirical evidence to support the proposition that the direct cause of the failure was sealing over wet base course material. As I have noted, CSR Emoleum warned on a number of occasions that this should not be done. The approximate areas described in its warnings were identified. There is a correlation between the areas so identified (bearing in mind that the identification was not precise, because of the relatively limited information given by CSR Emoleum) and the failed sections of some of the pavement. That correlation suggests that all the areas identified by CSR Emoleum failed. However, the overall failures were greater in extent than the areas identified by CSR Emoleum.  
     
      
    143 I have not overlooked the evidence of Mr Michael Nugent. He was the site foreman for Walker Civil Engineering (“Walker”). Walker was contracted to supply, place and compact the sub-base and base course layers. Rickard Constructions submitted that his evidence was inconsistent with there having been faulty or defective workmanship on its part. I do not accept that submission. I agree that his evidence is that he recorded no instance of what he regarded as faulty workmanship. But I think his testimony cannot bear the load that the submission places on it. Whilst I accept Mr Nugent as a witness of truth, who sought to give evidence to the best of his recollection, I do not think that his evidence can prevail against the overwhelming facts, and the inferences from them, to which I have referred. 
     
      
    144 Nor have I overlooked the submission for Rickard Constructions that the conclusion to which I have come entails fixing it with a degree of knowledge or understanding greater than that of the consultants, Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas, on site. That submission is misdirected. The question is not what Rickard Partners or Jeffery & Katauskas might have seen, and might have thought. (To the extent that this question is asked of Jeffery & Katauskas, the answer is clear from its letter of 3 May 1999; and the significant fact in this context is that Rickard Constructions effectively ignored the majority of the recommendations in that letter.) Rather, the question is what Rickard Constructions, or a reasonable and competent civil engineering contractor in its place, should have known, should have understood and should have done. As I have said, I have no doubt that Rickard Constructions understood, as would a reasonable and competent civil engineering contractor in its place, that excessively wet base course material should not be sealed, and that base course material that had been tested but had thereafter been exposed to prolonged and heavy rainfall should be retested before sealing.  
     
      
        
      
    The claim against Rickard Partners 
     
      
    145 Rickard Constructions’ direct claim against Rickard Partners is brought in negligence and pursuant to the Trade Practices Act. Rickard Constructions says that: 
     
      
       
      (1) It relied upon Rickard Partners to provide engineering, supervision and certification services in connection with the works comprised in the building contract and the construction of the pavement. 
       
       
      (2) Rickard Partners owed Rickard Constructions a duty to take reasonable care in providing design, supervision and certification services. 
       
       
      (3) Rickard Partners failed to carry out its services with reasonable care.  
       
       
      (4) Rickard Constructions suffered loss and damage as a result: making good the defects in the pavement after it failed without recovering payment from Mayne. 
       
       
      (5) Alternatively, Rickard Partners represented that the plans and specifications were adequate for the construction of the pavement and that it had provided and would provide supervision with appropriate care, skill and diligence.  
       
       
      (6) To the extent that the representations were with respect to a future matter, they were made without reasonable grounds. 
       
       
      (7) The design was not adequate for the construction of the pavement. 
       
       
       
      (8) Rickard Partners has engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in breach of s 52 of the  
      Trade Practices Act. 
       
       
       
      (9) Rickard Constructions relied on the representations. 
       
       
      (10) Rickard Constructions has suffered loss, of the kind already mentioned, by that conduct. 
       
      
    146 In my judgment, the claim, however formulated, must fail. 
     
      
    Duty of care 
     
      
    147 Rickard Constructions’ claim is one for pure economic loss: economic loss not associated with physical damage or destruction to any property of Rickard Constructions. In those circumstances, if a duty of care is to be found, it is necessary to show more than that some negligence on the part of Rickard Partners was a cause of the loss and that the loss was reasonably foreseeable. That is because (to paraphrase Brennan J in Bryan v Maloney (1995) 182 CLR 609, 632) to hold that liability for pure economic loss would follow simply because the defendant’s negligence was the cause of reasonably foreseeable loss (which in fact was sustained) would be destructive of commerce and inimical to contractual relations, and would create the real likelihood of liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class of potential plaintiffs. The law therefore requires that there be some additional circumstance before liability for pure economic loss will be imposed. 
     
      
    148 One such additional circumstance that has been identified is the “vulnerability” of the plaintiff. As the majority (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ) explained in Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd (2004) 78 ALJR 628 at 633-634 [23], vulnerability means more than that the plaintiff is likely to suffer damage if reasonable care were not taken. Their Honours said that vulnerability, in this context, referred to the plaintiff’s inability to protect itself from the consequences of the defendant’s reasonable care: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [T]he vulnerability of the plaintiff has emerged as an important requirement in cases where a duty of care to avoid economic loss has been held to have been owed. “Vulnerability”, in this context, is not to be understood as meaning only that the plaintiff was likely to suffer damage if reasonable care was not taken. Rather, “vulnerability” is to be understood as a reference to the plaintiff’s inability to protect itself from the consequences of a defendant’s want of reasonable care, either entirely or at least in a way which would cast the consequences of loss upon the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    149 Their Honours referred at 634 [24] to cases where notions of assumption of responsibility and known reliance grounded a duty of care in the context of pure economic loss. Their Honours noted that these cases could be explained by reference to notions of vulnerability, but did not find it necessary “to attempt to identify or articulate the breadth of any general proposition about the importance of vulnerability.” 
     
      
    150 Ordinarily, analysis of vulnerability will require consideration of the salient features of the relationship between the person said to owe, and the person said to be entitled to the benefit of, the duty of care, and to the context in which that relationship is to be found. Thus, in considering whether a duty of care exists in relation to the provision of professional services, it will be necessary to focus attention on the existence and terms of any retainer, or other contract, pursuant to which those services were provided. As the majority said in Woolcock at 635 [28], the contract will at least define the task undertaken; it would be difficult to hold that the person who provided the services owed a duty of care to a third party to avoid economic loss if the performance of that duty would have required the provider to do more or different work than was required or permitted under the contract.  
     
      
    151 In the present case, I do not think that Rickard Constructions was vulnerable to any want of care on the part of Rickard Partners in connection with the design or specification for the pavement. That is because Rickard Constructions’ duty, to Container Park and to Mayne, was to construct the pavement (using the appropriate standard of skill, competence and good workmanship) in accordance with the design and specification prepared by Rickard Partners. If Rickard Constructions complied with that obligation then it fulfilled its contract. It was entitled to be paid. If the pavement failed because of any defect in the design or specification, Rickard Constructions had no liability for rectification. 
     
      
    152 It might be otherwise in connection with the alleged duty to supervise. It could be argued that, in this case, Rickard Constructions was vulnerable, because a failure on the part of Rickard Partners to exercise the requisite standard of competence in relation to supervision might cause Rickard Constructions to construct the pavement otherwise than in accordance with the design and specification, and therefore to be liable for the cost of making good any loss caused thereby. 
     
      
    No breach of duty 
     
      
    153 Even if I were wrong in concluding that Rickard Partners owed Rickard Constructions no duty of care relating to the design and specification of the pavement, I would nonetheless conclude that it had not breached any duty that it did owe. In this context, it is to be noted that the case of breach of duty, relating to design and specification, that Rickard Constructions alleged against Rickard Partners was not supported by Dr Burman, the expert called for Rickard Constructions. Nor was it supported by Mr Thom, the expert called for Rickard Partners. The pleaded case must fail. (The case that Allianz sought to make out against Rickard Partners was not supported, in its pleadings, evidence or submissions, by Rickard Constructions; and I have in any event concluded that that case should fail.) 
     
      
    154 The supervision case is difficult to understand. The only pleaded case that can be understood as relating to failure to supervise is that found in the particulars to para 17 of Rickard Constructions’ contentions (which, by para 29D, are repeated in the direct claim) at paras (g), (h), (m) and (n). They allege that: 
     
      
       
      (1) Rickard Partners “failed to supervise the construction of the base layer” because it “wrongly approved the laying of the AC layer content properly [sic]” (para (g)). 
       
       
      (2) Rickard Partners failed to check the characteristics of the base layer and its moisture content (para (h)) – assuming that this allegation is directed at supervision rather than design and specification. 
       
       
      (3) Rickard Partners did not properly supervise the construction of the base layer and allowed material that did not comply with the specification to be incorporated into the constructed pavement, including unbound gravel with excessive fines and fines that were more plastic than those specififed (para (m)). 
       
       
      (4) Rickard Partners wrongly approved the placement of the AC layer on the base layer without checking that the base layer was suitable having regard to its material quality, degree of compaction and moisture content (para (m)). 
       
      
    155 The difficulty with this case is that there was no contract proved for the provision of general supervision services by Rickard Partners to Rickard Constructions, nor was there proved any arrangement by which Rickard Partners undertook some responsibility for general supervision of the work carried out by Rickard Constructions. Although, on the evidence, one of Rickard Partners’ engineers (Mr Andrew Castle) was “resident” on Lot 1 whilst the pavement was being constructed, it is not shown that he performed any active supervision of the works that were being carried out. Indeed, such evidence as there is is to the contrary. The materials for the sub-base were brought to site, placed and compacted by Walker. Walker’s site foreman, Mr Nugent, gave evidence, but said nothing of being supervised or directed or instructed by Mr Castle. 
     
      
    156 Likewise, Mr Steven Hulbert, Rickard Constructions’ site foreman for the last couple of months of the construction of the project, gave evidence. However, he gave no evidence of supervision, direction or instruction by Mr Castle (or by anyone else speaking on behalf of Rickard Partners, as opposed to Rickard Constructions).  
     
      
    157 Bearing those matters in mind, and bearing in mind also that Rickard Constructions did not call other site personnel, I would not conclude that Rickard Partners was retained to, or undertook to, or did, supervise the construction of the pavement. Specifically, I do not find that the approvals referred to in Rickard Constructions’ particulars (see para [154] above) were given. I add only that in this area as in others (including the issues that were agreed) Rickard Constructions’ submissions did not address the specific case that was pleaded – a circumstance that has not made it easy to deal with the issues that were raised.  
     
      
    158 The evidence suggests only that Rickard Partners would from time to time inform Jeffery & Katauskas that areas of the site were ready for testing; examine the test results produced by Jeffery & Katauskas; and advise Rickard Constructions if the results showed the need for work on a tested area to be redone or rectified before the next layer was constructed. 
     
      
    159 Thus, the evidence goes nowhere near making out the case, relating to supervision, that has been pleaded and particularised. Nor does the evidence show that the limited duties of a supervisory nature undertaken by Rickard Partners (those referred to in the preceding paragraph) were carried out negligently.

    160 If I were wrong both as to the existence and breach of a duty of care relating to design, I would conclude that Rickard Constructions has not shown that it suffered any damage. The damage alleged is the cost of reconstructing the failed pavement. However, as I have said, if Rickard Constructions had constructed the pavement in accordance with the design and specification, it would have discharged its obligations under the building contract. If the pavement failed in those circumstances, and Mayne wished Rickard Constructions to rectify the failed pavement, Rickard Constructions was entitled to be paid. If (as happened) Rickard Constructions undertook to do that without seeking to be paid (except in so far as it took the assignment as consideration for carrying out the rectification works), then that was not something that was causally related to any assumed breach of any duty of care that may have existed. It was the result of Rickard Constructions’ deliberate choice, for whatever reason, not to seek to be paid for that which, on its case, it was entitled to be paid. 
     
      
    161 Alternatively, it could be said that Rickard Constructions agreed to accept, as payment to it for carrying out the rectification works, the assignment. If it judged the assignment to be of sufficient value, then, again, it suffered no loss. If the assignment proved to be a nugatory consideration (as, I have concluded, it is), that again is not something that can be said to be causally related to any breach of any duty that Rickard Partners may have owed to Rickard Constructions. 
     
      
    162 Again (as with the existence of a duty of care), the position may be different when one considers the duty of care alleged in relation to supervision. However, as I have found, the duty alleged has not been proved; and the duty that has been proved has not been shown to have been breached. 
     
      
    The section 52 claim 
     
      
    163 The reasons that I have given for rejecting the negligence claim mean that the s 52 claim must also be rejected. 
     
      
    164 Although the matter was not argued in detail, I would conclude that Rickard Partners, by finalising and submitting the design for the pavement, represented that it was adequate for the construction of the pavement. But it has not been shown that the representation was misleading or deceptive. On the contrary, Rickard Constructions called no evidence to show that the design was inadequate; and even if it be appropriate to regard Allianz’ evidence as available to Rickard Constructions on this point (and it is not), I have found that the criticisms made of the design by Allianz cannot be sustained. In any event, even if it were misleading or deceptive, the loss claimed is not loss that is occasioned “by” the hypothetical misleading or deceptive conduct. 
     
      
    165 It has not been shown that the representation alleged relating to supervision services was made. Thus, no question arises of its misleading or deceptive character (and this is so whether it is to be regarded as a representation in relation to an existing, or a future, state of affairs). Even if it be assumed that a representation was made that Rickard Partners would provide the limited supervision services to which I have referred in para [158] above with reasonable skill and care, there is no basis for thinking that Rickard Partners lacked adequate grounds for making that representation; and there is no basis for thinking that the representation was otherwise misleading or deceptive. 
     
      
    The claim against Jeffery and Katauskas 
     
      
    166 The case pleaded by Rickard Constructions against Jeffery and Katauskas is as follows: 
     
      
       
      (1) Rickard Constructions relied upon Jeffery and Katauskas to provide “quality control, assurance and testing services” for the work under the building contract, and the construction of the pavement. 
       
       
      (2) Jeffery and Katauskas owed Rickard Constructions a duty to take reasonable care in providing those services. 
       
       
      (3) Jeffery and Katauskas failed to use reasonable care in providing those services, because the services provided by it did not detect the potential failure of the pavement due to the presence of excess moisture in the base course before the asphalt layer was applied. (This summarises the case on the second further amended summons; at the conclusion of the hearing, Rickard Partners sought leave to amend the particulars of breach of duty. I deal with that in paras [177] and following below.)  
       
       
      (4) Rickard Constructions suffered the loss already referred to (see para [145(4)] 
        
      above). 
       
       
      (5) Alternatively, Jeffery and Katauskas represented that the pavement was being properly constructed and that the moisture levels were appropriate to achieve a sound pavement. 
       
       
      (6) Rickard Constructions relied upon those representations by continuing with construction of the pavement and placing the AC layer on the base course. 
       
       
      (7) The representations were misleading or deceptive. 
       
       
      (8) Rickard Constructions has suffered the loss already referred to by that misleading or deceptive conduct. 
       
      
    Duty of care 
     
      
    167 Any consideration of the duty of care alleged against Jeffery & Katauskas must take into account the terms of its retainer. That is for the reasons given in para [150] above.  
     
      
    168 Other matters relevant to the question include that Jeffery & Katauskas: 
     
      
       
      (1) Was retained by Rickard Partners, not by Rickard Constructions. 
       
       
      (2) Was not retained or requested, and did not volunteer, to review the design. 
       
       
      (3) Nonetheless, did suggest to Rickard Partners that the design should be checked. 
       
       
      (3) Was retained on a “level 2” basis, with the incidents of that retainer being as described in para [17] above.  
       
       
      (4) Had suggested to Rickard Partners that the retainer should be a “level 1” retainer, with the more onerous incidents described in para [18] above, but that Rickard Partners had rejected this, presumably on the basis of cost.  
       
      
    169 There is no doubt that both Rickard Constructions and Rickard Partners, in each case through Mr Rickard, were aware of these matters. Thus, among other things, Rickard Constructions must be taken to have been aware of, among other things, not only the limited nature of the retainer, but also of the precise incidents of that retainer. Equally, Rickard Constructions must have been aware, through Mr Rickard, that Rickard Partners had a resident engineer on site and that it was this engineer who, upon request by Rickard Constructions, would arrange for Jeffery & Katauskas to come to the site and test particular areas of work that had been filled and compacted. 
     
      
    170 It is unclear whether Rickard Constructions asserts that Jeffery & Katauskas owed it a duty of care relating to the design of the pavement. However, Jeffery & Katauskas has put submissions on that point, apparently taking the view that this is a case that Rickard Constructions seeks, by the amendments with which I deal in paras [177] and following below, to make. I therefore propose to deal with it. I see no basis upon which it can be said that Jeffery and Katauskas owed any duty of care to Rickard Constructions relating to the design of the pavement. The reasons given in para [151] above, in relation to vulnerability, apply with at least equal force to Jeffery & Katauskas. Further, because Jeffery & Katauskas was not the designer of the pavement and was not retained or requested to review the design, it is inherently implausible that there could be any circumstances, whether of reliance or otherwise, that could impose such a duty of care upon it.  
     
      
    171 It may be that in some circumstances the full extent of a professional person’s duty of care may not be defined solely by the retainer (something that the majority in Woolcock at 635 [30] appeared to regard as still open; and see Waimond Pty Ltd v Byrne (1989) 18 NSWLR 642, 652 (Kirby P, although noting that what his Honour said was not followed in Heydon v NRMA Ltd (2000) 51 NSWLR 1)). But even if that be accepted in principle, there is nothing in the circumstances of the present case to suggest that Jeffery & Katauskas came under, let alone that they undertook, any duty of care in relation to the design.  
     
      
    172 As with Rickard Partners (see para [152] above), I think that the position might be otherwise in respect of the duty of care alleged in relation to the testing services in fact undertaken by Jeffery & Katauskas. But again, I see no reason for extending any duty of care in relation to those services beyond the terms of the retainer. 
     
      
    No breach of duty 
     
      
    173 On the assumption that Jeffery & Katauskas came under a duty of care in relation to the testing services that they undertook, no breach of that duty has been made good. It has not been suggested that its performance of the testing services that it undertook was in any way defective: that is to say, it has not been suggested that (for example) it derived wrong test results. 
     
      
    174 The submission that was put is that Jeffery & Katauskas should have undertaken a greater amount of testing. However, I do not think that the evidence makes this proposition good. Jeffery & Katauskas was called to site to test portions of work that were indicated to it as complete. Its obligation, under the terms of its retainer, was to perform the number of tests that it thought appropriate at places (within the overall area indicated to be tested) that it thought to be appropriate. It has not been suggested that Jeffery & Katauskas performed an insufficient number of tests within those areas or that it failed to use appropriate professional skill in selecting the locations where those tests were to be performed. So far as I understood the case to be put against it, it was that Jeffery & Katauskas should have tested, or retested, other areas of the site. 
     
      
    175 It may be accepted that when an area that had previously been tested (and that was not thereafter sealed) was affected by heavy rain, then it was desirable, if not necessary, for that area to be retested before it was sealed. But that was a decision to be undertaken by Rickard Constructions. Jeffery & Katauskas was not required, under the terms of its retainer, to decide that it should come to the site regardless of requests, and undertake testing other than on areas of work indicated to it. The evidence is clear that Rickard Constructions understood the significance of heavy rain on areas of work that had been completed but not sealed. (I will refer to this in discussing the claim against Allianz; but it is sufficient to note that that evidence came both from Mr Rickard and from Mr Thom, who dealt with the position of contractors generally.) In those circumstances, if Rickard Constructions did not suggest that there was a need for further testing, there was nothing in the terms of the retainer of Jeffery & Katauskas that required the latter to volunteer some different view; and I see no basis for imposing on Jeffery & Katauskas a duty of care more onerous than its obligations under its retainer. 
     
      
    176 I therefore conclude that this aspect of the negligence case against Jeffery & Katauskas must fail. 
     
      
    The proposed amended particulars 
     
      
    177 There is another aspect of the case that, although not expressly raised on the pleadings (subject to an application for leave to amend), must now be considered. That relates to what Rickard Constructions was pleased to call, with some want of accuracy, the “wet weather procedure”: the letter of 3 May 1999 referred to in para [21] above.  
     
      
    178 The amended particulars of breach of duty on which Rickard Constructions sought to rely would allege that: 
     
      
       
      (1) Jeffery & Katauskas failed to warn that the sub-base and base course materials were susceptible to elevated moisture levels and that failure of the pavement was likely unless moisture levels were carefully controlled and maintained prior to sealing (para (b)). 
       
       
      (2) Jeffery & Katauskas recommended that wet areas in the sub-base and base course be proof rolled, but this procedure was not of itself sufficient to detect excessive moisture levels (para (c)).  
       
       
      (3) Jeffery & Katauskas failed to carry out, or recommend that there be carried out, tests of moisture levels in the base and sub-base materials by reference to optimum moisture conditions or appropriate saturation levels (para (d)). 
       
       
      (4) Jeffery & Katauskas failed to carry out, or to recommend that there be carried out, tests of moisture levels immediately before the asphalt layer was placed (para (e)). 
       
      
    179 Although the first and second of these further particulars were not in terms confined to what I will call for convenience the 3 May letter, it appeared from what was said in argument that they were intended to be so limited. With one exception, Jeffery & Katauskas did not oppose the application for leave to add the first and second further particulars. The exception is the reference in each to “sub-base and”. The inclusion of reference to sub-base appears to be inconsistent both with the evidence of Dr Burman and with the joint report of the geotechnical experts. 
     
      
    180 I see no point in granting leave to amend to include an allegation that, on the evidence, must fail. I would therefore grant leave to Rickard Constructions to amend the particulars of negligence to para 31 of its contentions by the addition of paras (b) and (c) as set out in the draft handed up (and summarised above) on the bases that: 
     
      
       
      (1) The words “sub-base and” be deleted from each; 
       
       
      (2) In para (b), the words “in its letter of 3 May 1999” be inserted after the word “warn”; and 
       
       
      (3) The same words be inserted in para (c) after the word “recommended”. 
       
      
    181 The third and fourth proposed particulars are in a different category. The first of them was not foreshadowed in opening. It does not appear to be pressed. In any case, it would appear to allege an obligation to do something far beyond the terms of the retainer: a consideration of particular force bearing in mind the matters to which I have referred in para [168(3), (4)] above. The case is not one that Jeffery & Katauskas should be required to meet relying only on the evidence that has been adduced. In this, it may be contrasted with the case (limited in the way that I have just described) under the first two proposed particulars: that case was advanced in opening and was the subject of evidence. In this case, because the issue was not squarely raised, Jeffery & Katauskas has been deprived of the opportunity to consider how to deal with it. 
     
      
    182 Accordingly, I refuse leave to amend so as to include the third further particular of breach of duty, namely para (d) of the particulars to para 31 in the draft third further amended summons.  
     
      
    183 For essentially the same reasons, I refuse leave to amend in respect of the fourth further particular of breach: namely, that set out in para (e) of the particulars to para 31 in the draft third further amended summons. 
     
      
    The further case of breach 
     
      
    184 Jeffery & Katauskas appears to accept that it owed Rickard Constructions “a duty to advise with care in respect of the matters stated in [the 3 May] letter”: written submissions dated 4 November 2004, para 27(2).  
     
      
    185 There is some conflict as to the genesis of the 3 May letter. Mr Rickard said that there was a meeting on site between himself and Messrs Christopher Potts and Lance Woodworth of Rickard Constructions and David Treweek of Jeffery & Katauskas. Mr Treweek says that the first meeting was on site with Mr Potts and that there was a subsequent meeting in the offices of Jeffery & Katauskas. I prefer Mr Treweek’s version of events. Among other things, the 3 May letter commences “Further to our Thursday 29 April 1999 meeting at our offices”. Mr Rickard could not recall any such meeting. It is unlikely that Mr Treweek would have suggested in the 3 May letter that there was such a meeting if there were not. Further Messrs Potts and Woodworth were not called and no explanation was given for their absence. I draw the usual inference from the unexplained failure to call them on a matter that was in contest. 
     
      
    186 Mr Treweek’s evidence was that, at the site meeting, a number of matters were pointed out to him and discussed (including that rainwater from the buildings under construction was discharging directly onto unsealed but compacted layers of the pavement). He said, and I accept, that he was asked to formalise an advice on certain points, and that this is what he did in the 3 May letter.  
     
      
    187 The letter dealt with a number of issues. One was the proof rolling of the finished sub-base. (Proof rolling is a procedure whereby a heavy self propelled drum roller is passed back and forth across an area of work, to identify areas that are soft or “heaving”. If material is heaving – ie, moving under the pressure imposed by the roller – it indicates that it is excessively moist.) 
     
      
    188 The letter proposed that the entire finished sub-base should be proof rolled and that soft areas should be rectified. Rectification would involve stripping, placing either fresh material or the material that had been stripped after it had dried out, and recompacting. The letter confirmed that all material should be rolled under Jeffery & Katauskas’ supervision prior to placement of the base course. Jeffery & Katauskas were not asked to observe the proof rolling of the sub-base or to advise on the outcome of that proof rolling.  
     
      
    189 The letter also dealt with the base course material. It made a recommendation as to the standard that the material should achieve. Jeffery & Katauskas offered to test the material or to conduct audits; it was not asked to do so.  
     
      
    190 The letter suggested that all non confirming material (ie, material that had already been tested and shown not to meet the required level of compaction) should be retested. Jeffery & Katauskas was not retained to do this. 
     
      
    191 No one from Rickard Constructions suggested that Jeffery & Katauskas was asked to perform any of the tests or geotechnical services referred to in the 3 May letter other than to test the asphalt layer during placement. No one suggested that Jeffery & Katauskas in fact undertook any of the recommended tests, again with the exception of testing of asphalt. 
     
      
    192 Rickard Partners had prepared a quality control procedures document. That document noted that, if the works were affected by wet weather, Rickard Partners could call for field density tests prior to the recommencement of work, but that was only to be done “after prolonged wet weather and after discussion with” Rickard Constructions. There was evidence that Rickard Constructions or Walker Civil Engineering conducted proof rolling of various parts of the work without reference to Jeffery & Katauskas and without requiring representatives of Jeffery & Katauskas to be present. That, no doubt, reflected an implementation of the quality control procedure to which I have referred. (I have not overlooked that there is evidence that Jeffery & Katauskas’ personnel from time to time were present during proof rolling; but there is no evidence to suggest that this was done in pursuance of, or as an implementation of any of the recommendations contained in, the 3 May letter.) 
     
      
    193 In all the circumstances, I do not think that Rickard Constructions owed a duty of care, in relation to the 3 May letter, over and above the specific request of it to advise on the matters outlined in that letter and the advice that it gave in response. Again, the starting point must be the retainer: in this case, the specific requests for advice made in the meetings to which Mr Treweek referred. That, in turn, must be viewed against the background of the prior limited (level 2) retainer of Jeffery & Katauskas. It would be quite inimical to commercial and contractual relations to impose on someone in the position of Rickard Constructions a common law duty of care outside and greater than the scope of its obligations under precise and limited retainers, in relation to the subject matter of the requests in late April 1999. 
     
      
    194 Rickard Constructions did not suggest that, if the retainer as amended were confined in the way that I think it should be, the further particulars of breach (to the extent that I have allowed them) could go to breach of that retainer. In truth, its case was that the retainer was wider, and embraced duties of care which were correlative in extent to the breaches alleged. For the reasons that I have given, I do not think that this case can be sustained. 
     
      
    195 Thus, I do not think that it can be said that Jeffery & Katauskas breached the duty that it owed in respect of the 3 May letter by failing to warn in it that base course materials were susceptible to elevated moisture levels which might result in failure of the pavement. Firstly, that was not something that Jeffery & Katauskas was asked to deal with. Secondly (and this may explain the first point), it was a matter in any event well known to Rickard Constructions. Thirdly, in relation to moisture levels and their impact, the focus of the advice requested, and the procedure outlined in response to that advice, was on the sub-base. I have already said that I would not give leave to amend so as to include an allegation of breach relating to the sub-base; and one of the reasons for this was that, on the expert evidence, moisture levels in the sub-base were not a cause of the failure that occurred. 
     
      
    196 Further, in this context, I think that it is relevant to recollect that, with the exception of testing of asphalt, Jeffery & Katauskas was not retained to carry out any of the services, or tests, that it recommended in the 3 May letter. I find it difficult to understand how a more general case of duty and breach could be made out in circumstances where particular recommendations were effectively ignored. This tempts me to accept the description of this aspect of the plaintiff’s case given by Jeffery & Katauskas (written submissions, para 43) as “an opportunistic re-construction of events which had no contemporaneous support.”  
     
      
    The s 52 case 
     
      
    197 The representations alleged to have been made are that the pavement was being properly constructed, and that the moisture level of the pavement was appropriate to achieve a sound pavement. Neither of those representations was made expressly. Nor, having regard to the limited terms of Jeffery & Katauskas’ retainer, can either of them be said to have been made by implication in all the circumstances.  
     
      
    198 Jeffery & Katauskas was not retained to ensure that the pavement was being properly constructed, or even to ensure that the moisture levels in the pavement were appropriate. If it was not retained to do so, then its performance of the services that it was retained to provide cannot be elevated into representations to the effect alleged.  
     
      
    199 The s 52 case against Jeffery & Katauskas must fail. 
     
      
    The subrogation and contribution claims  
     
      
    200 Rickard Constructions says that, under the 3 May agreement, and by carrying out the rectification works in accordance with that agreement, it made good loss sustained by Mayne; and that the loss was loss for which Rickard Partners or Jeffery & Katauskas would have had to pay because of their breach of conduct, negligence, or misleading or deceptive conduct. In the circumstances, Rickard Constructions says, it is entitled to indemnity or contribution from Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas on one or more of the following bases: 
     
      
       
      (1) Equitable subrogation; 
       
       
      (2) Section 5 of the  
      Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act  
      1946; or 
       
       
      (3) Contribution in equity.  
        
        
        
        
       
      
    201 These are the claims referred to in issues 26, 27, 28 to 31, 54 and 55 to 57.  
     
      
    202 Rickard Constructions did not address these issues in either its written or oral submissions (including its written submissions in reply, filed by leave – although late – after the conclusion of oral submissions). 
     
      
    203 In those circumstances, it might be open to conclude that the issues are not pressed. Whether or not this is so, I do not think that it is appropriate to deal with those issues in the absence of submissions, and I do not propose to do so. The issues will be answered accordingly.

          The whole of the works whether permanent or temporary including all materials incorporated or to be incorporated therein for the performance of the Contract described in the Schedule.

        Exclusions 
        
       
       
        
        The Underwriter will not indemnify the Insured against: 
        
       
       
        
        1. the costs of repairing, replacing or rectifying Insured Property in which there is a fault, defect, error or omission in material or workmanship, but the Underwriter will pay the costs of loss or damage caused directly by such fault, defect, error or omission less the costs which would have been incurred in repairing, replacing or rectifying the faulty or defective material or workmanship immediately prior to the loss or damage occurring. 
        
       
       
        
        2. the costs of repairing, replacing or rectifying Insured Property in which there is a fault, defect, error or omission in design, plan or specification, but the Underwriter will pay the costs of loss or damage caused directly by such fault, defect, error or omission in design, plan or specification less the costs which would have been incurred in repairing, replacing or rectifying the fault, defect, error or omission in design, plan or specification immediately prior to the loss or damage occurring.

        2. Precautions 
         
        The Insured and its employees and agents must at the Insured’s expense: 
        
       
       
        
        2.1 take all reasonable precautions to prevent loss or damage; 
         
         
        … “ 
         
        
       
      
    205 It is clear that the pavement failed either during the construction period or during the maintenance period (cls 1 and 2 of the insuring clause). Since each looks to “sudden and unforeseen physical loss of or damage to Insured Property”, nothing turns on the precise time of the failure. It is also clear that the pavement either was, or formed part of, the Insured Property as defined. 
     
      
    206 As articulated in closing submissions, the questions in dispute between Rickard Constructions and Allianz were: 
     
      
       
      (1) Whether the failure was “sudden”. 
       
       
      (2) Whether the failure was “unforeseen”. 
       
       
      (3) Whether there was a “fault, defect, error or omission in material or workmanship”. 
       
       
      (4) Whether there was a “fault, defect, error or omission in design, plan or specification”. 
       
       
      (5) Whether, if either of the previous issues be answered “yes”, there was any loss over and above “the costs which would have been incurred in repairing, replacing or rectifying” the relevant faulty work or design. 
       
       
      (6) Whether any part of the claim was for consequential loss. 
       
       
      (7) Whether the insured had taken reasonable precautions to prevent loss or damage. 
       
      
    207 I have concluded that there was no defect in design, but that there was defective workmanship. That engages cl 1 of the exclusions. Because I have come to the view that cl 1 affords a complete answer to the claim under the policy, I propose to deal principally with that issue. 
     
      
    208 Before I turn to cl 1 of the exclusions, I will set out in summary form the views to which I have come on the other questions in dispute: 
     
      
       
      (1) The failure of the pavement was “sudden” within the meaning of the insuring clause. 
       
       
      (2) Likewise, it was “unforeseen”. 
       
       
      (3) As I have said, there was. 
       
       
      (4) As I have said, there was not. 
       
       
      (6) No part of the claim against the insurer was a claim for consequential loss; or if it was, then it must fail.  
       
       
      (7) It had. 
       
      
    209 Allianz’ submissions on the first and second issues really depended on its case that there were design defects, and that the failure was a result of those defects (so that it could not be said to be either sudden or unforeseen). Alternatively, Allianz submitted, the failure could not be characterised as unforeseen because Rickard Constructions, or a reasonable and competent civil engineering contractor in its place, should have known or understood or foreseen that the failure was a likely consequence of the practices that I have identified as amounting to defective workmanship. I do not think that this is what “unforeseen” means in the context of the policy. To construe that word as Allianz submits would be, in effect, to limit the insuring clause in the same way that Allianz says its obligations are limited by cl 6 of the exclusions (a matter to which I refer briefly in the next paragraph). If foreseeability of loss is an essential element of liability in negligence, then Allianz’ construction of the word “unforeseen” would mean that the policy could never indemnify Rickard Constructions for the negligent performance of its obligations as a civil engineering contractor.  
     
      
    210 In relation to the last question (para [206(7)]), Allianz conceded that the question was answered against it, at least at first instance, by decisions such as Legal & General Insurance Australia Ltd v Eather (1986) 6 NSWLR 390 and Toikan International Insurance Broking Pty Ltd v Plasteel Windows Australia Pty Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 641. That concession was properly made.    
     
      
    211 The reason why cl 1 of the exclusions affords a complete answer to the claim is simple. Where that clause applies (ie, where its opening words “The costs … workmanship” are engaged), Allianz’ only liability is to pay the costs of loss or damage directly caused by defective workmanship (to use a compendious term) less the costs that would have been incurred in rectifying that defective workmanship immediately prior to the occurrence of loss or damage. 
     
      
    212 The opening words of the clause make it clear that Allianz is not liable for the cost of repairing, replacing or rectifying Insured Property in which there was defective workmanship. It is, however, liable to pay the cost of loss or damage caused directly by that defective workmanship. That liability is limited because there must be subtracted from it the cost that would have been incurred in repairing the defective workmanship immediately prior to the occurrence of the loss. Clearly, when cl 1 of the exclusions is read in conjunction with cl 6, it is apparent that no element of consequential loss is recoverable. 
     
      
    213 In the present case, there is no evidence of “the costs of loss or damage caused directly” by the defective workmanship. Nor is there any evidence of “the costs which would have been incurred in” rectifying that defective workmanship immediately before the occurrence of the loss. Rickard Constructions and Allianz each submitted that the onus of proof of those matters lay on the other. Further, Rickard Constructions submitted, if the onus of proof lay on it, it could be dealt with at a later stage of the hearing. (I deferred the evidence of the quantity surveyors, upon the basis that it might or might not be relevant, and that, if it proved to be relevant, it would be dealt with most effectively by a reference under Pt 72.) 
     
      
    214 The clause is, obviously enough, an exclusion clause. It follows that the onus of proof lies, in the first instance, with Allianz. It is therefore necessary for Allianz to show (on the assumption that the insuring clause has been engaged) that the claim is for, or includes, the cost of repairing Insured Property in which there is defective workmanship. Once that is shown, then, prima facie, Allianz is not liable. If Rickard Constructions, as the insured, contends that Allianz is liable under the following words of cl 1, it is for Rickard Constructions to show that. 
     
      
    215 That onus requires Rickard Constructions to prove: 
     
      
       
      (1) What is the loss or damage caused directly by the defective workmanship. 
       
       
      (2) What are the “costs” of that loss or damage. 
       
       
      (3) What would have been necessary to rectify that defective workmanship immediately prior to the collapse of the pavement. 
       
       
      (4) What costs would have been incurred in that rectification. 
       
      
    216 Rickard Constructions submitted in reply (written submissions in reply dated 16 November 2004, paras 110, 111) that: 
     
      
       
      (1) Rectification of the defective workmanship immediately prior to the collapse of the pavement could have been done simply by permitting the moisture in the base course to dry out.  
       
       
      (2) Alternatively (as put by Mr Thom), that rectification could have been undertaken by removing the asphalt wearing layer, aerating the base course material and replacing and recompacting it, and relaying the asphalt.  
       
      
    217 Rickard Constructions did not explicitly submit that the first alternative would not involve any cost, but it appears to be implicit in the submission, and I proceed upon that basis. It did submit that the second alternative was a matter that had been quantified by its quantity surveyor, Mr Clifford Ventris, and that it could in any event be dealt with by reference or otherwise if there were no agreement. 
     
      
    218 I do not think that the first alternative deals with the issue to which it was addressed, namely, the amount of “the costs which would have been incurred in … rectifying the faulty or defective material or workmanship immediately prior to the loss or damage occurring”. The faulty workmanship that I have found included both the sealing of sections of pavement known to be wet and soft, and the sealing of other sections of pavement that had been subjected to heavy rainfall after compaction and testing and that had not been retested. If drying out of the base course were possible – and, contrary to the submission for Rickard Constructions, I do not think that the expert evidence demonstrated clearly that it was – it would not rectify the defective workmanship. It would, at most, overcome (to some greater or lesser extent) the consequences. 
     
      
    219 Dr Burman was the most enthusiastic advocate of “drying out”. To some extent, he was supported in this by Messrs Thom and Leventhal. Messrs Marshall and Waddell were of the view that drying out was both impractical and unlikely, in any event, to cure the problem.  
     
      
    220 The first difficulty with drying out is that it required the pavement to remain unused for an indeterminate period of time. The period of time would be indeterminate because, without taking up the pavement, the success of the process could only be ascertained by indirect testing such as Benkelman beam tests. (If repeated Benkelman beam testing showed no, or acceptable limits of, deflection, then, perhaps it could be inferred that the base course had dried out adequately.) This would have meant denying Mayne the use of the container depot. Rickard Constructions submitted that this was the result in any event, because it took some considerable time for the defective pavement to be repaired. That may be so. But it is not difficult to imagine that if Mayne were faced with a choice between delay occasioned by digging up, relaying and resealing the pavement (with appropriate attention paid to keeping it dry, and to testing it before it was sealed) on the one hand, and an indeterminate wait with an uncertain outcome on the other, it would have chosen the former course. 
     
      
    221 Another difficulty with the concept of drying out is not only that it is indeterminate in time, it is also dependent to some extent on weather conditions. Thus where (as was the case) there was prolonged heavy rain during the putative drying out period, the evidence suggests that drying out would have been at the very least delayed, and perhaps rendered impossible. It is for this reason that, at a technical level, Messrs Thom and Leventhal did not support drying out with the same enthusiasm as did Dr Burman. I think it is fair to say that Messrs Thom and Leventhal regarded drying out as a theoretical, rather than practical, solution.  
     
      
    222 More fundamentally, Rickard Constructions has not attempted to address the first two elements described in para [215] above. That seems to reflect what in my view is its incorrect construction of cl 1 of the exclusions. Rickard Constructions said (written submission in reply, pars 105 to 107): 
     
      
       
        
        “105. The intent of the exclusion clause is to provide for the possibility that an insured event may result in RC being compensated for losses that it would have suffered even if the insured event had not occurred. To put this another way, the clause makes provision against RC getting the advantage of making good defects in construction or in design which would have to be made good even if the insured event did not occur. The exclusion clauses are intended to operate to ensure that RC does not get that benefit so that the costs that would always have been incurred in making good defects in design or construction are not cast on Allianz. 
        
       
       
        
        106. Therefore, the exclusion clauses embody the following concepts: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the cost of repairing, replacing or rectifying any fault, defect, error or omission in material workmanship or design of the Pavement; 
           
           
          (b) the costs of loss or damage caused directly by the fault, defect, error or omission; 
           
           
          (c) the costs which would have been incurred in repairing, replacing or rectifying the faulty or defective material, or the error or omission in the design. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        107. In order to determine the costs that are excluded by (item (a)) above, it becomes necessary to determine the nature of any defect or omission that exists in the pavement. The costs in rectifying that deficiency are costs that would likely have been incurred, and are excluded.” 
        
       
      
    223 In my judgment, that construction of the clause – particularly, the proposition advanced in para 106(a) set out above – is incorrect. The clause does not “embody”, as the description or character of the excluded liability, the cost of rectifying defective workmanship or design (to summarise sub para (a)). It excludes liability for “the costs of … rectifying Insured Property in which there is a fault, defect, error or omission in material or workmanship” (emphasis supplied). The present claim is, precisely, one for the cost of rectifying Insured Property – the pavement – in which there was, or that was affected by, defective workmanship. That is clearly something greater than what Allianz will pay (namely, “the cost of loss or damage caused directly by such” defective workmanship); and that in turn is diminished further by the following words (“less the cost which would have been incurred in … rectifying the … defective … workmanship immediately prior to the loss or damage occurring”).   
     
      
    224 Drying out – a process that (if it worked at all) would take some months of fine weather to achieve - could not rectify the defective workmanship immediately prior to the failure of the pavement. As a matter of logic, the rectification of the defective workmanship immediately prior to the loss would have entailed the testing of the pavement by some appropriate method (such as the Benkelman beam test referred to frequently in the course of the evidence) to observe and quantify the extent to which it was defective. The Benkelman beam test does this because it measures the extent to which the pavement deflects under load. Once the defective pavement had been identified, rectification would have required the removal of the wearing layer and the underlying layers, and the placement of fresh (or dried out) fill for the sub-base and base course layers and the compacting of those layers to the appropriate specification. Finally, it would have required the replacement of the asphalt wearing course.  
     
      
    225 There is no reason for thinking that the costs of that (hypothetical) exercise would have been in any way significantly different to the costs actually incurred in repairing the failed pavement.  
     
      
    226 But it is not for this reason that the claim must fail. If that were the extent of the problem then, bearing in mind that consideration of the evidence of the quantity surveyors has been deferred, I would not think it appropriate to find against Rickard Constructions on that limited basis. The problem is a deeper one. As I have said, Rickard Constructions has not proved the matter referred to in para [215(1)] above. But it is this which is the starting point of the determination of any entitlement that Rickard Constructions may have once it is shown (as it has been shown) that the exclusion clause has been engaged. That is not a question of quantification. It is a matter of identifying what it is to be quantified. The evidence for Rickard Constructions simply does not do that, and so the question of quantification does not arise.  
     
      
    227 Further, if I am correct in concluding as well that Rickard Constructions has not identified the matter referred to in para [215(3)] above (see paras [216] and [217] above), then it has failed to identify the other essential component of its entitlement. The claim must fail for this reason also, and again, not as a matter of quantification only.  
     
      
    228 Accordingly, I conclude that the claim against Allianz must fail. 
     
      
    Damage 
     
      
    229 In view of the conclusion to which I have come, it is not necessary for me to deal with the question of damage. However, I shall set out briefly the findings that I would have made had it been necessary to do so.  
     
      
    230 The quantification of the cost of rectification of the pavement has been deferred, to be dealt with by an order for reference under Pt 72, should it be necessary to do so. It is not. 
     
      
    231 The other aspect of the claim was for the damages suffered by Mayne. 
     
      
    232 The components of the claim were identified and discussed by the relevant witnesses, Mr John Klepec (an employee of Mayne, called by Rickard Constructions) and Mr Alexander Penklis (an independent expert, called by Rickard Partners and Jeffery & Katauskas). 
     
      
    233 The first issue related to the first element of the claim: an amount claimed by Mayne to have been payable to a third party pursuant to a deed of settlement. The witnesses were agreed (and, so far as I understood it, the parties by whom they were called were agreed) that the dispute was only whether the amount was $1,200,000 (as asserted by Mr Klepec) or $982,008.70 (as asserted by Mr Penklis). 
     
      
    234 The amount expressed by the deed to be payable was the latter (lower) figure. Mr Klepec’s contention was that the settlement amount agreed was in fact the former (higher) figure, but that the third party was indebted to Mayne for the difference between the two figures of $217,991.35 (the difference of 5 cents is not one on which I propose to spend a deal of time). Mr Klepec reached that conclusion by reference to a without prejudice letter. The letter was tendered. I rejected the tender. The deed was tendered. The deed proves the lower amount. The deed does not show that the lower amount was reached after offsetting the amount of $217,991.35 against the higher amount. In my judgment, the amount to be allowed (should it become necessary to do so) is the lower amount, namely $982,008.70. 
     
      
    235 The next element of the claim was a amount of $686,592, said to be rent foregone by Mayne in respect of premises that, because it could not have access to the container depot when planned, it continued to use. Proof of liability for and quantification of this amount depended on what was called in submissions “the Truong e-mail” (an e-mail from Mr Thanh Truong of Mayne to Mr Klepec dated 19 October 2000, marked for identification 4 in the proceedings). I rejected the tender of that e-mail. It follows that this item is not proved.  
     
      
    236 Items 3 and 4 related to the cost of leasing alternative premises. They were in the amounts of $57,931 and $209,232 respectively. I am satisfied that they were incurred and should be allowed. 
     
      
    237 The fifth item was for the construction of a temporary fumigation pad. The amount claimed was $24,227. It was agreed that this amount was substantiated. However, it was shown to be a claim by MPG Logistics, not a claim by Mayne Nickless.  
     
      
    238 Items 6 to 14 relate to a number of additional costs said to have been incurred. They total $468,728. The evidence relied upon to prove them was the Truong e-mail. Because that document was not admitted into evidence, these claims are not made good.  
     
      
    239 Item 15, in the sum of $199,950, related to management costs. It was not pressed and would therefore not be allowed.  
     
      
    240 Item 16 relates to consultants’ fees. It was agreed in the sum of $57,980. It is another MPG Logistics’ claim.  
     
      
    241 Item 17 related to flights said to have been undertaken in the course of the rectification works. The amount claimed is $30,000 (said by Mr Klepec to be a conservative estimate). In my judgment, Mr Klepec’s evidence at T 320 and following – which was effectively unchallenged – is sufficient to justify this claim. I am comforted by this in Mr Penklis’ acknowledgment that he has “sighted invoices in excess of the amount claimed”. He said that the issue was “the purpose of the trips”. I am satisfied, as I have said, that Mr Klepec’s evidence demonstrates the purpose of the trips sufficiently to enable this item to be claimed. It, too, is a claim of MPG Logistics.  
     
      
    Conclusions 
     
      
    242 I return to the issues set out in para [11] above. Before I answer them, I wish to note that the resolution of the issues has been made difficult by the failure of (in particular) Rickard Constructions to address them specifically. The whole point in requiring the parties to agree upon the real issues in dispute is to focus the evidence, the submissions and the decision. Where parties do not address the issues directly and clearly, the Court’s task in resolving the dispute is rendered more difficult. I do not regard it as appropriate for a party, having participated in the process of agreeing the real issues in dispute, to formulate its submissions on a different and less readily comprehensible basis. Not only does this make the task of analysis and resolution more difficult, it leads to a risk that issues will be overlooked, and that time will be wasted in addressing issues that, although not formally conceded, are not in reality pressed. The Court should not have to struggle, at the end of four weeks of evidence, to understand the case that a party seeks to make and the evidence by which it seeks to prove that case. But that is the result of a failure to address specifically and seriatim the issues that have been articulated by agreement. 
     
      
    243 I answer the issues set out in para [11] above as follows: 
     
      
        
       
      1A. What was the cause of the failure of the Pavement and in particular was the failure of the Pavement attributable to: 
       
       
      (a) any design deficiency of the pavement of the type identified in the joint expert’s report; 
       
       
      (b) excessive quantities of moisture in the Pavement as a result of entry of moisture during the construction of the Pavement; 
       
       
      (c) any other aspect of the manner of construction of the Pavement. 
       
       
      Answer:  
      The pavement failed because of the build-up of excessive pore pressures in the base course material. That occurred because the base course became excessively wet as the result of the entry of moisture (due to rainfall) during the construction of the pavement. 
       
       
      1B. Was there physical loss of or damage to Insured Property and, if so, when? 
       
       
      Answer:  
      Yes. It occurred when the pavement failed immediately after it was put into service and loaded by the operation of heavy forklift vehicles.  
       
       
      1C. Was there a fault, defect, error or omission in design, plan or specification? 
       
       
      Answer:  
      No. 
       
       
      1D. Was there a fault, defect, error or omission in material or workmanship? 
       
       
      Answer:  
      Yes. 
       
       
      1E. What were the costs of loss or damage caused by fault, defect, error or omission in design, plan or specification? 
       
       
      Answer:  
      Not applicable. 
       
       
      1F. What were the costs of loss or damage caused by fault, defect, error or omission in workmanship or material? 
       
       
      Answer:  
      Not proven. 
       
       
      1G. What were the costs of loss or damage which would have been incurred in repairing, replacing or rectifying the fault, defect, error or omission in design or specification immediately prior to the loss or damage occurring? 
       
       
      Answer:  
      Not applicable.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 McCOLL JA: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed by Christie DCJ on 31 July 2003 at the Sydney District Court. 
     
      
    2 The applicant pleaded guilty to two charges, one of importing not less than the trafficable quantity of 3,4 Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (“MDMA” or “ecstasy”), namely 169.8 grams, contrary to s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and the other of importing Tier 1 goods, namely anabolic steroids without approval contrary to s 233BAA(4) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). As will appear, the sentencing judge found that the applicant would have sold some part of the ecstasy. In those circumstances, the maximum penalty for the s 233B offence was a fine not exceeding 5000 penalty units or 25 years imprisonment, or both: s 235 Customs Act 1901 (Cth). 
     
      
    3 The applicant was sentenced to five years and three months imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and six months in respect of the first matter and a fixed term of imprisonment of three months in respect of the second. The fixed term was concurrent with the first sentence. It dated from 21 September 2002 and had already been served by the date the sentence was imposed.4 The applicant was apprehended at Sydney Airport with the ecstasy on his return to Australia with a co-offender, Salcedo, who was also carrying ecstasy secreted on his person. Salcedo was sentenced before the applicant. To a large extent the appeal turns upon the application of the parity principle although with a degree of novelty derived from the circumstances in which the applicant’s co-offender was sentenced. 
     
      
       
      Background 
      
    5 On 22 August 2002 the applicant and Salcedo booked tickets on a Qantas flight to Paris departing the next day. Salcedo paid cash of $5,050 for both tickets. 
     
      
    6 The two men flew out of Sydney on 23 August 2002. Their original return date was extended twice. While they were overseas three money orders in the amount of $6,000, $6,600 and $4,600 respectively were sent from Australia to Salcedo. The sentencing judge found that all the money orders came from funds provided by Salcedo. 
     
      
    7 The two men returned to Sydney on 21 September 2002. Customs Officers searched them. The search of the applicant revealed that he had three packages containing tablets strapped to his body, one in the groin area and two on the lower part of his legs. The search of Salcedo revealed that he, too, had three packages containing tablets taped to his legs with brown coloured packaging tape.  
     
      
    8 The packages carried by both the applicant and Salcedo concealed a number of pink and blue coloured tablets within opaque, white coloured plastic bags bound with brown coloured packaging tape. Indicative field tests undertaken by the Australian Customs Service (“ACS”) indicated the presence of ecstasy. 
     
      
    9 The gross weight of the contents of the packages was 684.2 grams. Australian Forensic Drug Laboratories results indicated that the estimated total weight of pure MDMA found on the applicant was 169.8 grams. The total weight of pure MDMA found on Salcedo was 169.9 grams. 
     
      
    10 Australian Federal Police estimated that the 684.2 grams (gross weight) of the contents of the packages was the equivalent of about 3,000 tablets of ecstasy. They estimated that the street value of such tablets at about the time the applicant was sentenced was AUD$150,000 or AUD$50.00 per tablet. 
     
      
    11 In order to appreciate the applicant’s challenge to his sentence it is necessary to understand the somewhat unusual circumstances in which Salcedo’s sentence was determined. In short, that sentence was first imposed on 1 April 2003 then revised on 31 July 2003. 
     
      
      Salcedo’s first sentence 
      
    12 On 1 April 2003 Salcedo appeared for sentence before Christie DCJ having pleaded guilty to importing not less than the trafficable quantity of MDMA contrary to s 233B of the Customs Act. He also pleaded guilty to one count of using an Australian passport issued to another person for the purpose of travel contrary to s 9A of the Passports Act 1938 (Cth). 
     
      
    13 The sentencing judge inferred that when the two offenders travelled overseas their original intention was to holiday together and that the idea of importing the ecstasy tablets had occurred to them during the trip when they visited Amsterdam. 
     
      
    14 The sentencing judge noted that the applicant and Salcedo “entered in fairly quick fashion the drug world of Amsterdam” and …that “he and his co-offender were having … a ‘spree’ in Amsterdam”.  
     
      
    15 He found that the offenders became aware in Amsterdam that they could purchase ecstasy tablets for about $2 a tablet and that it was the “attraction” between the cost of the tablets in Amsterdam and their cost in Australia (“somewhat closer to $50”) which led the offenders to purchase about 6,000 tablets. They used the money which had been sent to Salcedo in the three money orders to purchase the drugs. 
     
      
    16 The sentencing judge found both the applicant and Salcedo were principals and not couriers, that they were importing the ecstasy tablets for their own use or joint use but that there was an inescapable inference that some of the tablets would have been sold upon the market at least to finance in part the moneys Salcedo had outlaid. 
     
      
    17 The sentencing judge concluded that while Salcedo’s role was that of a principal and that there was financial gain to be made, “to a very large degree this importation was intended to supply [Salcedo] and his co-offender with a source of this drug for their own use”. 
     
      
    18 His Honour accepted that Salcedo was “not a commercial drug dealer in the sense that he is not a person who set about making a very large profit, quick easy money in respect of this type of importation.” However, while accepting that the purchase of the tablets was “not a planned commercial activity”, the sentencing judge also found it was “undeniable” that there was “a commercial and semi-trafficable element in the purchase of such a large number of tablets”. 
     
      
    19 The sentencing judge accepted that the passport offence was a very serious one, although it paled “into insignificance in terms of likely penalty” in comparison with the principal offence. 
     
      
    20 Having referred to comparative sentences and taking into account Salcedo’s early plea, his co-operation with authorities and the fact he had served some time in protective custody, the sentencing judge thought a head sentence of seven years was appropriate. He then considered subjective factors. 
     
      
    21 Of the subjective matters to which the sentencing judge referred, it is important to note that he accepted that the “particular offence” (I assume his Honour was referring to the importation charge) was “completely out of character with the prisoner”. He took the view that it was unlikely Salcedo would commit “an offence of this nature or any other in the future”. Because of this, the sentencing judge said he would “deal with the matter as leniently as the circumstances permit”. He then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having looked at all of the subjective circumstances … I have with some reservation convinced myself that that head sentence should be reduced to six years but having done that I do not believe there is anything else I can do for the prisoner unless I passed a sentence that would not reflect the gravity of the particular offence.” 
        
       
      
    22 The sentencing judge then sentenced Salcedo to imprisonment for six years to date from 21 September 2002 (the date Salcedo was arrested at Sydney Airport) with a non-parole period of four years. In respect of the passport offence, the sentencing judge sentenced Salcedo to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years which was the maximum term, to be served concurrently with the first sentence. 
     
      
       
      Resentencing Salcedo 
      
    23 The statement of facts presented to the sentencing judge on 1 April 2003 by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (the “Commonwealth DPP”) alleged that the amount of pure ecstasy the subject of the charge against Salcedo was 339.7 grams. That was the total net amount of pure ecstasy contained in the tablets the two offenders had imported between them. The Crown relied upon the total weight of the pure ecstasy on the basis the two offenders had been involved in a joint criminal enterprise to import the tablets. Salcedo’s legal representatives did not contest that proposition. 
     
      
    24 After Salcedo had been sentenced on 1 April 2003, the Commonwealth DPP applied to have the matter relisted before the sentencing judge. This was because the Commonwealth DPP had apparently formed the view that the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) did not allow for the application of the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise. When the matter was relisted the Commonwealth DPP submitted that Salcedo should be resentenced on the basis that he had imported only the quantity of pure ecstasy in the tablets strapped to his body, namely 169.9 grams.  
     
      
    25 Christie DCJ accepted the Commonwealth DPP’s submission that he should resentence Salcedo for importing the smaller amount of ecstasy. He reviewed the remarks he had made in sentencing Salcedo for the first time. In considering what Salcedo’s revised sentence should be, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I considered it at some length because I am concerned and  
        I was concerned a little time after I passed sentence upon Mr Salcedo, that he received the benefit of a – quite frankly – a significantly lighter sentence than some members of the community might think appropriate.  
         But that is water under the bridge – I am more firmly of that view now than I ever was – but it is water under the bridge. I did say at that time that having done what I did, I do not believe there is anything else I can do for the prisoner unless I passed a sentence that would not reflect the gravity of the particular offence. 
        
       
       
        
        So I ask myself if he was sentenced on that basis whether there is any room to interfere with Mr Salcedo’s sentence, bearing in mind that I hold the view that  
        the sentence he received could be considered in some sections of the community, as over lenient in any event. 
         I have convinced myself again, with some significant reservation, that it is possible that Mr Salcedo might justifiably entertain a genuine sense of grievance if in fact his sentence was not at least marginally ameliorated by reason of the fact that he had been sentenced on the basis of a joint importation with Mr PHA, at least having regard to the quantity that he brought here. I feel that I, in ameliorating a sentence – and I shall only do it quite marginally – but  
        in ameliorating his sentence, I am fast approaching a stage where the sentence may not sufficiently reflect the objective criminality that the offence disclosed. 
        
       
       
        
        Nevertheless, the previous sentence was 6 years from 21 September 2002 to 20 September 2008, with a non-parole period of 4 years from 21 September 2002 to 20 September 2006. A parole period of 2 years from 21 September 2006 to 20 September 2008. So that if I am to adjust it for half of the quantity imported, that is half of the quantity that I earlier quoted from my remarks on 1 April, which can be found at page 2 of those remarks, I feel that there would be some justification for moderately adjusting the sentence, having regard to the fact that the volume imported is a relevant factor. Not the only factor of course, but it is a factor. 
        
       
       
        
        Now the Crown having abandoned that principle of common purpose as I say, in terms of this sentencing procedure for very good reason and indeed one of my brother judges so decided some time ago and nobody contests that that is the correct approach, I propose to reduce the prisoner Salcedo’s sentence by 3 months.” 
        
       
      
    26 He than resentenced Salcedo to 5 years and 9 months from 21 September 2002 to 20 June 2008. He reduced his non-parole period by 3 months to 3 years and 9 months from 21 September 2002 to 20 June 2006.  
     
      
       
      Remarks on the applicant’s sentence 
      
    27 The applicant was sentenced on the same day the sentencing judge resentenced Salcedo. The sentencing judge “notionally included” his remarks on Salcedo’s sentence in his sentencing remarks in relation to the applicant, no doubt in recognition of the parity principle – that having been the principal issue debated before him. 
     
      
    28 The sentencing judge noted that the applicant entered a plea of guilty to both charges at the earliest opportunity. 
     
      
    29 He concluded that he should proceed to sentence the applicant on the same basis as Salcedo insofar as he considered that the men had only decided to bring back the ecstasy after they arrived in Amsterdam. He also accepted that the applicant was a principal, like Salcedo, and not a courier.  
     
      
    30 In sentencing the applicant, however, the sentencing judge said that he had been in error in finding in connection with Salcedo’s sentence that “to a very large degree, this importation was intended to supply [Salcedo] and his co-offender with a source of this drug for his own use”. That was because, having read some of the remarks made by the applicant in his record of interview, his Honour concluded that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [T]he real motivation for this importation, or the significant portion of the motivation was a quick turnover of money and the consequent profits used to alleviate what [the applicant] perceived to be his pressing indebtedness.” 
        
       
      
    31 Having made what he frankly acknowledged was an error in favour of Salcedo, his Honour determined that he had to perpetuate that error in favour of the applicant “because it would be quite improper of me to take a different view now in sentencing [the applicant].”  
     
      
    32 His Honour also said that, as with Salcedo, he proposed to deal with the matter “as leniently as the circumstances permit, but consistent with one’s duty to the community, that this type of offence must in all circumstances be discouraged and penalties passed that are commensurate with the gravity of the crime”. He observed that “[t]he objective seriousness of this crime could not be overstated”. 
     
      
    33 In dealing with the applicant’s subjective circumstances, the sentencing judge noted that he was entitled to significant consideration because of the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty, it having been made at the earliest opportunity and reflecting a “genuine feeling of contrition and remorse”.  
     
      
    34 His Honour then turned to consider whether the applicant was entitled to any amelioration of the sentence that had been passed upon Salcedo by reason of two matters. The first was the contents of Ex H which referred to some assistance the applicant had afforded authorities. The sentencing judge concluded that that evidence entitled the applicant to “some marginal consideration” and “affected the sentence to be passed, but not by…a significant degree”. The second matter was that it was Salcedo’s money, not the applicant’s, which had financed the enterprise. 
     
      
    35 The sentencing judge concluded that in terms of the criminality exhibited in relation to the offences, any differentiation between the applicant and Salcedo was “pretty marginal”. He accepted that neither man was a commercial drug runner and that neither entered upon the importation of narcotics on a regular basis or moved in “the drug milieu”. 
     
      
    36 He accepted that the applicant’s offence was completely out of character. He concluded that the applicant’s subjective circumstances were “marginally more compelling” than Salcedo’s. That was partly because of some material concerning the applicant’s wife. He took into account the matters to which s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) required the Court to have regard when passing sentence which, in his view, “marginally favour [the applicant] when compared to Salcedo” as did the contents of Ex H. 
     
      
    37 His Honour then listed a number of documents which had been placed before him, the contents of all of which he said he had taken into consideration in determining the sentence. 
     
      
    38 His Honour then referred to the constraints under which, in his view, he was operating, both by reference to the parity principle as well as the circumstance that he had already had to adjust Salcedo’s sentence to a level where it may not sufficiently reflect the objective criminality of the offence.  
     
      
    39 He concluded that he had to make the same adjustment in favour of the applicant as he had made in favour of Salcedo as well as a further marginal adjustment having regard to the matters particularly relevant to the applicant’s circumstances. Having referred to those matters, however, his Honour was of the view that he could not make any further adjustment without passing a sentence that would not reflect the gravity of the particular offence and its objective criminality. Indeed, his Honour expressed the view that he thought the sentence he was about to pass probably fell short of the latter requirement but having sentenced Salcedo on that basis, he did not believe there was any other course he could adopt. 
     
      
    40 His Honour then proceeded to impose the sentence I have already set out. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
      
    41 The application relies upon three grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      1. That the sentencing judge erred in determining that the sentence of the co-offender, Jerry Salcedo, to which the sentencing judge had regard in applying the parity principle, should be reduced by three months from six years to five years nine months in order to reflect the change in the particulars of the offence for which he was being sentenced, that change being a reduction in the quantity of the drugs imported from 340 grams to 170 grams of ecstasy. 
       
       
      2. That the sentencing judge erred in determining that the applicant’s sentence should be the same as that of his co-offender where the evidence established that Salcedo’s role in the overall criminal enterprise was clearly more culpable than that of the applicant. 
       
       
      3. That the sentencing judge erred in determining that the sentence to be imposed on the applicant should only be reduced, by reason of his significant degree of cooperation with and assistance to the authorities, by six months as to the overall sentence, representing a reduction of 8.7%, and by three months as to the non-parole period, representing a reduction of 6.6%. 
       
       
      The applicant’s submissions 
      Ground 1 
       
      
    42 The premise upon which the first ground of appeal was based related to the starting point for the application of the parity principle. The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge had been correct in considering that a sentence of six years with a non-parole period of four years was appropriate for Salcedo in relation to the charge relating to 340 grams of ecstasy but that his Honour had erred in reducing that sentence only to five years and nine months in relation to the lesser amount of 169.9 grams of ecstasy. The applicant submitted that the reduction in the pure quantity of drugs imported from 339.7 grams to 169.9 grams was a matter of “real significance” in determining the appropriate penalty. The applicant argued that Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 demonstrated that quantity was a “very important consideration in drug importation”. The applicant submitted that the reduction was insufficiently large, taking into account the “significantly different level of criminality involved”.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
      
    43 The second ground focussed expressly on the parity principle. In essence the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge erred by treating the two offenders as people who were effectively equivalent. He contended he had been denied an entitlement to be dealt with on sentence more favourably than Salcedo. 
     
      
    44 The applicant submitted that there were a number of matters which should have led the sentencing judge to draw a “real distinction” between the two offenders. He contended that it was apparent that Salcedo was the instigator of the activity in the sense that he invited the applicant to accompany him overseas. He pointed out that Salcedo was slightly older than the applicant although he acknowledged that that was not a matter of great significance. He pointed out that Salcedo had paid for both plane tickets as well as for the drugs that were imported. Thus, in addition to being the instigator, he submitted that Salcedo was the financier.  
     
      
    45 He submitted that the person who paid entirely for the drugs was the person who, in the normal course of events of this kind, would stand to benefit more substantially than the person who paid nothing. 
     
      
    46 In addition to those matters, the applicant submitted that his subjective circumstances entitled him to more favourable consideration than Salcedo.  
     
      
      Ground 3 
      
    47 The applicant submitted that Ex H disclosed he had given the authorities a very high level of assistance which should have attracted a discount in the order of 50% of his sentence. He submitted that he had legitimate reason to think that the risks he had taken and the dangers to which he had subjected himself and members of his family had not been recognised by the “miniscule reduction” that he had received. He submitted that when the level of assistance he had afforded was rewarded with such a marginal refinement of the overall sentence, no encouragement was given to offenders in the future to cooperate in the manner in which he had.  
     
      
    48 The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge appeared to have concluded he was inhibited from granting any but a marginal reduction in the applicant’s sentence because of s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) which relates to the power to reduce penalties for assistance provided to law enforcement authorities. He submitted that there was “plenty of scope” for the sentence to have been reduced “significantly further”. He referred to R v Bourchas [2002] NSWCCA 373; (2002) 133 A Crim R 413 where a person closely involved in the importation of 17.1 kilograms of pure heroin was ultimately sentenced to imprisonment for five and half years with a non-parole period of three years after allowing significant discounts for his assistance to authorities.49 The applicant submitted that his offence was not as serious as that committed by Bourchas. He argued that the sentencing judge was wrong to say that he had “very little room to move” in adjusting the sentence to be imposed on the applicant to meet the seriousness of the offence he had committed but at the same time by taking into consideration his “very valuable assistance”.  
     
      
      The Crown’s submissions 
       
       
      Ground 1 
      
    50 The Crown took issue with the applicant’s reliance upon Wong v R, above, to submit that “quantity is a very important consideration in drug importation offences”. The Crown drew attention to the passage, in the joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ (at [67] – [70]) where their Honours concluded that to select “weight of narcotic as the chief factor to be taken into account in fixing a sentence represents a departure from fundamental principle”. The Crown pointed out that their Honours also emphasised that there would be many cases in which a sentencing judge would be more concerned to identify the level of the offender’s criminality by looking to the state of the offender’s knowledge about the importation in which he or she was involved. 
     
      
    51 The Crown also referred to submissions made by Mr Byrne SC who appeared on behalf of the applicant before the sentencing judge and in this Court. Mr Byrne SC had said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… realistically the fact that it’s half the quantity is not going to cut the sentence in half, it’s going to shave something off to recognise that …”. 
        
       
      
    52 The Crown submitted that in fixing the appropriate sentence the sentencing judge properly had regard to s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which required him to “impose a sentence … that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence”. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
      
    53 The Crown again drew attention to submissions made by Mr Byrne SC at the sentencing hearing that the applicant’s criminality was “slightly less than that of Mr Salcedo in relation to the charge of importing the ecstasy” and that “the less(er) criminality of this prisoner should be reflected in a marginal reduction from the sentence that was imposed on Mr Salcedo”. 
     
      
    54 The Crown submitted, in effect, that in the light of those submissions it was not open to the applicant to assert that the sentencing judge’s finding that the difference in culpability between the two offenders was “marginal” could be criticised. 
     
      
    55 The Crown also contended there was no evidence that Salcedo was the instigator. It pointed out that the sentencing judge had proceeded on the basis advanced at the sentencing hearing that both offenders had decided to undertake the importation when they were in Amsterdam. 
     
      
    56 The Crown also challenged the applicant’s submission that it was “inevitable” that Mr Salcedo would obtain the largest share of any profit to be gained. The Crown drew attention to the fact that there was no evidence about what was to happen to the profits. During oral submissions it drew attention to the applicant’s record of interview, in which he said he was to get half the proceeds of the sale of the ecstasy. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
      
    57 The Crown submitted that the assistance demonstrated by Ex H was not such as would attract a discount in the order of 50%. The Crown drew attention to R v Barrientos [1999] NSWCCA 1 at [47] where Abadee J (with whom Sheller JA agreed, as did Hulme J on this point) pointed out that there was no “fixed tariff” for any discount to a sentence in respect of assistance given to authorities and that where it could be concluded that there was “significant assistance”, the range in New South Wales was from 20% to 50%. 
     
      
    58 The Crown also referred to R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 232 where Gleeson CJ pointed out that when discounts were provided on sentence for assistance, care should nevertheless be taken to ensure “that the ultimate sentencing result …is not one that is so far out of touch with the circumstances of the particular offence and the particular offender that, even understood in the light of the considerations of policy which support the principle set out above, it constitutes an affront to community standards”. 
     
      
    59 The Crown submitted that even if the sentencing judge made any of the errors relied upon by the applicant the sentences imposed were, nevertheless, such that the Court would not conclude that another, less severe, sentence was warranted. 
     
      
    60 First, the Crown drew attention to the fact that the sentencing judge had made a number of findings which were very favourable to the applicant. These included sentencing the applicant on the basis that he was of prior good character whereas, in fact, the applicant had prior convictions. 
     
      
    61 Secondly, the Crown drew attention to the fact that the sentencing judge allowed the applicant the benefit of his conclusion in the Salcedo matter that the importation was intended to supply the two men with a source of drug for their own use, contrary to his conclusion that the men in fact intended to sell the tablets for profit. 
     
      
    62 Thirdly, the Crown drew attention to the fact that the sentencing judge had imposed a wholly concurrent term of imprisonment for the applicant’s importation of steroids. The three packages of steroids which the applicant had sent to Australia using false sender names had an estimated value of $196,000. The Crown noted that the sentencing judge appeared to have accepted the applicant’s assertion that the steroids were for his personal use, but pointed out that clinical notes produced on the applicant’s behalf indicated that he was receiving one injection of Sustanon 250mg per week and that at that rate, the steroids he imported, at 1 vial per injection, would have lasted him about 9.4 years. 
     
      
    63 Finally, the Crown criticised the applicant’s reliance upon R v Bourchas. It drew attention to R v Shepherd [2003] NSWCCA 287; (2003) 142 A Crim R 101 where Howie J (with whom Tobias JA and Shaw J agreed) criticised this practice and observed that at the end of the day each sentence was determined “by the particular facts and circumstances of the matter before the Court when viewed against the legislative regime for sentencing an offence of that type”.  
     
      
    64 The Crown drew attention to the range of sentences in respect of ecstasy matters such as that set out by Hulme J in R v Schofield [2003] NSWCCA 3; (2003) 138 A Crim R 19 and submitted that, by comparison with those sentences, the sentence imposed on the applicant for the ecstasy matter was well within the range properly open to the sentencing judge. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
      
    65 When this matter was first called on, the Court put to Mr Byrne SC that the first ground of appeal amounted to a collateral attack on Salcedo’s sentence. Mr Byrne SC accepted that that was so and also informed the Court that Salcedo had lodged an application for leave to appeal against his sentence. While Mr Byrne SC submitted that there were cases where people who were co-offenders had had their appeals dealt with separately, he acknowledged that there were few where the first ground of appeal sought to challenge the sentence of the co-offender as its founding premise. 
     
      
    66 Mr Byrne SC accepted that his starting point had to be to demonstrate that Salcedo’s sentence was manifestly excessive, in order, as I understood his submission, to obtain what I might term the flow-on effect which would follow by reason of the parity principle. 
     
      
    67 In such circumstances the Court heard the appeal but determined that it should not dispose of it until Salcedo’s appeal had been heard and determined.  
     
      
    68 The Court has now determined that appeal (R v Salcedo [2004] NSWCCA 430) and determined that it should be dismissed. In such circumstances the applicant’s first ground of appeal cannot succeed and should be rejected. 
     
      
    69 Turning to ground 2, I would reject the applicant’s submission that there was a real distinction between the two offenders. First, having regard to the sentencing judge’s finding (which was not challenged) that the idea of purchasing the ecstasy was conceived in Amsterdam, it is of little moment that it was Salcedo who invited the applicant to accompany him overseas. In other words, on the sentencing judge’s findings of fact, they departed contemplating a conventional overseas holiday. Furthermore, there did not appear to be any evidence as to who conceived the idea of purchasing the ecstasy once in Amsterdam. 
     
      
    70 Turning to ground 3, it might be noted that the applicant’s submission that the sentencing judge had reduced his head sentence by 8.7% and his non-parole period by 6.6% to reflect the assistance he had afforded authorities was based on his counsel’s interpretation of the judgment. The sentencing judge did not specify the discount he allowed in this regard, a matter of which the applicant made no complaint. 
     
      
    71 The applicant’s submission that his assistance should have been rewarded with a reduction in the order of 50% was, I infer, a reference to the range of 20% to 50% said to be “normally appropriate for assistance”: see R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162 at [71] per Howie J (with whom Simpson and Bell JJ agreed). It should be noted, however, that this Court has emphasised that there is no fixed tariff for assistance: see R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 255 per Hunt J and Badgery-Parker J (with whom Mahoney JA generally agreed); R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 234 per Hunt J; R v Chu (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 16 October 1998, per Spigelman CJ (with whom McInerney and Sperling JJ agreed)). 
     
      
    72 In such circumstances it was clearly in his Honour’s discretion to determine what discount was appropriate having regard to his evaluation of the assistance disclosed by Ex H. It does not appear from his Honour’s remarks that his ultimate sentence, and what the applicant suggests was a marginal reduction for the assistance to authorities, was influenced by a concern that a lesser sentence would have failed to have complied with s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to which he made no express reference and which would have to give way to s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) in any event (although even in Commonwealth offences it may be appropriate to have regard to sentencing criteria State authorities have devised: see R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162 at [60]).  
     
      
    73 If his Honour felt constrained at all that constraint would, in my view, have been the constraint imposed by s 16A and its requirement that he impose a sentence that was of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence, including the requirement that he ensure that the applicant was adequately punished. These requirements are reflected in R v Gallagher, to which the Crown referred, where it was emphasised that the provision of assistance to authorities should not be permitted to lead to a discounted sentence which did not reflect the objective criminality of the offence. 
     
      
    74 In this case, as I have already noted, the sentencing judge said he proposed to deal with the matter leniently although he also acknowledged the necessity to ensure that the sentence was commensurate with the gravity of the crime. He had made this observation when sentencing Salcedo as well. 
     
      
    75 For my part, his Honour never adequately explained why the offences deserved leniency. In AB v The Queen [1999] HCA 46 at [116]; (1999) 198 CLR 111 at 156, Hayne J said that “leniency may be given to an offender where to do so advances some policy of the criminal law”. In this case the applicant was entitled to some leniency because of his plea of guilty and also the assistance he had afforded the authorities. His co-offender, Salcedo, was also entitled to some leniency because of his plea of guilty. However, it appears to me that the sentencing judge was of the view that some additional leniency should be afforded the co-offenders for reasons which he never explained. Apart from the co-offenders’ pleas of guilty and the applicant’s assistance to the authorities, there was nothing in the nature of the offences to which they pleaded guilty which entitled them to additional leniency. Indeed, to the extent that the sentencing judge indicated that he intended to deal with the offenders leniently, it might be thought that, notwithstanding his reference to the fact that the sentence must be commensurate with the gravity of the crime, his Honour had not adequately addressed the requirement that stern punishment was warranted: Wong v R, above, at [64]. It is apparent that the sentencing judge appreciated that he had fallen into error in the leniency he had extended to Salcedo which he thought bound him by reference to the parity principle, when he lamented the level of his original sentence when resentencing Salcedo. 
     
      
    76 Although it is not apparent what discount the sentencing judge afforded the applicant by reason of the assistance to authorities, it is plain that it could best be described as minimal. That was, in my view, a matter within his Honour’s discretion both by reference to his evaluation of the assistance the applicant had afforded the authorities but also by reference to his obligation to ensure that the sentence was of an appropriate severity in all the circumstances. 
     
      
    77 In my view ground 3 should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Order 
      
    78 I would grant the application for leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the substantive appeal. 
     
      
    79 LEVINE J: I agree with McColl JA. 
     
      
    80 HIDDEN J: I agree with McColl JA.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff seeks relief from this Court in respect of a refusal of a magistrate to make an order under s 32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (the Act). In summary that section permits a magistrate, when hearing proceedings involving a defendant who is suffering from a mental illness, to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions under the section rather than in accordance with normal sentencing practice. The plaintiff asks this Court to quash the Magistrate’s ruling and, as a consequence, either to make the order that the Magistrate should have made or, alternatively, to require the Magistrate to exercise her jurisdiction afresh. 
     
      
    2 There was no issue raised as to this Court’s jurisdiction to entertain the summons nor the nature of that jurisdiction. The summons appears to seek relief under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act. However, it seems to me that the proper basis for the proceedings was as an application for leave to appeal under s 53 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001. An order refusing to apply s 32 would appear to me, without hearing argument on the matter, to be an interlocutory order for the purposes of s 53(3)(b). However, it is unnecessary to resolve this question in order to determine these proceedings. 
     
      
    3 The plaintiff was charged with a number of summary offences arising out of an incident that occurred in New South Head Road and William Street, Sydney. The plaintiff appeared before the Magistrate on the following matters: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) Menacing driving contrary to s 43(2) of the  
        Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 
        ; 
         
         
        (b) Negligent driving contrary to s 42(1)(c) of the  
        Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 
        ; 
         
         
        (c) Drive in a manner dangerous contrary to s 42(2) of the  
        Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 
        ; 
         
         
        (d) Assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s  
        59(1) of the Crimes Act 
        ; 
         
         
        (e) Not giving particulars to other driver contrary to Rule 287 of the  
        Australian Road Rules 
        . 
         
        
       
      
    4 The facts giving rise to the charges can be briefly stated. On 11 October 2003 the Plaintiff was driving his vehicle through the city when he pulled up behind a taxi that had stopped at an intersection. In an effort to indicate to the driver of the taxi to proceed, the plaintiff sounded his horn. When the taxi did not move, the plaintiff drove his vehicle beside it and, while both vehicles were stationary, exchanged abusive words and gestures with the other driver. The plaintiff became angry and opened the door of his vehicle to alight, but the lights controlling the intersection turned green and the taxi driver proceeded on his way. 
     
      
    5 The Plaintiff re-entered his vehicle and pursued the taxi until he was driving beside it along New South Head Road. He then repeatedly swerved his vehicle toward the lane where the taxi was driving almost colliding with the taxi on more than one occasion. At the same time he was sounding his horn and staring belligerently at the taxi driver. The two vehicles continued in this way into William St, Darlinghurst and through the Kings Cross Tunnel until the traffic ahead of them came to a stop because of a red light at the intersection of William Street and Yurong Street, Darlinghurst. The plaintiff then alighted from his vehicle, entered the taxi via the front passenger side door, and repeatedly punched the taxi driver in the face at the same time shouting “you fucking stupid Asian”. 
     
      
    6 When a bystander approached the vehicle and yelled at him to stop, the plaintiff returned to his vehicle. Ignoring a request not to leave the scene, he drove into the taxi, then reversed into a mailbox and pot plant, drove over the footpath and back onto the roadway. He then drove away, narrowly avoiding pedestrians and oncoming vehicles. 
     
      
    7 A short time later, police attended the plaintiff’s home. Immediately he admitted his involvement in the incident and was later charged with the offences for which he appeared before the Magistrate. 
     
      
    8 When the matter first came before the Magistrate on 29 March 2004, an application was made on behalf of the plaintiff that the matter be dealt with pursuant to the provisions of the Act. Section 32 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        32 
          
        Persons suffering from mental illness or condition 
          
         
         
        (1) If, at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a Magistrate, it appears to the Magistrate:  
         
          
          (a) that the defendant is:  
           
            
            (i) developmentally disabled, or  
             
            (ii) suffering from mental illness, or  
             
            (iii) suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital,  
            
           
          but is not a mentally ill person within the meaning of Chapter 3 of the Mental Health Act 1990, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) that, on an outline of the facts alleged in the proceedings or such other evidence as the Magistrate may consider relevant, it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law, the Magistrate may take the action set out in subsection (2) or (3).  
          
         
         
        (2) The Magistrate may do any one or more of the following:  
         
          
          (a) adjourn the proceedings,

        (3) The Magistrate may make an order dismissing the charge and discharge the defendant:  
         
          
          (a) into the care of a responsible person, unconditionally or subject to conditions, or  
           
          (b) on the condition that the defendant attend on a person or at a place specified by the Magistrate for assessment of the defendant’s mental condition or treatment or both, or  
           
          (c) unconditionally.  
          
         
        
       
      
    9 In order to determine the application the Magistrate received a copy of the police facts sheet and an antecedent report from the prosecutor. The plaintiff’s solicitor tendered a psychiatric report of Dr Lee, dated 26 March 2004. The psychiatrist offered the following opinion: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I believe that [the plaintiff] is not a mentally ill person within the meaning of chapter 3 of the Mental Health Act. However he suffers from a mental condition, for which treatment is available, characterised by severe recurrent disturbance of mood characterised by depression as well as intermittent uncontrolled anger. It would also appear compounded by problematic use of drugs. 
        
       
       
      The psychiatrist also set out a treatment program for the applicant that included addressing his use of cannabis and a course of anti-depressants and “mood stabilizers”. 
       
      
    10 There does not appear to have been any dispute before the Magistrate, and there was none before this Court, that the plaintiff had a mental condition that brought him within s 32 of the Act. 
     
      
    11 It is clear from the transcript of proceedings that from the outset the Magistrate was concerned with what she regarded as the serious nature of the offences charged against the plaintiff. It is also appears, initially at least, that the Magistrate was concerned with the plaintiff’s excessive use of marijuana and she expressed views during exchanges with the plaintiff’s solicitor that she thought that the plaintiff’s behaviour resulted from his use of that drug rather than any mental disability or illness. During the course of these exchanges, her Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Well I just have a problem with such serious charges where he has a background at school of being disruptive and being suspended six times, and we all know the side effect of marijuana is the up and down, the depression. But that day, you know, there was nothing there to mark it and what he said about “fucking Asians” sounds like somebody who has a short fuse. 
        
       
      
    12 However, it is clear that the Magistrate was reading from the report of Dr Lee during these exchanges and commenting upon material in that report. She plainly could not have over-looked the finding set out above. In any event, the Magistrate never suggested that she did not have jurisdiction to deal with the plaintiff under the provisions of s 32 and this was obviously because she accepted that he was suffering from a relevant mental condition at the time of the commission of the offences. 
     
      
    13 Towards the end of the hearing on 29 March the Magistrate expressed her view that the seriousness of the offences stood in the way of the application. However, at the request of the plaintiff’s solicitor she adjourned the proceedings in order to provide the plaintiff with an opportunity to place further evidence before the court in support of the application. 
     
      
    14 On 21 June 2004, the matter was again before the Magistrate. The plaintiff called Dr Kohn, a medical practitioner specialising in adolescent paediatrics and who had been treating the plaintiff since 2000. Dr Kohn’s evidence was that he believed the plaintiff was suffering from an over medication of Luvox, an antidepressant and mood stabilising drug, at the time of the incident. He expressed the opinion that the plaintiff’s conduct was out of character and that he was unlikely to re-offend. The prosecutor did not seek to challenge the doctor’s testimony. 
     
      
    15 Notwithstanding this evidence, the learned Magistrate still seemed to have felt some misgivings that the plaintiff’s conduct was due to a mental disorder or the over use of medication rather than the effects of cannabis. But it is clear that ultimately she came to the view that, notwithstanding the plaintiff’s mental condition, the offences were too serious and rejected the application. In her reasons for dismissing the application, the Magistrate recited the facts giving rise to the offences in detail and then stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Now from those facts, they were very serious offences. The evidence before me today is that at the time the accused was obviously suffering from a mental illness and Dr Kohn’s evidence is that was due to an over medication of Luvox. 
         
         
        I have great sympathy, but having said that one can understand what’s coming next, I have great sympathy for the family and for the young man but I consider the offences are too serious to deal with them pursuant to section 32. 
        
       
      
    16 It is clear that s 32 requires the magistrate to make a discretionary judgment as to the appropriateness of proceedings under the section rather than under the general criminal law. But the section requires a magistrate to arrive at a positive finding of fact before proceeding to deal with the defendant under the provisions of Part 3 of the Act. The magistrate can only proceed under s 32(3) to dismiss the charge or discharge the defendant where, in accordance with s 32(1)(b), the magistrate has determined that;  
     
      
       
        
         
        “………it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the Provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law.” 
        
       
      
    17 In order to determine whether it is more appropriate to deal with the applicant under Part 3 the Magistrate has to perform a balancing exercise; weighing up, on one hand, the purposes of punishment and, on the other, the public interest in diverting the mentally disordered offender from the criminal justice system. It is a discretionary judgment upon which reasonable minds may reach different conclusions in any particular case. But it is one that cannot be exercised properly without due regard being paid to the seriousness of the offending conduct for which the defendant is before the court. Clearly the more serious the offending, the more important will be the public interest in punishment being imposed for the protection of the community and the less likely will it be appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of the Act. It should be emphasised that what is being balanced is two public interests, to some extent pulling in two different directions. It is not a matter of weighing the public interest in punishment as against the private interest of the defendant in rehabilitation. 
     
      
    18 Because the magistrate’s jurisdiction under the Act involves a discretionary judgment, what weight is to be given to the various factors that touch upon that judgment will be very much a matter for the particular magistrate. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, for a defendant to convince this Court to intervene in the exercise of that discretion simply on the basis that the magistrate appeared to give more weight to one factor than another. As with any appeal against a discretionary judgment, the basis upon which this Court can intervene in the exercise of the power under s 32 is very limited. The question for this Court is whether the magistrate failed, either actually or constructively, to exercise the discretion conferred on the court by the section. 
     
      
    19 Fully appreciating this difficulty Mr Stanton for the plaintiff argued that the magistrate had been overly concerned with the nature of the charges rather than with the facts of the particular offences with which the plaintiff had been charged. It was submitted that the Magistrate unduly fettered her discretion by effectively limiting the scope of s 32 by determining that it could not apply to a certain category of offences; in this case “road rage” offences. From the transcript of proceedings on 29 March 2004, Mr Stanton relied upon the following exchanges between her Honour and the legal representative of the plaintiff:  
     
      
       
        
        Bench: You see road rage all the time Mr Gilbert. 
         
        Gilbert: But your Worship I understand that … 
         
        Bench: I have been at Penrith, on the way out to Penrith where I was for six months last year, people would tail gate you of a morning. 
         
        Gilbert: No I know, its terrible. 
         
        Bench: And coming back, its not – it is behaviour that on the whole one would expect late at night but it does happen, I mean that’s why we have the incidents that we have that you read about, they don’t always happen late at night, they happen in the middle of the day, all that sort of thing. But my thing is really whether the section 32, whether I can feel … 
         
        Gilbert: Comfortable in its application. 
         
        Bench: … comfortable. Can I tell you at this stage I don’t, they are such serious offences and he sees Dr Lee after the event …..”  
        
       
       
      Mr Stanton submitted in effect that the Magistrate had a closed mind to the application under s 32 because of her attitude to the type of offence with which the plaintiff had been charged.  
       
      
    20 It must be said that the comments made by the Magistrate in this part of the transcript were, with respect, unhelpful and possibly distracting from the real issue raised by the application. Her experience on the public roads was little to the point because it was the criminality of the plaintiff’s conduct that had to be assessed not that of other road users. To the extent that the Magistrate might be taken as indicating that general deterrence was an important matter to be considered, it should be borne in mind that general deterrence may have less weight in sentencing persons with mental disorders: see for example R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267. Therefore, the need for general deterrence in respect of a certain class of offence may not be a relevant, or particularly significant, consideration in determining whether to deal with a particular defendant under s 32. 
     
      
    21 However, it is clear that at least on 21 June 2004, her Honour had in her mind the particular facts of the offences with which the plaintiff had been charged rather than the type of offence. For example in one exchange with the plaintiff’s legal representative, the Magistrate stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        …if the facts weren’t what they were then I’d be inclined to look at it but because of the seriousness of the alleged facts, I just cant get over that.” 
        
       
      
    22 Furthermore, and more importantly, I have already quoted from a portion of the Magistrate’s reasons in dismissing the application that makes it clear that she approached the matter having regard to the particular facts giving rise to the offences for which the plaintiff was before the court. 
     
      
    23 I am not satisfied that there has shown to be any error in the Magistrate’s determination of the application to deal with the plaintiff under the Act rather than to sentence him according to law. The summons is to be dismissed with costs.

          DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    24 HIS HONOUR: In this matter I have dismissed the summons, and without hearing the parties as to costs just acted on the normal basis that costs would follow the event.  
     
      
    25 This morning it has been put to me that I ought not to make the normal order as to costs. I understand that the submission is that each party pay their own costs.  
     
      
    26 Two bases are put forward to support that submission. The first was that Mr Confos is, I am told, a young man, a student without means in order to pay the costs of the Director.  
     
      
    27 I assume that part of that submission, although unsaid, was that the Director of Public Prosecution is the defendant and therefore, presumably, more able to meet the costs of the matter than if it were a private person.  
     
      
    28 The other basis upon which I am asked to depart from the normal order in respect of costs is that it is submitted it was not unreasonable to bring the matter to this Court.  
     
      
    29 As I pointed out to counsel, and as I point out in the reasons for judgment in dismissing the summons, one of the difficulties that was faced by the plaintiff was that this was, in effect, an exercise of discretion and the limited basis upon which that exercise would be interfered with would be well known to those persons who advised the plaintiff.  
     
      
    30 In fact, it seems to me that despite the able submissions made on behalf of the plaintiff there was little prospect of this Court interfering with the discretion particularly on the basis initially put forward, and that was that the Magistrate had given too much weight to a particular factor in reaching her assessment as to whether or not it was appropriate to exercise the discretion under section 32. 
     
      
    31 It seems to me that the Director is entitled to the order for costs.  
     
      
    32 I am not satisfied, nor would I be satisfied even if I granted the plaintiff an adjournment to put on evidence, that there are sufficient reasons to depart from the normal order as to costs.  
     
      
    33 I note that the Director has very reasonably, and somewhat generously, indicated that the only costs that will be sought will be costs which the Director would have to pay in relation to counsel appearing in the matter. It seems to me, as I say, to be a very fair result and I will not alter the order as to costs, but I note the concession made by the Director.

     Judgment 
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: I have read in draft form the judgment of Smart AJ. I agree with the orders proposed, and with the reasons of his Honour.2 McCLELLAN JA: I have read in draft form the judgment of Smart AJ. I agree with the orders proposed and with the reasons given.3 SMART AJ: JNN seeks leave to appeal against a sentence of imprisonment for 3 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 20 months for the offence of detaining LT without her consent and with intent to obtain an advantage in circumstances of special aggravation in that the applicant was then in company with other persons, and at the time actual bodily harm was occasioned to LT. The maximum penalty for that offence is 25 years imprisonment. It is a serious children's indictable offence pursuant to the Children's Criminal Proceedings Act 1987 (see s 17 sub para (b) of the definition of serious children's indictable offence) and must be dealt with according to law, although JNN was aged 17 years 2 months at the time of the offence. 4 On 27 March 2002, about 3pm, the complainant (LT) was at her home at Punchbowl with her parents and sister. Toan La attended that home and the complainant and her parents were wrongly given to understand from what he said that the complainant's boy friend at that time was waiting out the front of the family home in a nearby motor vehicle. The complainant and Toan La left the home and walked to the vehicle. When the complainant was about one metre from the car the right rear door opened and the applicant alighted. Another female and the applicant grabbed the complainant. With the assistance of other co-offenders the complainant was forced into the rear of the vehicle and prevented from leaving. The complainant screamed during this period.5 Within the rear of the vehicle the applicant sat on one side of the complainant and an unknown female co-offender on the other side. The vehicle was driven by another unknown female co-offender. Toan La and an unknown male co-offender were also in the vehicle. It was driven to Rotary Park, off Belmore Road, Riverwood. In the centre of the park the complainant was ordered from the vehicle by the applicant and the other two female co-offenders.6 The complainant was hit and slapped on a number of occasions by the applicant and fell to the ground where she was kicked by the applicant and co-offenders on numerous occasions. The complainant attempted to shield her face from the attack but sustained several kicks to the facial area and body.7 During the attack the two males stayed in the vehicle. The applicant wielded a pair of scissors and cut large chunks of the complainant's hair from her head. The complainant was next told to remove her top and her pants. She was left wearing only a red singlet top, black underwear and a brassiere. She was further kicked and assaulted. She was ordered to remove her black underwear and the singlet.8 During the assaults the applicant and the female co-offenders asked the complainant about an abortion allegedly performed upon her. The applicant and the female co-offenders referred to the complainant as a ""slut"" and it was remarked ""We don't want you opening your legs for all the guys.""9 At one stage the complainant was naked. Before the assailants left, the applicant threw the complainant's red singlet top and underwear to her. She wore these. After the car containing the assailants drove off the complainant made her way to a nearby factory. The police and the ambulance were called. The complainant was taken to Bankstown Hospital where she was treated. As the judge remarked, a series of photographs graphically depicts the numerous and serious injuries the complainant received as a result of the beating.10 In her police record of interview on 5 April 2002 the applicant, who had been arrested by the police, agreed that the complainant had been lured out of her house into a motor vehicle, that she, the applicant, was in the car and that the complainant had been assaulted. There were five of them. She said that the two boys stayed in the car and that the other two female co-offenders were the assailants. She said that she stood by. She nominated Toan La as the person who had lured the complainant to the vehicle. The applicant was aware that the complainant was going to be assaulted.11 During the interview the applicant endeavoured to minimise her role in the abduction and assault and lay the blame principally on the other two female co-offenders, whose names she claimed not to know. However, the other evidence points to the applicant playing a leading role.12 In her account of the details of the offence given to Ms M A Edwards, the Juvenile Specialist Counsellor, the applicant was a good deal more forthcoming, admitting that she pulled the victim by her arm into the back seat of the car while one of the male offenders pushed the complainant who was screaming. The applicant admitted that she was fully involved in the assault upon the complainant in the park, kicking her five to six times in the head. This passage appears: 
     
      
       
        ""… J proceeded to cut off the victims hair. J reports that she then went up close to the victim's face and told her 'not to tell the school about this'. J states that by this point the victim had no clothes on at all, 'was crying and was already looking very bruised ..."" 
       
      
    13 The applicant told Ms Edwards that she never intended that the assault ""would go that far"".14 Ms Edwards commented: 
     
      
       
        ""It is of concern that although J is adamant that the victim did not deserve the assault and displays what appears to be appropriate remorse for her behaviour, J continues to make comments that serve in part to rationalise her behaviour. J continues to state, 'What she, (the victim) did, led to what happened'."" 
       
      
    15 The applicant believes in remedial action if someone close to her is being wronged or taken advantage of or picked on, preferably non violent action. She would use a lesser degree of force in the future.16 The applicant was born on 25 January 1985. At the time of the offence she was in Year 10 at Bankstown Senior College endeavouring to continue her education.17 The judge found that the plea of guilty was not entered at the first reasonable opportunity but that it was entered prior to trial and that it had a significant utilitarian value. The judge concluded that there was genuine contrition built into that plea. He allowed a discount of 15 per cent for the plea of guilty.18 The applicant has no prior convictions.19 The complainant's victim impact statement demonstrates that the offence has had a serious effect upon her. She feels she cannot trust or rely on anyone again and is constantly anxious. She cannot concentrate in some of her classes and her English language skills are deteriorating. She had to procure treatment from a psychologist in respect of significant difficulties. The psychologist thought that she developed acute post traumatic stress disorder but that her symptoms will continue to remit. There continues to be ongoing difficulties [school attendance and social functioning]. Her psychological state has been adversely affected.20 The complainant was also seen by the Clinical Psychologist, Dr Renata Wagner. As at 4 November 2002 the complainant had been seen on some twelve occasions for psychological counselling. She was also treated by Dr E Guirguis for physical and psychological harm. The complainant could not return to her school and her education for the remainder of 2002. She is fearful and suffers panic attacks.21 The judge correctly found that because of the grave criminal conduct of the applicant general deterrence and punishment were important. The judge also took into account that it was important to allow the applicant to continue her education without interruption, that it was desirable wherever possible to allow a child to reside in her own home and that children require guidance and assistance.22 The judge took into account the aggravating and mitigating factors of the offences. Amongst the aggravating factors were gratuitous cruelty, substantial harm, hatred, planned and organised criminal activity which may not have included such a serious assault.23 Mitigating factors included her previous good character, being unlikely to re-offend, good prospects of rehabilitation, remorse, her plea of guilty and not being fully aware of the consequences of her actions by reason of her age. The judge noted that the complainant's parents separated when she was six and that she had been raised by her mother with considerable support from her extended family members.24 She encountered difficulties with her schooling whilst at a Catholic girls' school and left. She worked for some time before returning to further her education at the Bankstown Senior College in 2002. Her behaviour at the College is acceptable and she is regarded as a capable student. She also works casually as a chef's assistant three nights per week.25 The judge found that the applicant accepted full responsibility for her behaviour. The judge took into account a series of favourable matters referred to by Ms Edwards as to the applicant, including no known history of violence or offending, her stable living environment, her network of family support and that she had been successfully residing in the community for two years since the commission of the offence.26 The judge took into account some favourable references, some community service which she had rendered and the report of Ms Anita Duffy, psychologist. The applicant told Ms Duffy that she had changed considerably since the incident. Ms Duffy wrote that the applicant was a person who tended to be somewhat dependent and submissive in her relationships with others and that she tends to want to be ""in the crowd"".27 Ms Duffy recorded that the applicant felt she had matured considerably and that the applicant had learnt to establish boundaries between herself and her friends so she does not become over involved in their problems.28 Ms Edwards and Ms Duffy thought that the applicant would be adversely affected by being sent to gaol.29 Appeal Ground 1 reads: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ""His Honour erred in placing too much weight on general deterrence and insufficient weight on rehabilitation when fixing the overall sentence."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    30 The applicant pointed to these remarks of the judge: 
     
      
       
        ""It is the type of offence where it must be borne in mind that general deterrence and punishment are very important and cannot be ameliorated by good subjective or rehabilitated  
       (sic) 
        (? rehabilitation) factors."" 
       
      
     That overstates, partially, the correct position. General deterrence and punishment are important but with a young offender good subjective and rehabilitation factors are also important and will generally point in the direction of a lesser sentence. Of course, everything depends upon the particular facts.31 The applicant also pointed to these remarks of the judge: 
     
      
       
        ""…the promotion of rehabilitation is a desired outcome … but nevertheless the promotion of rehabilitation must in some cases be subject to … the greater need for punishment, general deterrence, the protection of the community and the need to denounce the conduct of an offender, and to make that offender accountable for … her actions whilst recognising the harm to the victim and the community that criminal conduct of this type invariably causes."" 
       
      
    32 The applicant submitted that the judge did not have sufficient regard to the principle that generally the youth of an offender will mean that less weight is given to deterrence and more to rehabilitation: R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 at 116. The Crown relied on R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 340 at 354 stressing the need for a sentence proportionate to the objective gravity of the crime and that this was a serious crime carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.33 Although not happily expressed I doubt if the judge meant any more by the passage quoted in its context that this was a very serious crime and that while rehabilitation was important the sentence had to reflect the objective gravity of the crime, including adequate punishment and general deterrence.34 While abstract statements of principle have their place it is desirable not to become preoccupied with these at the expense of the particular facts under consideration. The judge recognised that at least part of the rationale for making allowance for youth, that is, being under the age of 18 years lies in their dependency and immaturity. There is a substantial benefit to the community in rehabilitating a young offender. The correct balance has to be struck between competing considerations.35 When regard is had to the judge's reasons as a whole they reveal that he was acutely aware of the applicant's age, of the need for her education to continue, her immaturity, her good prospects of rehabilitation, her previous good character, the dependent features of her character and her desire to conform to peer pressure.36 Despite the debate as to the terms of the judge's sentencing remarks, the sentence imposed does not support the submission that for the grave criminality involved the judge placed too much weight on general deterrence and insufficient weight on rehabilitation when fixing the overall sentence. Appeal Ground 1 should be rejected.37 Appeal Ground 2 reads: 
     
      
       
        ""The overall sentence and the non-parole period are manifestly excessive, taking into account the delay before sentence, the applicant's plea of guilty, her contrition, good character, age, subjective case and prospects of rehabilitation."" 
       
      
    38 The applicant submitted that the sentence reflected that too much weight was placed on general deterrence and punishment and that no allowance was made for her immaturity or the need to foster her rehabilitation in fixing the overall sentence. These arguments are not accepted. The sentence itself destroys such arguments.39 It was pointed out that as the judge allowed a reduction of 15 per cent for the plea and the sentence imposed was 40 months the starting point must have been 46 months (3 years 10 months). It was submitted that this was manifestly excessive taking into account the applicant's age, immaturity, her motivation for the offence and her favourable subjective case including her good prospects of rehabilitation. 40 The judge took into account what he described as the delay in dealing with the matter and that the applicant was on bail on onerous conditions in the two years between being charged and sentenced. From 5 April 2002 to 7 February 2003 she had to report to the Bankstown Police Station every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. It was reduced to each Monday as from 7 February 2003. She was permitted to fly to Vietnam from 17 to 31 January 2004 and excused from reporting during that period. There was the usual non-molestation provision as to the complainant.41 In R v McVittie [2002] NSWCCA 344 at [26] the Court held that being required to report to police while on bail was not a mitigating factor. To describe the bail conditions as onerous was over generous to the applicant.42 As to delay, the matter was listed for trial in June 2003, some 14 months after she was charged. The delay was not gross. The plea of guilty was not entered until shortly before the trial. On one occasion she requested an adjournment of the sentencing proceedings to enable her to do exams. On a subsequent occasion when the matter had to be adjourned because the requisite background report had not been completed she obtained a variation of her bail conditions to visit Vietnam with her family. Too much should not be made of the question of delay. The judge also treated the applicant generously on the issue of delay.43 The period on bail allowed the applicant to show a substantial period of good behaviour which assisted her on sentencing. Further, during this period the complainant's condition improved.44 Given the grave criminality involved in this very serious offence neither the head sentence of 40 months nor the non-parole period of 20 months was manifestly excessive. Appeal Ground 2 should be rejected.45 Appeal Ground 3 reads: 
     
      
       
        ""The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance when considering the sentence imposed on the offender Toan La.""  
       
      
    46 Toan La who was aged 18 years and 7 months at the time of the offence, pleaded not guilty to the same charge but was convicted. On 16 December 2003 he was sentenced by Payne DCJ for this offence and also for an unrelated offence of robbery in company on 27 November 2002 while on bail and subject to community service orders in relation to other unrelated offences. For the offence of 27 March 2002Toan La was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment from 27 November 2002 with a non-parole period of 18 months. As to the robbery in company he was sentenced to 3 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 27 May 2003. The total effective sentence was 3 years 10 months and the total effective non-parole period was 2 years. Because of the accumulation of the sentence the effective period which Toan La will spend in prison on the detain for advantage in circumstances of special aggravation charge is 6 months.47 As counsel for the applicant emphasised, Toan La had pleaded not guilty while the applicant pleaded guilty and expressed remorse. Toan La had committed a serious offence while on bail for the subject offence, whereas the applicant had not re-offended and had accepted responsibility for her actions. Her prospects of rehabilitation were markedly higher than those of Toan La.48 Payne DCJ found, conformably with the jury's verdict, that Toan La had pushed or helped to push the complainant into the motor vehicle and that he knew that she was going to be physically assaulted but was not aware of the extent of the intended assault. Payne DCJ found that the offence was initiated by JNN, that she had the motive and that she had recruited Toan La.49 The applicant played the leading role in the offence and was guilty of considerable cruelty. Toan La's role by luring the complainant with whom he was friendly, knowing that she was likely to be assaulted, was significant. The applicant played a leading role in bundling the complainant from the car and stripping her. The applicant kicked the victim about the head and cut her hair. Toan La stayed in the car. Her criminality was gross and merited a higher sentence than Toan La. 50 Counsel for the applicant relied on the well known passage of Dawson and Gaudron JJ in the judgment in Postiglione v The Queen (1996-7) 189 CLR 295 at 301-302. There must be due proportion between the sentences and that includes all components51 In giving his reasons why parity did not apply the judge relied on Toan La being an adult and the applicant being a juvenile to whom, in essence, a different sentencing regime applied. It is no longer the law that regard cannot be had to the sentence imposed on a juvenile when sentencing an adult or when an appellate court is considering parity or proportionality. However, the weight of the sentence imposed on the juvenile is limited because of the different sentencing regimes. Everything depends on the circumstances. Sometimes the juvenile has been the ringleader and had the greater criminality. Sometimes the age difference between the co-offenders is minimal. The adult may in fact be less mature and less practised in criminal enterprises or less intelligent than the juvenile. The list is not exhaustive.52 Where the adult co-offender is sentenced first, or there is an appeal, there is no good reason why regard may not be had to the sentence imposed on the adult when sentencing the juvenile or considering, on appeal, the sentence imposed on the juvenile. Again caution must be exercised. Subject to variations in their subjective cases where the adult and juvenile co-offenders appear equally blameworthy it would not usually be expected that the sentence on the juvenile co-offender would exceed that imposed on the adult co-offender. Again, everything depends on the particular facts.53 There is a lack of due proportion in the sentences imposed on Toan La and the applicant. She is entitled to have a justifiable sense of grievance.54 The Crown submitted that the differences in the sentences are not so significant that this Court should intervene. I am unable to agree. The structure of Toan La's sentence is such that he will serve effectively but 6 months in prison for the offence of 27 March 2002 before the accumulated second sentence takes effect. The offences of 27 March 2002 (detain for advantage) and 27 November 2002 (robbery in company) were entirely separate and Toan La was fortunate to be given such a high level of concurrency in respect of the sentences for those offences. The applicant would expect to spend 20 months in prison for the offence of 27 March 2002.55 The Crown in reliance upon R v Steele, unreported NSWCCA, 17 April 1997 at p 12 per Simpson J, Sheller JA and Grove J concurring, pointed out that the parity principle does not oblige this Court to reduce a sentence that is not itself excessive to the point where it might be regarded as inadequate. If it were not for a lack of due proportion I would not have intervened. As to the full term of the sentence of 40 months (3 years 4 months), when compared to the full term of the sentence of 36 months (3 years) imposed upon Toan La there is a lack of due proportion. While the applicant's criminality is greater, she pleaded guilty and was remorseful. Further, she was a juvenile. In the circumstances the full term of her sentence should also be 3 years. It could not be less otherwise it would not sufficiently reflect the objective criminality of the offence she committed. 56 The non-parole period fixed in respect of the sentence of the applicant lacks due proportion when compared with the period in prison which will effectively be served by Toan La for the offence of 27 March 2002. When sentences are made partially concurrent and partially cumulative in the application of the principle of totality, some distortions may occur. Again because of the gravity of the criminality involved in the offence of 27 March 2002 only a minor reduction in the non-parole period should be made otherwise that portion of the sentence will be inadequate. The non-parole period should be 18 months. There is no completely satisfactory solution to the problems presented by this case. It is evident that I have found along with the judge, the existence of special circumstances. These include this being her first time in custody and her need for extended supervision on her release.57 I have hesitated before making such minor sentence reductions as they give the impression of tinkering. The reasons for the course taken are twofold. First, it is important that there be due proportion between all components of the sentences, including the actual time likely to be spent in gaol for the offence. Secondly, anything less than a non-parole period of 18 months would not sufficiently reflect the applicant's substantial criminality.58 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
         
        2. Appeal allowed, sentence quashed. 
         
         
        3. In lieu of the sentence imposed the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years commencing on 20 February 2004 with a non-parole period of 18 months starting that day and expiring on 19 August 2005 on which day the applicant is to be released to parole. 
         
         
        4. Direct that the sentence be served at a Juvenile Justice Detention Centre (or its successor) and that on her release to parole the applicant be supervised for her period on parole and that the NSW Probation and Parole Service take over her supervision from the Juvenile Justice System at a point assessed as mutually appropriate by the Probation and Parole Service and the Department of Juvenile Justice.

     R v Phillip Nathan KING 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 McCOLL JA: Mr King pleaded guilty before Delaney DCJ to one count of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm on 20 August 2002, contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty for a breach of s 33 is 25 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 On 16 June 2004 his Honour sentenced Mr King to a term of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 ½ years, backdated to the date of his arrest on 21 August 2002. 
     
      
    3 There are two matters before the Court. Mr King seeks leave to appeal against his sentence pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) on the basis that it was manifestly excessive and that the sentencing judge erred in wrongly considering the actual or threatened use of violence as an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) complaining that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
    4 I shall, for convenience, refer to Mr King as the respondent throughout. 
     
      
       
      Background 
      
    5 The respondent and Ms Flick engaged in a single act of consensual sexual intercourse after which Ms Flick became pregnant. The respondent sought to persuade Ms Flick to have an abortion, but she refused. It was not disputed before the sentencing judge that on 20 August 2002, when the pregnancy was between 23 and 24 weeks, the respondent attacked Ms Flick by punching her in the stomach. She was taken to Bankstown Hospital immediately, where an ultrasound was performed. No foetal heartbeat was detected. The foetus was delivered stillborn on 23 August 2002. 
     
      
    6 The respondent was first indicted in February 2003 on the charge of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm on 20 August 2002 contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  
     
      
    7 On 9 October 2003 Tupman DCJ granted a permanent stay in respect of the s 33 charge on the basis that there was no prospect of the Crown succeeding in obtaining a conviction, as the particulars of the charge could not amount to grievous bodily harm to the mother. The Crown appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The permanent stay of proceedings was lifted as a consequence of this Court’s decision in R v King [2003] NSWCCA 399; (2003) 59 NSWLR 472 (the “stay proceedings”) in which Spigelman CJ (with whose reasons Dunford and Adams JJ agreed) held that for the purposes of s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) the foetus should be regarded as part of the mother.  
     
      
    8 That judgment assists in understanding the nature of the offence to which the respondent pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    9 Although Ms Flick suffered bruising injuries as a result of the assault, the Crown did not suggest that those injuries could amount to grievous bodily harm. The Crown relied on, alternatively, the death of the foetus and the injury to the placenta as constituting the grievous bodily harm she had suffered: R v King at [8]. Accordingly, the stay proceedings raised the question “whether or not the death of a foetus is capable of constituting grievous bodily harm to a pregnant mother”: R v King at [4].  
     
      
    10 The hearing before the Court proceeded on the basis of Tupman DCJ’s findings (R v King at [9]) that: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the evidence there is no doubt that there was really serious bodily harm occasioned to the foetus as a result of the accused assaulting the complainant. In very simple terms, the foetus bled to death following the abruption of the placenta and, as I understand the medical evidence, this occurred at the site of the abruption. The foetus was stillborn however and did not take a breath outside the uterus. 
        and 
        
       
       
        
        The placenta too suffered some injury on the evidence before me. As I understand the medical evidence, that injury amounted to a portion of it detaching from the uterine wall, allowing the loss of foetal blood into the mother’s blood stream and ultimately causing the retro-placental clot noted on delivery.” 
        
       
      
    11 It also appears to have been assumed in the stay proceedings that “the assault on the mother did not inflict grievous bodily harm on her, unless the harm done to the foetus or the placenta is sufficient for that purpose”: R v King at [86]. 
     
      
    12 Spigelman CJ accepted (at [87]) that there was “no clear rule, applicable in all situations, as to whether the mother and foetus must be considered as one or as separate [but that] the answer will turn on the incidents of the particular legal situation under consideration including, where relevant, the scope, purpose and object of a particular statutory scheme.” 
     
      
    13 His Honour referred (at [89] – [95]) to R v Sullivan & Lemay [1991] 1 SCR 489; (1991) 63 CCC (3d) 97, Winnipeg Child & Family Services (Northwest Area) v G [1997] 3 SCR 925 and Harrild v Director of Proceedings [2003] 3 NZLR 289. In each of these cases, in different statutory contexts, it was held that while physically connected to the mother an unborn child or foetus was part of her.  
     
      
    14 Spigelman CJ referred (at [95]) to Harrild at [123] where McGrath J said “that because it is connected to human tissue inside her a foetus is part of the mother’s person” and that the foetus, even if a separate entity for some purposes, was “human tissue connected to and inside” the body of the mother (Harrild at [126] and [133]) and said (at [96] – [97]): 
     
      
       
        
        “96 I find this approach compelling for the law of assault and in particular for the forms of aggravated assault requiring as an element of the offence actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm or wounding. The close physical bond between the mother and the foetus is of such a character that, for purposes of offences such as this, the foetus should be regarded as part of the mother.  
        97 The aggravated forms of assault reflect the community’s legitimate concern to control violence between persons. The greater the degree of injury, as compared with the result of common assault, the greater the community’s concern. Where such enhanced injury is inflicted on a foetus only, I can see no reason why the aggravated form of offence should depend on whether the foetus is born alive. The purpose of the law is best served by acknowledging that, relevantly, the foetus is part of the mother.” 
        
       
      
    15 The Court of Criminal Appeal set aside Tupman DCJ’s order staying the proceedings. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing proceedings 
      
    16 The sentencing proceedings followed the lifting of the permanent stay. 
     
      
    17 There were two stages to the sentencing proceedings. The sentencing judge first heard evidence concerning the circumstances of the assault in order to make the findings of fact to be taken into account on sentence. He delivered his findings of fact based on that evidence on 3 June 2004. He then adjourned the matter to 9 June 2004 when he heard further evidence and submissions on the appropriate sentence in the light of those facts. The sentence was imposed on 16 June 2004, on which date his Honour also enunciated his remarks on sentence. 
     
      
       
      Determining the facts 
      
    18 Before the sentencing judge, the Crown alleged that the respondent’s attack upon Ms Flick involved him kicking her in the stomach and stomping on her stomach about half a dozen times. The Crown also alleged that prior to his assault, the respondent had offered others money to assault the complainant, including hitting her in the stomach, but they had refused.  
     
      
    19 Although the respondent pleaded guilty, he did not accept the facts were as alleged by the Crown. His case was that he had punched Ms Flick in the stomach then stepped on her right arm. He also denied offering others money to assault her. 
     
      
    20 Accordingly the Crown was required to call evidence of the background to the event on 20 August 2002 to allow the sentencing judge to determine the facts upon which he should proceed to sentence the respondent. 
     
      
    21 The Crown tendered a number of documents which included statements taken from medical staff who attended Ms Flick after her admission to Bankstown Hospital and autopsy reports prepared by Dr Duflou, a specialist forensic pathologist at the Department of Forensic Medicine at Glebe.  
     
      
    22 Dr Duflou determined on his autopsy, which was conducted on 26 August 2002, that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The foetus was macerated, consistent with demise on or about 20 August 2002….Microscopic examination of tissues identified areas of bleeding in the placenta consistent with having been present for a number of days. Given the history, it appears likely this bleeding occurred at the time of the alleged blunt force assault to the abdomen. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Examination of the placenta 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        An 80 x 20 x 20 mm crescentic area of haemorrhage was noted at the placental border. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Placenta:  
        Shows normal development without evidence of placental infection. There is recent haemorrhage in areas, with an acute inflammatory cell reaction and early organisation along the edges of the haemorrhage and in the adjacent placental tissue. There is a minor degree of inflammation of the membranes … The features are consistent with bleeding a number of days prior to delivery.” 
        
       
      
    23 He concluded that the stillbirth of the foetus on 23 August 2002 was “consistent with blunt force abdominal trauma to mother”.  
     
      
    24 He prepared a second report based on the assumptions that the last time prior to the assault Ms Flick felt foetal movement was at 18.00 hours on 20 August 2002, that the assault took place shortly before 20.21 hours on 20 August 2002 and that no foetal heartbeat was detected by a midwife at about 21.30 hours on 20 August 2002. On those assumptions Dr Duflou opined: 
     
      
       
        
        “Abruptio placentae is relatively uncommon during the second trimester of a previously normal pregnancy. Causes of abruptio placentae include trauma …Given the circumstances described and the very short time interval between when movement was last felt and the death of the foetus (about 3 ½ hours), I am of the opinion that it is highly likely that the foetus died as a result of blows to the abdomen (i.e. trauma). On the material made available to me I am of the opinion that other causes of abruption of the placenta causing the stillbirth in this case are not reasonable possibilities.” 
        
       
      
    25 The Crown also tendered a report from Dr Simon McCaffrey, a gynaecologist. He reviewed the history and expressed the following opinions: 
     
      
       
        
        “… Kylie’s Kleihauer count of 5% suggested a foetomaternal haemorrhage of approximately 250mls. In other words virtually the entire blood circulation of the infant had undergone transplacental transfusion into Kylie’s circulation … The clinical setting and perinatal pathology suggested traumatic placental abruption as a result of the alleged assault with foetal demise due to placental haemorrhage and foetomaternal haemorrhage. 
        
       
       
        
        Pelvic ultrasound performed on 21/8/2002 (the day after the alleged assault) confirmed a foetal death in utero whose demise had been recent … 
        
       
       
        
        Traumatic placental abruption resulting in foetal death in utero and foetomaternal transfusion of the entire foetal circulation is indicative of significant trauma. Admittedly the extent of the trauma may not have been visible but the uterus underwent significant trauma to produce this result …” 
        
       
      
    26 The Crown called a number of witnesses including Ms Flick, Brianne McCarthy and Jessica Williams. Doctor Duflou was also called by the Crown at the request of the respondent as a qualified forensic pathologist. The respondent gave evidence, as did his mother and a Mr Brannigan. 
     
      
    27 Ms Flick gave evidence she became pregnant following one incident of consensual sexual intercourse with the respondent. Some weeks later she told the respondent that she was pregnant. She said that it appeared that he did not believe her at first. She gave evidence of conversations with the respondent both one to one and with other persons present between the time she first told him of her pregnancy and 20 August 2002. She said that she told the respondent that the pregnancy was going well and that she was going to have a boy. She was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What did you tell him in the conversation? 
         
        A. I told him that I was having a boy and I asked if he was happy about it and he said ‘Yes’ that he always wanted a boy. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How was the tone of that conversation? 
         
        A. He actually seemed happy about it.” 
        
       
      
    28 Ms Flick said that she was in contact with the respondent by mobile phone and by SMS text messages frequently. The sentencing judge found that the material annexed to the statement of a Sergeant Adney (Ex C) confirmed that statement. 
     
      
    29 During the course of the pregnancy Ms Flick underwent an ultrasound examination. An examination which took place on 31 July 2002 confirmed that the baby was healthy, the pregnancy was proceeding appropriately and that the baby was a boy.  
     
      
    30 Ms Flick said that as 20 August approached she was leaving the Yagoona area and moving to live at Minto. She said that there was a telephone conversation with the respondent who said he wished to say goodbye to her before she moved. Ms Flick said that arrangements were made for a meeting to be held on 20 August. On that day she had friends helping her with the heavy things when she received a call from the respondent to meet her down the side of the house. This she did. She was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Can you say what you talked about? 
         
         A. Moving away, getting away and getting out of the area, how bad the area had gotten. He was looking over my fence and I told him to watch out for the dogs because they might bite.” 
        
       
      
    31 Ms Flick’s evidence was that the conversation lasted about an hour and was civil and peaceful. There was some discussion about her future. She said that it was always her intention to support the child with the help of her mother and eventually work. She said that at a stage when it is apparent she had her back to the respondent, everything went silent, she heard a rushing noise and as she turned she felt pressure hit her stomach. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A … I fell backwards and hit the ground and then Phil just kept stepping on my stomach with his leg. 
         
        Q. What part of his leg was coming into contact with you? 
         
        A. The sole of his foot.” 
        
       
      
    32 Ms Flick said that the sole of the respondent’s foot came into contact with her about six or seven times. She said that at that stage she was positioned on her back and he was over the top of her holding her down with his hand. She was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Holding you down with his hand and what part of you was his hand in contact with? 
         
        A. My shoulder. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What were you doing? 
         
        A. I was screaming, trying to cover my stomach with my arms and legs. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. After he did this six or seven times that you’ve mentioned what did he do next? 
         
        A. He ran. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he say anything while he was doing this to you? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    33 One of the aspects of the early part of the history of the event after Ms Flick became pregnant was a visit by her to the home of the respondent with her sister. There was a discussion then about the future of the child. The question that was then asked by senior counsel was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. So if he’s asking you to get an abortion that really doesn’t sound like he’s very happy about being a father does it not? 
         
        A. Not at that point. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But are you telling the Court that he came around from that position from hanging up on you, wanting you to have an abortion and then being happy about being a father, is that right? 
         
        A. That’s how he made it sound.” 
        
       
      
    34 Ms Flick said in cross-examination that she did not agree that the respondent was making her feel unwanted. She agreed, however, that the respondent wished her to have an abortion, that he told her that she was too young to have a child and he was too young to be a father and to look after and support a child. Ms Flick said that she knew that the respondent did not have a job and that he could not support her and had told her that they were both too young to be married. 
     
      
    35 Counsel for the respondent cross-examined Ms Flick in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You were smoking on that night weren’t you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And it was after you lit up the smoke that the assault occurred did it not? 
         
        A. I’m not sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He said words to the effect “Look at you, you’re still smoking” didn’t he? 
         
        A. I don’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And this assault that you tell us about, you say he stomped on you six or seven times. You certainly remember that don’t you? 
         
        A. I can still feel it of a night. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Pardon? 
         
        A. I can still feel it of a night. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In stomping - you said he also held you down with one hand when that occurred? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You said that you were on your back? 
        
       
       A. Yes. 
       
       
        
        Q. Do I take it from that answer that he was stomping on your stomach? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And he was wearing shoes at the time? 
         
        A. Yes. I think they were boots. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He is not exactly a slightly built man is he? 
         
        A. He was a lot bigger than that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He was a lot bigger then wasn’t he, in fact he’s lost weight since the assault hasn’t he? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So he was a big man? 
         
        A. Yes.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. So therefore it was a big man stomping on you six or seven times? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was he bringing his boot - was he using both feet? 
         
        A. Just one. 
         
        Q. Just one foot, and was he bringing that down on the stomach area repeatedly? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The amount of times you said so? 
         
        A. I think so yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You think so. And at the same time holding you on the ground, so he was in a sense leaning over you is that right? 
         
        A. I think he more kept pushing me with his hand. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He pushed you down, would stomp and then if you tried to get up he’d -- 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
      Q. -- push you down again, is that right? 
       
        
        A. I think so. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can I suggest to you that the true position was that he at no stage stomped on you at all did he? 
         
        A. Yes he did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I mean by that, I’ll be very clear, any stomping was in fact the treading of his foot on your arm or wrist at the time when you fell to the ground? 
         
        A. I don’t understand. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I’m suggesting to you the only time he trod on you or even to use your word “stomped” was when you fell to the ground and he trod on your arm? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The arm - did he ever tread on your arm? 
         
        A. When I covered my stomach with them. 
        
       
       
       … 
       
       
        
        Q. And that arm was not covering your stomach at the time was it? 
         
        A. Yes it was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It was in effect beside you on the ground? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And he trod on you really only the once didn’t he? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    36 The respondent said that before 20 August he found out that Ms Flick and family were going to move from Yagoona to Minto. He said that she had contacted him by using mobile phone text messages and they eventually agreed to meet. He was then asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. All right, could you tell the Court in your own words what happened during the course of the conversation which led to the assault of Kylie and the loss of her unborn child? 
         
        A. We were talking for about 30 minutes and we were just talking about things. She told me I was going to pay for the baby for the rest of my life, that I’d better start working to get money and she threatened to tell my girlfriend Melanie that Kylie was pregnant to me and just then later on I seen her smoking and -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say later on she was smoking, did she light up a smoke or something? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In front of you? 
        
       
       A. Yes. 
       
       … 
       
        
        Q. When she lit up the smoke in front of you, what reaction did that have on you, given everything that had transpired up until that night? 
         
        A. I just asked her why she was still smoking and she said – she said “Oh not you too”, she said everyone else has told her to quit but she can’t, she said she couldn’t quit and she was still smoking. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you get angry at that stage? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you do? 
         
        A. After we talked about her smoking and that? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yeah, what did you do then? 
         
        A. I was standing there and - or about a few seconds, then I just punched her, I got really - I just clicked and punched her in the stomach. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened to her? 
         
        A. She fell to the ground. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The punch to the stomach, that was a hard punch? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. She fell to the ground and what happened next? 
         
        A. When she fell back on the ground I stepped on her right arm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you do that? 
         
        A. I’m not quite sure.” 
        
       
      
    37 He denied during the course of questioning that he had ever stomped on the victim six or seven times. He was asked. 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you ever stomp on her stomach at all after she was on the ground? 
         
        A. No, I stomped on her right arm. 
        
       
       
       … 
       
        
       
        
        Q. What did you do after you stomped on her right arm, did you go somewhere? 
         
        A. Yes I ran off in the opposite direction of my house.” 
        
       
      
    38 The respondent was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor about this evidence. He confirmed in cross-examination that he had punched Ms Flick once and did not stomp on her stomach as alleged. He was then asked about stomping on her arm. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. I’m not sure. Stomped on - it wasn’t a stomp. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you do to her arm? 
         
        A. Yeah I stomped on her arm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where was her arm? 
         
        A. Right next to the - like on the side of her. 
         
        Q. Which arm was it? 
         
        A. Her right arm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you do it? 
         
        A. I’m not sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why her arm as opposed to any other part of her body? 
         
        A. It’s just there, it’s just what I done at the time, I wasn’t thinking, it’s just what I done at the time.” 
        
       
      
    39 Further on: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. So you punched her once in the stomach. Did you know she had a baby there? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you intentionally aim for her belly? 
         
        A. I wasn’t - at the time I wasn’t thinking, I just - everything, we were talking - everything was fine, then after -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Everything was fine was it? 
         
        A. We were talking - we were talking about things and then - then things got brought up about she was going to tell my girlfriend and then I seen her light up a smoke and … then I just lost it and punched her in the stomach, she fell over and then I stomped on her right arm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But why her stomach? 
         
        A. It was her right arm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Any why punch her in the stomach? … 
         
        A. I’m not sure but if I was … 112 kilos and in her statement she says I held her down and stomped on her stomach, at 112 kilos jumping on her stomach six or seven times and she says I also kicked her in the shin, if I’m holding her down how could I stomp on her stomach six or seven times and stomp her in the shin as well when the shin’s further down, it’s -- 
        
       
       
       … 
       
        
       
        
        Q. So you cannot be any clearer about why it was that you punched her in the stomach? 
         
        A. After that she lit up a smoke, I just -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did the cigarette smoking enrage you did it? 
         
        A. That and other things she was saying to me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Because you were concerned that it was going to damage her baby? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you went along and damaged her baby instead? 
         
        A. Yes but I just - it just happened, it’s not like I - I just clicked and done it, I didn’t have any - yes that is.” 
        
       
      
    40 The Crown cross-examined the respondent further on this issue: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q.  
        You intended the foetus harm or did you want to kill it? 
         
        A.  
        I did want to kill it at the time yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.  
        You wanted to kill it? 
         
        A.  
        Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.  
        And you’d wanted it aborted right from the time you heard Kylie was pregnant didn’t you? 
         
        A.  
        Yes I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And when you understood that she was not going to have an abortion you sought out two others to cause her to have a miscarriage didn’t you? 
         
        A. No I didn’t.” (emphasis supplied) 
        
       
      
    41 The Crown called Brianne McCarthy and Jessica Williams. The sentencing judge found that their recollections fluctuated. Jessica Williams said that she knew Ms Flick and that she became aware that Ms Flick was pregnant. She said that she recalled a conversation in which the respondent had offered her five hundred dollars to hit Ms Flick in the stomach. She said that in relation to this conversation, although it was suggested to have been in a jocular manner, that is not the way in which she interpreted it. Brianne McCarthy gave evidence that the respondent had offered Ms Williams and her “$500 to get rid of the baby for him”. She said she “didn’t think he was serious” … (because she) “didn’t think he was that type of person”. The sentencing judge found that the respondent said to Ms Williams words to the effect, “I’ll give you five hundred dollars if you bash Kylie but you’ve got to get her in the stomach”. 
     
      
    42 The Crown tendered a statement from Megan Halliday, a Registrar in Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Bankstown Hospital. She stated that at 9.30 pm on Tuesday 20 August 2002 she attended the birthing unit at Bankstown Hospital because Ms Flick had presented following an assault. On examination no foetal heartbeat was detected with a hand-held Doppler Ultrasound instrument. Doctor Halliday also performed a real-time ultrasound examination of the foetus and it did not show any foetal heart motion. Doctor Halliday noted that the patient had been to Bankstown Hospital previously on 31 July 2002 for an ultrasound which showed that the foetus was apparently grown and alive.  
     
      
    43 Before the sentencing judge Mr Steirn SC submitted that the Court should not accept Ms Flick as a witness of truth. 
     
      
    44 He also submitted that there was no objective evidence of injury, that the obstetrician who was the Registrar at the Bankstown Hospital could not discern any injury although there was pain in the wrist, and therefore the Court should find that the Crown had not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the event had occurred in the manner deposed to by Ms Flick and that more likely than not the event occurred in the manner to which the respondent deposed. He referred the Court to the medical evidence to suggest that the Court should find that it was improbable that the evidence of Ms Flick about how the incident occurred could be correct.  
     
      
    45 The sentencing judge concluded that the respondent was “a most unconvincing witness”.  
     
      
    46 He accepted Ms Flick’s evidence of the events of the evening “in a general way” where it conflicted with the evidence of the respondent. He found beyond reasonable doubt, accepting Ms Flick’s evidence, that she was struck probably with a punch, as the respondent admitted, causing her to fall to the ground. He was satisfied that the respondent did not just stomp as he put it on Ms Flick’s arm but that he stomped or stepped on her stomach. He accepted Ms Flick as to the number of times she felt that occurred. He found the respondent’s actions caused the injury to Ms Flick’s abdomen leading to the death of the foetus. 
     
      
    47 The Crown submitted before the sentencing judge that the position was that the respondent had from the time that he became aware that Ms Flick was pregnant been intent on securing either by consensual or non-consensual means the termination of the pregnancy. 
     
      
    48 The sentencing judge accepted the Crown’s submission. He found it established beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent, after ascertaining that Ms Flick was pregnant, had in mind up to and including 20 August 2002 the course upon which he embarked to achieve the termination of the pregnancy either by consent or otherwise. First, he sought that Ms Flick have an abortion. Secondly, the sentencing judge found the respondent’s thought processes were displayed by the conversations he had with Jessica Williams and Brianne McCarthy about offering them five hundred dollars if they would strike or hit Ms Flick in the stomach. His Honour concluded that whether his request to the two girls was jocular or otherwise, it was evidence that he intended to take this course. He noted that Jessica Williams said “the approach which he took to the matter had in the end a harder edge than being merely jocular”.49 The sentencing judge concluded that, having contacted her on a number of occasions, the respondent led Ms Flick to the view that as the 20 August approached he was responding to her in a caring way. However, the impression the respondent conveyed to Ms Flick was not genuine. Rather, as the sentencing judge found: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although the evidence of Kylie Flick is the [the respondent] made comments to her which convinced her that he was caring and induced her to the view that he was supportive,  
        I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was always his intention to achieve either by agreement or otherwise the termination of the pregnancy 
        .” (emphasis supplied) 
        
       
      
    50 The sentencing judge found the following facts in summary had been established beyond reasonable doubt: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. the respondent was born on 19 April 1983; 
         
         
        2. he had known Ms Flick for about three years before March 2002 living in the Yagoona area; 
         
         
        3. he and Ms Flick had consensual sexual intercourse on 24 March 2002 at his house; 
         
         
        4. as a consequence of this event Ms Flick became pregnant; 
         
         
        5. in April 2002 Ms Flick told the offender that she was pregnant having obtained confirmation by a test; 
         
         
        6. initially the offender did not believe that this was so. He did not at that stage or indeed at any stage have or consider having a continuing relationship with Ms Flick and had an existing relationship with a girl, Melanie; 
         
         
        7. Ms Flick had a not dissimilar view. She intended that if the child was born he would be brought up as part of the family with the assistance of her mother; 
         
         
        8. there were discussions between the offender and Ms Flick about the future of the child between April 2002 and August 2002; 
         
         
        9. the offender did have a discussion with both Brianne McCarthy and Ms Williams about receiving five hundred dollars for taking steps to strike Ms Flick in the stomach. This was an indication of his intention in respect of the future of the pregnancy; 
         
         
        10. the pregnancy was viable and had reached between twenty three and twenty five weeks with a developed male foetus as at 20 August 2002; 
         
         
        11. the offender and Ms Flick met after arrangements were made between them by mobile phone and SMS messaging; 
         
         
        12. the meeting occurred late on 20 August 2002; 
         
         
        13. they discussed various aspects of the future of Ms Flick as she was moving to Minto. Ms Flick did not state to the offender that he would have to look after the child for the rest of his life in the form he deposed nor did she say that she would in a positive form as alleged by the offender, tell Melanie of the pregnancy; 
         
         
        14. the offender more likely than not punched Ms Flick in the stomach causing her to fall to the ground; 
         
         
        15. when she was on the ground the respondent stomped on her stomach five or six times and also struck her shin and also her wrist; 
         
         
        16. the assault caused the injuries to Ms Flick causing the death of the foetus. 
        
       
       
      Remarks on sentence 
      
    51 The sentencing judge incorporated the findings of fact made in his judgment of 3 June 2004 into his sentencing remarks.  
     
      
    52 There was no issue before the sentencing judge that, having regard to the nature of the offence, no penalty other than imprisonment was appropriate: s 5(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). 
     
      
    53 The sentencing judge noted that in determining an appropriate sentence there were competing considerations to take into account. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the one hand there is the seriousness of the offence itself. In this case, the injury to the mother and the death of the foetus. These matters are recognised both by the legislature and the community as serious crimes. That recognition must be addressed in the sentence imposed. In that context, it must be remembered that it is an important role of the law to act so as to so far as possible, protect citizens in our state and punish those who cause injury to them.” 
        
       
      
    54 His Honour then referred also to the necessity for the Court to consider the factual content and circumstances of the offence, the blameworthiness of the perpetrator and that care must be taken not to concentrate mainly on the subjective considerations of the perpetrator but that regard should also be had to the effect of the offence on Ms Flick’s family.  
     
      
    55 In this respect he said that: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is necessary for the Court to give consideration to the factual content and circumstances of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        Dealing with the blameworthiness of the perpetrator and taking into account all of the other factors that the law requires [c]are must be taken not to concentrate solely or mainly on the subjective considerations of the perpetrator. There is great sadness in the family of the victim, Kylie Flick, which has been expressed. It would be understandable in the circumstances that there is a sense of grievance against the [respondent] as their lives have been diminished by the events that have occurred and this is a relevant issue to note. The events that have occurred and the result of what happened can never be compensated by any sentence that the Court may impose and  
        it is for that reason that the Court takes into account in the way in which the law says it can, the victim impact statement which was tendered by the Crown in this case 
        . I do not propose to refer to all of the matters that appear in that victim impact statement but I have taken into account everything that appeared in it and noted what was said and the reaction and distress it conveyed.” (emphasis supplied) 
        
       
      
    56 In reminding himself of the nature of the charge to which the respondent had pleaded guilty, the sentencing judge extracted passages from the Chief Justice’s judgment in the stay proceedings, including paragraphs [95], [96] and [97] to which I have referred. 
     
      
    57 Following his reference to those passages the sentencing judge directed himself that he was required to sentence the respondent “upon the basis of the determination of the Court of Criminal Appeal”. He also reminded himself that it was necessary to bear in mind that the Court was sentencing in respect of an offence under s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and not some other offence. He referred to Gibbs CJ’s statement in R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383 at 389 to the effect that a sentence should take account of the circumstances of the offence but not punish the perpetrator for an offence for which he had not been convicted. 
     
      
    58 His Honour then dealt with subjective and objective factors in the following manner. 
     
      
       
      Effect of the plea of guilty 
      
    59 The sentencing judge found that the respondent’s plea was entered at the earliest opportunity after the Court of Criminal Appeal had determined the permanent stay proceedings. 
     
      
    60 However, he concluded that the respondent was only entitled to a discount at the lower level of the range referred to in R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty having regard to the manner in which the sentencing proceeded. This was because, despite the plea of guilty, most of the facts of the matter were disputed which led to Ms Flick, Ms McCarthy and Ms Williams having to give evidence and be cross-examined. His Honour appears to have acceded to Mr Steirn SC’s submission that the plea had some utilitarian value because it avoided the necessity of calling a jury and conducting a fully adversarial trial. 
     
      
    61 He concluded that “something around” 15% was the maximum the Court could allow for the plea of guilty. 
     
      
       
      Remorse and contrition 
      
    62 During the sentencing hearing the respondent was asked about his reaction to hearing the child had been lost. He gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When you found out that [Ms] Flick had lost her baby, what reaction did that have on you? 
         
        A. At first I - it was - not, like I was a bit upset because - well I was upset because it’s not something I intended to do and I wasn’t - I don’t know what I was thinking, I was in the police cells and I was -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Since that time you’ve had plenty of time to think being in gaol for that length of time. Are you sorry for what occurred to [Ms Flick]? 
         
        A. Yes I’m very sorry for what happened to [Ms Flick] …” 
        
       
      
    63 Mrs King gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Had you spoken to him about how sorry he is as to what happed to [Ms Flick] and the foetus being aborted? 
         
        A. Yes, he’s very sorry that it happened.” 
        
       
      
    64 The sentencing judge referred to a report of a Mr Taylor, a clinical forensic psychologist, which was tendered on the respondent’s behalf, in which the following appeared: 
     
      
       
        
        “He believes he felt very threatened when the alleged victim said that she would ruin his life. He said that after attacking the victim, “I just ran off, I wasn’t thinking anything”. He said he was not trying to avoid the police by running off because he knew that his mother would tell the police that he was at his girlfriend’s house. He said he went to his girlfriend’s house and went to bed.”  
        
       
      
    65 On the question of remorse Mr Taylor noted:  
     
      
       
        
        “He said he now feels ‘it wasn’t the right thing to do - it wasn’t planned to happen - it just happened at the time. It wasn’t planned on - it was just a bad thing that happened’.” 
        
       
      
    66 The sentencing judge accepted that, having regard to the facts and circumstances outlined in his judgment of 3 June, the respondent’s submission that there were “real indications of remorse and contrition… must be approached with some reserve”. 
     
      
    67 He concluded that the expressions of contrition and remorse which could be gleaned from the plea of guilty, the statements made by the respondent during the course of his evidence, the evidence of his mother and his statements to the psychologist in 2003 should receive generally little weight having regard to the manner in which they were expressed and the circumstances in which they were expressed. 
     
      
    68 I interpolate to note that in the light of the sentencing judge’s findings that Ms Flick had not threatened to ruin the respondent’s life and that the respondent had planned the termination of the pregnancy from April 2002, his Honour’s rejection of the respondent’s expressions of remorse was clearly correct. 
     
      
       
      The respondent’s health and mental issues 
      
    69 The respondent sought to establish that the offence was committed in circumstances which were affected by a head injury he had suffered when he fell off his bicycle when he was 10 or 11 years of age. Mr Taylor, the psychologist, concluded on the basis of the history he received of the accident and from his review of the hospital records, that the respondent had a “significant head injury” and this was consistent with the history his mother gave that “he was easily frustrated and irritable”. However, Mr Taylor also qualified his opinion by saying that it would be important to obtain the opinion of a neurologist concerning the consequences of traumatic brain injury. No neurologist’s report was tendered. 
     
      
    70 The sentencing judge concluded that the respondent had not established that he had sustained, or continued to have, or did have at the time of the offence, any brain injury. However, he said he would take into account the behavioural changes his mother had observed and related to the psychologist. 
     
      
    71 The sentencing judge noted that it had never been suggested during the respondent’s evidence that he suffered from any defect in understanding rendering him unable to know what to do, or what he should do, in relation to the events between March 2002 and August 2002. Nor, he observed, had it been put to any of the witnesses that they had observed any defect in the respondent’s ability to concentrate or appropriately interact with any person in terms of his daily social activities. 
     
      
    72 Accordingly, he concluded that the submission that sequelae of the head injury were causally relevant to the commission of the offence should receive little weight. 
     
      
       
      The manner in which the sentence was likely to be served 
      
    73 The sentencing judge noted that the respondent said that he had been bashed by a number of prisoners when he entered the prison system and had been in protective custody for the majority of the time since his incarceration. 
     
      
    74 Mindful of this Court’s statements that it could not always be assumed that protective custody was more onerous than custody in the general prison population (see R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97), his Honour had called for additional evidence to be tendered in relation to this issue. That evidence demonstrated to his satisfaction that there were a number of options available to those who are kept in protective custody. In particular, his Honour noted the passage in R v Mostyn, above, at [179] – [180] where Howie J (with whom Studdert J and I agreed on this point) to the effect that special arrangements existed for those in protective custody which do not reflect the harsh conditions or degree of isolation and lack of access to programmes which prisoners had to endure in the past. Accordingly, while his Honour concluded that he was satisfied that the respondent would from time to time spend time in restricted custody, the weight which should be given to that had to be balanced by reference to such special arrangements. 
     
      
       
      Rehabilitation 
      
    75 The sentencing judge accepted that the respondent had attempted to rehabilitate himself. 
     
      
       
      Age of the respondent 
      
    76 The respondent was 19 at the time he committed the offence, having been born on 19 April 1983. The sentencing judge took into account the respondent’s youth but also the remarks of this Court in R v Pham (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135 where Lee CJ at CL (with whom Gleeson CJ and Hunt J agreed) observed that: 
     
      
       
        
         “The gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens, must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court’s function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution will not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes.” 
        
       
      
    77 He acknowledged, in this respect, the “serious nature of the offence” and “the need for appropriate punishment to reflect the attitude of the community to that issue”. 
     
      
       
      Section 21A  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      
    78 The sentencing judge concluded that in determining the appropriate sentence he should take into account the aggravating factors referred to in s 21A(2)(b) (actual or threatened violence), (f) (offence involving gratuitous cruelty), (g) (offence caused substantial injury, emotional harm, loss or damage) and (l) (vulnerability of the victim). 
     
      
    79 He also took into account the mitigating factors referred to in s 21A(3)(e) (no prior record), (f) (offender a person of good character), (g) (offender unlikely to re-offend), (h) (good prospects of rehabilitation), (i) (offender has shown remorse) and (k) (plea of guilty). 
     
      
       
      Non-parole period 
      
    80 Having regard to the respondent’s prospect of rehabilitation, his youth, the fact that this would be the first time he would be in prison and that he would need a longer period than usual after his release to assist him in his rehabilitation, the sentencing judge found special circumstances for the purposes of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
       
      Criminality of the offence 
      
    81 The sentencing judge dealt with the degree of criminality of the offence last in his sentencing remarks. He said this involved a “vexed question”, “not because … there was not serious injury caused, but because the nature of this case was certainly unusual, if not unique”. 
     
      
    82 He noted that the maximum penalty was twenty-five years imprisonment. He referred to R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131 in which the Court of Criminal Appeal (Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J) in its joint judgment said, in referring to s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that in order to determine what was “an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness”, that it was necessary for the judge to determine what was “an abstract offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness” (at [74]). 
     
      
    83 He noted the Crown’s submissions that the offence was “very serious”, “above mid range” although not in “the worst category”. The Crown argued that the offence was “a serious example of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm” and that while the victim had not suffered a permanent injury such as paraplegia or brain injury, “she nevertheless suffered a permanent loss”. The Crown contended that the case was serious and pointed to the fact that the respondent had planned the offence and that the assault was sustained. 
     
      
    84 The Crown referred the judge to authorities in which significant penalties had been imposed upon persons who had been involved in very violent assaults as well as to two Queensland decisions each of which involved an assault upon a pregnant woman which had caused the demise of the foetus.  
     
      
    85 While the sentencing judge regarded the Queensland cases as providing some point of reference for the Court in considering the approach to what he described as “a very unusual form of injury committed in the form in which I found it”, he regarded those other cases as being distinguishable. (Although he did not articulate the distinctions, I understand them to be that in both Queensland cases the assault was not premeditated and in one, R v Huston, Queensland Supreme Court, unreported, 19 March 2003, the offence was committed while the offender was in a cannabis induced psychosis). He concluded that the starting point for the focus of the sentence should be at the upper limit of the mid range. 
     
      
    86 He said he had reached that conclusion having regard to the purposes for which the Court is to impose a sentence on an offender referred to in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    87 His Honour then referred again to the victim impact statement and said he had taken it into account when determining the sentence but “conformably with authority, see R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 and Bollen v R (1998) 99 A Crim R 510 [have] not made use of it so as to increase the penalty that would otherwise be imposed”. 
     
      
    88 Finally he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is … a difficult matter to determine the appropriate sentence to be imposed in the circumstances of this case.  
        It was submitted by Mr Steirn of senior counsel that there were a number of victims in this case and that the offender was one of them 
        . Whilst he made that submission, this, in my opinion, significantly overstates the way in which this sentencing process is to be considered. I have already indicated previously that it is necessary not to just focus on the offender, but to focus on the established facts of the offence to determine, notwithstanding the age of the offender and the plea of guilty and the way in which he will spend his time in prison, an appropriate sentence to reflect these matters.” (emphasis supplied) 
        
       
      
    89 As I have earlier indicated, the sentencing judge found special circumstances pursuant to which he varied the statutory ratio between the respondent’s head sentence and the non-parole period. Accordingly, he sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for 10 years to commence on 21 August 2002 and expire on 20 August 2012. In accordance with the amended Schedule under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act he specified a non-parole period to expire on 20 February 2009 which was the first date upon which the respondent would be eligible for consideration for release on parole. 
     
      
       
      The severity appeal: the respondent’s submissions 
      
    90 Mr Steirn SC submitted the sentencing judge had imposed an excessive sentence because, by taking s 21A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) into account in his remarks on sentence, he had treated as an aggravating factor a matter which was an element of the offence contrary to the concluding phrase of s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That provides that the “court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.” 
     
      
    91 Mr Steirn SC referred to R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 at [22] where Howie J (with whom Bell and Hislop JJ agreed), after referring to the concluding phrase of s 21A(2), said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The effect and policy behind such a limitation is self-evident: there should be no double counting of aggravating features of an offence.” 
        
       
      
    92 Mr Steirn SC also submitted that the sentence ultimately imposed did not reflect the sentencing judge’s finding that the starting point for the focus of the sentence should be at the upper limit of the mid range. In support of this submission he relied upon the following: 
     
      
       
      (a) Judicial Commission sentencing statistics tendered at the sentence proceedings relating to all offenders convicted of an offence contrary to s 33  
      Crimes Act  
      showed 196 offenders, of whom 161 received non-consecutive full-time custodial sentences. Of those 161 offenders, on the full term only 6% received a greater sentence and 5% a similar sentence to the respondent. In relation to non-parole periods, only 4% received a greater sentence and 1% a similar sentence. 
       
       
      (b) At the sentence proceedings his Honour was referred to  
      R v Huston  
      (Queensland Supreme Court, unreported, 19 March 2003) and  
      R v Lippiat  
      (Queensland District Court, unreported, 24 May 1996) in each of which lesser sentences were imposed upon offenders who assaulted pregnant women, in both cases leading to the death of the unborn child. The respondent conceded that the Queensland decisions were made in relation to an offence carrying a lesser maximum sentence however contended that the sentences imposed provide some guidance. 
       
      
    93 Mr Steirn SC also submitted that having regard to the many mitigating factors the sentencing judge said he took into account the sentence imposed indicated that he started the focus of the sentence well above the “upper limit of the mid range”.  
     
      
      The severity appeal: the Crown’s submissions 
      
    94 The Crown conceded that the sentencing judge’s reference to s 21A(2)(b) indicated that his Honour appeared not to have taken the concluding words of s 21A(2) into account. It properly drew the Court’s attention to R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 (at [58] and [64]) where Spigelman CJ (with whom Hidden and Buddin JJ agreed) held that where a sentencing judge failed to take into account the concluding words of s 21A(2) and had additional regard to subs (2)(b) in sentencing an applicant for an offence under s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the Court was entitled to intervene and re-exercise the sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    95 The Crown also conceded it was possible the sentencing judge made a similar error in taking into account s 21A(2)(g) (aggravating factor where the injury caused by the offence was substantial). It noted that in re-exercising the sentencing discretion in Cramp, Spigelman CJ (at [65]) was also critical of the sentencing judge’s consideration of that factor because the offence under s 33 requires the infliction of grievous bodily harm so that the injury is necessarily “substantial”.  
     
      
    96 The Crown contended that if, in citing s 21A(2)(g), Delaney DCJ intended to refer only to the physical injury inflicted on Ms Flick, his Honour arguably erred in the same manner as the sentencing judge in Cramp. However, it contended that Delaney DCJ might also have had in mind the substantial “emotional harm, loss or damage” which the victim and her family suffered as a result of the offence factors which are also referred to in s 21A(2)(b). 
     
      
    97 The Crown accepted that in R v Wickham, above, at [32], Howie J acknowledged that taking an aggravating factor into account when it is also an element of the offence in question “would normally indicate that the sentencing exercise has miscarried”. However, it submitted that in accordance with s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 it did not automatically follow that a lesser sentence was “warranted in law”. It drew attention to R v Astill (No 2) (1992) 64 A Crim R 289 at 304 where Lee AJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “When an appeal is brought under s 5(1) [of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
        ] it may well be that the court will consider the sentence passed to be ‘warranted in law’ even though the court may not be in agreement with the weight assigned by the sentencing judge to particular features, or his selection of the substantial matters which guide him to his conclusion. In such a case the appeal fails. Even where the court concludes that the judge has made a mistake of law, the court may still hold that the sentence is not excessive and should stand.” 
        
       
      
    98 The Crown noted that R v Wickham was an example of a case where, despite a double counting error, the Court did not impose a lesser sentence. Howie J considered the sentence in that case to be bordering on inadequate, and concluded (at [32]) that “there was in fact no miscarriage in that case as no lesser sentence was warranted”.  
     
      
    99 The Crown also referred to R v Cocking [1999] NSWCCA 311 at [22] – [24] where Sully J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Grove J agreed), after referring with approval to Lee J’s statement in R v Astill (No 2), also referred to R v Oastler (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 7 October 1992). In the latter case it was clearly demonstrated that the sentencing judge had made significant errors of law in his perception of the operation of relevant sections of the then sentencing code now embodied in the Commonwealth Crimes Act. Lee AJ had been a member of the Court in R v Oastler and took the approach he adopted in R v Astill (No 2). Sully J pointed out that Gleeson CJ, while agreeing with Lee AJ, added the following comment:  
     
      
       
        
        ""I agree with the orders proposed by Lee AJ and, in particular, I agree that although the applicant has succeeded in demonstrating that some of the steps involved in the process of reasoning of the learned sentencing judge involved some misapprehension on his Honour's part as to the effect of the relevant legislation, nevertheless the sentence ultimately imposed was not excessive.""  
        
       
      
    100 The Crown submitted that the sentence in the present case was inadequate, for the reasons advanced in its submissions on the Crown Appeal. It also contended that if the Court re-exercised the sentencing discretion on the basis of the sentencing judge’s apparent misapplication of s 21A(2)(b), and possibly s 21A(2)(g), of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the objective seriousness of the offence required the imposition of a sentence of at least the period determined by Delaney DCJ, if not a greater period. Disregarding one, and even two, of the aggravating factors in s 21A(2) would not, the Crown submitted, result in a diminution of the sentence. 
     
      
    101 Turning to the complaint that the sentence was manifestly excessive, the Crown submitted that the remarks on sentence, when read in their entirety, demonstrated that the sentencing judge clearly considered each mitigating factor which arose in this case, and the appropriate weight to give each factor, in determining the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    102 It submitted that given the weight the sentencing judge attributed to the various mitigating factors, the impact on the sentence of those factors did not lead to the conclusion that his Honour “actually started the focus of the sentence well above ‘the upper limit of the mid range’ ”. 
     
      
       
      The Crown appeal: the Crown’s submissions 
      
    103 The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge erred in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence in characterising the offence only in the upper limit of the mid range. The Crown submitted that the objective seriousness was in the high range and his Honour’s sentence, because it commenced at the upper limit of the mid range, was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    104 The Crown submitted that the significant features of the criminality or objective seriousness that took this case into the high range were: 
     
      
       
      (a) The malicious wounding of the victim by the respondent had the effect of killing the foetus (regarded by the law as part of the mother) that was otherwise healthy and viable; 
       
       
      (b) The killing of the foetus was intended by the respondent; 
       
       
      (c) The respondent had decided for a considerable period of time that he wanted the victim’s foetus killed; 
       
       
      (d) The respondent attempted to procure other persons to kill the victim’s foetus for financial reward and when those attempts failed took the opportunity himself to attack the victim; and 
       
       
      (e) The respondent knocked the victim to the ground without warning, pinned her down and repeatedly stomped on her stomach, multiple times, with the specific intent of killing the foetus. In the course of that attack the victim attempted to protect her stomach and suffered injuries to her wrist and shin as a result. 
       
      
    105 The Crown submitted, in substance, that the sentencing judge failed to give due weight to these matters. 
     
      
    106 The Crown submitted that the circumstances of this case were more serious than those in R v Lippiat (Queensland District Court, unreported, 24 May 1996) because of the degree of planning, including offers of financial reward, and the repeated ‘stomping’ of the respondent’s foot on the victim’s stomach. 
     
      
    107 Similarly, the Crown submitted the case was more serious than R v Huston (Queensland Supreme Court, unreported, 19 March 2003) because of the specific intent to kill the foetus that had been held by the respondent for a considerable period of time, the degree of planning and repeated ‘stomping’ of his foot on her stomach. 
     
      
    108 The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge’s error could be demonstrated as follows. His Honour allowed a discount for the plea of guilty of about 15%. He made some allowance for the likelihood that the respondent would spend time in more restrictive custody than would otherwise be the case “so far as weight can be given to it” and perhaps gave some small allowance for some expression of remorse by the respondent beyond his plea of guilty. He also took into account s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and the relatively small number of Judicial Commission statistics provided. In arriving at a ten-year term, therefore, his Honour must have commenced with a starting point in the range of perhaps 12 to 13 years for the head sentence, assuming the allowance for protective custody was not a large one, or, without being able to quantify the figure precisely, a somewhat higher starting point if a greater allowance was made for protective custody.  
     
      
       
      The Crown appeal: the respondent’s submissions 
      
    109 The respondent submitted that the Crown had not identified any error in the sentencing judge’s reasoning process. The respondent submitted that the sentencing judge’s reasoning process was sound and that in concluding that “the starting point for the focus of the sentence should be at the upper limit of the mid range”, the sentencing judge was exercising a discretion and his finding was open to him. 
     
      
    110 The respondent criticised the Crown’s attempt to demonstrate the sentencing judge’s error in its submission that the sentencing judge must have commenced with the starting point in the range of 12 to 13 years for the head sentence. The respondent submitted that process of analysis was inappropriate having regard to the “instinctive synthesis approach” to sentencing approved by Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Wong v R [2001] HCA 64 at [75] – [78]; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 661. 
     
      
    111 The respondent made the following submissions in the event that the Court was of the view that the sentencing judge had erred: 
     
      
      (a) that the sentence imposed demonstrated that the sentencing judge started the focus of the sentence well above “the upper limit of the mid range”. In support of this submission the respondent relied on his written submissions in support of his application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence. 
       
       
      (b) that the Crown’s submissions rely upon an assumption that a starting point of 12 or 13 years was not within the high range. The respondent submitted that there was no basis for this assumption. 
       
       
      (c) if this Court were to interfere with the sentence it would require the Court to distinguish between the starting points for a sentence at the “upper limit of the mid range” with a sentence starting at the lower end of the “high” range. The respondent referred to  
      Dinsdale v The Queen  
      [2000] HCA 54 at [62]; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 341 where Kirby J said: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “… where such demonstration succeeds, it is conventional for the appellate court to impose a substituted sentence towards the lower end of the range of available sentences. This convention tends to add an additional restraint upon interference, given the strong resistance that exists against appellate “tinkering” with sentences.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    112 The respondent submitted that the Crown was seeking to have the Court “tinker” with the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
       
      The application for leave to appeal 
      
    113 I accept that the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence are open to the interpretation for which the respondent contends, that in referring to s 21A(2)(b) and, as the Crown concedes, possibly s 21A(2)(g), he took into account as matters of aggravation two elements which were also elements of the offence. It is not clear how he took s 21A(2)(b) into account for he did not identify in his remarks on sentence his assessment of the degree of violence involved. Equally, he did not identify which of the factors enumerated in s 21A(2)(g) he took into account. I am prepared to infer, in the respondent’s favour, that he wrongly took the first, “injury”, into account and may therefore have double counted. 
     
      
    114 However, having regard to the conclusion I have reached on the Crown’s appeal that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate, no lesser sentence was warranted: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). 
     
      
    115 In his oral submissions Mr Steirn SC also argued that the sentencing judge ought to have extended the respondent leniency because of the uncertainty to which he had been subject by virtue of the time taken to determine whether the s 33 charge was open in law: cf R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 – 520 per Street CJ (with whose reasons the other members of the Court agreed); Mill v R  [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 66. 
     
      
    116 In my opinion the circumstances in which the sentencing proceedings were deferred pending disposition of the stay proceedings do not attract the principles in Todd and Mill. The offence is not “stale” in the sense used in those cases. The fact is that the respondent chose to test the uncertain state of the law by applying for a permanent stay rather than, for example, standing trial and seeking an acquittal either by asking for a directed verdict on the basis the indictment did not disclose an offence or putting himself in the hands of the jury: cf R v King, above, at [25]. While, of course, the respondent is not to be penalised for moving for a permanent stay (and is not, in fact, because his sentence dates from the date of the offence), nor should he have the benefit of the premise underlying the Todd principle, that the sentencing proceedings should have been resolved earlier. 
     
      
    117 I would grant the respondent leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    118 I turn then to the Crown appeal. 
     
      
       
      Crown Appeals: principles 
      
    119 The principles concerning Crown appeals against sentence were summarised by Wood CJ at CL (with whom Meagher JA and Bell J agreed) in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499, applies to Crown appeals against sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion, as to the appropriate sentence, for that of the sentencing judge:  
        Lowndes v The Queen 
         (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown;  
        R v Tait 
         (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen  
        (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 58 and 109. 
         
         
        (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
        Malvaso v The Queen  
        (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere:  
        R v Baker 
         [2000] NSWCCA 85. 
         
         
        (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle “for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons”: per Barwick CJ in  
        Griffiths v The Queen 
         (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
        Everett v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299;  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        (2000) 202 CLR 32, at paras 61 and 62,  
        and Wong & Leung v The Queen 
         at para 109. 
         
         
        (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
        R v Allpass 
         (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
        R v Papazis 
         (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         at para 110. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
        R v Holder and Johnston 
         (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        at para 62.” 
        
       
      
    120 The principles to which Wood CJ at CL referred in paragraph (a) require some elaboration. The meaning of patent error is plain. However the nature of latent error which may attract judicial intervention is somewhat more elusive. In House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505 Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ said the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for the sentencing judge, although the nature of the error was not discoverable, “if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust” so that the appellate court could infer that there had been “a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance.”  
     
      
    121 In Cranssen v R (1936) 55 CLR 509 at 520, delivered two days after the decision in House v The King, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ reiterated that in reviewing the adequacy of a sentence, “it is not necessary that some definite or specific error should be assigned” and that “[t]he nature of the sentence itself, when considered in relation to the offence and the circumstances of the case, may be such as to afford convincing evidence that in some way the exercise of the discretion has been unsound.” 
     
      
    122 Most recently in Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 605 [58], Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ referred to the two situations in which an appellate court may conclude that a trial judge's exercise of discretion has miscarried, as being “cases of specific error of principle” and “the residuary category of error which, in the field of sentencing appeals, is usually described as manifest excess or manifest inadequacy…[when] the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons.” Kirby J said (at [109]), “Where specific error of sentencing principle is not demonstrated and the complaint is one of manifest inadequacy of the sentence, it is only where it is shown that the ‘sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range that [a court] is ever justified in granting leave to the Crown to appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence’. ” 
     
      
      Determining the sentence 
      
    123 This Crown’s challenge to the adequacy of the sentence falls to be determined against the backdrop of Jordan CJ’s famous aphorism about sentencing that ""the only golden rule is that there is no golden rule"": R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554 at 555. Having said that, however, his Honour observed that a judge should impose such punishment as:  
     
      
       
        
        "" ... having regard to all the proved circumstances of the particular case, seems, at the same time, to accord with the general moral sense of the community in relation to such a crime committed in such circumstances and to be likely to be a sufficient deterrent both to the prisoner and to others.""  
        
       
      
      
      This maxim, unsurprisingly, continues to apply: see  
      Lupton v R 
       [2003] NSWCCA 200 per O’Keefe J (Sheller JA and James J agreeing);  
      R v Stringer 
       [2000] NSWCCA 293; (2000) 116 A Crim R 198 per Grove J at [102];  
      R v Kalache 
       [2000] NSWCCA 2; (2000) 111 A Crim R 152 at [97] per Sully J (with whom Hidden J agreed);  
      R v Cuthbert  
      (1967) 86 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 272 at 274;  
      R v Rushby 
       [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 at 598. 
       
      
    124 The legislative context in which the sentence was imposed appears from s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows:  
         
         
          
          (a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,  
          (b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,  
          (c) to protect the community from the offender,  
          (d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,  
          (e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, (f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,  
          (g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    125 In Re Attorney General's Application under S 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 2 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 515 at [57]; (2002) 137 A Crim R 196 Spigelman CJ (with whom Wood CJ at CL, Grove, Sully and James JJ agreed) suggested that the introduction of s 3A in 2002 might alter the application of pre-existing sentencing principles, but expressed no view about the matter as it had not been argued.  
     
      
    126 In R v M A [2004] NSWCCA 92 at [23] Dunford J (with whom Studdert and James JJ agreed) said that s 3A is in substance a codification and elaboration of the purposes of criminal punishment described in Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476, an observation referred to without demur in Re Application By Attorney General (No 3 of 2002) [2004] NSWCCA 303 at [46] by Howie J (with whom Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL, Grove and Dunford JJ agreed).  
     
      
    127 In Veen v R (No 2), above, at 476, Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions.” 
        
       
      
    128 Section 3A was inserted in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 by Schedule 1, cl 1 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Bill. The Bill was intended to provide “further guidance and structure to judicial discretion in sentencing”: Second Reading Speech, New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 23 October 2002, at p 5813. The fact that s 3A was intended to reflect the principles I have quoted from Veen v R (No 2) is made plain in the Second Reading Speech to the Bill during which the Attorney General, the Honourable Bob Debus MP, quoted the above passage from Veen v R (No 2) as explaining that the new Bill would operate in an area which requires “the exercise of a complex judicial discretion”: Second Reading Speech, New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 23 October 2002, at p 5815. 
     
      
    129 As Dunford J said in R v M A, above, at [23], the High Court in Veen v R (No 2) recognised the “troublesome but unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of those purposes which overlap”.  
     
      
    130 Troublesome though the task may be, it is essential that the sentence reflect the factors set out in s 3A. The fact that s 3A confers a discretion upon the sentencing judge as to the factors to be taken into account does not detract from that proposition. It reflects legislative recognition of the principles in Veen v R (No 2) and, in particular, the necessity to reconcile and rationalise the s 3A purposes in considering the sentence appropriate to the particular offence. The sentencing judge must reach an “instinctive synthesis” which takes account of and balances the “conflicting and contradictory” factors which bear upon the sentencing exercise: Wong v R, above, at 611 [75].131 The nature of the exercise undertaken when imposing a sentence of imprisonment under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was outlined by Howie J (with whom Hodgson JA and Levine J agreed) in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [23]: 
     
      
       
        
        “23 It is clear that, when sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment under that Act, a court is required to undertake a number of steps before finally determining the appropriate sentence. Each step requires the court to consider the objective gravity of the offence balanced against the subjective circumstances of the offender, but it is the first of those considerations that will principally determine which of the available sentencing alternatives the court should adopt. This is because at the end of the day the sentence must be commensurate with the seriousness of the crime:  
        R v Geddes 
         (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554;  
        R v Rushby 
         [1977] 1 NSWLR 594.” 
        
       
      
    132 Although the sentence imposed is described as an “instinctive synthesis”, the sentencing judge is obliged to state fully the reasons for determining the sentence. The significance of reasons is well known however deserves restatement in the sentencing context. One of the purposes of the statement of reasons is to ensure that an appellate court can review the reasoning process: Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 276 – 281; R v McDonald (1998) 28 MVR 432 per Spigelman CJ at 437.  
     
      
    133 Significantly, in the criminal context, reasons have an additional purpose. They serve to ensure that the criminal law is “administered publicly in such a fashion that its activities can be understood by ordinary citizens and regarded by them as conforming with the community’s generally accepted standards which are fair and just”: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 622 [39] per McHugh J, Hayne J and Callinan J quoting Sir John Barry. In addition, as Brennan J said in Jago v District Court (NSW)  [1989] HCA 46; (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 50: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the victims of crime, who are not ordinarily parties to prosecutions on indictment and whose interests have generally gone unacknowledged until recent times, must be able to see that justice is done if they are not to be driven to self-help to rectify their grievances.” 
        
       
      Objective criminality 
      
    134 In order to determine the appropriate sentence, the sentencing judge was required to identify the objective criminality of the offence as well as take subjective factors into account. In the former respect, it is relevant to note this Court’s statement in R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354: 
     
      
       
        
        “As Jordan CJ pointed out in  
        Geddes 
         at 556, making due allowance for all relevant considerations, there ought to be a reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime…  
        it is always important in seeking to determine the sentence appropriate to a particular crime to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, for without this assessment the other factors requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place. 
         Each crime, as  
        Veen (No 2 
        ) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472; 33 A Crim R 230 at 234 stresses, has its own objective gravity meriting at the most a sentence proportionate to that gravity, the maximum sentence fixed by the legislature defining the limits of sentence for cases in the most grave category. The relative importance of the objective facts and subjective features of a case will vary: see, for example, the passage from the judgment of Street CJ in  
        Todd 
         [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 quoted in  
        Mill  
        (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 64; 36 A Crim R 468.  
        Even so, there is sometimes a risk that attention to persuasive subjective considerations may cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective circumstances of the case 
        :  
        Rushby 
         [1977] 1 NSWLR 594.” (emphasis supplied) 
        
       
      
    135 In my opinion the Crown’s submission that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate weight to the criminality or objective seriousness of the offence is correct. Although, in dealing with objective criminality, he said he had reviewed the evidence which he found to be established beyond reasonable doubt, he did not identify what aspects of that evidence he regarded as relevant to determining the objective criminality of the offence.  
     
      
    136 Indeed, his Honour’s references to the issue of criminality as being “vexed”, to the “very unusual form of injury” and to the case being “unusual, if not unique” without elaboration indicate, to my mind, that he had some difficulty characterising the objective criminality of the offence.  
     
      
    137 The sentencing judge explained his conclusion that the starting point for the focus of the sentence should be the upper limit of the mid range by saying he had had “regard to the manner in which the offence was committed, taking into account s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, reviewing the statistics of the Judicial Commission … and keeping in mind the wide variety of facts and circumstances that apply to cases of this type”. 
     
      
    138 His Honour’s remarks concerning objective criminality gave little insight into his appreciation of the gravity of the offence. Nowhere did he express the reasoning process he adopted in undertaking the exercise referred to in Dodd of assessing the objective gravity of the offence. 
     
      
    139 Although he acknowledged the seriousness of the offence in the sense that he referred to “the injury to the mother and the death of foetus”, his Honour did not expressly have regard to the premeditated nature of the offence, the cold-blooded manner in which it was contrived, let alone the violence that accompanied it or the permanency of the injury inflicted. While he had earlier referred to taking into account the aggravating factors that the offence involved gratuitous cruelty (s 21A(2)(f) and the vulnerability of the victim (s 21A(2)(l)), he did not address those matters by reference to the circumstances of the actual offence. His Honour’s failure to refer to the factors which determined the objective seriousness of the offence would in many cases lead to the inference that they were not given weight: see R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [52] per Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
    140 It is impossible to discern from the remarks on sentence what, if any, weight the sentencing judge placed on the Crown’s submissions concerning the objective criminality of the offence. It is equally impossible to discern how he treated Mr Steirn SC’s submission that the respondent was also a “victim”. In the light of his Honour’s findings concerning the circumstances in which the offence was committed, I would have expected that submission to have been rejected out of hand. Instead his Honour merely said it “significantly overstates the way in which this sentencing process is to be considered”, a cryptic and impenetrable remark. 
     
      
    141 Further, while his Honour recited a list of s 21A(2) and (3) matters he said he took into account he did not explain how and to what extent they operated by way of aggravation or mitigation. Indeed some of the matters which his Honour listed, such as s 21A(3)(i), which is the factor mitigating a sentence where the offender has shown remorse, were inconsistent with his earlier finding that the respondent’s expressions of contrition and remorse should receive little weight. 
     
      
    142 His Honour’s failure to deal expressly with the objective features of the offence stands in stark contrast to the detail he accorded to the respondent’s subjective circumstances. It is apparent from that disparity in treatment that the sentencing judge fell into the error identified in R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 and allowed the respondent’s subjective considerations to cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    143 In my opinion the sentencing judge’s remarks concerning objective criminality fell far short of the obligation to state reasons expressed in Soulemezis, McDonald, Pearce and Jago. 
     
      
    144 His Honour’s failure to state his reasons in respect of the objective criminality of the offence is, itself, an error of law which would warrant setting aside his exercise of the sentencing discretion: R v McDonald (1998) 28 MVR 432 at 437. 
     
      
    145 His Honour was in error, in my opinion, in saying that the starting point for the focus of the sentence should be at the upper limit of the mid range. 
     
      
    146 The offence of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm carries the highest maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature short of life imprisonment. In sentencing the respondent, the sentencing judge was required to bear in mind that that maximum penalty reflected the seriousness with which the public, through the legislature, considered the type of criminal conduct to which s 33 is concerned: R v Zamagias, above, at [11]. Although his Honour referred to the significance of the maximum penalty, in my opinion he fell into error in not characterising the offence as being in the high range, as the Crown submitted. 
     
      
    147 The objective seriousness of this offence was grave. The offence was premeditated, having being planned on the sentencing judge’s findings from April 2002 when Ms Flick informed the respondent that she did not intend to have an abortion. Having been unable to dissuade Ms Flick from having an abortion, the respondent sought to achieve his end by other means. 
     
      
    148 First, he tried to enlist others by payment to do the deed for him. Having been unsuccessful in this respect, the respondent turned to achieve that result by a violent attack. 
     
      
    149 He executed the offence in a cold-blooded and callous manner. 
     
      
    150 First he lulled Ms Flick into a sense of false security by, as the sentencing judge found, making comments to her which convinced her he was caring and induced her to the view that he was supportive. He was in frequent communication with her by SMS and arranged to visit her the night before her move for the apparently benign purpose of bidding her farewell.  
     
      
    151 However the idea that he wished to farewell Ms Flick was a pretext. His intention was to kill the foetus. In other words he intended to cause precisely the serious bodily harm he inflicted. That fact alone indicates the gravity of the offence. 
     
      
    152 The assault itself, so far as Ms Flick was concerned, came out of the blue. It was unprovoked and involved sustained and substantial violence inflicted by a man who was clearly of significant physical proportions. He knocked Ms Flick to the ground, then brought his booted foot down upon her abdomen six or seven times. The force of the assault can be gauged not only from Ms Flick’s evidence, but also from Dr McCaffrey’s opinion that her uterus underwent “significant trauma” to produce the result of causing the haemorrhage to the placenta and the consequent draining of the foetus’s blood thus leading to its demise. 
     
      
    153 Further, the offence cause Ms Flick permanent loss, a consequence which was inevitable once the respondent successfully executed his plan of killing the foetus. 
     
      
    154 In addition to the grievous bodily harm directly consequent upon the assault, the sentencing judge had evidence before him that the assault had caused grave emotional harm to Ms Flick.  
     
      
    155 It was apparent from answers Ms Flick gave in cross-examination that she was still reliving the assault 18 months later. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And this assault that you tell us about, you say he stomped on you six or seven times. You certainly remember that don’t you? 
        A. I can still feel it of a night.” 
        
       
      
    156 In her victim impact statement Ms Flick said: 
     
      
       
        
        “When the doctor told me that they could not find Jonathan’s [the name she had given the child] heartbeat, I felt my world was falling apart … After [the funeral] I just withdrew. I didn’t want to talk to anyone. I did not feel comfortable around people. I felt that I couldn’t trust people or judge me [sic, as in original] for not stopping what happened, not preventing it. I thought that I should have protected Jonathan, that I should have known that Phil was going to do this, and that I should have stopped him. I thought I shouldn’t have seen him at all. I find that I cry while watching television, over any little thing. I never did this before. For the first six months after the offence I cried myself to sleep every night …” 
        
       
      
    157 In my opinion, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence, the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. His Honour’s errors are both patent, as appears from the matters to which I have referred, as well as latent, as appears from the fact that “[t]he nature of the sentence itself, when considered in relation to the offence and the circumstances of the case … afford convincing evidence that … the exercise of the discretion has been unsound”: Cranssen v R (1936) 55 CLR 509 at 520. 
     
      
    158 I would allow the Crown appeal. Before I consider the sentence which should be imposed, I consider two other matters which were debated during argument. 
     
      
       
      Deterrence and youth 
      
    159 The general principle relating to deterrence was set out in R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 at 597 by Street CJ who said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The law upon the matter of sentencing is well stated in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in New Zealand in  
        R v Radich 
        , a passage which has been cited in other judgments on numerous subsequent occasions: ‘one of the main purposes of punishment … is to protect the public from the commission of such crimes by making it clear to the offender and to other persons with similar impulses that, if they yield to them, they will meet with severe punishment. In all civilised counties, in all ages, that has been the main purpose of punishment, and it still continues so. The fact that punishment does not entirely prevent all similar crimes should not obscure the cogent fact that the fear of severe punishment does, and will, prevent the commission of many that would have been committed if it was thought that the offender could escape without punishment, or with only a light punishment. If a Court is weakly merciful, and does not impose a sentence commensurate with the seriousness of the crime, it fails in its duty to see that the sentences are such as to operate as a powerful factor to prevent the commission of such offences. On the other hand, justice and humanity both require that the previous character and conduct, and probable future life and conduct of the individual offender, and the effect of the sentence on these, should also be given the most careful consideration, although this factor is necessarily subsidiary to the main considerations that determine that appropriate amount of punishment.’ ” 
        
       
      
    160 Mr Steirn SC submitted that because this was an “exceedingly rare” offence committed by a young offender the general deterrence factor should give way to his youth. This was because, he contended, in the context of general deterrence, the most predominant factor was the frequency of the offence in the community. In this respect he relied upon the statement in R v Pham, above, to which the sentencing judge referred and which I have set out in [75]. 
     
      
    161 In my opinion this submission was fundamentally misconceived both as a matter of fact and law. 
     
      
    162 First, the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm is, regrettably, one of frequent occurrence. The Judicial Commission’s statistics for the offence from April 1997 to March 2004 show 211 such cases were dealt with by courts other than the Local Court, 84% of which resulted in a prison sentence for offenders with no prior convictions (a characterisation I am prepared to extend to the respondent, as did the sentencing judge, notwithstanding his record for earlier but relatively minor matters). 
     
      
    163 Secondly, if Mr Steirn SC’s submission was intended to refer to the fact that the “rarity” lay in the fact the grievous injury inflicted was to Ms Flick’s placental sac and the foetus and that she herself did not continue to suffer physical (as opposed to emotional) injury, it reflects a complete misunderstanding of the criminality of the offence. The offence to which the respondent pleaded guilty was of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. The manner in which that harm was inflicted cannot distract attention from the fact that the plea of guilty reflected recognition that he had inflicted serious physical injury: R v Sergi [1974] VR 1 at 6 per Winneke CJ, Smith and Menhennitt JJ (referring to the trial judge’s direction to the jury which was approved); R v Blevins (1988) 48 SASR 65. 
     
      
    164 Thirdly, the youth of the offender is only one matter to be taken into account in all the circumstances of the case. In R v M A, above, at [26], Dunford J rejected the proposition that favourable subjective circumstances such as youth and prospects of rehabilitation override or take precedence over deterrence, punishment and the protection of the community. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “[27] Deterrence, retribution and protection of the community are not to take precedence to the exclusion of rehabilitation, but neither is rehabilitation to take precedence over deterrence, retribution and punishment. All must be balanced in the overall synthesising of the sentence. 
         
        [28] It is true that in the case of young offenders, there is generally greater emphasis given to rehabilitation and less to deterrence than in the case of adult offenders, but that depends in part on the age of the young person and the circumstances of the offence; and there comes a point at which the seriousness of the crime committed by a young offender, particularly if a crime of violence, is so great that the special attention normally given to rehabilitation in the case of young offenders must give way, and greater emphasis given to punishment and deterrence. The relevant principle was summarised in the joint judgment of this court in 
         R v AEM Snr and Ors 
         [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [97]-[98] as follows: 
         
          
           
            
            It is well accepted that in the case of youth, general deterrence and public denunciation usually play a subordinate role to the need to have regard to individual treatment aimed at rehabilitation…. However, important as that principle is, it cannot defeat the primary purpose of punishment nor, in circumstances where young offenders conduct themselves in a way which an adult does, can it stand in the way of the need to protect society. 
            
           
          and their Honours quoted what had been said by Lee AJ in  
          R v Nichols 
           (1991) 57 A Crim R 391 at 395 as follows: 
           
            
            However there is a point at which the seriousness of the crime committed by a man of 19, even though a young man, is of such a nature is so great, that the principle must, in the public interest, give way.

    165 Moreover, even if the submission that the offence was “rare” was correct, that does not mean that consideration should not be given to the deterrent effect of the sentence. Indeed, in such cases the words of Abadee J in Taouk v R (1992) 65 A Crim R 387 at 417, uttered in the context of sentencing for the offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice, are apposite: “[a] deterrent sentence is called for to ensure that the offence which rarely occurs, does not become one of any greater frequency”, as too is his statement that “[t]he courts in sentencing must make it plain that this type of conduct will not be tolerated”. Such sentiments have equal resonance in the context of the infliction of grievous bodily harm intended to kill a foetus. 
     
      
    166 What was critical was that the respondent in a deliberate and cold-blooded manner assaulted Ms Flick because he had been unable to secure his objective either through persuasion or hiring others to do so. This was not the crime of an immature youth, but one conceived and executed in an adult manner. 
     
      
    167 The case was clearly one which called for a significant element of general deterrence to convey to persons in the respondent’s position that engaging in such conduct will attract a severe penalty. The sentence must reflect the community’s disapprobation of the respondent’s conduct. 
     
      
       
      Impact of the offence on the victim 
      
    168 The weight the sentencing judge accorded to Ms Flick’s victim impact statement is not clear. As his remarks on sentence indicate, he referred to it early in the piece. However subsequently (as I have earlier noted, but repeat for convenience) he said that he had considered the matters which appeared in the victim impact statement but “conformably with authority, see R v Previtera and Bollen v R (1998) 99 A Crim R 510 [have] not made use of it so as to increase the penalty that would otherwise be imposed”. 
     
      
    169 In R v Previtera, above, at 85, Hunt CJ at CL said that despite s 23C(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) which required the sentencing judge to receive and acknowledge victim impact statements but not consider the statement in connection with the determination of the punishment to be imposed “unless the Court considers that it is appropriate to do so”, it could never be appropriate to take a statement of that nature into account in sentencing the offender. This was because, in his Honour’s view, in a case of murder, the reactions of the victim’s relatives were not relevant to the task of sentencing the prisoner (at 87). On the other hand, his Honour made it plain that the consequences of the crime upon the victim directly injured by it are always relevant to sentencing the offender as part of the objective circumstances of the crime and, in appropriate cases, to aggravation of those circumstances.  
     
      
    170 In R v Bollen, at 529, Hunt CJ at CL referred to his judgment in Previtera and opined that it remained “the only valid interpretation of s 23C”. 
     
      
    171 In R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300 at [43] Spigelman CJ suggested that the reasons given in Previtera may need to be reconsidered in an appropriate case because s 3A(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 acknowledges that one of the purposes of sentencing is “to recognise the harm done to … the community”. This is notwithstanding the fact that s 28 of the same Act, which determines when victim impact statements may be received and considered, contains the same language as was present in s 23C. Wood CJ at CL agreed with the Chief Justice’s observations although (at [48]) he sounded a note of caution concerning fact-finding in relation to the impact of a crime upon other members of the community or, indeed, upon the victim to ensure that injustice did not occur to the person standing for sentence where the makers of statements concerning that impact were not available for cross-examination.  
     
      
    172 Mr Steirn SC submitted that the victim impact statement could not be used where the material contained in it could not be tested or otherwise examined upon. He referred to psychologist’s reports which were attached to Ms Flick’s victim impact statement, noting that they contained “a great deal of hearsay material”. He pointed to the collateral issues which might arise if such reports were taken into account on sentencing where, for example, an offender sought to rebut such evidence by requiring the victim to be examined by a psychiatrist. 
     
      
    173 In R v Slack [2004] NSWCCA 128 at [62] Sperling J referred to the fact that in a sentencing hearing, although the rules of evidence did not apply, the Court was required to be satisfied of the facts in question beyond reasonable doubt and suggested that substantial weight could not be given to an account of harm in an unsworn statement which was untested by cross-examination and “in the nature of things, far from being an objective and impartial account of the effect of the offence on the victim”. 
     
      
    174 This case falls into a somewhat different category. Leaving aside the issue of the psychologist’s reports, Ms Flick was called to give evidence and was extensively cross-examined by Mr Steirn SC. Her victim impact statement was admitted without objection. Ms Flick was not challenged, in cross-examination, to the effect that anything set out in her victim impact statement did not constitute an accurate account of the harm she had suffered as a result of the offence.  
     
      
    175 Before the sentencing judge the Crown submitted that the victim impact statement demonstrated that Ms Flick had suffered permanent loss of great significance to her. In my opinion that submission was correct. The permanency of Ms Flick’s loss went to the objective criminality of the offence. Nothing in Previtera or Bollen is inconsistent with that proposition. 
     
      
    176 In my view, the sentencing judge erred in saying that he had not used the matters in Ms Flick’s victim impact statement by way of aggravation of the sentence which should be imposed.  
     
      
    177 I accept, however, Mr Steirn SC’s proposition that it would be inappropriate to take into account the psychologist’s reports apparently attached to Ms Flick’s statements. That is not least because there was no opportunity to cross-examine the psychologist during the sentencing hearing. 
     
      
       
      Re-sentencing the respondent 
      
    178 In my view the objective criminality of this offence was in the upper range of objective seriousness. It called for a very significant element of general deterrence to send the clearest possible message to those in the respondent’s position that such conduct will attract stern punishment. A civilised community cannot tolerate conduct of the nature manifest in this offence. The community’s abhorrence of such conduct must be reflected in the severity of the sentence. 
     
      
    179 I am conscious, as too was the sentencing judge, that extreme caution must be exercised to ensure that the respondent is not sentenced for an offence which was not the charge he faced, namely killing Ms Flick’s unborn child. 
     
      
    180 I have taken into account the subjective factors the sentencing judge considered. I have also accepted the evidence in the affidavits tendered on the appeal which disclose that the respondent is in Cooma Correctional Centre where employment, educational courses and counselling are available to him and that he has undertaken several such courses and intends to continue such pursuits. He is no longer on protection, having voluntarily signed off protection on his arrival at Cooma. He is allowed out of his cell between 7 am and 8.30 pm as are all other inmates. He clearly has prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    181 I have taken into account that in re-sentencing the respondent, the Court must recognise the element of double jeopardy involved in the respondent twice standing for sentence by imposing a sentence which is less than the sentence it considers should have been imposed at first instance. This has been described as “the least sentence which could properly have been imposed …at first instance”: R v Rose (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 23 May 1996), as “one which is at the bottom of the range”: R v Giam (No 2) [1999] NSWCCA 378; (1999) 109 A Crim R 348 at [28] and one “towards the lower end of the range of available sentences”: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [62] per Kirby J; or the “minimum sentence which should have been imposed at first instance”: R v Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2; (2000) 111 A Crim R 152 at 204 [206] per Hulme J. 
     
      
    182 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Respondent given leave to appeal against severity of sentence but appeal dismissed. 
       
       
      (2) Crown appeal against inadequacy of sentence allowed. 
       
       
      (3) Quash the sentence below and in lieu thereof sentence the respondent to a term of imprisonment for 12 years to commence on 21 August 2002 with a non-parole period of 8 years, similarly to commence on 21 August 2002 and to expire on 20 August 2010.

    184 BUDDIN J: I agree with McColl JA.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Tony Rugari, is to be sentenced for the manslaughter of Peter Laliotitis and for robbing him in circumstances of aggravation, namely by using personal violence, of a telephone and a gold chain. He asks the Court to take into account, in sentencing him, of his possession of 1 gram of cannabis leaf and 3.9 grams of pseudoephedrine. 
     
      
    2 The offender lived at a caravan park at Miranda. So did a twelve year old girl, whom I shall call X, and a group of other young people. They all knew each other. The offender was a very well-built eighteen year old. The deceased, Peter Laliotitis, was twenty years old and lived at Campbelltown. Not long before 6 January 2003 the deceased and X spoke to one another a number of times on the telephone. Their first contact may have been accidental. They may also have met. There is evidence to show that the deceased was told that X was thirteen years old but that he did not believe it and thought that she was sixteen years old. The deceased and X arranged that he should attend the caravan park. It seems that the offender also spoke to him on the telephone and gave him directions about how to get there.  
     
      
    3 The deceased drove to Miranda and arrived at the caravan park at 9:30pm on 6 January. He was met by a group of young people, including the offender, but X was not present. The young people told him where to go to find X’s caravan. He drove his car to the rear of the caravan park and the others followed him on foot. The offender believed that the deceased was intending to have sexual intercourse with X. He considered, in view of X’s age, that that was inappropriate. He referred to the deceased as a paedophile. Although he could have told X’s mother, who lived at the caravan park, or other adults about what he believed might happen, he did not do so. He laid into the deceased and gave him a beating. I do not think that he intended to inflict any lasting or serious injury on the deceased. He intended to hurt him and ensure that he went away and did not come back. The beating he delivered was savage, however, and he hit him many, perhaps fifteen, times. The deceased never retaliated. He merely said that he did not want trouble.  
     
      
    4 The deceased returned to his car and got into it but the offender stole his keys and told him that he would return them only if the deceased handed over his gold chain. The deceased handed it over, and the offender took his mobile telephone as well.  
     
      
    5 The offender gave the chain to a male member of the group and told a female member that if anything happened with the police she was to say that the deceased was attacking her and that the offender and the male member had seen the attack and that that was why the offender had attacked the deceased.  
     
      
    6 The deceased drove home to Campbelltown. When he arrived he was in a bad way and collapsed in the garage of the house. His mother and then his sister went to assist him. They took him to his room and called the ambulance. Ambulance officers attended and took him to hospital. When he arrived there he was unconscious. He was found to have an acute left-sided extradural haematoma. He underwent two operations to relieve pressure on the brain. He was kept in the intensive care unit. Eventually, on 13 January 2003, he died because resulting changes in brain tissue led to lung failure, possibly associated with cardiac arrest.  
     
      
    7 On 1 October 2003 the offender was committed to this Court for trial on a charge of murder and a charge of robbery. On 5 December he pleaded not guilty to both charges and his trial was fixed to commence on 3 May 2004. On 6 February the trial date was changed to 7 June. There were still pleas of not guilty but the parties were conferring and defence counsel told the Court that there would probably not be a trial. On 7 June the offender pleaded not guilty of the murder of the deceased but guilty of his manslaughter and guilty of his robbery. The Crown accepted the plea in discharge of the indictment.  
     
      
    8 Substantial issues of fact were raised on the sentence hearing and a number of witnesses gave evidence. Two of them, the mother and sister of the deceased, were cross-examined by counsel for the offender. The intention was to enquire into the cause of the deceased’s head injury. The deceased’s mother, Mrs Maria Laliotitis, had made two statements for the police. In the second one, made on 20 May 2004, she had said this -  
     
      
       
        
        Peter fell to the ground, onto his knees. This did not happen very quickly but took some seconds. Peter slumped to his knees, he tried to support himself by putting out his hands. Peter was supporting his weight in this manner. He remained in this position for some time… 
        
       
      
    9 Counsel asked Mrs Laliotitis whether police had asked her to make her second statement because there had been a suggestion that the deceased had hit his head on the garage floor. In the end the evidence was inconclusive. Mrs Laliotitis may not have understood what she was being asked. Counsel also cross-examined Mrs Helen Mihas, the sister of the deceased, about the position the deceased was in when she entered the garage and saw him. Both witnesses appeared to find giving evidence an ordeal. 
     
      
    10 There was no submission as to any conclusion that the Court ought to draw from the evidence so adduced.  
     
      
    11 A second issue arose as to the use the Court might make of a transcript of an interview between investigating police officers and the offender. On 8 January 2003 the offender was arrested and charged with the robbery of the deceased. He denied the robbery. Before and during the electronically recorded interview that followed he made a number of statements justifying his attack on the deceased as a paedophile. It was submitted that when the interview was held the offender had not been charged with any offence other than the robbery and that there had been no suggestion that the police would charge him with any other offence, other than perhaps for possessing any drug they found as they searched. Throughout the interview the deceased was lying in hospital in a critical condition but the police did not tell the offender until the interview was almost over. It was submitted that that was unfair and that the answers given in the interview were likely to be unreliable and should be rejected as inadmissible or in the exercise of the Court’s discretion. The submission implied an application for a direction under s4(2) Evidence Act that the Act apply.  
     
      
    12 Even if the Evidence Act applied, I would not regard the evidence as inadmissible or unreliable or reject it in the exercise of my discretion. I accept that when the deceased drove away from the caravan park after the beating, the offender had no reason to think that he was seriously hurt. There was no evidence that he otherwise found out. I accept the submission that the offender acted as he did partly out of indignation that the deceased should be contemplating having sexual intercourse with a girl as young as X and partly because he wanted to show off to the assembled company of young people, but I do not think that his answers were for those reasons any less reliable. On the contrary, the offender asserted what I accept as true, namely that he could have killed the deceased but did not do so because all he wanted to do was “smash him around a bit”. That answer assists his case and should be given weight. 
     
      
    13 The offender was born on 14 October 1984. He was the eldest of seven children. His father was a violent man and often physically abused him. He was difficult to manage. The Department of Community Services removed him from the care of his parents when he was five years old and placed him in foster care. He was diagnosed at an early age with attention deficit hyper-activity disorder. He left school and his foster home when he was twelve years old. Sometimes he lived with his mother and sometimes with his father.  
     
      
    14 He fathered a child when he was fourteen years old. That child is now six years old and has been removed from the mother’s care. The offender does not see it. He has been in a relationship with another young woman but that relationship has come to an end. He has been a consumer of illegal drugs for a number of years. 
     
      
    15 It seems that he is deaf in one ear and partially deaf in the other. He usually wears a hearing aid. 
     
      
    16 During a period of a little under three months between August and October 2001 the offender committed a substantial number of offences of assaulting police officers, maliciously damaging property, resisting or hindering police, assault, demanding property with menaces, having custody of offensive instruments and using an offensive weapon to prevent his lawful apprehension or detention. The Children’s Court dealt with him a number of times, leniently at first but ultimately by the imposition of a series of control orders, the longest of which was twelve months, dating from October 2001. After his release on the expiry of the last of the control orders he spent a few months in the community. He resided at the caravan park. He was employed by McDonalds, a hamburger chain, liked the work and was promoted to assistant manager. He stayed out of trouble until he committed these offences.  
     
      
    17 It was submitted that the plea of guilty of manslaughter was timely, particularly in view of the early indication made by defence counsel that the matter would probably not go to trial. I accept that submission. 
     
      
    18 The offender is entitled to the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. The State was saved the expense of a trial which was estimated to last three weeks. I have taken that matter into account. I have tempered the reduction I would otherwise have allowed because the mother and the sister of the deceased were required to come to Court to be cross-examined. I do not by these remarks intend to imply that the offender was not entitled to cross-examine them. That was his right. It is simply that his exercise of that right removed a benefit that would have followed.  
     
      
    19 The author of the Pre-Sentence Report stated that the offender told her that he believed that the deceased was a paedophile and justified the attack for that reason. He denied that what he did resulted in the death of the deceased. He denied robbing the deceased. Counsel for the offender submitted that I should give little or no weight to that part of the report, but I see no reason to deal with it other than at face value. Of course, the offender’s adherence to his pleas of guilty and his continued conduct of the hearing before me show that he no longer maintains that he did not kill the deceased and did not rob him, so no question arises about his guilt. The importance of the evidence is twofold. It shows that he lacks contrition and that he has made little progress towards rehabilitation.  
     
      
    20 It was submitted that if the matter had gone to trial there would have been good prospects of an acquittal in view of the criticism directed at the manner in which the admissions in the interview were obtained. I do not accept that submission. I think that the chances of having the interview excluded would have been small. Besides, several witnesses saw the offender beat the deceased and rob him. One of them would have given evidence of the story the offender concocted to be told to the police if they should enquire. A pawn ticket for the mobile phone was found in the offender’s possession. His thumbprint was found on a card in the deceased’s wallet. The Crown case was strong one, though the Crown would never have succeeded on a charge of murder. The pleas of guilty are no evidence of remorse. My conclusion about that is supported by the offender’s statements of justification and denial to the Probation and Parole officer.  
     
      
    21 The Probation and Parole officer considers that intervention is required to teach or help the offender to control his anger. His mother told the officer that he would often punch holes in walls and become verbally abusive, though he has never been violent towards her. She, too, thought that he needed assistance to control his anger.  
     
      
    22 A report was received from Ms Ryder, psychologist. She tested the offender. She thought him suspicious, defensive and sensitive to criticism. He was abrasive, hostile, irritable and quick to find fault. He was resentful and discontented. Ms Ryder concluded that the test results indicated an acutely paranoid and possible delusional state, but I have reservations in accepting that opinion in view of the opinions of the psychiatrist, Dr Greenberg. Ms Ryder’s report is of some assistance, but since it was written before the offender pleaded guilty it lacks any consideration of the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    23 Dr Greenberg, psychiatrist, saw the offender three times, the third time after he had decided to plead guilty. His report was tendered. He said that the offender had a personality disorder with antisocial features. He was prone to be violent, to use illegal drugs and to abuse alcohol. His insight into his behaviour was poor and his prognosis depended on his developing an insight into his psychological and psychiatric difficulties and changing his attitude and behaviour. Dr Greenberg put the offender into that group of offenders who present a medium to high risk of re-offending. 
     
      
    24 I think that there are some slim prospects of rehabilitation in view of the period of employment during which the offender committed no offences at all, but he has a long way to go before he becomes rehabilitated. He must begin by acknowledging responsibility for the offences he has committed.  
     
      
    25 The evidence does not enable me to make any precise finding about when the offender decided to rob the deceased. I regard it as an opportunistic offence, carried out without much forethought and without planning. 26 The offences were more serious because they were unprovoked. The beating was administered for a considerable time, notwithstanding that the deceased offered no offence and, it seems, no resistance. The offender’s recent history of offences of violence aggravates his criminality because it leads to the conclusion that there is a considerable risk of his re-offending. I accept Dr Greenberg’s assessment, which is consistent with the other features of the case, particularly the criminal history of violence and the evidence about the offender’s personality and lack of insight into his attitude and behaviour.  
     
      
    27 The offender is without remorse. 
     
      
    28 In the offender’s favour are that the attack on the deceased was hot-blooded and the robbery unplanned. The offender was eighteen years old at the time and is still entitled to some consideration for his youth. He is entitled to a lesser sentence to acknowledge the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty, the effect of which should be limited in the way I have described.  
     
      
    29 Since both offences were carried out at the one time and since the beating at once constituted the unlawful and dangerous act component of manslaughter and the circumstances that aggravated the robbery there will be a high degree of concurrency between the sentences.  
     
      
    30 The Court was informed that the offender had been kept on strict protection during the custody which followed his arrest. That was apparently at his own request. There was some suggestion of violence in custody, and that may explain the request. No further details were put before the Court, notwithstanding an opportunity which was given to defence counsel to supply information about the precise effect upon the offender of the way in which he was being kept. Recent experience suggests that offenders who are kept on protection are not denied the ordinary range of facilities in the corrective system, educational, vocational or otherwise rehabilitative. I do not think, in the absence of detailed evidence of the reasons for and the effects of protection, that the fact of protection entitles the offender to a lower sentence or constitutes a circumstance entitling him an extended period on parole.  
     
      
    31 I think however that the offender’s age, his personality disorders, his need of professional assistance to recognise his problems and begin to come to grips with them amount to circumstances justifying an extended period of time on parole. So does the accumulation of the sentences. I have come to this conclusion even though there is a considerable risk that the offender will re-offend.  
     
      
    32 A Victim Impact Statement was tendered on behalf of Mrs Helen Mihas, the deceased’s sister. She and her family have been badly affected by the death of the deceased, particularly by the way in which he met his death and by the way they came to be involved in it. The Court has not taken into account the contents of the Victim Impact Statement in imposing sentence, but it does extend sympathy to Mrs Mihas and her family and hopes that the use of the Victim Impact Statement has provided them with comfort.  
     
      
    33 Tony Rugari, for the robbery in circumstances of aggravation of Peter Laliotitis I sentence you to imprisonment for a period of four years. The sentence will be taken to have commenced on the day of your arrest, 8 January 2003, and will expire on 7 January 2007. I decline to fix a non-parole period because of the sentence I intend to impose for the manslaughter. For the manslaughter of Peter Laliotitis, and taking into account the two offences of the possession of drugs, I sentence you to imprisonment for a term of seven years, commencing on 8 January 2004 and expiring on 7 January 2011. I fix a non-parole period of four years, which will expire on 7 January 2008. The first day upon which you will become eligible for release on parole will be 7 January 2008.

    1 DUNFORD J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    3 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Eddie Azzi, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of attempted sexual intercourse without consent, an offence under s61I and s61P of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum sentence of fourteen years imprisonment, and four charges of indecent assault, an offence under s61L of the Act which carries a maximum sentence of five years. He also asked that two offences of committing an act of indecency towards a person above the age of sixteen years (s61N(2)) be taken into account on a Form 1. On each of the charges of indecent assault, taking into account the offences on the Form 1, he was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for two years, to commence on 20 June 2003. On the charge of attempted sexual intercourse without consent he was sentenced to a wholly cumulative term of imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of two years. The aggregate sentence, then, was six years with a non-parole period of four years. He seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 
     
      
    4 The application is several months out of time but an explanation for the delay has been provided. At the hearing, there being no opposition from the Crown, the Court granted an extension of time.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    5 The offences were committed against four adult women, to whom I shall refer only by their initials. The charge of attempted sexual intercourse without consent and the first charge of indecent assault arose out of the same incident, involving the complainant, AH. The other four charges of indecent assault arose from separate incidents involving the complainants, RC, JH and AC. The incidents involving JH and AC also gave rise to the two matters on the Form 1.  
     
      
    6 Before the sentencing judge was an agreed statement of facts. Substituting initials for the names of the complainants, this is how his Honour set them out in his remarks:  
     
      
       
        
        The prisoner is the owner of a well known and established hair salon known as Eddie Azzi which is located on Level 1 of Skygardens in the Pitt Street Mall in Sydney. The prisoner has owned and operated this salon for the past eleven years or so. 
        
       
       
        
        During the afternoon of Wednesday, 6 October 1999 the victim, AH, attended a prearranged appointment for a haircut and hairdressing matters at the prisoner’s hair salon. The prisoner cut and treated her hair. But during the haircut the victim stated that her haircut was taking longer than usual and she was concerned because of where she had parked her car. The prisoner arranged with security people for her to park her car under the Skygarden building. But when the victim returned to the salon she noticed that the majority of staff had left and there was only one staff member along with the accused left in the salon.  
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner continued to blow dry the victim’s hair as the remaining staff member left. The prisoner locked the door to the salon. The victim felt uneasy. The prisoner then led the victim to an office where she undressed on his instructions. The prisoner attempted to remove the victim’s underwear, however, she held on to that to prevent him pulling garments from her. The prisoner then fondled the victim’s breasts and pulled her against himself, rubbing his erect penis against the victim’s pubic hair. 
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner then led the victim to the beauty section of the salon which the victim states had a spa and a massage table therein. The victim lay on a massage table on the instruction of the prisoner who then climbed on top of her. The prisoner attempted to have sexual intercourse with her. The victim refused this and told the prisoner that she was a virgin and that she would not have intercourse with him. The victim resisted penetration by holding on to her underpants. The prisoner then requested the victim to perform oral sex on him. The victim refused. The prisoner commenced to masturbate and at the same time pulled the victim by the hair close to his penis and ejaculated on her face. The prisoner then fixed the victim’s hair which was in somewhat of a mess from where he had been pulling it. 
        
       
       
        
        On Wednesday the 2 February 2000 the victim, RC, a 29 year old female, attended the premises of Eddie Azzi Hair Salon for a haircut. The prisoner cut the victim’s hair and engaged in general conversation while doing so. The time was about 5.30pm and a booking had been previously made. During the haircut the prisoner offered the victim a glass of champagne or wine, which the victim declined.  
        
       
       
        
        During the haircut the prisoner showed interest in a book belonging to the victim and later began to read it while the victim’s hair was being blow dried. At the completion of the hair treatment the prisoner took the victim’s book to the office located at the rear of the salon. By this stage most of the clients of the salon and the staff thereof had left. The victim went to the office to retrieve her book which had been placed on top of a desk in the office. When the victim reached forward to collect her book the prisoner blocked the victim’s access by standing directly in front of her. The prisoner then grabbed the victim with both his arms and pulled her towards him holding her close to his body, groin against groin. The victim was able to feel the erect penis of the prisoner against her body. The prisoner fondled the victim’s behind and kissed her on the right side of the neck. 
        
       
       
        
        The victim broke away by twisting and turning her body. The victim immediately walked out of the office but was unable to get out of the salon as the front door was locked and there was no other person or persons in the salon. The prisoner informed the victim that he did not have a key and the only way out was to use the internal lifts to the garage. The victim reluctantly agreed to go with him and both of them left the salon together. 
        
       
       
        
        About 3pm on Wednesday 30 November 2000 the victim, JH, a 20 year old female went to the premises of Eddie Azzi Hair Salon for a haircut. At the front counter the prisoner introduced himself to the victim and said that he would be cutting her hair. While cutting the victim’s hair the prisoner offered her a glass of wine which she accepted. 
        
       
       
        
        While the victim’s hair was being cut there was general conversation between the two. After cutting the victim’s hair the prisoner asked what the victim was doing immediately afterwards and invited her to stay for a while. The time was about 5pm. The victim was invited into the office located at the rear of the salon. Both the prisoner and the victim sat at a desk in the office and the prisoner offered the victim a second glass of wine which she accepted. The two engaged in general conversation. Then the prisoner began talking about sex, asking the victim how she liked to have sex and what turned her on. The prisoner asked the victim if she like to watch people masturbate and undid his trousers removing his penis. The prisoner then masturbated himself in front of the victim. The prisoner continued to masturbate himself stating: 
        
       
       
        
          
        “Imagine me licking your tits. Imagine you 
        
       
       sucking my cock.” 
       
        
         
        The prisoner stopped and asked if he was making the victim feel uncomfortable. She stated that he was. The prisoner pulled his trousers up and then hugged the victim placing his hand up her shirt and kissing her on the cheek. The victim removed the hands of the prisoner from her shirt and the prisoner stood up and removed his penis again, continuing to masturbate directly in front of the victim’s face. 
        
       
       
        
        The victim then kept telling the prisoner she had to go, however, the prisoner was standing between her and the doorway. The office door was closed. 
        
       
       
        
        After a time the prisoner ceased to masturbate. The victim opened the office door and walked out. 
        
       
       
        
        Prior to the victim leaving the accused asked the victim for the amount of $200 for a haircut. The victim paid the bill and left the salon. When leaving the building the victim had trouble walking as she was feeling numb. 
        
       
       
        
        About 5pm on Tuesday 19 June 2001 the victim, AC, a 37 year old female, attended the premises of Eddie Azzi Hair Salon for a haircut. The prisoner introduced himself to the victim and later cut her hair. While cutting the victim’s hair the prisoner offered her a glass of wine which she accepted. At the completion of the haircut the victim paid $260. The prisoner offered the victim another glass of wine which she accepted. The prisoner suggested the victim see his newly renovated beauty parlour and escorted her to it. 
        
       
       
        
        When in the beauty parlour the prisoner sat the victim down and stepped into the spa bath and stood directly in front of her. The prisoner removed his penis from his trousers and began masturbating himself saying: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “I’m not going to have sex with you. You just enjoy your wine and watch.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner took hold of the victim’s hand and placed it on his penis asking the victim to masturbate him. The prisoner slapped the victim’s behind, as it is described here, and placed his hand up her shirt exposing her breasts. The prisoner then began sucking on the victim’s breasts. The victim felt scared of the prisoner. The victim then lay down on a massage table on the instructions of the prisoner who masturbated himself in front of her, ejaculating over her face. The victim washed her face and the prisoner unlocked the front door to the salon allowing the victim to leave. 
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner was arrested on 8 August 2001 and interviewed in the presence of his solicitor regarding these matters. He declined to comment on advice from his solicitor which he was entitled to do and he was later charged. 
        
       
      
    7 Three of the four complainants made victim impact statements, which led his Honour to observe: 
     
      
       
        
        There can be no doubt that the prisoner’s unwanted physical sexual assaults on these completely innocent women have had seriously deleterious effects on them, both physically and psychologically.  
        
       
      
    8 His Honour viewed the offences as objectively very serious. He observed that there was no suggestion that any of the victims had encouraged the applicant’s advances in any way, and that they had obeyed him because they were frightened of him. He described the offences as “well planned” and “predatory” adding that they “involved a breach of trust”. It will be necessary to examine his Honour’s assessment of the objective gravity of the offences more closely when dealing with some of the grounds of the present application.  
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    9 The applicant was aged between thirty-eight and forty at the time of the offences and is now forty-three. He has no previous convictions. He was born and raised in Lebanon, where an otherwise happy childhood was tragically disturbed by the civil war in that country. In 1975, when he was only a teenager, he saw his brother and grandfather shot. His father died in the same year and, although it is not entirely clear, I take it that he was also killed in the war. 
     
      
    10 The applicant trained as a hairdresser and married before emigrating to this country in the early 1980s. He has three children and it seems that, despite the offences, he has enjoyed the continuing support of his wife. Before his Honour were a number of testimonials from responsible citizens, from which it appeared that he was a highly regarded citizen who was also involved in valuable charity work, and that the offences were entirely out of character.  
     
      
    11 To the author of a pre-sentence report he attributed the offences to the fact that he was under financial pressure at the time because of a business dispute and had increased his drinking, although the Probation and Parole officer noted that he “did not attempt to minimise his behaviour”. Also before his Honour was a psychological report, the author of which assessed the applicant “as not being at significant risk of sexually reoffending, provided that all appropriate safeguards are observed”. The psychologist added, however, that he would “benefit from therapy to address background and lifestyle factors related to his offending”. 
     
      
    12 His Honour assessed the risk of the applicant’s re-offending as “small”. He noted that the applicant had suffered considerable financial hardship as a result of the offences, and had brought disgrace upon himself and his family. His Honour described the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty as “considerable” and accepted that they demonstrated remorse. He considered that the pleas warranted a twenty percent reduction of the overall sentence which would otherwise have been appropriate. As is apparent from the structure of the sentences, he found special circumstances.  
     
      
       
      The application 
      
    13 In this Court Mr Nicholson QC, for the applicant, challenged the sentencing judge’s assessment of the gravity of the offences by reference to some particular observations he made about them. He also submitted that his Honour fell into error in passing a cumulative sentence on the charge of attempted sexual intercourse without consent. 
     
      
    14 The first of the challenged observations about the gravity of the offences was that they constituted “a breach of trust”. This had been the subject of submissions by the Crown prosecutor and counsel for the applicant in the sentence proceedings (neither of whom appeared in this Court). The Crown prosecutor had argued that a hairdresser such as the applicant occupied “a position of care and protection” in relation to his clients, given the incidence of physical contact in the course of hairdressing and beauty treatment. Counsel for the applicant had argued that the applicant’s profession involved a measure of “flattery and personal intimacy” which created “danger zones” not easily recognised by someone in his position. However, he submitted that the relationship of hairdresser and client could not be placed in the same category as relationships of dependence often referred to in this context as involving trust, such as that between a parent or carer and a child, or between doctor and patient. 
     
      
    15 It is necessary to read his Honour’s reference to “breach of trust” in its context within his remarks. What his Honour said was this: 
     
      
       
        
        It is clear that objectively these are very serious offences. They were committed by an individual in a position where his clients, these victims, were entitled to expect that they could trust the prisoner and would be treated with respect and decency and not like chattels for his personal sexual gratification.  
        
       
       
      Having observed that the victims had done nothing to encourage the applicant’s advances and that they had obeyed him because they were “terrified”, his Honour continued: 
       
       
        
        He seems to have thought that it was his entitlement to act as he did. All these offences were well planned, predatory and involved a breach of trust. 
        
       
      
    16 It is true that the expression “breach of trust” is something of a term of art in this context, recognising the seriousness of offences of this kind committed by a man whose relationship with the victim is one of authority or influence. However, I do not understand his Honour to have found that the relationship between the applicant and his victims fell into that category. His reference to “breach of trust” appears to have been simply to the trust which, he had earlier said, the victims were entitled to have in being treated by the applicant appropriately and not as objects for his sexual gratification. 
     
      
    17 His Honour did not expressly deal with counsel’s arguments about this matter in his remarks, and I do not read what he said as the resolution of that issue in favour of the Crown. He later referred to defence counsel’s argument that the applicant might not have recognised the danger arising from the flattery and intimacy involved in his profession, only to reject it with the observation that there was not “even a hint of fault on the part of the victims” and that any flirting “was by the prisoner, and not by the victims”. The Crown prosecutor in this Court adopted the argument of his predecessor in the sentence proceedings, submitting that the position of hairdresser/beauty therapist should be likened to that of a health professional. However, although it is significant that the applicant’s profession may necessitate physical contact with a degree of intimacy, I would not characterise his position in that way. 
     
      
    18 Next, Mr Nicholson submitted that it was not open on the agreed facts to describe the offences as “well planned” and “predatory”. He argued that, at most, they were opportunistic. This also had been the subject of argument by counsel before his Honour. 
     
      
    19 In my view, although the language is perhaps a little colourful, it was a characterisation of the offences which was open to his Honour. The notions of planning and predation go hand in hand, conveying that the applicant was on the look out for opportunities to derive sexual pleasure from his unsuspecting clients. In each case the offences were committed at the end of the working day, when he was alone with them. Indeed, in the case of AH, the inference is available that he prolonged her hairdressing until his staff had left the salon. In each case he then led his victim to a more private part of the premises: in the case of AC, the beauty parlour and, on the other occasions, the office. With RC and AC he achieved this by subterfuge: in the case of RC, by taking her book to his office and, in the case of AC, by inviting her to inspect his newly renovated beauty parlour.  
     
      
    20 For what significance it might have, he also offered wine to all the complainants except AH (whose age is not disclosed but who may have been younger than the others). However, it may be that offering wine to his clients was a common practice. 
     
      
    21 Lastly, Mr Nicholson took issue with a further observation by his Honour: 
     
      
       
        
        Each offence constituted a separate, well planned, predatory and cowardly attack on four different women, who were, in effect, his prisoners. 
        
       
      
    22 Mr Nicholson argued that the suggestion of imprisonment was also not available on the agreed facts. Indeed, he argued that his Honour had fallen into error by sentencing the applicant on the basis that, in addition to the offences to which he had pleaded guilty, he was guilty of the offence under s86 of the Crimes Act of detaining his victims for advantage, with which he had not been charged: cf The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. Again, while the expression used by his Honour may be rather colourful, I do not read this passage of his remarks in that way. Particularly is this so given that the term “prisoners” was qualified by the expression “in effect”. That phrase was not inapt to describe a feature common to each of the incidents. 
     
      
    23 In the case of AH, the applicant locked the door of the salon and she felt uneasy. RC also found the salon door locked when she tried to leave after the indecent assault (although the applicant then escorted her out of the building by an internal lift). When JH told the applicant she had to go after the indecent assault upon her, he stood between her and the closed office door until he had finished masturbating. In the case of AC the salon door was also locked and, when the indecent assault upon her came to an end, he unlocked it to allow her to leave. The facts give rise to the inference that none of the victims felt free to leave while his sexual misconduct was in progress. 
     
      
    24 I am not persuaded than any of his Honour’s observations lead to the conclusion that he erred in his assessment of the gravity of the offences. Nor, indeed, does the aggregate sentence suggest that he did. 
     
      
    25 As I have said, the remaining basis of the application is the assertion that his Honour erred in accumulating the sentence on the charge of attempted sexual intercourse without consent. Mr Nicholson argued that that sentence should have been concurrent with the sentence on the second charge, the indecent assault upon AH, as it was part of the same incident. 
     
      
    26 His Honour expressly considered the question of how the sentences should be structured, referring to Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and related cases. It is true that the sentences might have been structured differently, for example, by passing concurrent sentences on the charges relating to AH but accumulating them upon the sentences for the remaining charges. In that event, the aggregate sentence would have been no different. 
     
      
    27 Consistently with the policy behind s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, it is not the function of this Court to restructure sentences passed at first instance if it makes no difference to the overall result. As Mr Nicholson realistically acknowledged, the only question for us is whether the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive as a reflection of the totality of the applicant’s criminality. I am not persuaded that it is. These were serious offences of their class, committed upon four women over a period of some twenty months. Even allowing for the fact that it was arrived at after a reduction for the applicant’s pleas of guilty and his remorse, I consider that the overall sentence of six years imprisonment was within the discretionary range properly open to his Honour. Equally, the effective non-parole period of four years, while affording the applicant the benefit of a finding of special circumstances, appropriately reflected considerations of retribution and deterrence. 
     
      
    28 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 His Honour: The offender, Allan Clifford Clarke, was found guilty by a jury of the manslaughter on 12 April 2003 at Seven Hills of Rodney Frederick Searle. The offender and the deceased lived in adjacent streets in Seven Hills. The offender’s daughter, Narelle Clarke, lived nearby. She often saw the offender and they had a good relationship. On the day of the offence Ms Clarke was walking with two friends in the street near the deceased’s house. One of the friends excused herself for a short time, so Ms Clarke and the other friend sat down to wait. The deceased, who had had a good deal to drink, was outside the front of his house. He and Ms Clarke knew one another. He engaged her in conversation. The subject-matter is of no particular interest, but the conversation became heated and insults began to be exchanged. The conversation was so loud as to attract the attention of people nearby. The argument ended when the deceased threw a beer bottle at Ms Clarke. It missed her and she retreated by the way she had come. She went into the offender’s house and complained about the conduct of the deceased. She was upset and, on one description, hysterical. On hearing her complaint, the offender took a hunting knife from his house, left the house and went towards the deceased’s house. He engaged the deceased on the grass verge of the street in front of his house and there killed him. The wound which caused death was a single thrust to the chest which lacerated the heart and the pulmonary artery.  
     
      
    2 At the trial three possible routes to a verdict of guilty of manslaughter were canvassed, namely by provocation, by excessive self-defence and by unlawful and dangerous act. For reasons for which I shall explain, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to inflict grievous bodily harm. It is therefore inappropriate to sentence him as merely for an unlawful and dangerous act causing death. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was not acting in self-defence. I am satisfied that the offender acted under the sting of the words and action of the deceased, as reported to him by his daughter, and that, so provoked, he attacked and killed the deceased. The conduct of the deceased could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the offender to have so far lost self-control as to have formed the intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    3 I am satisfied that the words and actions of the deceased towards Ms Clarke were insulting and even dangerous. I am satisfied that she was very upset when she reported the matter to the offender. Ms Clarke gave evidence that the deceased invited her to bring her father into his presence and the offender gave evidence that after Ms Clarke spoke to him he was afraid that the deceased might be intending to hurt him. I do not accept that the deceased ever made such an invitation or ever had any intent to hurt the offender. I do not accept that the offender ever thought that the deceased intended to hurt him.4 I am satisfied that when the offender picked up the knife he was intending to stab the deceased. Although he intended to demand an explanation of the deceased, it was not his intention only to talk. I am satisfied that when he approached the deceased he moved quickly, ahead of Ms Clarke, and that as he walked down the street he was already handling the knife with the intention of using it.  
     
      
    5 After his altercation with Ms Clarke the deceased moved to re-enter his house, and I think that he would have done so if the offender had not approached him and called him out. The offender demanded to know why the deceased had acted as he had and asked him whether he would like to “have a go at him”. The offender held the knife in his right hand and waved it at the deceased. I am satisfied that the deceased removed his belt, but only under the threat of the knife. I am satisfied that he used the belt not to attack the offender but to try to knock the knife out of his hand. The offender made a number of thrusts with the knife. Two of them cut the deceased across the knuckles of the belt hand. Another killed him.  
     
      
    6 I am satisfied that the confrontation began at or close to the boundary between the wide grass verge and the hard surface of the road. The verge was quite wide at that point and was bounded on the other side by the side fence of the deceased’s house. During the attack the offender drove the deceased backwards until he was close to his own side fence. It was there that he fell, mortally wounded. I am satisfied that the offender was always driving forward and the deceased always retreating.  
     
      
    7 A number of witnesses saw the offender make motions with his right arm or body. Some of them described those motions. That evidence satisfies me that the offender repeatedly thrust the knife at the deceased, using his right hand. I think that the death blow was probably delivered after the offender had changed his grip, so that the blade of the knife came from the back of the hand, whereas previously he had presented the knife from the front of the hand. 
     
      
    8 As the deceased lay on the ground, the offender knelt beside him and held the knife to his throat as though making or threatening to stab him again, yet he did not do so but withdrew the knife. He may not have realised at the time that the deceased was dying, and what he did makes me think that, notwithstanding the way things might have appeared during his attack on the deceased, he did not intend to kill him. The fatal injuries resulted from a single thrust. No great force was needed to inflict the injury.  
     
      
    9 The provocation was not of a high order. Nothing the deceased said or did put Ms Clarke in any great danger. After the bottle missed her she was in no danger at all. No doubt the offender considered the deceased a nuisance who ought to be taught a lesson, but in my opinion the acts and words of the deceased were only just sufficient to entitle the offender to a verdict of guilty of manslaughter rather than of murder. The use of the knife aggravated the offence. The deceased’s use of the belt was defensive, not provocative. However, the offence was opportunistic rather than planned or organised. I conclude in view of all these matters that the offence was in the mid-range of seriousness of offences of its kind. 10 The offender was born on 8 September 1952. He has a long record of offending, beginning in the Children’s Court before he was yet fourteen years old. There is only one conviction for any offence of violence, however, a common assault for which he was fined in 2001. He has a large number of convictions for offences of dishonesty and deception. He has served a number of periods of imprisonment for breaking entering and stealing, receiving, having stolen goods in his custody, obtaining benefits by deception, false pretences and forgery. His record does not aggravate his criminality but it disentitles him to leniency.11 I think, in view of the offender’s criminal history, that the offence was out of character and that the likelihood of his re-offending is slight. I accept that he is sorry that the deceased died, but that is the extent of his remorse. He is not sorry, apparently, that he used the knife and continues to say, according to the pre-sentence report, as he did at trial, that the stabbing was an accident. I think that his prospects of rehabilitation are moderate.  
     
      
    12 The offender and his wife have been married for thirty years and the marriage has withstood the pressures put upon it by his use of alcohol and illegal drugs and by his offending. His wife strongly supports him and will continue to do so throughout the custodial and parole portions of his sentence. The other members of their family support him as well.  
     
      
    13 The circumstances do not to my mind have that special nature which justifies a balance of the sentence exceeding one third of the non-parole period.  
     
      
    14 A Victim Impact Statement was tendered on behalf of Ms Shirley Godwin, the partner of the deceased. She and their two children have been badly affected by the loss of their partner and father, particularly because of the circumstances in which he died. The Court has not taken these matters into account in imposing sentence, but it does extend its sympathy to Ms Godwin and her children in their loss and expresses the hope that the use of the Victim Impact Statement at the sentencing hearing has given them comfort.  
     
      
    15 I set a non-parole period of six years, which will be taken to have commenced on the day of the offender’s arrest, 12 April 2003, and will expire on 11 April 2009. The balance of the sentence will be two years and will expire on 11 April 2011. The offender will become eligible for release on parole on 11 April 2009.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: I have read in draft form the judgment of Hislop J. I agree with the orders proposed, and with the reasons of his Honour. 
     
      
    2 HISLOP J: On 21 August 2003 the applicant pleaded guilty before Berman DCJ to an indictment containing seven counts, namely, three counts (counts 1, 4 and 5) of indecent assault contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 61E(1), the maximum penalty for which was 4 years imprisonment; two counts (counts 2 and 3) of indecent assault on a person under the age of 16 years and under authority contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 61E(1A), for which the maximum penalty was 6 years imprisonment; one count (count 6) of sexual intercourse with a person above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 66C, for which the maximum penalty was 8 years imprisonment; one count (count 7) of sexual intercourse with a person above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years and under authority contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 66C(2), for which the maximum penalty was 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 On 14 November 2003 his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years in respect of each of the first five counts, and imprisonment for 4 years in respect of the last two counts, with a non-parole period of 3 years. Each of the sentences was to date from 21 August 2003. 
     
      
    4 Counts 1-5 relate to offences committed by the applicant against a relative “A” during the period 1983 – 1989. A was born on 6 December 1978.  
     
      
    5 As the sentences in respect of the first five counts were subsumed by the sentences on the last two counts, it is unnecessary to record their detail, suffice it to say that, as was conceded in the applicant’s written submissions, all of them were very serious offences. 
     
      
    6 The circumstances of the sixth count, in brief, were that the applicant entered A’s bed at night, removed A’s pants and indecently assaulted him before causing him to commit fellatio upon the applicant. 
     
      
    7 “B” was a relative of the applicant. In September/October 1988, the applicant indecently assaulted her before having penile-vaginal intercourse lasting some five to ten minutes, during which B was unable to speak or scream because of the pain. At the time of the offence, B was 10 years of age. This offence gave rise to the seventh count.  
     
      
    8 During the same period the applicant committed a series of sexual offences against another young relative. On 15 May 1998 the applicant was sentenced by Kirkham DCJ to six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four and a half years, to expire on 14 November 2002 for those offences.  
     
      
    9 The victim of those offences made statements to police dated 2 and 8 May 1996 which raised the possibility that A and B may also have been sexually molested by the applicant. However it was not until 29 September 1999 that A gave a statement to police, not until 12 November 2001 B made a statement to police, and not until 29 April 2002 that the applicant was charged with the subject offences.  
     
      
    10 The applicant was released to parole on 14 November 2002 after completing the non-parole component of the sentences imposed by Kirkham DCJ. He was returned to prison on 21 August 2003 to serve the balance of that sentence as well as being bail refused in relation to the subject offences.  
     
      
    11 The applicant was born on 22 June 1948. He gave a history that he had been sexually interfered with as a child and that during the period of the offences his mind was full of sexualised thinking about children. 
     
      
    12 In 1988 the applicant, apparently of his own volition, sought treatment for his condition and in 1997 sought counselling with a psychologist who he continued to see on a monthly basis save for the periods when imprisoned. He involved himself in appropriate programs. He is in a relationship with his present partner. His Honour found that, apart from the offences referred to above the applicant was a man of good character. His Honour concluded, “it is universally acknowledged that at present the offender is most unlikely to re-offend” and that the rehabilitation of the applicant had been achieved.  
     
      
    13 His Honour held that if he had been dealing with both the offences to which the offender pleaded guilty on 21 August 2003 and the offences dealt with by Kirkham DCJ at the same time he would have given effect to the principle of totality by partially accumulating the sentences such that the overall effective sentence would have been one of 10 years imprisonment with a seven and a half year non parole period. This was the effect of the sentences which his Honour in fact imposed. 
     
      
    14 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The learned judge failed to have sufficient regard to the impact of the delay, possibly by the individual complainants but certainly by the prosecuting authorities, in bringing the prosecutions against the applicant. 
         
         
        2. The learned trial judge failed to take proper account of the consequences of returning the applicant to custody more than nine months after his release from serving a lengthy sentence of imprisonment for related offences. 
        
       
      
    15 The applicant submitted that the delay in prosecuting the applicant for the subject offences was not only lengthy, it was unusually lengthy, even for cases of child sexual assault; there did not appear to be any valid explanation for the delay; a significant element of delay on the part of the prosecuting authorities in particular must have caused extreme prejudice to the applicant and should have resulted in a lesser sentence. His Honour had not given the applicant any benefit or consideration for the crushing impact of being returned to prison for a lengthy period after already having enjoyed a substantial period of release on parole following an earlier significant sentence of imprisonment. These submissions were refined in reply and in supplementary written submissions to an assertion that essentially his Honour, when applying the principles of totality, had erred in failing to apply the principles in R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517.16 In R v Todd at 519 this Court held:  
     
      
       
        
        …where there has been a lengthy postponement, whether due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence, to the circumstances that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion, and to the fact that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offence, calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach – the passage of time between the offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner. 
        
       
      
      
      These principles were approved by the High Court in  
      Mill v R 
       (1988) 166 CLR 59). 
      
    17 Whilst his Honour did not expressly refer to Todd or Mill in his Remarks on Sentence it does appear that he had those principles generally in mind. He stated that the effects of the applicant’s rehabilitation resulted in little need for personal deterrence in the sentence, that he would take into account the delay as a mitigating factor, though as such delays were common when offenders abused children he would be careful not to give too much weight to this circumstance, and this was not a case where the applicant had spent the years between committing the offence and being sentenced in emotional hell, because he believed that he had got away with his sexual abuse of A and B and would never be punished for that.  
     
      
    18 These were bad offences. The sentencing Judge e.g. described the offence upon B as one which suggested a significant level of depravity and callousness. The objective gravity of the offences and the need for general deterrence and retribution is such as to justify the overall sentence imposed by his Honour. Indeed it could be argued the overall sentence was unduly favourable to the applicant in that there was no accumulation of sentences to reflect the fact two separate victims were involved.  
     
      
    19 However I have come to the view that having regard to the principles in Todd insufficient weight was given by his Honour to the passage of time between the offences and the sentence, to the late return to custody and to the progress of the applicant’s rehabilitation and that such matters constitute special circumstances which should be reflected in a shorter non-parole period. 
     
      
    20 I would reduce the non-parole periods in respect of counts six and seven to 2 years and 3 months. I would not otherwise disturb the sentences imposed by his Honour. 
     
      
    21 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Appeal dismissed as to counts 1 – 5 inclusive. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Appeal dismissed as to the sentences of imprisonment of 4 years commencing on 21 August 2003 in respect of counts six and seven, but allowed in relation to the non-parole periods imposed in respect of those counts. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The non-parole periods of 3 years in respect of counts six and seven are quashed. In lieu thereof, non-parole periods of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 21 August 2003 are substituted.

     Regina v Lee Joshua MARTIN 
      
      
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: I have read in draft form the judgment of Hislop J. I agree with the orders proposed, and with the reasons of his Honour. 
     
      
    2 HISLOP J: On 28 October 2003 the applicant pleaded guilty to the offence of robbery in company while armed with an offensive weapon (a replica hand gun), contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 97(1). The maximum penalty for such an offence is 20 years imprisonment. 3 On 13 February 2004, Nield DCJ sentenced the applicant to a total of 5 years and 4 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 4 years to commence on 14 June 2003. This sentence also took into account two matters on a Form 1, namely assault with intent to rob, and goods in custody. 4 The offence occurred on 14 June 2003. The facts as shortly stated by his Honour in his Remarks on Sentence were: 
     
      
       
        
        The complainant was walking along Parramatta Road between Broadway and Camperdown when he was accosted by the offender who asked the complainant for money. When the complainant told the offender that he did not have any money, the offender produced the replica hand gun and pointed it at the complainant and demanded that the complainant hand over his wallet. When the complainant handed over his wallet to the offender, the offender started to look through it. Then the offender and the complainant were joined by another and the offender gave the complainant’s wallet to this man, who, after looking through it, said that there was nothing in it. Then the offender demanded that the complainant empty out his pants pockets and the complainant put his backpack on the ground and commenced to empty out his pants pockets. When the complainant removed his mobile telephone from one of his pockets, the offender took it from him. Then the other man picked up the complainant’s backpack and started to go through it. Then the offender hit the complainant on his nose with the handle of the hand gun, and then the complainant was hit on the back of his head by another person who had come up behind him. Then the offender walked away with the complainant’s telephone and the first man who had joined them walked away with the offender’s wallet and backpack. These two men were followed by two other men. 
        
       
      
    5 The applicant was born on 15 October 1982. He had a prior record comprising some fourteen offences, six of which had been dealt with in the Children’s Court and eight in the Local Court. Those offences included the use of physical violence, malicious damage to property and stealing. At the time of the subject offence the applicant was on bail in respect of the Form 1 offence of assault with intent to rob. That offence occurred when the applicant punched a train passenger several times in the face in an attempt to rob him of his mobile phone. The maximum penalty for such offence, if prosecuted on indictment, was 14 years imprisonment.6 The Probation and Parole Service pre-sentence report dated 23 January 2004 provided the following background: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Martin was raised in Australia by his parents and has a younger brother aged 17. His father worked away from the family home for the majority of the offender’s childhood and did not play a major role in his upbringing. His mother had a gambling problem which caused conflict between the offender’s parents. In 1997, Mr Martin’s parents had an acrimonious separation and his mother relocated with the two sons to New Zealand for approximately a year. The offender returned to reside in Australia with his father and eventually his mother and brother also returned to Australia in 1998. Shortly afterward, Mr Martin’s father was in a serious accident resulting in him being unable to return to the workforce. It was during this period that the offender’s mother commenced a new relationship and lapsed into drug use. May 2001 Mr Martin’s mother overdosed on methamphetamine resulting in her death. 
         
         
        Due to the offender’s father being unable to work, the family was forced to reside in a hostel for numerous months until being issued a Department of Housing unit. When Mr Martin is released into the community he shall reside with his father and brother. Since his incarceration, Mr Martin has developed a supportive and positive relationship with his father. Additionally, he has been in a relationship for the past 18 months which appears to be stable and a positive influence on his life. Mr Martin completed year 10 at high school and then left to assist his father in his recovery from his accident. He has stated that he has worked casually as a labourer and furniture removalist although he was not motivated to work in the past due to his alcohol and drug use… Mr Martin has experienced a difficult upbringing and appears to have not managed with his life situation appropriately, resulting in excessive drinking and overuse of cannabis. Since his period of incarceration he has developed a positive relationship with his father and presents as motivated to address his drug and alcohol problem. His attitude to the offence and his drug and alcohol problem demonstrate maturity and developing insight into the importance of communication. Given his limited communication skills and coping skills when managing emotional problems and stress, a structured residential program would appear to be the most beneficial form of rehabilitation. 
        
       
      
    7 A report of the psychologist, Dr Christopher Lennings, dated 7 January 2004 concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Martin is a young man of robust cognitive ability who life reveals numerous vulnerabilities for dysfunction. He reports a sad and dysfunctional family background. Despite this, he remained reasonably well behaved until the age of 15 when increasing substance abuse resulted in the beginning of what appears to have a been a concentrated history of criminality, mainly associated with anger resulting from alcohol abuse. Mr Martin’s primary need is for drug rehabilitation. He presents as a young man with a mixed response to rehabilitation. On one hand he has some rehabilitation strengths. These include social support (from his girlfriend and “reformed” father), the capacity to work and some pro-social interests (such as his interest in jazz). He does not have a significant mental illness nor in my view, personality disorder despite his behaviour over the last 5 years. On the other hand, he has demonstrated an inability to capitalise on his insight and has only had superficial motivation for treatment in the past. He has major risk factors associated with an entrenched substance abuse problem and a peer network that is both delinquent and substance abusing. His propensity to violence when drinking represents a concern but can be expected to respond well to appropriate treatment given the apparent lack of aggression in his manner when he is not intoxicated. A long term gaol sentence will remove Mr Martin from circulation for the duration of the sentence, but unlikely to make much change in his behaviour once he returns to the community. This is because the problems he has cannot be adequately addressed in gaol. Community treatment options for Mr Martin are unlikely to be effective in the short term. It seems Mr Martin’s immediate need is to attend a short term residential program (generally about 6 weeks to 3 months duration) to learn skills in managing substance abuse, substance refusal skills, and the beginnings of some vocational training. Following this, a referral to a community based treatment program to monitor his substance use (ideally he will opt for abstinence) and to provide assistance in “talking through” the troubles of his childhood should be of assistance to him. A sentence that provided for a lengthy period of supervision might facilitate such a treatment option.  
        
       
      
    8 Supportive references were tendered on behalf of the applicant and his father gave evidence on sentence. A letter from the applicant’s aunt, June Buchanan, in particular, confirms the family problems faced by the applicant during his teenage years. 9 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. His Honour erred in his application of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
         s 44. 
         
         
        2. His Honour erred in his assessment of the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. 
         
         
        3. The sentence imposed, in circumstances where the applicant was 19, had a relatively minor record, pleaded guilty at an early time, and had the disadvantaged childhood that he did, is manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
      Ground One – His Honour erred in his application of s 44 
      
    10 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s 44 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 
         
         
        (2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision). 
         
         
        (3) The failure of a court to comply with subsection (2) does not invalidate the sentence. 
         
         
        (4) Schedule 1 has effect in relation to existing life sentences referred to in that Schedule.  
        
       
      
    11 His Honour determined that a non-parole period of imprisonment for 4 years was appropriate. His Honour set out the various matters to which he had regard in his Remarks on Sentence and concluded:  
     
      
       
        
        I cannot see any circumstance which is special such as would require that the parole period be longer than one third of 4 years, which is 1 year 4 months. Accordingly the sentence will be imprisonment for 5 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and a parole period of 1 year 4 months.  
        
       
      
    12 The applicant referred in its written submissions to the following exchange which took place between his Honour and counsel for the applicant during the sentence proceedings: 
     
      
       
        
        Steele: This is a matter where I’d be asking the Court to find special circumstances 
         
         
        His Honour: And do what 
         
         
        Steele: Well to structure – to give him a longer period on parole so that he can enter… 
         
         
        His Honour: You’re the only one that’s ever asked for that. Bearing in mind this offence was committed after 1 February 
         
         
        Steele: Yes 
         
         
        His Honour: So the real sentencing regime takes effect 
         
         
        Steele: Yes certainly 
         
         
        His Honour: The first thing to do is to determine the non-parole period and then to determine the parole period and the parole period should not exceed one third unless there is a special circumstance which requires it to be more. So if I say four or five years for the sentence. Let’s say three years as the non-parole period. One-third of that is one year, the sentence is four years. Nowadays, no one asks for special circumstances to be found for an offence committed after 1 February. It means the total sentence is longer. 
         
         
        Steele: Yes, I thought your Honour that an approach that could be taken by a court in relation to setting a non-parole period is also to consider the head sentence that’s going to be imposed but I’ll phrase that differently 
         
         
        His Honour: s 44 is quite straightforward 
         
         
        Steele: Might I phrase my… 
         
         
        His Honour: Section 44 says this, “When sentencing an…to the offence”. So that’s the first thing I do, and that’s the period, as the act says, is mandatory. “The balance of….it being more”. That’s why nobody makes the submission any more that special circumstances exist, because no one wants their client to be potentially in custody longer than otherwise. 
         
         
        Steele: Certainly that’s not something I would ask as well your Honour. Perhaps I can structure what I’m seeking another way. I would ask that the Court consider a non-parole period that is reduced because of factors such as the defendant’s youth and need for rehabilitation in the community, the fact he’s likely to… 
         
         
        His Honour: Well all of those factors will be taken into account in the determination of the first step, the non-parole period, and I will 
         
         
        Steele: Thank you your Honour. 
        
       
      
    13 It was submitted that that approach was contrary to principle as subsequently expounded in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131 where, after equating s 44 (as amended) to the former Sentencing Act 1989 s 5, this Court stated: 
     
      
       
        
        [111] The view that was taken in  
        R v Moffitt 
         (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 in relation to the former s 5 of the  
        Sentencing Act 
         did not require the sentencing judge to first determine a minimum term, which was thereafter immutable, notwithstanding a subsequent finding of special circumstances. In substance, the section specifies the sequence in which the sentence was to be set, focussing upon the period which was considered appropriate to be served by way of a minimum period of actual imprisonment, followed by the period for a potential supervised release on parole. 
         
         
        [112] While there are separate considerations involved for s 44(2) of the Act, they need not be regarded as involving a two-step or sequential process since, as Spigelman CJ pointed out in  
        R v Hampton 
         (1998) 44 NSWLR 729, the relevant steps can be taken simultaneously. 
        
       
      
    14 There is a divergence between the approach that was initially indicated by his Honour and that taken in Way’s case. However such divergence did not result in material error as the latter part of the exchange between his Honour and counsel makes it clear his Honour proposed to take all relevant matters into account when determining the non-parole period. 
     
      
      Ground Two - His Honour erred in his assessment of the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. 
      
    15 The applicant initially was charged on 14 June 2003 with the offence of robbery in company whilst armed with a dangerous weapon contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 97(2). This was amended on 28 October 2003 to the charge to which the applicant pleaded guilty on that day.16 His Honour, in his Remarks on Sentence, stated the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        …appeared before a Magistrate on seven occasions between 15 June and 28 October 2003, and it was not until after the police obtained a match between [his] DNA and the DNA recovered from the replica hand gun… that the [applicant] pleaded guilty to the offence. His guilty plea was not given at the earliest appropriate opportunity. He is entitled to a discount in penalty of 15% on account of his guilty plea. 
        
       
      
    17 At the conclusion of sentencing the applicant, the following exchange occurred between his Honour and the applicant’s counsel: 
     
      
       
        
        Steele: Just in terms of the discount allowed for the plea, he was originally charged with an offence under s 97(2). It was only after an offer was made by the DPP to lay a charge under 97(1) he pleaded either on the first or second occasion after that had been offered to him. 
         
         
        His Honour: Well Mr Steele, it is unfortunate that I was not appraised as to that on the occasion on which you made submissions to me, although I realised from the form of the formal notice under s 51A [of the Act] that it had been amended from s 97 subs 2, dangerous weapon, to s 97 subs 1, offensive weapon. But having said that, I don’t intend to vary the sentence which I consider to be appropriate to the s 97 subs 1 offence.  
        
       
      
    18 The applicant submits that the plea of guilty was entered at the earliest opportunity and that a greater discount should have been allowed for the plea. 19 In the guideline judgment of this Court in R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, Spigelman CJ (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) held that, generally, in relation to the discount for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [152] … the appropriate range for a discount is from 10 – 25 per cent. 
         
         
        [153] The determination of where, within such a range, the discount should fall in a particular case is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing Judge. 
         
         
        [154] There are however two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case: 
         
         
        (i) The time at which a plea is entered. A plea at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has a greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of a trial.  
         
         
        (ii) the complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of the plea. 
         
         
        [155] The top of the range would be expected to be restricted to pleas at the earliest possible opportunity and should not be given, save in an exceptional case, after a matter has been set down for trial. A discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for late pleas, for example, on the date fixed for trial, unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial. 
        
       
      
    20 In R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 Hodgson JA said: 
     
      
       
        
        [5] If a plea is entered a long time after a person is first charged, but at a time when a lesser charge is substituted for a greater charge, the advantages to the administration of justice are less, even though the plea may have been at the earliest opportunity. There is in any event no entitlement to a 25% discount; and the fact that in this situation there are less advantages to the administration of justice can justify a smaller discount. 
         
         
        [6] This approach may mean that in some cases an offender may obtain a lower discount just because the prosecuting authorities initially brought a greater charge than that ultimately pursued, so that the delay in the plea of guilty was not the offender’s fault. But this is consistent with the nature of the discount as being at least in part a recognition of practical advantages, and not merely a recognition of mitigation of culpability. 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour’s conclusion that the appropriate discount was 15% was within the range suggested in R v Thomson and within the principles referred to in R v Dib. The matter is discretionary and his Honour confirmed, when the facts surrounding the background to the plea were further outlined to him, that he considered the sentence imposed appropriate. In my opinion, this ground of appeal fails.  
     
      
      Ground Three - The sentence imposed, in circumstances where the applicant was 19, had a relatively minor record, pleaded guilty at an early time, and had the disadvantaged childhood that he did, is manifestly excessive. 
      
    22 In R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, this Court promulgated a guideline sentence of a full term of between four and five years for armed robbery in respect of a certain profile, being: 
     
      
       
      (i) Young offender with no or little criminal history; 
       
       
      (ii) Weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; 
       
       
      (iii) Limited degree of planning; 
       
       
      (iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; 
       
       
      (v) Victim in a vulnerable position; 
       
       
      (vi) Small amount taken; 
       
       
      (vii) Plea of guilty. 
      
    23 Each of these factors was present in this case, save that the weapon was not capable of killing nor inflicting serious injury. However, the offence was committed in company and the applicant had a criminal history which was not insignificant. Counsel for the applicant and the Crown accepted the Henry guideline was relevant in the circumstances.24 There were two additional matters adverse to the applicant in that he was on bail when he committed the subject offence and the serious Form 1 offence. It was acknowledged in Henry that aggravating and mitigating factors will justify a sentence above or below the range.25 The applicant submits the sentence is manifestly excessive having regard to the applicant’s age, “relatively minor” record, early plea and disadvantaged childhood. Those matters were taken into account by his Honour but whether those matters were sufficiently taken into account does require further consideration. 26 The applicant’s age, record and plea are part of the Henry profile and do not merit further consideration so far as the overall sentence is concerned. 27 The seriousness of the Form 1 offence and the fact that the subject offence was not only serious but occurred whilst the applicant was on bail was sufficient to justify a sentence which exceeded the upper level of the Henry guideline. The overall sentence imposed by his Honour was not manifestly excessive and, in my opinion, should be confirmed.28 In the proceedings on sentence, the applicant’s counsel referred to the applicant’s youth and rehabilitation needs as forming the basis for a finding of special circumstances. There was evidence the applicant had had a disadvantaged childhood, that his teenage years from 13 to 17 were severely disrupted, and that there were prospects of rehabilitation if he was able to forego drugs and alcohol. Most of his offences were at the lower end of the criminal scale, they commenced during the period of disruption and none resulted in a custodial sentence. The applicant is of robust cognitive ability and has the capacity to make something of himself if he takes the opportunity to do so. In the light of these factors, I have concluded insufficient consideration was given by his Honour to the prospects of rehabilitation. 29 The prospects of rehabilitation give rise to special circumstances for the purposes of s 44 (2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which justify departure from the statutory ratio imposed by that subsection. I propose the non-parole period be reduced to 3 years and 3 months. In determining the non-parole period, I have taken into account not only the matters referred to above, but also the evidence tendered on the appeal that the applicant is studying advanced mathematics and hopes to do a TAFE course in electronic engineering and then work in that field, and that he has received a good report for his work in gaol, including that he requires minimal supervision.  
     
      
      Orders 
      
    30 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Leave to appeal granted. 
         
         
        2. Appeal allowed. 
         
         
        3. Sentence of imprisonment for 5 years and 4 months to commence on 14 June 2003 confirmed. 
         
         
        4. The non-parole period of 4 years is quashed. In lieu thereof, non-parole period of 3 years 3 months commencing on 14 June 2003 and expiring on 13 September 2006 substituted. 
        
       
      
    31 SMART AJ: I agree with Hislop J.

     REGINA v ANDREW NICHOLAS KALDOR 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: In this matter I have had the opportunity of reading in draft form the judgments of both Adams and Howie JJ, and for the reasons given by Howie J, I agree with him that the indictment was adequate, that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, and that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
    2 In particular, I agree with Howie J that a jury is generally better able to judge a case based on circumstantial evidence than a single judge or this Court. In this regard, I adhere to the view I expressed in R v Micallef (2002) 136 A Crim R 127, SLR 30 April 2004 at [44] that as a circumstantial case involves a consideration of the evidence in the light of the common experience of human affairs, it is essentially a question for the jury representing, as it does, the common experience of the community being comprised of men and women from different backgrounds, of different ages and with different experiences in life applying their collective knowledge of human affairs. That is not to say that there will not be cases of which Knight v The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 495 is an example (other examples are not easy to find) where an appellate court will conclude, in accordance with the principles enunciated by the High Court in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty; but I am satisfied that this is not such a case. 
     
      
    3 I also agree with Howie J that the significance of the failure of the appellant to make any real attempt to determine the contents or provenance of the package delivered to the hotel in Vietnam was not diminished by the lack of detail as to the extent or nature of the relationship between the appellant and Mr Sandford. The jury could only consider the evidence which was before them and it was not for them to speculate on what might have emerged if further evidence had been adduced.  
     
      
    4 I also observe that the evidence of Mr Gurvich (T 9) was that “we both collected our bags from the baggage carousel and took individual trolleys and started to move forward to the immigration counter”, and then the appellant spoke about going to the toilet and Gurvich collecting the guitar and “meet him”. Apparently the appellant did not leave his luggage trolley with Gurvich as might be expected in the circumstances, but took it to the toilet with him, further suggesting that he had no intention of coming back to “meet him”. This, it seems to me, was a further circumstance which the jury was entitled to take into account. 
     
      
    5 In relation to the Crown appeal against sentence, I agree with Howie J. 6 ADAMS J: The appellant, Andrew Nicholas Kaldor, who was fifty-seven years of age at the date of the alleged offence, was convicted on 5 December 2003 of an offence set out in the indictment in the following terms –  
     
      
       
        
        “[that he] on 21 May 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did procure the commission of an offence by David Israel Gurvich against s233B(1)(b) of the  
        Customs Act 
         1901, having imported into Australia prohibited imports to which section 233B of the  
        Customs Act 
         1901 (Cth) applied, namely, consisting of a quantity of heroin not being less than the trafficable quantity applicable to heroin, contrary to sub-section 11.2(1) of the  
        Criminal Code 
         1995 (Commonwealth) and paragraph 233B(1)(b) of the  
        Customs Act 
         1901 (Cth).” 
        
       
      
    7 It is obvious that the terms of this indictment meant that Kaldor could not be convicted unless Gurvich was guilty of the principal offence. It is undisputed that the prosecution case was that Gurvich had not committed any such offence but was the innocent dupe of the appellant. Accordingly, Kaldor could not be convicted of the charge for which he was placed on trial. He appeals from his conviction, however, not upon this ground but upon the ground that the evidence did not justify the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that he was aware in the relevant sense that the guitar which he gave Gurvich to bring through Customs at Sydney airport contained heroin. Kaldor contends, in terms of s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
     
      
       
      The role of this Court 
       
      
    8 The test provided in s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 has been considered in a number of cases, of which it is sufficient to refer to Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 where Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said (at 450-1, 452) –  
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        M v The Queen  
        (1994) 181 CLR 487, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey said (at 493) that the test for an unsafe or unsatisfactory verdict was whether the court thought that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was ‘open to the jury’ to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. The majority emphasised, however, that it was not the function of the court to answer that question merely by examining the transcript of evidence and the exhibits. Their Honours said that (at 493): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The majority judges explained (at 494) the application of the test as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Gaudron J agreed (at 508) with the majority formulation of the test, as did Brennan J (at 501), although His Honour said (at 501-502) that the question as to whether it was ‘open to the jury’ to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt was to be resolved by asking whether the jury was ‘upon the whole of the evidence … bound to have a reasonable doubt’ [Citing Dawson J in  
        Chidiac v The Queen 
         (1991) 171 CLR 432 at 451] or whether ‘the jury, acting reasonably, must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused’. 
        
       
       
        
        McHugh J said (at 525) that the correct test for determining whether a verdict should be set aside on the ground that it was unreasonable was ‘whether a reasonable jury must have had a reasonable doubt about the accused’s guilt’. McHugh J did not adopt the ‘open to the jury’ test because his Honour thought that such a test came ‘perilously close to applying the test for determining whether there was a sufficiency of evidence to convict the accused’ and would constitute ‘an unwarranted intrusion into the jury’s right to determine the facts in a criminal trial’ (at 525). However, the test formulated by the majority in  
        M  
        must now be accepted as the appropriate test for determining whether a verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory.” 
        
       
      
    9 Accordingly, this Court is required to undertake its own examination of the evidence in order to determine whether the jury, acting reasonably, should have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. It is important to note that, in this case, the evidence adduced by the Crown was not the subject of substantial controversy and Kaldor called no evidence. Leaving aside the considerations arising from the jury’s constitutional role as fact-finders, it enjoyed no advantage over this Court in evaluating the evidence and determining Kaldor’s guilt or otherwise.  
     
      
      The facts 
      
    10 The Crown case relied almost entirely upon the evidence of Gurvich, who had been a good friend of the appellant for something like fifteen years. Gurvich lived in Melbourne. Kaldor lived in Queensland. They kept in touch with each quite frequently and, in about April 2003, Kaldor, who had travelled to Vietnam before, mentioned to Gurvich that he intended to go there again. It was Gurvich who suggested that, as he was shortly completing a project and had some time on his hands, he would like to accompany Kaldor, which was agreed. Gurvich, who is a project developer and builder, managed to get, though a friend of his, some work to do in Vietnam, which he used to obtain upgrades for himself and Kaldor from economy to business class.  
     
      
    11 Kaldor arrived in Vietnam a few days before Gurvich but nothing turns on this. They stayed at a hotel recommended by Kaldor. During the ensuing week, Kaldor and Gurvich spent some but by no means all of their time together. On the day before the two were due to return to Australia, Gurvich was informed through his office that their upgrade to business class had been approved for their return journey.  
     
      
    12 On the day before they left, Gurvich and Kaldor met for lunch and Kaldor told Gurvich that “he’d had a phone call, and he’d been asked to bring a parcel back to Australia, a guitar.” Gurvich asked, “Why would anybody want to buy a Vietnamese guitar, it couldn’t be that good”, to which Kaldor replied, “Well, probably cheap”. Gurvich thought that he asked Kaldor who the guitar was for but said that he probably did not get an answer. At all events, Kaldor did not tell him the name of the person for whom he was bringing the guitar home.  
     
      
    13 Gurvich first saw the guitar at about 4pm on the day of their departure. He and Kaldor had lunched together and, when they returned to their hotel to collect their luggage and go to the airport, the receptionist told Kaldor in his presence that a guitar had been delivered to the hotel for him. He and Kaldor had brought their baggage down to the reception area and Gurvich saw a black guitar case, shrink-wrapped in plastic, placed with their luggage. At some unspecified point, Gurvich said that Kaldor was somewhat uncertain about whether the guitar was going to be collected at Sydney or Melbourne and he was asked, whether he could take it to Melbourne, if necessary. Gurvich said that he would do so if he was able to do so. 
     
      
    14 Gurvich said that, near the reception counter of the hotel, he and Kaldor were writing out luggage labels which were being placed on the luggage by employees of the hotel. The luggage was loaded onto the back of a vehicle and he and Gurvich were taken to the airport. The evidence does not disclose what name was on the luggage label attached to the handle of the guitar. At the airport the luggage was placed on two baggage trolleys. The guitar was put onto Gurvich’s trolley, he thought probably because he had less luggage than Kaldor. Gurvich’s evidence is not clear on this point but I gather that it was placed on the trolley by the taxi driver who helped them unload. They went to the check-in counter but it was early and, as it happened, the counter was not yet open. When the counter opened, all of the bags were placed on the conveyor. Kaldor and Gurvich were informed that it was overweight. Gurvich said that Kaldor had done a lot of shopping in Vietnam, and this was why he had so much luggage. Gurvich protested that they were supposed to be travelling business class and should therefore be allowed sixty kilograms, which was the weight of their luggage. Gurvich was told that he needed to see the supervisor and left the counter to do so, asking Kaldor to wait with the luggage in the meantime. After some telephone calls, Gurvich obtained confirmation that the upgrade had been approved and he returned to the counter. The operator then let the bags go through for loading. Gurvich suggested, however, that the guitar should be handled as fragile baggage and the operator was asked to put the appropriate badge sticker on it. It appears that Gurvich did this without reference to Kaldor. The airline baggage ticket attached to the guitar was in Gurvich’s name as, indeed, was the case with much of the other luggage. There was no evidence that this was done at Kaldor’s instigation. Gurvich said that it happened merely because the luggage had been placed together on the conveyor belt at the counter. 
     
      
    15 In due course, Gurvich and Kaldor boarded the aircraft, which arrived in Sydney shortly after 7am on 21 May. Gurvich said that it was necessary to collect the luggage from the carousel and then go through the immigration checkpoint where passports were inspected. (This was, as it happened, a mistake. It is clear that the initial immigration check precedes baggage collection.) He said that he and Kaldor had collected their bags from the baggage carousel, placed them on trolleys and started to move forward to the immigration (sic) counter when Kaldor said that he wanted to go to the toilet. Kaldor took his luggage trolley with him and suggested that Gurvich “might like to collect the guitar from the fragile baggage counter and meet him”. Since the airline baggage ticket attached to the guitar was in Gurvich’s name, this seems readily explicable. Where Gurvich and Kaldor were to meet once the guitar had been collected and Kaldor had finished in the lavatory was not further clarified, subject to the possibility (mentioned below) that by this time Kaldor had already asked him to take the guitar with him thorough Customs. Otherwise, Kaldor’s suggestion as to where they should meet is ambiguous.  
     
      
    16 Gurvich went over to the fragile baggage counter, which was about twenty metres from the carousel and waited for about five minutes before the guitar arrived. He said that, at this point, he had his back to the toilets and had not seen where Kaldor had gone. When Gurvich collected the guitar from the operator, he turned and looked towards the toilets waiting for Kaldor to come out. When Kaldor did not reappear, Gurvich thought he might have missed him so he called him on his mobile phone to ask where he was. Kaldor said, “I’m in the line, I’m almost outside (or, possibly, ‘in the customs queue’)”. Gurvich asked, “Well, what do you want me to do?” He said in chief that Kaldor responded, “Can you come out and bring the guitar with you?” Gurvich agreed in cross-examination that, in his police statement (about which he had given a lot of thought and consideration), he had not mentioned any request by Kaldor to bring the guitar with him through Customs. He also said that Kaldor’s request may have been made at an earlier time. This was not specified but the only relevant earlier time was before Kaldor had gone to the toilet. Gurvich then took his trolley down to the Customs line and pushed all his bags and the guitar case onto the conveyor belt that passed it through an X-ray machine. A Customs officer asked him whether the bags were his, to which Gurvich replied in the affirmative. He asked him about the guitar and he said that it was not his. The officer asked, “Who does the guitar belong to?” Gurvich replied, “I don’t know who it belongs to, but I am carrying it for a friend of mine because he was overweight in his luggage.” 
     
      
    17 Kaldor first presented himself at the primary customs and immigration barrier at about 8.19am. It seems that the guitar was taken through the X-ray monitor a few minutes before 8.47am.  
     
      
    18 At the officer’s request, Gurvich then opened the guitar case and saw in it what appeared to be a brand-new guitar. The case and the guitar, together with Gurvich, were taken by Customs officers to a nearby room. As he turned around, Gurvich said that he saw Kaldor being escorted back into the Customs hall by two officers but said in cross examination that, when he saw Kaldor shortly after a customs officer had spoken to him (Gurvich) he “could see Andrew down the other end waiting for me”. They had a short conversation. Subsequently, Gurvich was interviewed by officers of Customs and the Australian Federal Police.  
     
      
    19 When a metal plate was unscrewed from the guitar, parcels were located inside. These parcels contained heroin.  
     
      
    20 It was not suggested either by the Crown or by the defence that Gurvich knew about or had anything to do with the heroin. Indeed, so far as the defence was concerned, his account of what happened was not substantially in dispute, although some refinements and qualifications were the subject of cross-examination. Gurvich said that he had met a man called Sandford on a couple of occasions and that he had lived in Melbourne but had since moved elsewhere. He gave a physical description. He said that he had met him a number of times in Melbourne, on one occasion when he was with Kaldor many years ago and then on other odd occasions he had seen him in a social context at various places after Kaldor had moved to Queensland.  
     
      
    21 Customs officers gave evidence that the suspicious item in the guitar was seen when it was X-rayed. They also gave evidence of a conversation with Kaldor shortly before he entered the interview room under escort. The conversation was as follows –  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Mr Kaldor, is that your guitar? --- A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Whose guitar is it then? --- A. Barry Sandford. The guy is meeting us out the front.” 
        
       
      
    22 They all went into the interview room and Kaldor said that he needed to go to the toilet. He was permitted to do so but had to leave the door open for obvious reasons. He used the toilet, re-entered the room and the following conversation occurred –  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What is your job? --- A. Taxi driver. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where do you live? --- A. [An address in Surfers Paradise] 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you booked on a flight to Surfers today? --- A. Yes.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you travelling with the other gentleman? --- A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How long have you been away? --- A. Nine days. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. For holiday or business? --- A. Holiday.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. How do you know the other gentleman? --- A. He lives Melbourne. I used to live in Melbourne. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is that your guitar? --- A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Whose guitar is it? --- A. The guitar belongs to Barry Sandford, the guy meeting us at the front. I was supposed to pick up a guitar for Barry.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where did you get the guitar from? --- A. It was delivered to a hotel, The Saigon Pink 2 at the reception. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When was it delivered to the hotel? --- A. It arrived yesterday. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was it delivered in your name? --- A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. If the guitar was delivered to you, why did you not check it in under your name? --- A. We were originally travelling economy and were upgraded. My baggage allowance was 30 kilos and I had over 40 kilos. He had less baggage so he checked it in on his name. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you have any receipts or documents for the guitar? --- A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Does your friend who the guitar belongs to have a telephone number? --- A. [Kaldor picked up a phone and read it out.]” 
        
       
      
    23 Kaldor was then asked some questions about signing his inwards passenger card, identifying his luggage and saying that he had packed it himself and was fully aware of the contents of the bag. It was examined and contained nothing of interest. One of the customs officers, who had left the room a short time before, returned and asked for a description of Mr Sandford. This was given to her by Kaldor. It was similar to that given in evidence by Gurvich. Shortly afterwards, Kaldor was searched and then asked, “What is going on? Will I catch my plane?” In the circumstances, this appears to be a somewhat strange question which, if it does not indicate innocence, certainly does not suggest any consciousness of guilt. He was told that it would be necessary for him to wait for the Federal Police who were on their way. 24 Federal Police interviewed Kaldor shortly after 10am. He was asked –  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. As you are no doubt aware your friend was found to be carrying a guitar which we believe has heroin in it. From what he has told us and what you told customs I believe that you may be involved in the importation of that heroin. I would like to question you in relation to this but before I do I remind you that you do not have to say or do anything as anything you do say or do will be recorded and may later be used in evidence. Do you understand? --- A. Yes, but I have done nothing wrong. What’s the other person said about me?  
        
       
       
        
        Q. I can’t answer that question. --- A. He is not involved. I was supposed to bring the guitar back to give to a friend. He only brought it in because I had too much luggage and it was checked in under his name.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Before you say anything else I have to let you know what your rights are. You have the right to call a friend or a relative to inform them of your whereabouts. Do you understand that? --- A. Yes. [Kaldor said he would like to call someone whose name the officer could not recollect.] 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I am concerned that if you call someone you may tip off other persons whom we would like to arrest, so I will not let you do that at this time. Maybe sometime later when we know more about the situation. You also have the right to call a legal practitioner of your choice and speak in private to them and arrange for them to be present during any interview. Do you understand that? --- A. I want to call a solicitor.” 
        
       
      
    25 Kaldor was provided with a telephone book and telephoned one or more solicitors. At about 12.30pm a solicitor attended at the interview room and had a private conversation with Kaldor. It appears that the police were informed that Kaldor was too tired to take part in a record of interview at that time and he was taken to a police station to be charged and for the question of bail to be considered. Whilst Kaldor was in the interview room he was asked a number of times by police whether he would be prepared to participate in a controlled delivery of the guitar. He agreed to do so but, in the result, it did not take place for reasons that are not presently relevant. It also appears, though this is somewhat uncertain, that police did attempt to locate Sandford in the departure area but without success.  
     
      
    26 A number of individual packets were found in the guitar. The powder contained in them weighed 727 grams at an average of about 66% purity, yielding 479.3 grams of pure heroin. Although the guitar bore the brand “Magnum” and was in a bag bearing the brand “Fender”, there was no evidence as to its value. It remains to note that Sandford was, it appears, located in Melbourne but declined to be interviewed. It also appears that the telephone number given by Kaldor to police was indeed Sandford’s. Kaldor was not further interviewed.  
     
      
    27 Kaldor did not give evidence or call any witnesses. 
     
      
       
      The elements of the charge 
        
       
      
    28 I have already noted the fact that, as it was not suggested that Gurvich was himself involved in any criminal enterprise, let alone that of an offence under the Customs Act 1901, Kaldor could not be convicted of the offence with which he was charged, which was specifically brought under s11.2(1) of Criminal Code Act 1995 (the Code). As counsel both for Kaldor and the Crown agreed in this Court, the Crown case should have been framed in terms of s11.3 of the Code –  
     
      
       
        
        “11 
        . 
        3 Innocent Agency  
        
       
       
        
        A person who:  
         
        (a) has, in relation to each physical element of an offence, a fault element applicable to that physical element; and  
         
        (b) procures conduct of another person that (whether or not together with conduct of the procurer) would have constituted an offence on the part of the procurer if the procurer had engaged in it; 
         
        is taken to have committed that offence and is punishable accordingly.” 
        
       
      
    29 The indictment, in terms, alleged that Kaldor was an accessory before the fact, using the language of s11.2(1) of the Code, which was also identified in the charge as the relevant provision –  
     
      
       
        
        “11.2(1) A person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence by another person is taken to have committed that offence and is punishable accordingly.” 
        
       
      
    30 There is no doubt that the learned trial judge thought that this indictment was laid under that provision and not under s11.3, having mentioned it during an argument on the second day of the trial as to whether the Crown’s application for the jury to have a copy of the indictment should be acceded to. Shortly after lunch on the same day, his Honour received a note from the jury in the following terms –  
     
      
       
        
        “Could the jury please have the actual charges reconfirmed in layman’s terms? (Procuring and trafficking)” 
        
       
       
      His Honour, without at first seeking submissions from counsel, said, amongst other things –  
       
       
        
        “I consider it is appropriate that I indicate to you, in relation to the word ‘procure’, that it will be on the Crown to prove that it was the accused who intentionally caused or brought about the commission of the offence by David Israel Gurvich having imported into Australia certain goods.” 
        
       
       
      The Crown prosecutor then said –  
       
       
        
        “I don’t know if it is confusing the jury, your Honour, but the commission of an offence by David Gurvich, the Criminal Code does provide for use of an innocent agent in that regard.” 
        
       
       
      After saying that he thought that “that would unnecessarily confuse the matter”, his Honour said –  
       
       
        
        “I would think what the jury [is] … properly concerned with, is the word ‘procure’ and that, as I read the dictionary, definitions of procuring requires a causal link between the act of the procurer, which in this case is the accused, and the conduct of the other person, that being Mr Gurvich. Thereby, as I say, that the conduct of Mr Gurvich in importing the prohibited substance into Australia by Mr Kaldor, the accused, that conduct was that of Mr Kaldor or the accused, intentionally caused or brought about that conduct (sic).” 
        
       
       
      The Crown prosecutor agreed with this answer to the jury’s question. It is obvious, however, that this explanation was limited to the meaning of “procure”. 
       
      
    31 At the close of the Crown case an application for a directed verdict was made by counsel for Kaldor. The sole ground of this application was stated by his Honour as follows –  
     
      
       
        
        “Counsel for the accused submitted that an examination of the evidence, particularly the evidence of the witness Mr Gurvich, does not support the indictment, that the accused procured the commission of the offence by David Israel Gurvich”. 
        
       
       
      The Crown’s response to this submission was the contention that, whilst there was no direct evidence of any awareness  
      by the accused 
       of the presence of a prohibited substance in the guitar, the inference that he was so aware was justified by references to the circumstances as a whole. The trial judged noted –  
       
       
        
        “Counsel agreed that the jury would be directed that the matter for decision in this case is whether the accused did intentionally cause or bring about the commission of the offence by Mr Gurvich. I am concerned as to whether or not, on the evidence, it could be said that that evidence could support a verdict that the accused did intentionally cause or bring about the commission of the offence by Mr Gurvich.” 
        
       
      
    32 It seems to me that, despite his Honour’s earlier reference to s11.2 of the Code, both he and counsel understood the issue to be simply whether Kaldor used Gurvich as his instrument or agent to import the heroin and that whether Gurvich was himself guilty of an offence was immaterial. This was, however, a material misreading of the indictment, upon which Kaldor could only be convicted if Gurvich had committed the offence of importing the heroin.  
     
      
    33 When his Honour came to directing the jury he did so in the following terms –  
     
      
       
        
        “The accused is not charged with importing a prohibited substance into Australia. That is not the charge. The charge is that he did procure the commission of an offence by David Israel Gurvich of having imported into Australia a prohibited substance, namely heroin….Those words ‘did procure’ come from the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Therefore…what this charge is, is that the accused did something which brought about David Israel Gurvich importing a prohibited substance into Australia. I indicated to you earlier that ‘procure’ has a normal dictionary meaning…to cause or bring about. So, and I hope this is of assistance to you, did the accused cause or bring about the commission of the offence of the importation into Australia of a prohibited substance by David Israel Gurvich? I repeat that. Did the accused cause or bring about the commission of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    34 On the face of it, this passage rested fairly and squarely on s11.2(1) of the Code, namely charging Kaldor with having procured Gurvich’s crime, since Gurvich could not relevantly have imported the drugs unless he knew or believed it likely that the guitar contained them. But later language used by his Honour was more ambiguous, leaving open the possibility that Gurvich’s “importation” was innocent and that Kaldor’s guilt was established if Gurvich was the instrument by which Kaldor imported the heroin –  
     
      
       
        
        “Did the accused mean or intentionally cause or mean to cause the importation of the prohibited substance heroin into the country. That is what this case has really hinged upon so far as the evidence is concerned…As I have already indicated, the question is an essential ingredient, did the accused intentionally cause or bring about the commission of an offence by David Gurvich? I have already indicated that the intention would also be looked at in accordance with the Commonwealth Criminal Code, did the accused mean to cause or bring about the importation of the prohibited substance by Mr Gurvich.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour then went on briefly to outline the circumstances upon which the Crown relied from which “you could infer that the accused intended or meant to cause Mr Gurvich to import the prohibited substance into the country”.  
       
      
    35 This was repeated at the end of his Honour’s review of the evidence in the following way –  
     
      
       
        
        “But we really come down to this question of the evidence and whether or not, on the evidence, you can find beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended or meant that David Israel Gurvich import a prohibited substance into Australia.” 
        
       
      
    36 The ambiguity of language was never corrected. However, no application for re-direction was made by either counsel as to this characterisation of the crucial question for determination. His Honour’s charge to the jury continued on the following day and this question was repeated to the jury without significant change.  
     
      
    37 The question left to the jury following these directions as implicitly agreed to by counsel on both sides was not the question distinctly presented by the terms of the indictment, namely whether Gurvich having been guilty of the offence of importing heroin, Kaldor had induced him to commit it. Rather, the case left to the jury was whether Kaldor had used Gurvich as his (innocent) agent to import the heroin. Having regard to Gurvich’s account at the hotel reception and the airport, there can be no doubt that Kaldor was indeed importing the guitar case into Australia, whether or not Gurvich was also doing this. 
     
      
    38 The introduction of agency, whether under s11.2(1) or 11.3 of the Code, was an unnecessary complication in what was essentially a very simple case. Indeed, there was no need for the Crown to insert Gurvich’s involvement in the indictment at all. It is clear that, by the time the guitar case was at the fragile baggage counter it had then been imported, although no doubt the process of importation continued up to the time it was seized by the customs officers. It was never a part of the case or of anybody’s understanding of it, that Gurvich had himself committed an offence, despite the terms of the indictment. 
     
      
    39 In this Court, counsel for Kaldor noted the problem with the indictment but took no point about it on the ground that, at all events, it could be cured by application of s7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. That provision permits the Court of Criminal Appeal to substitute a verdict on an alternative charge where “on the finding of the jury it appears…that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved the appellant guilty of that charge” but only where “the jury could on the indictment have found the appellant guilty of” the alternative offence (emphasis added). Here it could not be said that a verdict on the basis that Gurvich was an innocent agent was an alternative open on the indictment, which alleged that he had committed an offence procured by Kaldor.  
     
      
    40 The only answer, as it seemed to me, is that there was an implicit, pro tanto amendment of the indictment so that the charge which went to the jury alleged that Kaldor was the principal offender and Gurvich was his innocent agent within the meaning of s11.3 of the Criminal Code. Alternatively, the words “did procure the commission of an offence by David Israel Gurvich against s233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 having” were implicitly omitted as surplusage with a consequential omission of the reference to “subsection 11.2(1)” of the Criminal Code. As I understand it, this is the solution proposed by the other members of this Court, for the persuasive reasons set out in the judgment of Howie J. 
     
      
    41 Although I was initially attracted to this solution, I have ultimately come to the view that it is unsatisfactory, essentially for the reason that the indictment was not actually amended at all. At common law, an indictment cannot be amended: Maher v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 221 at 230. Sections 20 and 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provide for amendment of indictments but this can only be done by the prosecutor (by leave or with the consent of the accused) or by order of the Court. There was no order and the prosecutor did not actually amend the indictment. 
     
      
    42 In R v McKinney and Judge (NSWCCA, 6 September 1993, unreported), the indictment charged the appellants with, amongst other offences, “breaking and entering a dwelling house, assaulting and inflicting grievous bodily harm while therein (s110 Crimes Act 1900)”. It was contended that, as this charge required proof both of an assault and the infliction of grievous bodily harm, it disclosed no offence. It was clear that the elements of the offence did not require proof of assault, which was a mistaken reference to another offence in the relevant section of the Crimes Act 1900 creating the offences. Accordingly, the indictment specified all three necessary elements and one unnecessary element. The error was held to be merely technical and of no consequence. If I may respectfully say so, this is plainly correct. However, the situation in this case is significantly different. The charge here was entirely correct and undoubtedly disclosed an offence. In its terms, however, the accused could only be “taken to have committed the principal offence” if the Crown proved that Gurvich had himself committed the principal offence. R v Smith and Kirton (1990) 47 A Crim R 43 was a case where the Court rejected the submission that the contentious phrase (assault and robbery) was duplicitous, holding that the reference to assault was mere surplusage. 
     
      
    43 The words that I have identified as possible surplusage, were not surplusage at all in respect of the charge to which the indictment explicitly referred. As the indictment stood, proof that Gurvich had committed the offence alleged against him was an essential element of the charge against Kaldor and not merely a particular of evidence. In this respect the Code is no different to the common law. The result of the error made below is that the record wrongly shows that Gurvich committed a serious crime of which he was not even charged. It is clear that, in a practical sense, Kaldor has not suffered any substantive or procedural injustice, except to the extent that he must have been acquitted on the indictment as it stood. But to my mind the record – which cannot now be corrected unless this appeal be upheld and a new trial conducted on a proper indictment – demonstrates a judgment which was simply never made and, with respect for those with whom I differ on this point, I do not agree that this is of no moment. I add for completeness that s11.2(1) of the Code does not assist, since Kaldor had not aided, abetted, counselled or procured the commission of an offence by Gurvich.  
     
      
    44 There was certainly a misunderstanding – shared by all participants in the trial – as to what proved the elements of the charge in the indictment, but its terms were unambiguous. When Kaldor pleaded not guilty, issue was taken with every element necessary to be proved in the charge laid and he must have been acquitted if the Crown failed to prove every element. In the result, he was convicted upon an indictment that required proof beyond reasonable doubt of the element that he had procured the commission of a crime by Gurvich when there was no evidence that Gurvich had committed such a crime. Put otherwise, he was convicted of an offence upon which he had not been arraigned, to which he had not pleaded and which the jury had not been sworn to try. To my mind, this is a serious error of law.  
     
      
      The relevant knowledge 
       
      
    45 It was necessary for the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Kaldor intended to import a narcotic drug. Proof of this intention would be satisfied if the prosecution established that Kaldor knew that the guitar case contained or was likely to contain a narcotic drug of any quantity: Kural v The Queen (1987) 162 CLR 502 at 505; Pereira v DPP (1988) 82 ALR 217; 35 A Crim R 382; R v Vergara [2001] NSWCCA 24. It appears that the Code does not affect this requirement: Regina v Narongchai Saengsai-Or [2004] NSWCCA 108. 
     
      
    46 The Crown submitted that the following circumstances lead to the inference, beyond reasonable doubt that Kaldor was aware that the guitar case contained a prohibited drug or it was likely that it did so –  
     
      
       
        
        (i) Kaldor did not tell Gurvich whom the guitar was for; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) it was inherently unlikely that someone would want to bring a guitar to Australia from Vietnam when that guitar was described by Kaldor as “probably cheap” and which was heavy; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) Kaldor did not examine the guitar; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) there were no receipts or documents for the guitar; 
        
       
       
        
        (v) Kaldor’s behaviour at Sydney airport when he suggested that Gurvich should collect the guitar, leaving Gurvich after indicating that he was going to the toilet and stating to Gurvich on the telephone that he was “nearly outside” and asking him (expressly or implicitly) to “come out and bring the guitar” with him; 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) it was inherently unlikely that a man fitting Kaldor’s description of Sandford would want a cheap electric guitar; 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) the inconsistency between Kaldor telling Gurvich in Vietnam that the guitar was to be delivered to Melbourne and his statements to customs officers that Sandford was waiting at Sydney airport for the guitar; and 
        
       
       
        
        (viii) the inherent unlikelihood of Sandford travelling to Sydney to pick up a cheap electric guitar. 
        
       
      
    47 Of course, all these matters need to be considered together as strands in a suggested cable of guilt. However, it remains necessary to examine each one, if only because the Crown contended that each is suspicious and, taken together, demonstrated Kaldor’s guilt. It seems to me that some of these matters are trivial, if not irrelevant, whilst none is decisive and that, even when taken together (as, of course, they must), they fall far short of proof beyond reasonable doubt of Kaldor’s guilt.  
     
      
    48 As to the first, Gurvich’s evidence was far from categorical that he asked Kaldor whom the guitar was for. I have already pointed to this evidence. Not only did he say that he thought he asked the question, he also said that he “probably” did not get an answer. At all events, not every question is answered by friends in conversation. It would depend, amongst other things, upon whether Kaldor was paying any attention to Gurvich at that point. If the point is that, asked for or not, Kaldor did not tell Gurvich who requested him to bring the guitar home, this seems to me to be inconsequential. As to the unlikelihood of anyone – in this case Sandford or someone in his position – wanting to have a guitar brought from Vietnam which was heavy and “probably cheap”, it is clear that Kaldor did not assert that the guitar was cheap. His answer, as reported by Gurvich, was obviously a speculative explanation for somebody wanting to buy a Vietnamese guitar which, Gurvich supposed, could not be very good. It is clear that Gurvich himself was speculating about the quality of Vietnamese guitars. More fundamentally, there was no evidence that suggested that the guitar was Vietnamese or that Kaldor or Gurvich for that matter knew its place of manufacture. As to its being heavy, it appears that Gurvich had but one bag and it was not reasonable to infer that carrying the additional item comprising the guitar was an unreasonable imposition in any sense. The reason for its weight was obvious: the additional weight of the heroin would be unlikely to be noticed. But this would be effective also to conceal the concealed parcels from Kaldor. 
     
      
    49 The third alleged circumstance relied on by the Crown is that Kaldor did not examine the guitar. This is not correct. It seems certain that that Kaldor did not examine the guitar once it had been delivered to the hotel but this is understandable when it was shrink-wrapped and he was bringing it for Sandford whom he knew. There is no evidence one way or another as to Kaldor’s previous contact with the parcel. It follows that there is no basis for concluding that he had not examined it. There was also no evidence that he asked or inquired about its provenance. But that cannot justify the conclusion that therefore he made no such inquiry or that he probably did not or even that he apparently did not. It is simply a matter about which there is no evidence, one way or the other. Accordingly, I am respectfully unable to agree with Howie J that the jury were entitled to infer that there had been such a failure and from that fact to draw an adverse inference about his guilt. For all that is known, Kaldor may well have seen the guitar, examined it, seen it placed in the case and shrink-wrapped and arranged for its delivery to his hotel.  
     
      
    50 It is worth, perhaps, making the point that a person who went so far as to open up the guitar to make sure it contained no drugs, would almost certainly have the suspicion that it might contain them. As there is no basis for concluding that he did not examine the guitar, short of unscrewing the back plate, it follows that the truly crucial fact was not lack of examination but that Kaldor agreed to bring the guitar case into Australia on behalf of someone else when it contained drugs that could only be discovered by disassembly.  
     
      
    51 On the face of it, this might be a suspicious circumstance. But how far does it really go? It is one thing to accept a parcel from a stranger, quite another to accept one from a friend. After all, Gurvich (who knew Sandford, but not perhaps all that well) obviously had no suspicions at all about the guitar – he was perfectly happy to take it through Customs at Sydney airport, presumably because he trusted Kaldor. There was no evidence about the relationship between Kaldor and Sandford. So far as the evidence went, he may have been a close and trusted friend or he may have been a mere acquaintance. No assumptions about this matter can be made and commonsense does not help. It was for the Crown to prove that the reason that Kaldor brought the guitar from Vietnam to Australia was that he intended to import prohibited drugs. It seems to me that the mere fact that he brought in a guitar, which he had not troubled to disassemble, for someone else whom he knew, and possibly knew well, is no more than sufficient to give rise to a suspicion of guilt, there being no evidence at all as to the circumstances in which the guitar case came into his possession, except that it was at Sandford’s request. I appreciate that this was not the only incriminating circumstance but, so far as it goes, I do not think that it amounts to much. 
     
      
    52 Except for what happened on arrival at Sydney Airport, the other circumstances relied on by the Crown are insignificant. The lack of documentation proves nothing. The Crown prosecutor at the trial and, for that matter, the Crown prosecutor in this Court was unable to suggest how the lack of documents was material. The sixth point relied on by the Crown depends upon an assumption as to the value of the guitar, which had no evidentiary basis, but is at all events a non sequitur. Persons of any description might want an electric guitar. Indeed, persons of any description might want a cheap electric guitar and they might want it for many reasons. There is nothing in this point. So far as the inconsistency about the destination of the guitar is concerned, I do not think this amounts to much either. At the most, the appellant told Gurvich that it might be necessary to deliver the guitar in Melbourne. The fact that he apparently knew or at least believed that Sandford was in Sydney waiting to collect the guitar is simply evidence that, after the conversation with Gurvich, it was no longer necessary to request this favour of him. His apparent readiness to permit Gurvich to carry the guitar to Melbourne, should that prove necessary, suggests that he was unaware of its cargo rather than incriminates him. As to the last point made by the Crown, there is no evidence that Kaldor suggested that Sandford had travelled to Sydney for the specific purpose of picking up the guitar, cheap or otherwise. Kaldor said nothing about why Sandford might be in Sydney, simply asserting that he believed he was waiting at the airport. 
     
      
    53 This brings me to what happened on arrival in Sydney. There is nothing of itself suspicious in Kaldor going to the toilet and asking Gurvich to collect the guitar from the fragile baggage counter. There is no evidence that Kaldor did not go to the toilet and no reason to suppose that he did not. The time involved was not, it seems, unusually long. In light of Gurvich’s concession in cross-examination as to when Kaldor asked him to bring the guitar through Customs, two possible scenarios arise. On the assumption that Gurvich’s evidence in chief is accepted, the suspicious circumstance is that, having asked Gurvich to collect the guitar, Kaldor went through Customs without seeking Gurvich out to carry the guitar through Customs himself. On the assumption that Gurvich’s concession is accepted, Kaldor might well have thought that Gurvich had picked up the guitar and would go through Customs without waiting for him. On this scenario, the suspicious circumstance is that Kaldor asked Gurvich to take the guitar through Customs. The crucial question is: why did Kaldor act in this way? A consideration of the possible explanations is therefore inescapable. This is not to deny the Crown of the probative value of the evidence but to evaluate that probative value.  
     
      
    54 The Crown case assumes the correctness of the first scenario. It is submitted that Kaldor had not acted thoughtlessly in going through Customs by himself without waiting for Gurvich, but deliberately manipulated Gurvich into carrying the guitar through Customs because Kaldor knew that it contained prohibited drugs. The strength of this reasoning depends upon a number of assumptions, of which the major one to my mind, is that Kaldor could not reasonably have supposed that Gurvich had collected the guitar and already moved through Customs. If this were an inference rather than assumption, then it would be a significant pointer to Kaldor’s guilt. It depends, in part, on the times involved, on the geography of the baggage collection area and the extent to which it was crowded. There was no evidence on either of the latter matters (indeed, the evidence does not disclose where the fragile baggage counter was in relation to the Customs barrier) and the important time lapse – between Kaldor’s going to the toilet and his passing through Customs – remained vague. The problem with going beyond suspicion in respect of this circumstance depends, I think, upon assumptions which the Crown made no attempt to establish by evidence and, in the result, are no more than speculative. I respectfully agree with Howie J that “the possibility that, having gone to the toilet, the appellant merely forgot about Gurvich and the guitar case” should be rejected. However, it is unnecessary to suppose that Kaldor forgot about Gurvich and the guitar case. Inferring that Kaldor made a deliberate decision not to worry about bringing the guitar case through Customs as he (correctly) thought Gurvich would do, if he asked, the question is whether this proves that he knew it contained heroin or merely that he took convenient advantage of Gurvich’s helpfulness. Or, as I have mentioned, he may simply thought that Gurvich had already taken it through. It seems to me that Kaldor’s behaviour is entirely explicable by his simply taking advantage of Gurvich’s apparent willingness to carry the guitar for him. After all, it appears that Gurvich had far less luggage that Kaldor to carry. Moreover, such behaviour is consistent with a belief that the guitar was not especially valuable. If Kaldor was not all that concerned about the guitar, why would he bother to take it through personally? Thoughtless, careless, impolite it might be, but I do not think that it is possible to conclude that it established that he knew that there were drugs in the guitar.  
     
      
    55 The second scenario differs for the first to the extent that Kaldor’s request to Gurvich to take the guitar through Customs together with their agreement to meet, could well have meant that he expected Gurvich to collect the guitar case and meet him outside the Customs area, even though Gurvich apparently thought that they would meet after he had collected the guitar and Kaldor had finished in the toilet. The suspicious circumstance is said to be that Kaldor asked Gurvich to take the guitar through Customs. However, Kaldor’s need to go to the toilet may well have been genuine and to ask his companion to collect the guitar, he having the receipt and far less luggage, and make his (Gurvich’s) way through Customs (implicitly) without waiting for him does not seem to me to be more than suggestive. Of course, if Kaldor did not think that the guitar contained anything illicit, there is nothing suspicious in his asking Gurvich to take it through Customs for him. Thus the conclusion that the request is suspicious depends upon an assumption about the very fact that it is suggested it proves. Nor do I see that assumptions about what most people might or might not do about asking travelling companions to take innocent luggage through Customs, which anyway strike me as largely speculation (and really as code for what I might do), provide a sound basis for drawing an inference about what Kaldor’s reasons actually were. 
     
      
    56 I am very far from suggesting that Kaldor’s conduct at the airport was not suspicious at all but, in my view, innocent explanations remain reasonably and ineluctably open and their hypothetical character is logically no different from those urged by the Crown. Shortly put, what Kaldor did is consistent both with his guilt and his innocence.  
     
      
    57 Howie J considers that it would be extremely unlikely that an innocent person would be entrusted with the delivery of a cargo so valuable as half a kilogram of heroin, mentioning the possible failure to comply with the request, for example because of excess baggage costs. The evidence demonstrated that arrangements to avoid excess baggage costs were made by Gurvich at his own instigation at the last minute when he and Kaldor were at the airport. This argument was not put to the jury, nor was it mentioned by the prosecutor in this Court. With respect, I find it unconvincing. Once Kaldor had agreed to take the case, it seems to me highly unlikely that he would leave it behind. It was delivered to his hotel and placed with his luggage by the hotel staff, without his inquiry. Once it got to the airport it was going to Australia. Maybe there was some slight risk that Kaldor would simply decide that he could not be bothered but he could scarcely leave the case at the airport. The assessment of this risk involves far more speculation, including about the nature of the relationship between Kaldor and Sandford, which I have already discussed, than I feel justified in undertaking and I do not consider that it would have been appropriate for the jury to undertake. There may be significant advantages, moreover, in using an innocent agent to carry drugs past a Customs’ inspection. With respect, I cannot see that this point is much more than a straw in the wind. 
     
      
    58 Militating to some extent against the likelihood of Kaldor’s guilt are the facts that he drew attention to himself at Hanoi Airport by having excess luggage, for which it is obvious he was not ready, mentioned Sandford to the police immediately and, so far as it went, what he told the police about the telephone number was correct. Furthermore, it appears that Sandford was known also to Gurvich. Gurvich’s description of Kaldor’s conduct when he saw him after the telephone call was that he was “waiting” for Gurvich to come through Customs. By that time it must have been obvious to Kaldor that all items were being X-rayed as they went through the Customs barrier and, therefore, that if there was indeed heroin in the guitar it would be detected. Yet he made no attempt, so it seems, to abscond. 
     
      
    59 All the circumstances to which I have referred must, of course, be considered together. The only really significant suspicious facts – that Kaldor carried a sealed item for another person and that he acted in a way that meant that his companion rather than himself ran the gauntlet of Customs’ inspection at the airport – together raise a substantial suspicion of guilt. But, absent assumptions with no evidentiary basis, they are also consistent with his innocence.  
     
      
    60 It seems to me, with great respect, that the argument articulated by Howie J (with which Dunford J agrees) in substance reverses the onus of proof. His Honour states that it is inappropriate “to deprive a piece of evidence of its potential value in proving the Crown’s case simply because its probative force may have been affected by some other fact that was not in evidence”. This reasoning, in substance and effect, is that a suspicious fact, or collection of facts, that potentially establishes guilt, actually does so unless some other fact not in evidence, though reasonably possible (or, in other words, not excluded), is established. The only possible source of the justifying fact is the accused and to reason in this way, in my respectful view is implicitly either to reverse the onus of proof or draw an impermissible inference from the accused’s silence. With unfeigned respect for Dunford and Howie JJ, I think that this is a fundamental error of principle for which it is unnecessary to cite more than Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) 205 CLR 50 and Peacock v The King (1911) 13 CLR 619 per Griffiths CJ at 634: “[The] circumstances must be such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused.”  
     
      
    61 I wish to take up one other matter of principle. Dunford J, whose judgment in draft I have also had the benefit of reading, considers that “a jury is generally better able to judge a case based on circumstantial evidence than a single judge or this Court”. Although these observations are obiter dicta, they raise such an important question that I feel a brief respectful response is necessary. 
     
      
    62 There is no doubt that jurors are well qualified to make the determinations of fact that are entrusted to them in criminal trials and I do not see any distinction in this regard between circumstantial and other cases. However, the assertion that juries are generally superior to judges in this regard is, if I may respectfully say so, a speculative and, ultimately, unhelpful supposition. Our system of trial by jury does not assume – and has never assumed – that any such superiority exists. Rather, it is a fortunate accident of our history that, since early times, citizens have been involved as jurors in the administration of justice, especially criminal justice. The benefits of this involvement are obvious and substantial. But this does not arise from or depend upon any assumptions about the relative fact-finding abilities of judges or juries, a matter which is necessarily guesswork since, although judges must give reasons for their decisions, the process of decision making by juries is completely opaque.  
     
      
    63 At all events, it is the inescapable duty of this Court, under s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act on any appeal against conviction to “allow the appeal if it is of the opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence…”. The proper approach to this matter is the subject of well-settled authority, which I have set out above. The deference to be properly allowed to the jury’s verdict results from its constitutional position as the primary fact-finder and the advantage that will usually flow from having seen and heard the evidence about which it is necessary to make a judgment: it does not depend upon any assumption about their superior ability to assess “the conduct of persons”, especially, I might add, where – as here – they know nothing or next to nothing about the individual whose conduct is in question. I have no difficulty in acknowledging the considerable usefulness of a jury’s ability in evaluating general standards of behaviour but it seems to me to be self-evident that the question of what has motivated or what is known or believed by particular individuals is a very different question indeed and the supposition that what would generally be the case establishes what is so in an individual case is plainly unreasonable, for all that it might give rise to a suspicion or even a probability. Indeed, it seems to me, that it is likely that this flawed reasoning has led to the guilty verdict in this case.  
     
      
    64 Commonsense judgments, of course, are both necessary and appropriate but this cannot mean that analysis of the facts is not also essential, in particular an examination of the assumptions upon which the commonsense conclusions are based. It is this examination that, in this case, establishes that the verdict is unreasonable in the relevant sense. 
     
      
    65 For these reasons I consider that the verdict is unreasonable in the sense that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about Kaldor’s guilt and, accordingly, the appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered.  
     
      
    66 As I am in the minority in respect of the conviction appeal, it is necessary for me to consider the Crown appeal against sentence. Given Kaldor’s guilt, I agree with the other members of the Court, for the reasons given by Howie J, that his sentence was significantly less than the learned sentencing judge’s discretion permitted. I also agree with the orders proposed by his Honour and the reasons for them.  
     
      
    67 HOWIE J: I have had the considerable advantage of reading the judgment of Adams J in draft and gratefully adopt the facts of the matter as set out in his reasons. Unfortunately I cannot agree with his Honour’s conclusion that the evidence in the Crown case was insufficient to justify the conviction of the applicant and, in particular, I do not believe that the conviction is either unreasonable or that it cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. I also wish to add some further comments as to the form of the indictment. 
     
      
       
      Form of the indictment 
       
      
    68 It was unfortunate, to say the least, that the Crown case was presented in such a confused understanding of the legal ramifications of the very simple factual issue that arose on the evidence to be called by the Crown. As Adams J points out, the only issue in dispute was whether the appellant knew to the required degree that the guitar case contained heroin when he caused it to be imported into Australia. The Crown having determined not to prosecute Gurvich for any participation in the importation, he was obviously to be presented as an innocent agent of the appellant in his attempt to bring the guitar case from the luggage hall through the Custom’s check and onto the concourse where, on the Crown’s case, the appellant would be waiting to take possession of it. It is important to bear in mind that the importation of the guitar case was complete before Gurvich took it into his possession from the fragile goods area of the luggage hall. The Crown case was in effect that the appellant by a ruse had caused Gurvich to carry the guitar case through the Customs check because the appellant knew that the guitar case had heroin inside it. 
     
      
    69 However, despite the Crown’s efforts to unduly complicate the matter, this was how the issue was ultimately left to the jury. It was never suggested to Gurvich in cross-examination of him that he was aware of the contents of the guitar case at any time before the Customs officers stopped him. There was, at the end of the day, no suggestion made to the jury by counsel or the trial judge that Gurvich may have been implicated in the importation of the drug. It was accepted that the appellant caused the guitar case to be imported into Australia, at least insofar as it arrived in the luggage hall of the Sydney terminal. The only issue left to the jury was whether when he did so he was aware that it contained a narcotic substance. The appellant’s actions after the importation of the guitar case were relied upon by the Crown as evidence of his intention or knowledge at the time of the importation. 
     
      
    70 Adams J has in detail set out the manner in which the issues were left to the jury by the trial judge during the summing up and has quoted from his Honour’s directions with regard to the terms of the indictment and his explanations to the jury of what the Crown had to prove before they could convict the appellant. I agree with Adams J that, despite the considerable complication to what was a remarkably simple case caused by the form of the indictment, at the end of the day the jury could have had no doubt as to the issue that had to be resolved by them. There is, in my opinion, no possibility of a miscarriage of justice arising by reason of the terms of the charge or the manner in which it was explained to the jury notwithstanding that there was some confusion arising from the way the charge was framed. 
     
      
    71 There is, however, no ground of appeal based upon the form of the indictment or the inconsistency between the allegation set out in the charge and the evidence presented by the Crown. Mr Hulme SC, who appeared for the appellant on the hearing of the appeal, conceded to the Court that the appellant could have been convicted of the offence of importing the heroin notwithstanding the form of the indictment. Although the conduct of counsel both at trial and on appeal cannot absolve this Court from ensuring that the accused was lawfully convicted of the offence charged in the indictment, in my view the concession was well founded and ought to be accepted. 
     
      
    72 It is important to note that the offence under s 233B(1)(iii) of the Customs Act, which was the foundation of the charge brought against the appellant, is one of importing narcotic goods. The Customs Act contains no provision relating to the determination of criminal responsibility, either generally or with respect to an offence under s 233B. Although there are some provisions found in the subsections of s 233B that are concerned with proof of an offence under that section, none are relevant to the issues presently before this Court. Provisions relating to criminal responsibility generally and which apply to an offence under s 233B are to be found in the Criminal Code (the Code). The inter-relationship between the provisions of the Code and s 233B(1) was considered in R v Saengsai-Or [2004] NSWCCA 108. The elements of the offence of importing were put to the jury in the present case consistently with this. 
     
      
    73 Criminal responsibility for an offence to which the Code applies is generally determined in accordance with s 3.2 of the Code. That provisions is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
       
       
        
         
        3.2 Establishing guilt in respect of offences 
         
         
         In order for a person to be found guilty of committing an offence the following must be proved:  
         
          
          (a) the existence of such physical elements as are, under the law creating the offence, relevant to establishing guilt;  
           
          (b) in respect of each such physical element for which a fault element is required, one of the fault elements for the physical element. 
          
         
        
       
      
    74 According to this provision, as it applies to an offence under s 233B(1)(iii), the appellant was guilty of the offence if he imported the guitar case into Australia (the “physical element” of the offence) intending to import the drug (the “fault element” of the offence). An intention to import the drug could be inferred if the jury found that the appellant knew that the case contained heroin or was aware of the real chance that it did. This is, in effect, how the matter was left to the jury: that is on the basis of normal criminal responsibility for the offence of importing narcotic goods as set out in R v Saengsai-Or. 
     
      
    75 Provisions relating to extended criminal responsibility for an offence are contained in Division 11 of Part 2.4 of the Code. That Division contains provisions dealing with the following: attempt (s 11.1); complicity and common purpose (s 11.2); innocent agency (s 11.3); incitement (s11.4); and conspiracy (s 11.5) 
     
      
    76 Section 11.2 relevantly states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        11.2 Complicity and common purpose  
         
        (1) A person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence by another person is taken to have committed that offence and is punishable accordingly.  
         
        (2) For the person to be guilty:  
         
          
          (a) the person's conduct must have in fact aided, abetted, counselled or procured the commission of the offence by the other person; and  
           
          (b) the offence must have been committed by the other person. 
          
         
        (3) For the person to be guilty, the person must have intended that:  
         
          
          (a) his or her conduct would aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of any offence (including its fault elements) of the type the other person committed; or  
           
          (b) his or her conduct would aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of an offence and have been reckless about the commission of the offence (including its fault elements) that the other person in fact committed. 
          
         
        
       
      
    77 That provision, in its terms, does not create an offence but merely states a way in which a person may commit an offence even though not falling within the terms of s 3.2 of the Code. In accordance with the principles at common law, a person cannot be guilty of an offence under this provision unless the person being aided, abetted, counselled, or procured commits an offence. 
     
      
    78 Section 11.6 of the Code makes it clear that s 11.2 is not an offence creating provision even though some of the sections in Division 11 do create offences in respect of Commonwealth offences found under the Code or in some other Federal statute. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        11.6 References in Acts to offences 
          
         
        (1) A reference in a law of the Commonwealth to an offence against a law of the Commonwealth (including this Code) includes a reference to an offence against section 11.1 (attempt), 11.4 (incitement) or 11.5 (conspiracy) of this Code that relates to such an offence.  
         
        (2) A reference in a law of the Commonwealth (including this Code) to a particular offence includes a reference to an offence against section 11.1 (attempt), 11.4 (incitement) or 11.5 (conspiracy) of this Code that relates to that particular offence.  
         
        (3) Subsection (1) or (2) does not apply if a law of the Commonwealth is expressly or impliedly to the contrary effect.  
         
        (4) In particular, an express reference in a law of the Commonwealth to:

        does not mean that the first-mentioned law is impliedly to the contrary effect. 
        
       
      
    79 The point is that s 11.2 is not mentioned in the section and this is an acknowledgment by the drafter that the section does no more than extend criminal liability for an offence contained in the Code or some other statute. In case it was thought by the reader of s 11.6 that the drafter might simply have overlooked s 11.2, the note following s 11.6 states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Note: Sections 11.2 (complicity and common purpose) and 11.3 (innocent agency) of this Code operate as extensions of principal offences and are therefore not referred to in this section.  
         
        
       
      
    80 The charge laid against the appellant in the indictment was in the following terms, my underlined as to which see later in this judgment: 
     
      
       
        
         
        On 21 May 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales  
        did procure the commission of an offence by David Israel Gurvich against s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901, having 
         imported into Australia prohibited imports to which s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) applied, namely, consisting of a quantity Heroin being not less than the traffickable quantity applicable to Heroin, contrary to subsection 11.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) and paragraph 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). 
         
        
       
       
      The charge was not stating an offence of procuring the commission of an offence under s 233B(1)(b) but rather alleging an offence under the relevant paragraph of s 233B(1) and giving particulars of how the Crown said that the appellant had committed that offence. 
       
      
    81 As Adams J points out there was some agreement at the trial, at least between the parties, that the more appropriate provision of the Code was s 11.3. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        11.3 Innocent agency 
         
         
         A person who:  
         
          
          (a) has, in relation to each physical element of an offence, a fault element applicable to that physical element; and  
           
          (b) procures conduct of another person that (whether or not together with conduct of the procurer) would have constituted an offence on the part of the procurer if the procurer had engaged in it; 
          
         
        is taken to have committed that offence and is punishable accordingly.  
         
        
       
       
      As with s 11.2, this section does not create an offence but rather specifies a way in which an offence can be committed other than under s 3.2 of the Code. Section 11.3 is not mentioned in s 11.6 and again the note quoted above indicates that this was not merely an oversight. 
       
      
    82 In summary the situation at trial was as follows. The appellant was charged with an offence of importing narcotic goods under s 233B(1)(b). The charge alleged that he was guilty of the offence by relying upon extended liability under s 11.2 of the Code. During the course of the trial the parties accepted that the appropriate provision of the Code with regard to extended liability was s 11.3. In fact the appellant’s criminal responsibility as alleged by the evidence tendered by the Crown in its case was under s 3.2 of the Code and there was no need for reliance upon any of the provisions of Division 11. The trial was conducted on the basis that, before the jury could convict the appellant, they had to be satisfied that (a) he imported the drugs into Australia and (b) that he intended to import the drugs in the guitar case. There was no issue about (a) and the Crown tried to prove (b) by showing that the appellant had knowledge of the drugs in the case. 
     
      
    83 In my opinion the reliance in the charge on s 11.2 of the Code was a mere particular indicating the manner in which the Crown alleged that the appellant was guilty. Similarly any reliance upon s 11.3 during the course of the trial was also an attempt to particularise the manner in which the offence was committed. The Crown is entitled to depart from a particular contained in the charge alleging the manner in which an offence is committed where to do so would not occasion unfairness to the accused. There was no injustice in the present case. 
     
      
    84 In my view the allegation in the charge that the appellant had procured Gurvich in terms of s 11.2 was merely a particular and can be disregarded as mere surplusage so far as the statement of the charge is concerned. If the underlined part of the charge, as set out above, is ignored, there is a proper and sufficient statement of the offence alleged under s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act, the charge of which the appellant was convicted. In my opinion there was no requirement that the indictment be amended. The particular was surplusage to the statement of the charge. That being the case the indictment can be amended to remove it or it can be simply ignored where, as here, there was no risk of the appellant being prejudiced by a technical irregularity in the charge: R v McKinney and Judge (CCA, 6 September 1993, unreported); R v Smith and Kirton (1990) 47 A Crim R 43. 
     
      
       
      Reasonableness of the verdict 
       
      
    85 It was not a ground of appeal that there was no prima facie case, in that the jury were not able to logically and rationally infer the guilt of the appellant from the evidence led by the Crown in its case. Rather it was argued that, although the jury could have inferred the appellant’s guilt, they should not have done so beyond a reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    86 I agree with Adams J that the jury was in no better position than this Court to assess the evidence in the Crown case insofar as little of the evidence was in dispute and there was no issue of the reliability of any Crown witness. However, I doubt that, with respect to a circumstantial case depending exclusively upon the jury’s ability to assess the conduct of persons by applying their commonsense and experience of life, this Court and the jury stand in an equal position as finders of fact. This is because I am concerned that the Court should pay due deference to the combined experience and commonsense of the members of the jury in a case such as the present, which was one quintessentially for a determination by ordinary citizens in the community. However, I do not need to reach any firm view upon this point, or to determine whether such a consideration is inconsistent with the principles stated by the High Court for the resolution of this type of ground of appeal, because I do not have a doubt about the guilt of the appellant. 
     
      
    87 There was, in my view, an overly complicated presentation by the Crown of the circumstantial case upon which it relied. There is, with respect, much merit in the criticism by Mr Hulme SC, who appeared for the appellant, of some of the particular matters upon which the Crown sought to rely at the trial. They had little, if any, relevance to the jury’s consideration of the issue before them. For example, the Crown’s suggestion of the unlikelihood that a person of Sandford’s description would want a guitar is simply idle speculation likely to divert, rather than assist, the jury. 
     
      
    88 But in my view the evidence does not have to be examined in such minute detail as the Crown sought to do at the trial, or as Mr Hulme did on the appeal. The Crown case relied upon three sets of facts that can be considered broadly: the first involved the circumstances surrounding the bringing of the guitar case into Australia; the second involved the happenings in the luggage hall at the international terminal; the third was the finding of the heroin. In my opinion, when these sets of facts are considered together, the only reasonable inference arising is that the appellant had sufficient knowledge that the guitar case contained narcotics to justify his conviction of the offence charged. 
     
      
    89 I do not, with respect, believe that it is appropriate or necessary to examine all the events that surrounded the circumstances that led to the fact that Gurvich was placed in the position of being the person responsible for bringing the guitar case through Customs. I do not understand that this is how a circumstantial case should be considered. For example, whether or not the appellant and Gurvich had a conversation about the reason why anybody would want to bring a guitar into Australia from Vietnam or the contents of any such conversation was of little significance except as it revealed the state of knowledge of the appellant about the provenance of the guitar or why he was being asked to bring it into Australia from Vietnam. Similarly whether the guitar originated in Vietnam or elsewhere was of no real importance. 
     
      
    90 In my opinion it is the fact that the appellant was prepared to bring a package into Australia without any apparent attempt to determine its contents, provenance or why he was being requested to bring it with him that is significant so far as the first set of facts is concerned. I believe that this fact was clearly proved by the Crown and was the background against which the events at the airport had to be considered. The fact that the guitar case was delivered to the hotel shortly before the two men departed for the airport does not explain this apparent failure, but to the contrary is one of the facts that, in my view, indicate the suspicious nature of the importation. Nor do I see any significance in how the luggage of the appellant and Gurvich was checked in for the flight to Australia. The guitar case was always part of the appellant’s luggage and he was going to be responsible for it when it came time to enter through Customs in Australia. 
     
      
    91 In this regard I do not, with respect, accept Adams J’s reasoning as to the absence of evidence of the relationship between the appellant and Sandford in considering the circumstances in which the appellant came to bring the guitar case into Australia. This is because I do not believe that it is appropriate to deprive a piece of evidence of its potential value in proving the Crown’s case simply because its probative force may have been affected by some other fact that was not in evidence. The only evidence before the jury of the relationship between the appellant and Sandford was that they were associates of some kind and the appellant described him as a friend to the investigating officials. In my opinion it was open to the jury to draw an inference adverse to him about the appellant’s failure to investigate the provenance of the guitar case or its contents on the basis of that relationship. How good a friend he was and the circumstances of that friendship were unknown. In my opinion the fact that the appellant had apparently made little, or no, inquiry or investigation about the guitar case or its contents does not lose its probative value simply by speculating that Sandford may have been a true and trusted companion of the appellant when there was no evidence to suggest that he was. 
     
      
    92 During the course of argument Mr Hulme submitted that each of the factual matters relied upon by the Crown should not be viewed in the worst light for the appellant. But equally they should not be viewed in the best available light on the basis that there might be some reasonable explanation to account for each particular fact and so dismiss each as having no probative value. As I have already stressed, it is the total set of circumstances which are in evidence that are to be considered for the purpose of ascertaining whether any other reasonable explanation arose to account for them other than that the guilt of the accused had been established beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    93 In addition to what I believe to be the highly suspicious circumstances in which the guitar came to be imported into Australia, I take into account, as I believe the jury would have been entitled to do, the improbability that a person would be trusted to convey a very significant amount of drug into Australia unless that person knew of the presence of the drugs. Almost half a kilogram of pure heroin was a highly valuable commodity and I believe it was unlikely in the extreme that its importation would be trusted to a scheme in which it was to be conveyed by a person who had no idea of its presence in the package being imported and no real incentive to comply with the request to bring the package into Australia if it proved inconvenient to do so, for example because of excess baggage costs. 
     
      
    94 The second and most significant area of facts was clearly what happened in the luggage hall at the airport. The two men had collected their respective baggage from the carousel and were about to move towards the custom’s checkpoint, each with their individual trolleys, when the appellant indicated that he wished to go to the toilet and asked Gurvich to collect the guitar and “to meet him”. He then left with his trolley rather than leaving it with Gurvich. It does not seem to me to be appropriate to stop at this point and see whether the request for Gurvich to retrieve the guitar case was a reasonable one because, for example, the baggage ticket was in the name of Gurvich. In any event there is no suggestion in the evidence that the name on the baggage ticket was a relevant fact at all in determining who should collect the guitar case. The item was clearly part of the appellant’s luggage and his responsibility however it came to be checked in at the airport in Vietnam and whoever collected it from the fragile luggage area. In any event, the request was made because the appellant said he wished to go to the toilet not because the baggage ticket was in Gurvich’s name. 
     
      
    95 Similarly I do not believe it is appropriate to consider whether the agreement “to meet” upon the guitar case being collected by Gurvich should be scrutinised to see whether there was the possibility that there was some ambiguity in the arrangement that may explain why the appellant did not wait for Gurvich in the luggage hall. The fact that the appellant was apparently proceeding through the Custom’s inspection without Gurvich or the guitar case, but with his own trolley that he had kept with him, was highly probative of the Crown case, and it does not lose its probative value by speculating about what reasons might account for that particular fact on the basis that the appellant had no knowledge of the drugs in the guitar case. 
     
      
    96 I believe it was well open to a jury to find the conduct of the appellant, a mature adult and not an inexperienced traveller, to be inconsistent with what would be expected of a reasonable person in his situation. The guitar case was clearly his responsibility: it was an item of his luggage and he was the person bringing it into the country. As I have already indicated, what happened in Vietnam at the baggage counter and how the luggage came to be checked in for the flight to Australia seems to me to be completely irrelevant. In any event I cannot accept the possibility that having gone to the toilet, the appellant merely forgot about Gurvich and the guitar case. 
     
      
    97 The simple fact is that the appellant left Gurvich in the position of having to bring the guitar case through customs. I believe that this was an intentional act on his part and I cannot see any innocent explanation for it. When that fact is added to the other established facts concerning the manner in which the case came into the appellant’s possession, his apparent failure to make inquiries or investigations as to its contents or provenance, and that it contained a substantial amount of narcotics, the Crown case was well and truly proved. 
     
      
    98 I have taken into account the conduct of the appellant after the drug was discovered but that does not change my view of the behaviour that preceded it. It was a fact that itself was equivocal but not of great significance in light of the strong inference arising from the other circumstances to which I have referred. 
     
      
    99 In my opinion the jury were entitled to find the appellant guilty and, for what it is worth, it is the verdict to which I would have come independently. The appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
    100 There is a Crown appeal against sentence. Judge Puckeridge QC sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 40 months (3 years and 4 months) with a non-parole period of 24 months (2 years). The maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for 25 years. The Crown asserts that the sentence ought to have been above the range of a head sentence following a plea of guilty, which would be 6 years to 7 years having regard to the amount of heroin involved. The trafficable quantity is 2 grams and there was 479.3 grams of pure heroin secreted in the guitar case. Mr Hulme SC realistically accepted that the sentence was below the range but submitted that the Court should not intervene. 
     
      
    101 There was some discussion before the Court as to the factual basis upon which the appellant was to be sentenced. Mr Hulme argued that the circumstances were unusual in that the appellant was charged as having procured Gurvich to import the drug and that act occurred at the airport terminal. It was, so the argument ran, at that point that the appellant’s criminality arose and he should not be sentenced on the basis that he imported the drug from Vietnam. With respect, I believe that this is an overly technical and highly unrealistic way of viewing the appellant’s criminality. Although he was convicted of an offence alleging that he procured Gurvich, as Adams J points out, that allegation was superfluous and factually erroneous. The appellant was guilty of importing the drug and the method by which he did so was of little consequence. I have no doubt that he was knowingly importing the drug from Vietnam when he took custody of the guitar case at the hotel. That was in substance the Crown case and it is in my view the only commonsense way of considering the evidence. 
     
      
    102 I understand that the Crown for some reason, which is not apparent to me, determined not to proceed on a charge of importation simpliciter, but rather chose to proceed on the charge set out in the indictment. It is consistent with the Crown’s confusion as to the way it was endeavouring to prove the charge. But in any event the appellant was to be sentenced on the basis that, he having imported drugs into Australia, attempted to use Gurvich to convey them through the Custom’s check so they could be made available for distribution. 
     
      
    103 The sentencing judge accepted that the amount of drug imported was substantial but noted that there was no evidence that the appellant was aware of the quantity of the drug. That is true, but I do not understand it to be a mitigating factor. Once the appellant was convicted of the offence and taken to have known of the presence of the drug, I do not believe he should be sentenced on the basis that he did not know the amount involved. At best the lack of evidence of knowledge of the actual amount being imported is a neutral factor, neither aggravating nor mitigating. But I do not see why it should not be assumed that a person who brings drugs into the country is aware of the amount involved, at least in a general sense, unless there is evidence to the contrary. However, that is not a point that needs further consideration to determine the present appeal. 
     
      
    104 His Honour also noted that there was no evidence that the appellant was to profit from the importation. Again, with respect, I do not understand the relevance of that statement. If his Honour was taking that fact into account as a mitigating factor then he was in error, because again at best it was neutral. Once more it is unnecessary in order to determine this appeal to embark upon a consideration of the relevance of whether the courier is to be rewarded or not as it affects his or her criminality. However, it seems to me as a matter of commonsense that it should be inferred, unless there is evidence to the contrary, that a person who is importing drugs is doing so for profit. 
     
      
    105 His Honour referred to s 16A of the Crimes Act (Cth). He did not refer to s 16G, that section having been repealed by the time the appellant came to be sentenced. The relevance of the repeal of the section to sentencing for Commonwealth offenders has been considered in a number of recent decisions of this Court. It is clear that his Honour was to sentence the appellant without regard to the fact that the section had once been in existence, and to this extent his Honour’s failure to refer to the section was appropriate. However, it is also clear that the range of sentences that was appropriate when s 16G operated is no longer appropriate after its repeal. The repeal of the section must result in high sentences because the court has no longer the power to discount sentences to take into account remissions: R v Kevenaar [2004] NSWCCA 210. 
     
      
    106 I remain of the view that I expressed in Studenikin that there is no fixed mathematical equation for converting the range existing at the time that s 16G was in operation to a range applicable after the section was repealed. My agreement with the judgment of Hulme J in  was not intended to suggest otherwise. I indicated in Studenikin my view that a consideration of statistical information, such as an existing range of sentence, was the last point of reference for a sentencing judge rather than the first. My opinion as to the proper approach to sentencing after the repeal of s 16G was set out in [71] of Studenikin and I have not changed that opinion. It accords with the view later taken by Smart AJ in R v Dujeu [2004] NSWCCA 237 and was followed in R v Mas Rivadavia [2004] NSWCCA 284. 
     
      
    107 The appellant was aged 57 years at the time of sentence. He has some record for dishonesty but those matters are of little significance, and apparently arose as a response to a gambling addiction. He has never served a gaol sentence. There was little in his background as set out in the pre-sentence report of relevance. 
     
      
    108 The sentence was manifestly inadequate to a very significant degree. The sentence should have been in the range of 8 to 10 years following a trial. By reason of double jeopardy I am prepared to propose a more lenient sentence that that which should have been imposed upon him. 
     
      
    109 I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed. The Crown’s appeal against sentence be allowed. The appellant should be sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years to date from 29 January 2004. There should be a non-parole period of 4 years.

    1 WOOD CJ at CL: I have read in draft form the judgment of McClellan AJA. I agree with the orders proposed, and with the reasons of his Honour. 
     
      
    2 McCLELLAN AJA: The respondent pleaded guilty to being an accessory before the fact to a charge of malicious wounding in company contrary to s 35(2) and s 346 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty is a term of imprisonment for ten years. The offence was committed while the respondent was serving a full time sentence of imprisonment of six years with a non-parole period of four years for the offence of detain for advantage contrary to s 86 of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    3 The sentence for the latter offence was imposed on the respondent in the Campbelltown District Court on 11 December 2001 and was back-dated to commence on 30 October 2001, with a head sentence expiring on 29 October 2007 and the non-parole period expiring on 29 October 2005. 
     
      
    4 For the offence the subject of the present appeal, the respondent was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two and a half years commencing on 30 October 2005, with a non-parole period of six months. The sentencing judge ordered (as required by s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)) that the respondent be released to parole on 29 April 2006. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    5 The offence arose out of a disagreement between the victim, his brother and members of the family of the respondent's partner, Ms Natalie Carter. As a consequence of these difficulties, the victim caused damage to the home of Ms Carter's mother. This included smashing a window at the front of the house.  
     
      
    6 Following this incident the victim, his brother and Ms Carter's sister, Amanda went to the home of the victim and his brother. In the early hours of the morning they were visited by two members of Ms Carter's family (her mother and brother) and another man. The respondent's brother, Riad Hamze, also arrived armed with a baseball bat. There was another argument during which the victim armed himself with a shovel. 
     
      
    7 Following this argument, Amanda and her baby left the home of the victim and his brother and returned, with her mother and brother, to her mother's home. 
     
      
    8 Police attended the mother's house at about 3.50am on 10 November 2002 after receiving a complaint in relation to a domestic dispute. Amanda told them she had been involved in an argument with the victim and that he and his brother had left. She also told the police that she wanted no action taken. 
     
      
    9 At this time the respondent was serving his term of imprisonment at the John Moroney Correctional Centre at Windsor. On 10 November 2002 the respondent made three telephone calls from the prison to his partner, Ms Natalie Carter, who was living at her mother's house. These calls were made at 9.30am, 9.33am and 9.47am and, because they were made from the prison, were recorded. Extracts from the transcript of these calls formed part of the facts tendered at the hearing.  
     
      
    10 In the first call, Ms Carter tells the respondent about the behaviour of the victim and his family and about insulting remarks they had made about the respondent and members of her family. The respondent tells her to tell his brother Riad what has been said. In the second call at 9.33am, the respondent speaks first to his mother-in-law and then to Ms Carter. He insists that Ms Carter give him the address of the victim and his brother, despite her reluctance to do so because she is afraid the baby in the house might get hurt. He tells Ms Carter that the victim and his brother ""gotta be taught a lesson."" He tells her he is ""gonna get some boys too."" He instructs her in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Okay and then to to Riad [sic] and say to him Iash said fucking get some boys organised and go and fucken sort it out and he means sort it out properly, no fucken little kids shit okay."" 
        
       
      
    11 In the third phone call at 9.47am, Ms Carter is again reluctant to do what the respondent says but the respondent tells Ms Carter ""okay okay they're scared of us, we gotta teach them a lesson."" He repeats this saying ""… we teach them a fucking good lesson, give them a mad hiding."" He instructs her to tell his brother Riad to ""get some boys organised okay, and sort these two cunts out. If you have to."" He also instructs her to tell his brother ""to catch them in the street"" if he does not go to their house. He then tells her to visit a friend, Errol, and: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Tell him Iash is fucken burning inside he's chomping at the bit, he wants you to shoot these cunts head off, say look, like go over there, just stir it up for me, ya know what I mean, and try to do that today."" 
        
       
      
    12 About two hours after the respondent made these phone calls, five or six men broke into the victim's home and attacked him. He was punched, kicked and hit with a baseball bat and an iron bar. He was dragged from his bedroom by the men, one of whom said ""I'm going to fucking kill you."" As he was being dragged through the kitchen he was stabbed in the stomach with a large knife, described as being like a silver sword. He managed to struggle free and escaped by diving through a closed glass door. He ran and hid in a neighbour's garage. He was bleeding from his stomach wound. The victim's brother was woken up by pain in his legs and saw a large male armed with a baseball bat standing at the foot of his bed. He did not recognise this man. He later saw one male get into a car and drive off. 
     
      
    13 The victim was taken to Liverpool Hospital and received 15 stitches for the stab wound. His other injuries included a cut to his right hand requiring three stiches, bruising to his stomach and back near his left and right kidneys, extensive scratches to his back and arms and grazes to his knees, one leg and left forearm. 
     
      
    14 On 10 November 2002 the victim and his girlfriend, Summer Sharon, provided statements to the police. The victim identified the respondent's brothers, Riad and Rabih Hamze, as among the people involved in this attack. Ms Sharon identified Riad Hamze. Further telephone calls between the respondent and Ms Carter after this attack confirmed that it had been carried out at the respondent's instigation. In a call on 11 November 2002 at 1.14pm, the respondent says ""Well, so you don't want, you done sort it out or what?"" When Ms Carter says ""Yeah"", the respondent replies, ""That's good then. They fucking deserve it.""  
     
      
    15 Ms Carter then tells the respondent that the police were involved. He instructs her to tell the police if they ask that she knows nothing about the matter. He then says, ""Well what kind of fucking dogs are they to go to coppers for?"" The respondent asked if the victims were in hospital, and having been told they had been released replied ""Yeah, that's good."" However, when told shortly after this comment that Ms Carter's sister Amanda had said the victims deserved it, the respondent agreed, saying: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Yeah that's good. What they think they can come over there and do what they did to abuse me, abuse my brother, abuse my mum and just think everything is sweet."" 
        
       
      
    16 The respondent then said to Ms Carter: 
     
      
       
        
        ""You know what it is? They just rang the coppers in shock. But in about a week or two, Steve will tell em listen you're doing the wrong thing pull yourselves up."" 
        
       
      
    17 Shortly after this and in the same telephone conversation, the respondent continues saying: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Well now now you gonna have to fuckin talk to them and say listen why did you call the fuckin coppers for what are you's a bunch of dogs rah, rah, rah."" 
        
       
      
    18 On 24 January 2003 the victims retracted their earlier statements claiming they had been mistaken as to the identity of their attackers. No bill applications were made by each of them and the charges against the respondent's brothers were withdrawn. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    19 The respondent was born on 24 September 1977 and was the third of nine children. His parents had emigrated from Lebanon. The pre-sentence report described the respondent's family environment as dysfunctional on account of violence inflicted on the family by his father. When the respondent was sixteen, his father began travelling to Lebanon for extended periods of time. He eventually left the family, remarried and had children with his second wife.  
     
      
    20 The respondent has two children with Ms Carter, but is not sure as to the future of that relationship. His period of incarceration between 17 May 2002 and 20 March 2004 resulted in a number of disciplinary charges and punishments, although there were positive as well as negative reports about his behaviour and attitude. He had generally been employed in semi-skilled or unskilled positions since leaving school at 17 and prior to February 2001 had done volunteer work at the Westside Youth Centre. Apart from an earlier history of cannabis use, the respondent does not appear to have a drug or alcohol problem. He has previous convictions for assault, larceny, drug offences and detain for advantage. The pre-sentence report noted little insight by the respondent into his propensity for violence and an unacceptable level of anger and aggression. The respondent was assessed as immature and lacking the motivation and belief that he could change. However, it was noted that he was aware of the need for change and the need to develop an ability to discuss relevant issues, be introspective and allow himself to be challenged. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
       
      The Crown appeals against the sentence imposed because of its manifest inadequacy. It is further submitted that the sentencing judge erred in respect of the following particular matters: 
       
       
        
        (a) in discounting the respondent's sentence on account of remorse or alternatively in giving too much weight to this matter; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) in discounting the respondent's sentence on account of delay or alternatively in giving too much weight to this matter; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) in finding that the respondent's previous convictions were only relevant to his prospect of rehabilitation and to explain why he was in custody; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) in the extent of the reduction of the non-parole period on account of special circumstances and in failing to consider whether the non-parole period adequately reflected the criminality of the offence; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) in failing to give sufficient weight to the gravity of the offence; 
        
       
       
        
        (f) in failing to give sufficient weight to an aggravating feature of the offence, namely the fact that the respondent committed it while he was in prison. 
        
       
       
      Relevant principles 
       
      
    21 The correct approach to the consideration of appeals by the Crown has been considered on many occasions. In R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 Wood CJ at CL identified the following five fundamental principles (at [70]): 
     
      
       
        
        ""(a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
        House v The King  
        (1936) 55 CLR 499, applies to Crown appeals against sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion, as to the appropriate sentence, for that of the sentencing judge:  
        Lowndes v The Queen  
        (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown;  
        R v Tait  
        (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen  
        (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 58 and para 109. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
        Malvaso v The Queen  
        (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere:  
        R v Baker  
        [2000] NSWCCA 85. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle 'for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons': per Barwick CJ in  
        Griffiths v The Queen  
        (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
        Everett v The Queen  
        (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299;  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        (2000) 202 CLR 32, at para 61 and para 62, and  
        Wong v Leung v The Queen  
        at para 109. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
        R v Allpass  
        (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
        R v Papazis  
        (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
        Wong v Leung v The Queen  
        at para 110. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
        R v Holder and Johnston  
        (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        at para 62."" 
        
       
      
    22 These principles have been recently confirmed by Wood CJ at CL in R v Bezan [2004] NSWCCA 342 and it is appropriate to apply them when considering the particular matters raised by the Crown in this appeal. 
     
      
       
      Remorse 
       
      
    23 The sentencing judge said that the respondent was entitled to have his guilty plea taken into account in mitigation of penalty on the basis of its utilitarian value ""and to reflect contrition"": 
     
      
       
        
        ""There is evidence that he has expressed remorse to the Probation Officer. I note that shortly after the offence, in a telephone conversation with his wife, although he said that the victim deserved it, nonetheless he commented, when he was told that the victim was out of hospital: 'that's good'. The plea of guilty has also relieved the victim of anxiety of awaiting a trial and giving evidence in it. It may well be that a trial might have led to a flare up in hostility between the Offender's family and the victim's family. The fact that he has pleaded guilty has avoided that possibility. These matters, in my view, do reflect contrition and that has been reflected by a further reduction of the sentence that I will impose."" 
        
       
      
    24 The role of remorse in the sentencing of an offender has been considered on many occasions. In R v Thompson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 412, Spigelman CJ identified the fact that genuine remorse in an offender may have the consequence that personal deterrence may be of less significance in a particular case and may also indicate that there are good prospects of rehabilitation. If present, genuine remorse may be reflected in a lesser sentence. 
     
      
    25 However, the Chief Justice was careful to identify the fact that although a guilty plea has been entered, it may not reflect genuine remorse. His Honour said (at 412): 
     
      
       
        
        ""The bare fact of a plea is, of itself, a very simple expression of remorse. Much greater weight may be accorded to the conduct and statements of an accused over a period of time, which confirm a position of genuinely and deeply felt contrition. When such contrition is taken into account by a sentencing judge, then the diminution of sentence is given for contrition, not for the plea of guilty. The plea in such a case is, at most, evidence of remorse or contrition and, often, not the best such evidence. It is not desirable to separate out the factor of a plea as an indication of remorse from other manifestations of remorse."" 
        
       
      
    26 In the present case, the Crown submits that when considering remorse the sentencing judge erroneously interpreted the respondent's apparent expression of regret as evidence of his contrition. The evidence relied upon was found in the pre-sentence report of which the relevant section was: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Hamze appeared to justify his actions. On the other hand, he indicated what appeared to be genuine regret in acting as he did. Mr Hamze indicated the problems caused to his relationship, he noted missing the birth of one of his children and not being at home with them. He indicated his regret at not being able to be a suitable father and husband. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Hamze's remorse appeared to relate to the consequences of his actions on his own circumstances."" 
        
       
      
    27 In my opinion, the Crown submission in relation to this aspect of the matter should be accepted. Although the respondent expressed remorse, the Probation Officer's conclusion that it was related to the consequences of his actions or his own circumstances does not appear to have been appreciated by his Honour. The conclusion expressed by the officer appears soundly based having regard to the conversation which is reported. To my mind, the respondent should be understood as believing his criminal activity was justified in order to protect his family, although he regrets its adverse personal consequences for himself. 
     
      
    28 With respect to the comment ""that's good"" which the respondent made to Ms Carter, the Crown submits that the comment needs to be understood in its context. It is suggested that rather than expressing empathy with the victims the respondent was merely using a figure of speech which he commonly used when receiving information. The relevant conversation was: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Respondent: And where are these blokes? Are they in hospital or what? 
         
        Carter: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Respondent: Are they? 
         
        Carter: They got out yesterday. 
        
       
       
        
        Respondent: Yeah that's good. And how what's, how you Amanda, what's you mum and Amanda saying? [sic] 
         
        Carter: Amanda's says they deserve it. That's it. 
        
       
       
        
        Respondent: Yeah that's good. What they think they can come over there and do what they did, abuse me, abuse my brother, abuse my mum and just think everything is sweet. 
         
        Carter: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Respondent: You know what it is? They just rang the coppers in shock. But in about a week or two, Steve will tell em listen you're doing the wrong thing pull yourselves up."" 
        
       
      
    29 In my opinion the Crown submission in relation to this aspect of the matter should also be accepted. I can detect no genuine remorse in the respondent's remarks to Ms Carter. Although the respondent said ""that's good"", his use of the same response in relation to the next matter - ""Amanda says they deserve it"" - indicates that he used the expression without empathy for the victim. Of course, if it was otherwise, the respondent's statement ""Yeah that's good"" to the suggestion apparently made by Amanda that ""they deserve it"", is the very opposite of an expression of contrition. 
     
      
    30 The sentencing judge also identified the fact of the plea as evidence of contrition and concluded that it had the benefit of avoiding anxiety for the victims and the possibility of aggravating the dispute between the families at a contested hearing. However, as the Crown submits, the respondent would have had other reasons to avoid a trial. In particular, as the telephone conversations reveal, the respondent took steps to avoid charges being brought against those who carried out the assault and a contested hearing may have brought difficulties for those persons. In any event, his plea effectively recognised the inevitable having regard to the strength of the evidence available from the recorded telephone conversations. 
     
      
    31 In my opinion, the finding made by the sentencing judge that the respondent's sentence should be reduced because of his contrition was not justified. 
     
      
       
      Delay 
       
      
    32 The sentencing judge reduced the respondent's sentence on account of what he found to be a twelve month delay in getting the prosecution brief together in the Local Court and the consequent stress on the respondent of being in gaol and not knowing the outcome of the proceedings. The offence was committed on 10 November 2002 and the respondent was arrested and charged on 28 January 2003. After receiving the prosecution brief and other supporting documents, the respondent pleaded guilty and was committed for sentence on 17 December 2003. The matter was delayed in the District Court while a pre-sentence report was obtained. The report was ordered on 5 February 2004, the respondent being sentenced on 14 May 2004. 
     
      
    33 This sequence of events make it apparent that some delay has occurred. I accept that the respondent may have suffered some stress from a lack of knowledge of the likely outcome. However, the stress would be less than might be experienced by someone who did not know whether they would suffer a custodial sentence. 
     
      
    34 In R v Blanco (1999) 106 A Crim R 303 at 306, Wood CJ at CL said of delay: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The reason why delay is to be taken into account when sentencing an offender relates first to the fact of the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left; secondly to any demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, to the fact that a sentence for a stale crime does call for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach … "" 
        
       
      
    35 In the present case there is no indication that the respondent has progressed in his rehabilitation or that the crime is in any way stale. Any reduction in the respondent's sentence by reason of delay should be minimal. 
     
      
       
      The respondent's prior convictions 
       
      
    36 The respondent has convictions in the Children's Court in 1995 in relation to offences of violence, dishonesty and drug offences. As I have related, he was serving a sentence for detain for advantage at the time of commission of the present offence. 
     
      
    37 When sentencing, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""That the offender has a record of previous convictions, the Crown says, should be treated as an aggravating feature. He is not to be punished again for offences committed in the past where punishment has been imposed. He is only to be punished in connection with this offence. His prior record is relevant in the circumstances of this case to consider the context in which he found himself in custody and to consider his prospects of rehabilitation."" 
        
       
      
    38 The manner in which an offender's criminal history is to be taken into account on sentence was explained by the High Court in Veen v R (No 2) (1998) 164 CLR 465 at 477 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ in the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
        ""There are two subsidiary principles which should be mentioned. The first is that the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences:  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Ottewell  
        [1970] AC 642 at 650. The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind. Counsel for the applicant submitted that antecedent criminal history was relevant only to a prisoner's claim for leniency. That is not and has never been the approach of the courts in this country and it would be at odds with the community's understanding of what is relevant to the assessment of criminal penalties."" 
        
       
      
    39 To similar effect is the statement by Howie J in R v Shankley [2003] NSWCCA 253 at [31]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The effect of the prior criminal record of the offender, where it is relevant to sentencing, is not to increase the objective seriousness of the offence committed but rather that 'retribution, deterrence and protection of society may indicate a more severe sentence is warranted.' "" 
        
       
      
    40 Although, as the sentencing judge indicates, the respondent's criminal history is relevant to his prospects of rehabilitation, there was a particular need in the present case to consider matters of ""retribution, deterrence and protection of society."" The criminal history of the respondent makes plain that rather than the offence being an uncharacteristic aberration, it is further evidence of a person prepared to ignore society's constraints on his behaviour and seek to impose his will on others by means of physical violence. His Honour's remarks on sentence do not reflect consideration of these matters, which indicates to my mind that the sentencing discretion has miscarried. 
     
      
       
      Special circumstances, the gravity of the offence and failure to take into account the aggravating factor of an offence committed in custody 
       
      
    41 The Crown does not dispute that totality principles permit an adjustment of the head sentence and/or a finding of special circumstances in order to ensure that the resulting overall sentence is appropriate. However, having regard to the grave nature of the offence and the fact that it was committed in custody, the Crown submits that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    42 In my opinion, the offence committed by the respondent carries a high degree of criminality. The respondent was already serving a sentence for a serious criminal offence and the commission of this further offence demonstrates a serious inability to accept that it is necessary for him to conform to the law in the conduct of his affairs. The organisation of a group of men to carry out a serious assault, which could have had grave consequences for the victims, warrants a sentence which marks the serious breach of the law committed by the respondent. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    43 Having regard to these matters, I am of the opinion that the discretion of the sentencing judge has miscarried and I am satisfied that it is appropriate for this Court to intervene: Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299. In my opinion, the sentence and non-parole period imposed were both manifestly inadequate and should be quashed and the respondent re-sentenced by this Court: Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 175 ALR 315. 
     
      
    44 In relation to the decision as to whether or not to intervene and in relation to the sentence to be substituted, I have had regard to the matters to which I have referred. It is of course necessary to impose the least possible sentence which could possibly be imposed being mindful of the fact that this is the second time the respondent's freedom has been put in jeopardy: R v Bavadra (2000) 115 A Crim R 152; Everett v The Queen. However, the sentence must recognise the gravity of the offence, having regard to the previous convictions of the respondent, and the fact that the offence was committed when the respondent was in custody. The sentence must also adequately reflect the need for retribution, deterrence and the protection of society. I am satisfied that the respondent will require a lengthy period of supervision when released from custody and, accordingly, it is appropriate to find special circumstances.  
     
      
    45 I am of the opinion that the following orders should be made: 
     
      
       
      1. Crown appeal allowed. 
       
      2. Sentence below be set aside. 
       
      3. In lieu, sentence the respondent to imprisonment for three and a half years to commence on 30 October 2005 and to expire on 30 April 2009. 
       
      4. Set a non-parole period of one year and three months to date from 30 October 2005 to expire on 30 January 2007, which will be his earliest parole release eligibility date. 
       
      
    46 SMART AJ: I agree with McClellan AJA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BUDDIN J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court. The applicant originally pleaded guilty to a number of matters in the Local Court and adhered to those pleas when he appeared for sentence. In all he pleaded guilty to three counts of armed robbery. The applicant asked that a further four offences on a Form 1 document, namely two further offences of armed robbery and two of robbery in company, be taken into account on sentencing. Each of the offences attracted a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. In respect of the first count, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years and 3 months to date from 5 May 2003, which was the date of his arrest. In respect of the second count, a fixed term of 3 years to commence on 5 May 2004 and to expire on 4 May 2007 was fixed. In respect of the final count, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 document, a non-parole period of 2 years and 4 months to commence on 5 January 2006 and to expire on 4 May 2008 was fixed with the balance of the term fixed to expire on 4 May 2011. The overall non-parole period was one of 5 years imprisonment and the balance of the term one of 3 years, thus producing an overall effective head sentence of 8 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    2 It is unnecessary to describe the background facts in respect of each of the offences in any great detail because in each instance the modus operandi which was employed was very similar. On each occasion, the applicant was in the company of at least one other young man. One of them would place an order by telephone for the home delivery of pizzas, garlic bread and soft drinks to a nominated address. The address nominated was in most instances near to a park where the applicant and his co-offender or co-offenders would be waiting. When the food arrived the person who delivered it was confronted by the applicant and his co-offenders. Only some of the co-offenders have been identified. The two who have been identified are younger than the applicant. In respect of each of the five offences of armed robbery (all of which were committed in company), either the applicant or one of his co-offenders was armed with a knife. In each case the delivery person was robbed of the food and/or money which he was carrying. In all more than $800 in cash was taken. Two mobile phones were also taken. None of that property has been recovered. Two of the offences of armed robbery were perpetrated upon the same victim. The offences in all spanned a period of four months from 6 December 2002 until 20 April 2003. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was just under the age of 19 when he committed the first of these offences. It was to his credit that he had no prior convictions of any kind. The sentencing judge accepted the extensive evidence, which was in testimonial form, which attested to his good character. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was born in Australia to parents of Egyptian descent. There was conflict between his parents as to whether the family should live in Australia or Egypt. The applicant sought to distance himself from that conflict by removing himself from the family home whenever it arose. The sentencing judge concluded that that had led to “his associating with older, more streetwise young men ” and in turn to his introduction to illicit drugs.  
     
      
    5 The applicant obtained his Higher School Certificate and in 2002 undertook a business studies course at a TAFE college. In 2003 he switched to doing a diploma in real estate at another TAFE college. He was still doing that course as a full-time student at the time of his arrest.  
     
      
    6 The applicant began smoking cannabis when he was 14 and within a year was smoking it on a daily basis. He then began experimenting with other drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy and soon became dependent upon them as well. By the age of 16 he was also abusing alcohol. He told the sentencing judge that he was motivated to commit these offences in order to obtain money with which to purchase drugs. It would appear that his drug taking escalated after his best friend died in tragic circumstances. 
     
      
    7 The sentencing judge allowed a discount of 25% for the pleas of guilty, which his Honour found had been entered at the earliest available opportunity. In the circumstances, the sentencing judge was inclined to the view that the applicant would be rehabilitated and would not re-offend, particularly were he to make good use of his time whilst in custody. 
     
      
    8 It was submitted on the applicant’s behalf that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. It was contended that the sentencing judge must have commenced with an overall sentence in excess of 10 years before allowing the applicant the benefit of the 25% discount for the pleas of guilty. It was submitted that such a starting point clearly exceeded what the circumstances called for, particularly in light of the applicant’s favourable subjective features, the fact that the offences were unsophisticated and that they occupied but a short period of time in the life of a young man who had otherwise led an exemplary existence. I shall further consider this submission in due course. 
     
      
    9 The applicant then submitted that there were a number of matters which indicated an erroneous approach on the part of the sentencing judge. It was submitted, for example, that the sentencing judge had erred in rejecting a submission that the fact that the applicant was dependent upon drugs was a matter which should mitigate the otherwise appropriate penalty. It was argued that this was a case which could, and should, have attracted the operation of the principles enunciated by Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 in which his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        In my view the relevant principles are as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the need to acquire funds to support a drug habit, even a severe habit, is not an excuse to commit an armed robbery or any similar offence, and of itself is not a matter of mitigation; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) however the fact that an offence is motivated by such a need may be taken into account as a factor relevant to the objective criminality of the offence in so far as it may throw light on matters such as: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the impulsivity of the offence and the extent of any planning for it: cf  
          R v Bouchard 
           (1996) 84 A Crim R 499 at 501-502 and  
          R v Nolan 
           (Victorian Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, 2 December 1998, unreported): 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) the existence or non-existence of any alternative reason that may have operated in aggravation of the offence, for example, that it was motivated to fund some other serious criminal venture or to support a campaign of terrorism; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) the state of mind or capacity of the offender to exercise judgment, for example, if he or she was in the grips of an extreme state of withdrawal of the kind that may have led to a frank disorder of thought processes or to the act being other than a willed act; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (c) it may also be relevant as a subjective circumstance, in so far as the origin or extent of the addiction, and any attempts to overcome it, might: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) impact upon the prospects of recidivism/rehabilitation, in which respect it may on occasions prove to be a two-edged sword: eg,  
          R v Lewis 
           (Court of Criminal Appeal, 1 July 1992, unreported): 
           
           
          (ii) suggest that the addiction was not a matter of personal choice but was attributable to some other event for which the offender was not primarily responsible, for example, where it arose as the result of the medical prescription of potentially addictive drugs following injury, illness, or surgery (cf  
          R v Hodge 
           (Court of Criminal Appeal, 2 November 1993, unreported) and  
          R v Talbot 
          ); or where it occurred at a very young age, or in a person whose mental or intellectual capacity was impaired, so that their ability to exercise appropriate judgment or choice was incomplete; 
           
           
          (iii) justify special consideration in the case of offenders judge to be at the “cross roads”:  
          R v Osenkowski 
           (1982) 30 SASR 212; 5 a Crim R 394. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        To go further, and to accept the fact of drug addiction as a mitigating factor generally, would not be justified in principle. Moreover, it would involve an exercise in irresponsibility on the part of the Court, if it were understood as a message that committing the crime of armed robbery to feed a drug habit is less deserving of censure than would otherwise be the case. 
        
       
       
        
        The legislature has, by the heavy maximum penalty prescribed for armed robbery, spoken clearly in relation to this offence. Drug dependent persons should not be encouraged, as a class, to think that they are free to engage in serious criminal conduct of whatever kind with impunity, or with any hope of favourable treatment because they are able to show that they needed money through their addiction. (at 397-8) 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    10 Particular reliance was placed upon paragraph (c)(ii) of his Honour’s remarks. 
     
      
    11 In my view a fair reading of the Sentencing Remarks reveals that the sentencing judge did have proper regard to those principles. His Honour, for example, specifically found that there was no evidence that the applicant was withdrawing from drugs at the time of committing any of the offences with which he was charged. His Honour also rejected a submission that his drug use had led to “a disorder of thought process” or that the applicant “lacked maturity or was developmentally delayed or was mentally retarded”. In essence, the sentencing judge found that the circumstances did not call for any particular moderation of the otherwise appropriate sentence by reason of the applicant’s dependency on drugs. That finding was, in my view, well open to the sentencing judge.  
     
      
    12 It was next contended that the sentencing judge had erred in diminishing the extent of the applicant’s contrition. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        I accept that the offender is, to some extent, contrite for his conduct. His being contrite is shown by his guilty pleas and his expression of sorrow to his relatives and friends, the psychologist and the Probation and Parole officer. I say “to some extent” because it seems to me that a young man, armed with a knife, who robs pizza delivery boys of food and money and mobile telephones in order to obtain money to obtain a preferred prohibited drug, would not give one moment’s thought to the fear instilled in the victims or the emotional reaction of those victims to that fear. 
        
       
      
    13 It is submitted that in making those observations the sentencing judge thereby “vitiated the genuineness of his contrition”. I am unable to accept the thrust of the applicant’s submission. The applicant, at least “to some extent”, received the benefit of a favourable finding in respect of his expressions of remorse. The extent to which the applicant was entitled to leniency by reason of this consideration was clearly a matter which fell within the sentencing judge’s discretion. The applicant gave evidence in answer to a leading question from his counsel that he “very deeply” apologised to his victims. In cross-examination he gave the following evidence touching upon this issue: 
     
      
       
        
        Q You told the probation and parole officer that you were sorry for your victims? 
         
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Can you explain to me what you mean by sorry? 
         
        A I just didn’t want to put them in fear or anything, I never had intentions of hurting any of my victims. 
        
       
       
        
        Q But you carried, or your co-accused, carried a knife each time you committed these offences? 
         
        A Yes but neither victims were hurt in any serious way. 
        
       
       
        
        Q No but they didn’t know that did they? 
         
        A Sorry. 
        
       
       
        
        Q They wouldn’t have known that would have they, they would have seen a knife and thought you were going to hurt them? 
         
        A Yes. 
        
       
      
    14 The sentencing judge’s observations are to be understood in the light of that evidence. In those circumstances I detect no error in his Honour’s approach. 
     
      
    15 It was then submitted that whilst the sentencing judge was entitled to partially accumulate the sentences which were imposed in respect of counts two and three, his Honour did so in a fashion which produced sentences which were manifestly excessive. Putting the matter another way, it was submitted that the sentencing judge misapplied the principle of totality. In that context, reference was then made to two other cases said to bear some comparability to the present case. This Court has said repeatedly that it will not compare the sentence under challenge directly with that imposed upon another offender (who is not a co-offender) simply because the offenders may share similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. That approach is adopted because what must be looked at is whether the challenged sentence is within the appropriate range and not how it compares with some other sentence which merely forms part of the applicable range. See R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 358. Nor were the errors that were identified in those cases apparent in the present case. 
     
      
    16 Finally complaint was made about the fact that the sentencing judge referred to several matters which are specified in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as being matters of aggravation. The checklist of such matters to which his Honour referred included the fact that the “offence involved the actual or threatened use of violence”, the fact was “the offence involved the actual or threatened use of a weapon” and finally the fact that “the offence was committed in company”. The submission was made that the sentencing judge fell into error in having regard to those considerations as being aggravating factors because it overlooked the injunction contained in the concluding words to ss (2) namely that “the court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence”. See R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193; R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264. I accept the submission that error has been thus established. 
     
      
    17 The question which then arises is whether, pursuant to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the court is of the opinion that some other less severe sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. The applicant’s conduct was of considerable objective gravity. Each of the offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty, when considered on its own, fitted the profile of the typical case identified in Henry. It was there said that such a case should normally attract a penalty of between 4 and 5 years imprisonment, albeit that the case identified in Henry unlike the present one, assumed a late plea. Accordingly, the fact that there were seven such offences had to be brought into account. Each offence involved a degree of planning and an attack upon a vulnerable victim. The offences themselves took place over a not inconsiderable period of time. In those circumstances, notwithstanding the applicant’s favourable subjective features I am not of the opinion that some lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed. It follows that I am also not persuaded that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. I propose that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    18 BELL J: I agree. The order of the Court will be as Buddin J proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court following his plea of guilty to an offence of larceny. That offence attracts a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. The applicant also asked that two offences of goods in custody, which appeared on a Form 1 document, be taken into account. The applicant was sentenced to 2½ years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 months. The sentence was fixed to commence on 28 March 2004 and accordingly the non-parole period will expire on 27 June 2005.  
     
      
    2 The offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty related to the theft of $83,000 which was the property of Brambles Pty Limited. Because the facts of the matter were put in issue by the applicant at the sentencing hearing it will be necessary to set out the findings which the sentencing judge made as they provide the relevant framework for an assessment of the applicant’s grounds of appeal. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that during the early part of 1997 discussions took place between M H and a person by the name of S S who was then employed as a security guard by Brambles. I am satisfied that those discussions related to, in essence, a sham robbery and that as a consequence of those discussions, M H recruited a number of people to assist in such an illegal enterprise. 
        
       
       
        
        I accept that this prisoner was involved heavily in the planning which included surveillance of the movement of the Brambles armoured vans, further liaison with S S and in the delegation of tasks to the various individuals who ultimately took part, those persons being M G, I Z and S A, this prisoner and the person S S. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 10.30 am on 27 May 1997 a Brambles armoured van crewed by S S, J C and S W was driven to the Commonwealth Bank at Waterloo. S S was in possession of a Brambles bag containing eighty-three thousand dollars in cash. J C was his escort to the bank. S W remained in the vehicle. I find beyond reasonable doubt that this offender and the man M G approached and made a demand for the money of S S which was part and parcel of the sham arrangement. I find that the prisoner was armed with a sawn off shotgun and that as a result of seeing these two persons approach S S, the other security guard, J C, drew his revolver and fired two shots at the offender and M G. Those shots missed and the offender and M G sought cover. It is difficult to determine precisely what happened thereafter but it is clear that S S either threw the bag to or gave the bag to M G or placed it on the ground where M G was able to grab it. In any event, the bag was taken by M G and he and the offender left the area and ran to a nearby area where I Z and S A were waiting with motor vehicles. 
        
       
       
        
        A police investigation commenced and those who participated met at the offender’s flat where a further discussion took part. Within a few days the offenders all travelled to Victoria where they attended the Crown Casino and gambled some of the proceeds of the offence. It is clear that S S received a significant portion probably in the vicinity of fifty per cent of the funds. I am also satisfied that the offender received a substantial quantity of funds, certainly more than the amount that he claims now and at least unlikely to have been more than the twenty-three thousand dollars that he previously indicated he had received. In any event the precise break up in terms of the proceeds need not be determined as it is clear that this offender received a large amount of money as a consequence of this robbery and that each was in fact responsible for the theft of eighty-three thousand dollars from Brambles. 
        
       
       
        
        During 1999, M G made admissions as to his part and he also implicated his co-offenders. During the year 2000 all the offenders with the exception of this offender were arrested and all, except for the man S S who made no admissions, implicated the offender. The offender was not arrested until well after the others, that is until 28 May 2001 but I do note that on 28 May 1999 a covert recording was made of a conversation between the offender and a M S. That was a conversation which was in Hindi and which included a number of significant admissions by the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        Following his arrest in May of 2001, the offender was interviewed electronically and it is clear that during the course of that interview he lied to police until a portion of the listening device tape of his conversation with M S was played to him. Thereafter he indicated that he was simply big noting himself and that he had known about the offence although he had not participated. He was subsequently charged. No money has been recovered. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to the two Form One matters, the facts are set out in the Form One document and they relate to the possession of the offender of New South Wales driver’s licences, credit cards and other documents which might reasonably be suspected of being stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained so far as the first of the two matters on the Form One is concerned and so far as the second, relates to New South Wales driver’s licence and proof of age card which again might reasonably be suspected of being stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained. 
        
       
      
    3 It is convenient at this point to refer briefly to the course which proceedings took in relation to the various co-offenders. I Z was dealt with first. He pleaded guilty to armed robbery and was sentenced to a term of 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months. His role was to drive the getaway car for M G. He was young and was treated as having no prior convictions. He received a discount of 50% on sentence for his early plea of guilty and for his assistance to authorities, which included an offer to give evidence. M G was acquitted at a trial by judge alone of the offence of armed robbery but convicted of the offence of larceny, to which he had earlier offered to plead guilty. His plea of guilty, his contrition and his offer to assist the authorities by giving evidence and his other favourable subjective features led to his receiving a sentence of periodic detention. This was despite the sentencing judge (Judge Sides) having found that the offence fell into the worst category of offence. This finding was made even though that particular offender did not initiate the plan or carry the gun. S A, who drove the getaway car for the applicant, received a suspended sentence of 15 months. His role was a subsidiary one. He pleaded guilty to larceny at the earliest opportunity and also had undertaken to assist the authorities by giving evidence. S S was acquitted at trial. It was hardly surprising in the circumstances that the applicant did not seek to claim that he entertained a justifiable sense of grievance in respect of any of those sentences. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was born in Fiji into a family of Indian descent. At the age of 5 his family went to live in New Zealand and when he was aged 12, the family moved to Australia and settled in Sydney. The applicant is a permanent resident of this country. When he was aged 17, his father was murdered. His killer has not been brought to justice although for a number of years his mother remained a suspect in the killing. The death of his father and its aftermath unsettled the applicant to a significant degree. He became dependent upon alcohol and also became heavily involved in gambling. He has a child with whom he has little contact. He was married in 2003 to a Korean woman who apparently knew nothing of these proceedings. The sentencing judge heard evidence that the applicant had, for various periods of time, been employed. At the time of sentence he had been working as a factory manager for nearly 12 months. The applicant was aged 24 at the time of the offence and was 31 at the time of sentence. The sentencing judge specifically took into account in the applicant’s favour that there had been a significant period of delay in bringing the matter to finality. 
     
      
    5 The applicant did not have the advantage of a clear criminal record. Nevertheless apart from having on one occasion spent several months in custody pending an appeal to the District Court, he had never previously been to gaol. He had however acquired a number of previous convictions including convictions for offences of dishonesty. He had convictions for stealing; break, enter and steal; attempting to obtain money by deception, as well as several convictions for stealing or unlawful use of a motor vehicle. 
     
      
    6 The sentencing judge allowed a discount “in the order of 10 – 15%” for the utilitarian aspect of the applicant’s plea of guilty and a further discount “in the order of 30%” for the assistance which the applicant had provided to the authorities. His Honour then made a finding of “special circumstances” because of the applicant’s need for ongoing counselling in relation to his gambling addiction and because this was his first substantial sentence of imprisonment.  
     
      
    7 The first ground of appeal asserts that the sentencing judge erred in assessing the offence as “approaching the worst class category”. I have already referred to the factual findings at which the sentencing judge arrived. The applicant’s role in this offence amply justified his Honour’s finding that he was a principal offender. The offence was committed as the result of careful planning and was thus clearly premeditated. It was also executed, as the sentencing judge found, in a professional manner. The possession of the firearm, which was intended to give the sham robbery a greater degree of authenticity, clearly enough had the potential to give rise to a highly dangerous situation. The fact that the applicant was armed and that shots were fired, albeit by one of the victims of the offence, indicated that the offence was committed without any regard for the safety of the bank officers, security personnel or members of the public who were involved in, or who observed the incident. The sentencing judge was nonetheless alive to the need to approach this issue with appropriate circumspection. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        It is clear to me that the only relevance of the possession of the firearm is not that it was possessed for the purpose of the offence per se as it would be for the offence of armed robbery but rather it was possessed to simply give the sham robbery a more realistic appearance to any onlookers. 
        
       
      
    8 Nevertheless the sentencing judge took into account the fact that no substantial injury or harm was occasioned to any person. It was submitted that the amount of money taken was, in the scheme of things, not particularly large and was of itself a sufficient reason to remove the case from being in the worst category. Neither of those considerations could, in my view, be regarded as matters which disentitled the sentencing judge from characterising the objective gravity of the offence in the way in which his Honour did. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    9 The second ground of appeal is that the sentencing judge erred in giving insufficient weight to the plea of guilty. Whilst it was recognised that the discount allowed for this aspect of the matter fell within the range identified by this court in R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, it was submitted that a more generous discount was called for in the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    10 The applicant was presented upon an indictment on 22 May 2003 which contained a count for armed robbery and an alternative count for larceny. His plea of guilty to the larceny was accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment. The applicant was first charged with the larceny offence in the Local Court in November 2002 during the course of the committal hearing at which he had legal representation. Although the Crown had indicated as early as December 2002 that a plea to that offence would be accepted in full discharge, it was not until six months later that the plea was actually entered. The matter was adjourned on a number of occasions in the interim. It is not necessary in my view to descend into the details of what occasioned the various adjournments. I am content to proceed upon the basis that they were not all at the behest of the applicant. In those circumstances however, the sentencing judge found, as he was entitled to do, that the plea was not entered at the first available opportunity. The timeliness of the plea is of course a key ingredient in any evaluation of the extent of the discount to be allowed. Furthermore, this was not a case in which the applicant could claim that he had admitted his involvement in the matter when interviewed by police. Indeed the case against him depended upon the contents of a listening device which captured a conversation between him and another person as well as evidence from his co-offenders In those circumstances I am not persuaded that this Ground of Appeal has been established. 
     
      
    11 In any event, this question ought not to be considered in isolation from the question of the discount allowed for assistance to the authorities. In R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 this Court said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “an offender’s conduct in pleading guilty, his expressions of contrition, his willingness to co-operate with the authorities, and the personal risks to which he thereby exposes himself, will form a complex of inter-related considerations, and an attempt to separate out one or more of those considerations will not only be artificial and contrived, but will also be illogical” (at 228). 
        
       
      
    12 The final Ground of Appeal is that the sentencing judge “erred in failing to recognise the rehabilitation of the applicant”. This ground takes as its starting point the fact that the applicant received a 30% discount for his assistance to the authorities. It was submitted that that discount did not accurately reflect the significance of the assistance which the applicant had provided. It was pointed out that more generous discounts have been allowed in other cases.  
     
      
    13 The sentencing judge described the assistance which the applicant had provided in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        Since his arrest in relation to these matters, he attended voluntarily at the Australian Crime Commission and thereafter provided what has been described as significant information to that Commission in relation to a number of different areas. Those matters are set out in a letter of assistance provided by Mr Robert McDonald, a Director of the National Operations of the Australian Crime Commission dated 29 March 2004. The content of that letter was expanded upon by investigator Stephen Emes who gave evidence before me today in relation to the assistance. The assistance has been by way of information rather than by way of the giving of any evidence in any proceedings. The information provided has been significant according to the Australian Crime Commission in a number of areas in relation to fraud prosecutions and joint investigation of the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Crime Commission in relation to a number of accountants regarding a number of credit card frauds and in relation to information which was provided which was significant [in] that it involved information regarding a threat being made to an officer of the Australian Crime Commission. That threat was subsequently substantiated by the investigations of the Commission and safeguard steps were taken in response to the offender’s assistance. The offender also provided information which has not as yet but may well involve a new investigation being undertaken by the Australian Crime Commission in relation to key ring firearms. The information which has been provided has been described as significant.  
        
       
      
    14 The sentencing judge was aware that the weight to be attributed to this factor was to be evaluated in light of the considerations set out in s 23(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The sentencing judge had regard to the matters therein identified. His Honour observed that the applicant had indicated that he was not prepared to give evidence in relation to any of the matters about which he had provided information because of fears of retribution which the evidence revealed that he quite reasonably entertained. Furthermore, as the sentencing judge observed, because the applicant was not prepared to sign an undertaking to give evidence, he was not amenable to a Crown appeal if he failed to honour that undertaking. There was also an absence of any evidence before the sentencing judge to the effect that the applicant would, by reason of his assistance to authorities, be obliged to endure the more onerous conditions of protective custody whilst serving his sentence. 
     
      
    15 His Honour also noted that the information which the applicant had provided concerned matters that were unrelated to the present offences. His Honour was also aware that the applicant was to be registered as an informer and that there was some prospect that he would, in that capacity, continue to provide assistance to the authorities. Finally, as the sentencing judge observed, he was constrained, by reason of s 23(3) of the Act, not to allow a discount for assistance that had the effect of producing a penalty that was disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.  
     
      
    16 I referred earlier to this court’s decision in Gallagher. The combined discount which the sentencing judge extended to the applicant for his plea of guilty and for his assistance to the authorities was in the order of 40% - 45%. On any view of the matter that was a generous discount. In all those circumstances I am not persuaded that error has been established. 
     
      
    17 An allied submission was made that the assistance which the applicant provided was a powerful indicator of his ongoing rehabilitation, a matter which ought to have been reflected in the sentence. The sentencing judge observed that he was “unable to positively reach [the] conclusion” that the applicant had “good prospects of rehabilitation”. In arriving at that conclusion, his Honour made specific reference to the fact that he had found that the applicant was “a very unimpressive witness” when he gave evidence during the course of the sentencing hearing. His Honour said that the applicant was not prepared to admit the full extent of his involvement in the offence, a fact which bore upon the question of whether he was remorseful and also whether he had good prospects of rehabilitation. Nor, it may be observed was the applicant completely candid with the author of the pre-sentence report about his role in this offence. His Honour was certainly not bound, in light of all that evidence, to arrive at a positive finding upon the issue of rehabilitation. Moreover it is to be observed that the applicant had committed further offences subsequent to the one which is presently under consideration. In my view the applicant has failed to establish that error of the relevant kind was made by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    18 I would reject this Ground of Appeal. That being so, I propose that leave to appeal be granted and the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    19 BELL J: I agree. The order of the Court will be as Buddin J proposed. I direct that the exhibit in the sealed envelope be resealed and not opened without further order of a judge of this Court.

    2 The trial involving J was on an indictment containing eight counts, relating to three separate incidents, each said to have occurred at Vaucluse in the State of New South Wales. 
     
      
    3 The first two counts related to an incident alleged to have occurred between 27 June 1986 and 27 June 1989, and were in identical terms, alleging assault of J and commission of an act of indecency upon him. 
     
      
    4 The next four counts related to an incident alleged to have occurred between 27 June 1988 and 31 December 1990, and alleged that the appellant had sexual intercourse with J. Counts 3 and 5 were in identical terms, alleging that J was then under the age of 10 years. Counts 4 and 6 were also in identical terms and were respectively alleged as alternatives to counts 3 and 5, and they alleged that J was then of or above the age of 10 years and below the age 16 years.  
     
      
    5 The final two counts related to an incident alleged to have occurred between 27 June 1989 and 27 June 1992, and were in identical terms, alleging that the appellant had sexual intercourse with J, a person then of or above the age of 10 years and below the age of 16 years. 
     
      
    6 On 6 March 2003, the jury in that trial returned verdicts of not guilty to counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 and guilty to counts 4, 6, 7 and 8.  
     
      
    7 The trial involving F was on an indictment containing three counts, relating to two incidents each said to have occurred at Vaucluse between 1 January 1987 and 3 October 1990.  
     
      
    8 The first two counts were in identical terms, and alleged that the appellant had sexual intercourse with F, a person then under the age of 10 years. The third count alleged that the appellant committed an act of indecency with F, a person then under the age of 16 years. 
     
      
    9 On 17 March 2003, the jury in that trial returned verdicts of guilty to all three counts.  
     
      
    10 On 25 July 2003, Graham DCJ sentenced the appellant in relation to all the offences.  
     
      
    11 In relation to the offences committed upon J, the appellant was sentenced on each count to imprisonment for five years to commence 6 March 2003 and expire 5 March 2008, in each case with a non-parole period to commence on 6 March 2003 and expire on 5 March 2006.  
     
      
    12 In relation to offences committed upon F, the appellant was sentenced on each of counts 1 and 2 to imprisonment for eight years to commence on 6 March 2003 and expire on 5 March 2011, in each case with a non-parole period to commence on 6 March 2003 and expire on 5 September 2008. On count 3, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 15 months, to commence on 6 March 2003 and expire on 5 June 2004.  
     
      
    13 The effect of these orders was that all sentences were to be served concurrently. The overall sentence was for eight years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of five and a half years.  
     
      
    14 The appellant appeals from his convictions. The Crown appeals on sentence. I will refer to the prisoner as the appellant or the prisoner throughout the judgment. 
     
      
       
      CROWN CASE CONCERNING J 
      
    15 J was born on 27 June 1979 at Penrith. Shortly afterwards, his parents separated, and J moved with his mother and four siblings to his maternal uncle’s residence at Watsons Bay. J’s mother met the appellant, and in about the mid-1980s they began a romantic relationship. J’s evidence was that, from the age of about 8 years, J would stay with his mother overnight at the appellant’s then residence at Vaucluse most weekends, and all incidents were alleged to have occurred there. 
     
      
    16 J’s evidence concerning the first incident (counts 1 and 2) was that J was called into the appellant’s lounge-room, and the appellant had J sit on his lap. The appellant undid his own pants, and pulled out his penis, and then reached into J’s pyjamas and started fondling J’s penis (count 1), saying “I’ll play with yours, you play with mine”. The appellant then placed J’s hands on his penis (count 2). The activity stopped when J’s mother entered the room. 
     
      
    17 J’s evidence concerning the second incident (counts 3-6) was that, when he was about 9 years of age, he was woken from his sleep in the spare room in the appellant’s house by his mother, and was taken into the appellant’s bedroom. The appellant was naked on his bed. The appellant’s mother removed the robe she was wearing, undressed J and laid him on his back. The appellant sucked J’s penis (counts 3 and 4) while J’s mother kissed J using her tongue. Then J’s mother told J he had to “return the favour” and pushed J’s head towards the appellant’s penis, and J started sucking the appellant’s penis (counts 5 and 6). J noticed that the appellant had eczema on his stomach and chest.  
     
      
    18 J’s evidence concerning the third incident (counts 7 and 8) was that when he was between the ages of 9 and 10, his mother took J into the appellant’s room where the appellant was lying on the bed. J’s mother took J’s clothes off, and laid J on the bed. The appellant then sucked J’s penis (count 7). J’s mother kissed J and guided his head towards the appellant’s penis, and J sucked it (count 8). After that incident, J’s mother told him to be quiet and go back to his room and go to bed.  
     
      
    19 J gave evidence that there were other times sexual things happened between himself and the appellant, but he was not able to give details because his memory was vague.  
     
      
    20 J gave evidence that when he was about 10 years old he spoke to his older brother D at Watson’s Bay Pizzeria, on an occasion when J’s father, mother and siblings and also the appellant were there. J said he called D to an area where there were video games, D asked him what was wrong, and J said he was “getting sexually assaulted by Mum and Ken”. D said he would tell their father, J told D he did not want D to do this, and then told him that what he had said was not true. J’s evidence was that he did this (retracted his complaint) because he knew his father had a violent temper and because he was scared that if D spoke to his mother or the appellant, something could have happened to him. 
     
      
    21 J also gave evidence that he did not tell anyone of the assaults immediately after they happened because the appellant was a violent man, J was scared of him, and J had seen the appellant hit his mother on several occasions.  
     
      
    22 D gave evidence that one day when he was at Watson’s Bay Pizzeria with his family, he and J were at the counter and J told him that the appellant had been “touching him and stuff”. D’s evidence was that he asked J if he was sure, that J walked out and then came back in and said “I didn’t mean it”, and that J was like a frightened little kid. 
     
      
    23 J’s mother gave evidence in chief of two incidents. In one, J had come to her bed, and she had fallen asleep and then woken up and found the appellant on top of J. The appellant was naked and she thought J did not have any clothes on. In the other, she saw an act of fellatio between J and the appellant, but could not remember which of them was performing the act. 
     
      
    24 The Crown Prosecutor applied for leave to cross-examine J’s mother and this was granted. He put to her that the specific incidents alleged by J had occurred; and she said “That is quite possible. I’d say it would be correct”.  
     
      
       
      CROWN CASE CONCERNING F 
      
    25 F was born on 4 October 1980. She gave similar evidence to J as to the circumstances of her acquaintance with the appellant.  
     
      
    26 F’s evidence concerning the first incident was that when she was about 6 or 7, she awoke in the appellant’s study to see her mother performing an act of fellatio on the appellant. F’s mother told her to do to the appellant what she had been doing, and F was forced to suck the appellant’s penis (count 1). F then went to the lounge, and the appellant positioned himself on top of her and inserted his penis in her vagina (count 2). F’s mother told her to stop crying and shut up, because she (F’s mother) knew F was enjoying this act.  
     
      
    27 F’s evidence concerning the second incident was that in the same year, 1987, F woke up in the appellant’s lounge-room and saw a pornographic video being played on the television. The appellant and F’s mother were on a blanket in front of the heater. The appellant and F’s mother told F to come down to them. The appellant and F’s mother, and also F, were unclothed. F touched the appellant’s penis (count 3), and F’s mother performed an act of cunnilingus on her.  
     
      
    28 F did not remember any other incidents of a sexual nature involving the appellant, but remembered she would “always” find herself waking up in the appellant’s bed with her mother, in circumstances where F had no clothes on.  
     
      
    29 F gave evidence of assaults committed by the appellant on her mother, and that the fighting made her feel scared. She did not complain to anyone after the incidents, because she did not believe it to be wrong, nobody had told her anything bad had happened, she was only a kid, she had never heard anything of sexual abuse before, and she was afraid that if she said anything to her mother she would hit her, or if anything was said to the appellant he might get angry and then instead of being violent on her mother be violent on “us kids”.  
     
      
    30 F gave evidence in chief that when she was about 14, she ran away from her mother (F and her mother were then living in the Blue Mountains) and went to stay with the appellant and her elder brother A for two weeks; and also that when she was about 16 or 17, she wrote a letter of thanks to the appellant for letting her stay at his place and thanking him “for all the nice things”. 
     
      
    31 F’s mother gave evidence of an occasion when she saw F in the appellant’s study and saw the appellant sitting on the back of F’s legs just below her buttocks. She denied ever having licked F’s vagina. She said that she had been assaulted by the appellant. 
     
      
    32 The Crown Prosecutor applied for and was given leave to cross-examine F’s mother. The first incident was put to the mother and she said that it “could have been quite possible”. The second incident was put to her mother, and she said “That’s correct” and “As far as I know that’s correct yes”, though she did not admit that she licked F’s vagina. 
     
      
    33 Over objection, the Crown adduced evidence from F that, when she was in Year 7 at Dover Heights High School, she had complained to a friend K, though she did not remember the details of the complaint. K gave evidence that in 1993 or 1994, she had a conversation with F in which she vaguely remembered F saying “Something about her mother asking her and Ken or Ken to touch her or play with her”, with F crying quite a bit, being very distraught. 
     
      
       
      DEFENCE CASE 
      
    34 The appellant gave evidence at both trials that the incidents of sexual assaults never happened, and that at no time did either complainant sleep at his place overnight when he was present. He denied ever having assaulted the complainant’s mother, and said he had been assaulted by her. He denied he ever suffered from eczema between 1988 and 1992, and tendered a photograph taken in 1988 or 1989 showing him with no shirt on.  
     
      
    35 In relation to the trial concerning F, the defence case was that the first incident could not have happened, because at the committal proceedings F had given evidence that the first incident occurred before a meeting with DOCS on 9 February 1987; and evidence was given at the trial by Dr. Roche that he had conducted a medical examination on F on 13 March 1987 which include a genital examination, and the findings were normal and F could not have been penetrated by an adult penis. F said at the trial that, when she gave evidence at the committal, she was confused as to whether she remembered the 1987 meeting with DOCS or had a memory of another meeting in 1991.  
     
      
    36 The appellant’s case was that the second incident concerning F could not have happened, because F’s mother denied cunnilingus, and because at the committal proceedings F gave evidence that during the second incident she had sucked the appellant’s penis, but conceded at the trial that this was a false memory. 
     
      
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
      
    37 The appellant relies on two grounds: 
     
      
      1. The trial judge erred in allowing evidence as to alleged physical assaults committed by the appellant upon the complaints’ mother. 
       
      2. The trial judge erred in admitting evidence of complaint in the trial with respect to the complainant [F]. 
       
       
      EVIDENCE OF ASSAULTS 
      
    38 Mr. Pontello for the appellant submitted that evidence, admitted over objection in both trials, of assaults allegedly committed by the appellant on the complaints’ mother should not have been admitted. It was not admissible as relationship or context evidence, because it was too vague, general and unspecific: R v. Marsh [2000] NSWCCA 370 at [18]. It did not assist in understanding the circumstances of the alleged assaults, since it was no part of the Crown case that compliance was due to fear of the appellant.  
     
      
    39 Mr. Pontello submitted it was not admissible to explain delay in respect of complaint. There was no effective delay in respect of complaint by J. The probative value in each case was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice: Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) s.137. The probative value was low: there was no close temporal connection between the alleged assaults and the incidents, the assaults were not committed on the complainants, the evidence was vague, there was no delay to explain in relation to J, and the assaults were of minimal relevance to the explanation of lack of complaint given by F. The danger of prejudice was high: high generality, which gave rise in cross-examination to highly prejudicial and non-responsive evidence in J’s trial from his mother that the appellant broke her back, broke her arm and bashed her head twice along pavers, with the further result that there was no effective cross-examination of the mother about the alleged assaults in F’s trial.  
     
      
    40 In my opinion, the evidence was relevant both to the acquiescence of each complainant at the time of the alleged offences, and to questions concerning complaint, although the probative value on the first aspect was small, because in each case the complainants’ evidence was essentially that they acquiesced in the relevant conduct because of directions coming from the mother, so that fear of the appellant was only of slight relevance.  
     
      
    41 On the matter of complaint, it was relevant in the case of J to the fact that the only complaint was made to his brother and then promptly withdrawn. Two explanations were given for withdrawal, one concerning what the father would do, but the other to the effect that if the brother spoke to the mother or the appellant, something could have happened to him.  
     
      
    42 In the case of F, the evidence was relevant to lack of complaint until about six years later, when complaint was made to K. F’s fear that the appellant might get angry and be violent to “us kids” was a significant part of F’s explanation for this.  
     
      
    43 On the matter of prejudice, the prejudicial and non-responsive answer by the mother could not amount to an error of the primary judge, and no complaint was made either to the primary judge or on appeal as to what was done by the primary judge in response to this. There was no application to strike out the evidence or to discharge the jury, and no complaint made about directions or lack of directions on the matter. There is no appeal ground on the basis that this unresponsive answer has resulted in a miscarriage. In my opinion, this does not go to the s.137 question. 
     
      
    44 In my opinion, there was an element of discretion to be exercised by the Crown Prosecutor and the primary judge concerning the level of generality at which this evidence was led. If such evidence is led at a high level of generality, there is difficulty in the appellant answering it. On the other hand, if it is led with too much specific detail, the evidence could be distracting from the real issues in the case. The question under s.137 is also a matter of judgment, where there would be appellate interference only if some error of principle is disclosed in the judge’s approach to the problem or if the appeal court is able to say that the trial judge’s conclusion was wrong. In my opinion, no ground is made out in this case for intervention by an appeal court on these matters. 
     
      
       
      COMPLAINT BY F 
      
    45 There was evidence from F of her complaint to K, and evidence from K of this complaint, admitted after F had been cross-examined in respect of her evidence that she stayed with the appellant for two weeks when she was about 14, and wrote a letter of thanks to him when she was about 16 or 17. In that cross-examination, it was suggested to her that there were a number of other places she could have gone to, and that she went to stay at the appellant’s house because “nothing happened”; and that she had written the letter because “nothing happened”. The trial judge then ruled that the evidence of complaint was admissible under s.108(3)(a) of the Evidence Act. Section 108 of the Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        108 Exception: re-establishing credibility 
         
        (1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in re-examination of a witness. 
         
        (2) (Repealed)  
         
        (3) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if:  
         
        (a) evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of the witness has been admitted, or 
         
        (b) it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or re-constructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion, 
         
        and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement. 
        
       
      
    46 The trial judge indicated that he would allow further cross-examination of F, but the appellant’s Counsel did not undertake this.  
     
      
    47 Mr. Pontello submitted that the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence, because the evidence of complaint had no ability to answer the attack that was made on F’s credibility, and leave should not have been granted in circumstances where the Crown itself adduced evidence of the alleged prior inconsistent statements in evidence in chief. In the present case, the relevant attack on F’s credibility centred on her assertion that she went to stay with the appellant because she did not know where to go; and her vague evidence about a complaint to K did nothing to rebut this attack: R v. BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 141; Graham v. The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606. It was not appropriate for the Crown to adduce evidence of prior inconsistent statements in evidence in chief, and then rely on this to ground an application under s.108(3)(a), particularly where the defence had not raised that issued: Gipp v. The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 106 at [12]. Complaint evidence is a powerful factor in cases such as the present, and admission of this otherwise inadmissible complaint dealt the appellant’s case an unfair blow.  
     
      
    48 Mr. Pontello also relied on s.192 of the Evidence Act, which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        192 Leave, permission or direction may be given on terms 
         
        (1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit. 
         
        (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:  
         
        (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and 
         
        (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and 
         
        (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and 
         
        (d) the nature of the proceeding, and 
         
        (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence. 
        
       
      
    49 He submitted that s.192(2)(b) was particularly relevant, and was not referred to by the trial judge: Stanoevski v. The Queen (2001) 202 CLR 115.  
     
      
    50 In relation to this submission, further provisions of the Evidence Act are relevant, namely the definitions in Part 1 of the Dictionary to the Evidence Act of “prior consistent statement”, “prior inconsistent statement”, “previous representation” and “representation”. Those definitions are as follows. 
     
      
       
        
        prior consistent statement 
         of a witness means a previous representation that is consistent with evidence given by the witness. 
         
         
        prior inconsistent statement 
         of a witness means a previous representation that is inconsistent with evidence given by the witness. 
         
         
        previous representation 
         means a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which evidence of the representation is sought to be adduced. 
         
         
        representation 
         includes:  
         
        (a) an express or implied representation (whether oral or in writing), or 
         
        (b) a representation to be inferred from conduct, or 
         
        (c) a representation not intended by its maker to be communicated to or seen by another person, or 
         
        (d) a representation that for any reason is not communicated. 
        
       
      
    51 It is important to note that a representation can be “implied” or “inferred from conduct”; and that it is not necessary that it be intended to be asserted, as is the case in the statement of the hearsay rule in s.59(1) of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    52 In my opinion, the action of F in voluntarily going to stay for two weeks in the appellant’s house when she was 14 could be considered as an assertion or representation by conduct that the appellant had not done anything to her so terrible as she now alleged, particularly in relation to count 2. The letter of F thanking the appellant for nice things he had done amounted to an implied representation that the appellant had not treated F as she alleged, again particularly in relation to count 2.  
     
      
    53 The defence in cross-examination squarely put to F, in relation to each matter, that F did it because “nothing happened”, plainly meaning that the alleged incidents had not taken place. That was the relevant attack on F’s credibility, not the particular attack on her assertion, in relation to the first matter, that she had nowhere else to go.  
     
      
    54 In my opinion, evidence of the complaint to K made in about 1993 or 1994, shortly before the stay with the appellant and two to three years before she wrote the letter, was relevant to assist her credibility to the extent that it had been damaged by the implied representations. At least indirectly, it gave material support to her explanation of these matters, making her essential evidence concerning the incidents more credible.  
     
      
    55 In my opinion, it is appropriate for the Crown to lead relevant evidence which is damaging to the Crown case, including evidence of prior inconsistent statements by a witness. In cases such as the present, this may lay the ground for seeking leave under s.108(3)(a) to adduce evidence of a prior consistent statement; but the circumstance that the evidence was volunteered by the Crown may lead the judge, in considering whether leave should be granted, to decide that the prior inconsistent statement volunteered by the Crown is insufficient to justify admission of a complaint, which otherwise would be too late to be admissible under s.66 of the Evidence Act as having been made when the matter asserted was “fresh in the memory” of the complainant. 
     
      
    56 In this case, there was no application for such leave by the Crown prior to cross-examination, and it is not necessary to decide whether such an application could possibly have been successful. However, it does seem to me that, if it had not been suggested in cross-examination that these matters indicated that the events alleged by F had not occurred, an application by the Crown to adduce the evidence of the complaint would have been unlikely, and it would have been most unlikely to succeed. 
     
      
    57 However, the defence cross-examination of F did seek in effect to use these matters in their capacity as prior inconsistent statements, and as a basis for suggesting that F’s evidence of the alleged events was false; and it was in those circumstances that the application was made. The trial judge concluded his reasons for admitting the evidence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The onus is on the Crown to establish that it should be granted leave but, provided the accused has a further opportunity to cross-examine on that material, it seems to me that there is no injustice done by the admission of the material relating to the conversations with [K] in about 1993 and I grant that leave. 
        
       
      
    58 This passage, and the judgment generally, shows that the trial judge did consider the extent to which the grant of leave would be unfair to the appellant, and in my opinion the absence of specific reference to s.192 does not amount to an error: R v. Reardon [2002] NSWCCA 203 at [23]-[32].  
     
      
    59 In my opinion, the admission of the evidence, by leave of the trial judge, was justified by s.108(3)(a) of the Evidence Act; and no error has been shown in the judge’s reasons for granting that leave. 
     
      
       
      CONCLUSIONS ON CONVICTION APPEAL 
      
    60 For those reasons, the appeal against conviction fails.  
     
      
    61 I note that the Crown also sought to rely on the proviso in relation to the evidence of complaint to K. In my opinion, had the appellant established that it was wrong to admit that evidence, this would not have been a case for application of the proviso. Although the complaint evidence was vague, it could not be said that there was no reasonable possibility of a different result if that evidence had not been admitted. 
     
      
       
      CROWN APPEAL ON SENTENCE 
      
    62 It was submitted for the Crown that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate, and that error was shown by the sentencing judge’s failure to impose appropriate individual sentences for each count, failure to accumulate individual sentences so as to reflect total criminality, and failure to provide reasons for not setting a non-parole period for count 3 in the matter of F. The effective sentence imposed on the co-offender mother of the complainants (on appeal in R V. JMP [2003] NSWCCA 369) of eight years after a 30% discount gave a notional starting point of 12 years (mathematically, it seems to me that 11½ years would be more accurate). That would also be an appropriate starting point for the prisoner. The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge had not complied with Pearce v. The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, and that there should have been at least some partial accumulation of sentences: R v. AEM Snr, KEM & MM [2002] NSWCCA 58. Even if the alternate approach countenanced in Johnson v. The Queen (2004) 205 ALR 346 at [26] were adopted, there was still manifest inadequacy in the total.  
     
      
    63 In my opinion, the failure to provide reasons for not setting a non-parole period for count 3 could not possibly justify appellate intervention. In circumstances where the head sentence was much shorter than the non-parole periods in relation to the other offences, the reason for taking this course was manifest. Appellate intervention could not be justified. 
     
      
    64 In my opinion also, having regard to the comments of the High Court in Johnson, the circumstance that the sentencing judge did not strictly follow the Pearce procedure would not of itself be a sufficient ground for intervention on a Crown appeal in this case.  
     
      
    65 Further, in my opinion it would be inappropriate to intervene on parity grounds when the Court of Criminal Appeal in JMP applied parity with the original sentence imposed on the prisoner to reach its result in that case. The difference between a notional starting point of 11½ years in that case and the head sentence of eight years in the present case can be justified by the larger number of offences for which the mother was charged (resulting in a liability to imprisonment for a total of 110 years in her case, as against 74 years in the appellant’s case), the mother’s position of trust with respect to her children the complainants, and also perhaps some discount for the appellant because of his health. Considerations of the need for protective custody could also be relevant, although those considerations could apply equally in both cases.  
     
      
    66 Accordingly, in my opinion the real issue on this appeal is the matter of manifest inadequacy. In my opinion, the sentence imposed was too low having regard to the very high criminality involved; and were the role of this Court simply to impose the sentence that it thought appropriate, in my opinion the result would be a substantial increase in the sentence. However, having regard to all the considerations that apply in the case of Crown appeals, and having regard to the circumstance that to disturb the current sentence could disturb what the Court of Criminal Appeal in JMP considered appropriate having regard to parity considerations, in my opinion the Court should not intervene in this case. 
     
      
       
      CONCLUSION 
      
    67 For those reasons, in my opinion the following orders should be made: 
     
      
      1. Conviction appeal dismissed. 
       
      2. Crown appeal on sentence dismissed. 
       
      
    68 HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hodgson JA and with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    69 HIDDEN J: I agree with Hodgson JA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon her in the District Court in consequence of her pleas of guilty to an indictment containing three counts. The first count alleged that she supplied not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The second count alleged that she supplied methylamphetamine and the third count alleged that she was involved in an ongoing supply of methylamphetamine in that she supplied the drug on three or more occasions during a period of 30 consecutive days. The second count attracted a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment whilst the other two counts each attracted a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. A number of other offences, which appeared on a Form 1 document, were taken into account. They consisted of four offences of possession of small quantities of cannabis, cocaine and amphetamine respectively, as well as four offences of goods in custody. One of those charges related to the possession of clothing and electrical items whilst the remaining charges related to the possession of three separate amounts of cash, which in total exceeded $8,000. 
     
      
    2 In respect of count 1, the applicant was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years. Each term was ordered to commence on 10 July 2003 and the non-parole period is accordingly due to expire on 9 July 2006. In respect of count 2, a wholly concurrent sentence of 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years 9 months was imposed. In respect of count 3, a sentence of 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months was imposed. That sentence was ordered to commence on 10 July 2004. The total effective sentence is thus a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 9 months which is due to expire on 9 April 2008. 
     
      
    3 The facts which give rise to the various offences can be briefly stated. So far as count 1 is concerned, they relate to an occasion on 3 April 2001 when the police executed a search warrant upon the applicant’s premises. During a search of her bedroom they discovered 266.42 grams of methylamphetamine together with a sum of $2900 in cash. Police also located a large quantity of resealable plastic bags containing traces of methylamphetamine as well as a set of electronic scales. The applicant was charged with supplying the drugs by reason of the deeming provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  
     
      
    4 The applicant was granted bail but was arrested again on 18 May 2001. It was the discovery on that occasion of a further quantity of 96.47 grams of methylamphetamine that provided the basis for count 2. The applicant showed the police a container sitting on her bedside table which had 25.6 grams of the drug within it. She maintained that it was for the personal use of herself and her son. Although the applicant denied that there were any other drugs in the bedroom, the police then discovered a further quantity of approximately 70 grams of the drug in a resealable bag under a pillow. The applicant denied any knowledge of that item. Also located near the bedside table were numerous resealable plastic bags and a set of electronic scales. Police also discovered $1000 in cash which the applicant maintained had been given to her by various friends to enable her to pay electricity bills. Once again the applicant was granted bail. 
     
      
    5 On 30 July 2001 police obtained a warrant to intercept calls made on the applicant’s mobile phone. Those calls were monitored for a 30 day period. Those calls provide the basis for count 3. Transcripts of some of those calls were before the sentencing judge. They revealed that the applicant was supplying truck drivers with methylamphetamine on a regular basis. There was evidence of about 10 such transactions although there was no evidence as to the quantities involved. On the occasion of her arrest in respect of this matter, a sum of $4160 in cash was located at the applicant’s premises. 
     
      
    6 On this occasion, bail was refused. The applicant remained in custody for some months before being released on bail. She then remained on bail for about 2 years until she was sentenced. It would appear that she dutifully observed the conditions of her bail during that period. The commencement date for the first of the sentences imposed upon her was selected in order to give the applicant credit for the time she had spent in custody prior to being sentenced. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was aged 47 at the time of sentence. It was to her credit that she had no prior convictions of any kind whatsoever. The evidence revealed that she had been adopted as a baby. Her childhood was otherwise unremarkable. She married when she was 16 and had two sons. Her sons are now adults. The marriage was dissolved in 1979. The applicant had been on a disability pension since 1987. Prior to that time she had been in regular employment. She had driven trucks for a period of 9 years and it would appear that she began using amphetamines at that time. She had also done clerical work. 
     
      
    8 There was evidence from the applicant’s general practitioner, which the sentencing judge accepted, that her health had been compromised by her long standing respiratory problems, including asthma and emphysema. The sentencing judge also accepted that the applicant’s elder son suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and that he has an extensive criminal record. In that context his Honour set out at some length parts of the pre-sentence report. It contained the following extract: 
     
      
       
        
        The offender said her eldest son had been a major cause of many of her problems, claiming his behaviour had contributed to her poor health and the matters currently before the Court. She stated that at the time of some of the offences she was living in a house with her son and at least four other people mainly associates of her eldest son whom she had met in gaol. The offender claimed that she had not been aware of what was happening in the house at that time as she had spent most of her time locked in her room to get away from her son who was harassing her for money. Her ex partner endorsed her statement saying that his son and his partner both alleged drug abusers had been problematic to both himself and the offender over the years.  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    9 The sentencing judge was not however prepared to accept a submission which was advanced by the applicant that she had involved herself in these offences in order to support her son’s drug addiction or as a means of in some way freeing herself from his chaotic and violent behaviour. Indeed the sentencing judge concluded that “the offender was acting in her own interests and endeavouring over a period of time to accumulate funds from the unlawful dealing in drugs for her own purposes”. That finding was not the subject of challenge in this Court. 
     
      
    10 It was clearly an aggravating feature of the offences giving rise to counts 2 and 3 that they were committed whilst the applicant was on bail in respect of the first offence. Moreover an additional penalty was warranted to properly reflect the offences which were on the Form 1 document, albeit that those offences were intimately connected with the offences which gave rise to the counts on the indictment. It was also appropriate that there was some accumulation of the sentences which were imposed. In the circumstances nothing but substantial custodial sentences could have been countenanced. 
     
      
    11 The first ground of appeal is that the sentencing judge “erred in the determination of the utilitarian value of the plea”. The challenge is made in respect of the following observations which were made by the sentencing judge. His Honour said, “I have taken into account her plea of guilty but to a very limited extent having regard to the strength of the prosecution case and the lateness of the plea.” 
     
      
    12 In R v Grbin [2004] NSWCCA 220, this Court dealt with a very similar submission. Dunford J, with whom Levine and Howie JJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        His Honour noted that the applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity but went on to observe that the prosecution case against him was a strong one and noted he had not identified his suppliers or his other customers.  
        
       
       
        
        This suggests that his Honour failed to regard the utilitarian value of the plea as something separate from the value of the plea as evidencing remorse and contrition. 
        
       
       
        
        While the strength of the prosecution case is relevant to the plea of guilty as evidence of contrition, authority establishes that it is not relevant to the utilitarian value of the plea:  
        R v Thomson and Houlton  
        [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383 at [137] and see also  
        R v Way  
        [2004] NSWCCA 131 at [18] and [149]. Moreover, his Honour made no express reference to a discount for the plea of guilty, particularly for its utilitarian value nor did he quantify it in any way.  
        
       
       … 
       
        
        In the present case, not only does his Honour appear to have confused the strength of the Crown case with the utilitarian value of the plea, but he has not indicated that any discount has been allowed for the utilitarian value of the plea or the extent of any such discount. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that his Honour fell into error. (pars 18-23) 
        
       
      
    13 In R v Tran [2004] NSWCCA 366 this Court also dealt with a submission to like effect and observed that: 
     
      
       
        
        [t]he main thrust of the complaint is directed to the following passage from the sentencing judge’s Remarks on Sentence. His Honour said:  
         
          
          I have taken into account on the question of sentence the pleas of guilty entered. However, I pay little regard to them in view of the overwhelming strength of the Crown case, the offences from beginning to end having been recorded on quite clear coloured television. 
          
         
        To treat the strength of the Crown case as bearing upon this latter consideration has been held in a succession of cases since  
        Thomson & Houlton 
         to reveal error. See  
        R v Sutton 
         [2004] NSWCCA 225 at para 12.  
        
       
      
    14 The Court went on to hold that error had been established. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    15 Those decisions assume particular significance because the sentencing judge in each of those cases was the same judge as the one who imposed sentence in the present matter.  
     
      
    16 I do not accept, as the Crown somewhat faintly suggested, that the sentencing judge was confining his remarks concerning the strength of the Crown case to the issue of contrition. Indeed it is most unlikely, given the generally unfavourable views which his Honour expressed about the applicant’s evidence, that he was prepared to accept that she was entitled to any discount on account of contrition. In any event, his Honour’s specific reference to the lateness of the pleas, which was a relevant consideration so far as the utilitarian aspect of the plea was concerned, suggests that he was considering only that aspect of the plea when he made the remarks which are the subject of the present challenge. 
     
      
    17 In Sutton (supra), Howie J, with whom Studdert and Dunford JJ agreed, said that: 
     
      
       
        
        if judges are not prepared to make the discount clear by quantifying it or indicating the starting point of the sentence before the application of the discount, then with respect, they should carefully and correctly enunciate the factors taken into account and the principles being applied in determining the discount which they are applying. As Dunford J noted in  
        R v Mako 
         [2004] NSWCCA 90 at [21]:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          In all cases the important consideration is to expose the transparency of the process so that it can be seen that an appropriate discount has been allowed. 
          
         
        
       
      
    18 I am of the view that this ground has been established. This was a case in which it was appropriate to give some weight to that aspect of the applicant’s pleas of guilty which went to the utilitarian consideration referred to in Thomson & Houlton, albeit that the discount which was warranted fell towards if not at the bottom of the range therein identified, because the pleas were entered at a late stage of the proceedings. 
     
      
    19 The applicant also submits that the sentencing judge erred in failing to find special circumstances. Indeed it is pointed out that his Honour made no reference to the question at all. Nor did his Honour do so in Grbin. There this Court said that: 
     
      
       
        
        [a]lthough there is no obligation to do so,  
        R v Simpson  
        (2001) 53 NSWLR 704, it is desirable that judges at first instance do refer specifically to whether they have considered special circumstances, whether they find them established, and if so, whether or not they find such special circumstances sufficient to justify a variation of the ratio referred to in s 44(2):  
        R v Brindley 
         (1993) 66 A Crim R 204. (para 32) 
        
       
       
      
    20 Before further considering this issue, it is convenient to consider the applicant’s final ground of appeal which asserted that the sentencing judge “erred in imposing a non-parole period in excess of the customary ratio resulting in a non-parole period which is manifestly excessive”. 
     
      
    21 For present purposes it is necessary to refer only to the individual sentences imposed in respect of counts 1 and 3. In each case the sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period which was in accordance with the normal statutory proportion, that is 75% of the head sentence. However, when the later sentence was accumulated upon the earlier sentence, the consequence was that the overall non-parole period produced was almost 80% of the head sentence. Although there is no prohibition against the setting of a non-parole period which is more than 75% of the head sentence, there is no reason to believe that that is the result which his Honour intended in the present case. Indeed the indications are to the contrary. Moreover, this Court has intervened on a number of occasions in which the accumulation of sentences has produced an outcome similar to that which has occurred in the present case. See R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58; R v Close (1993) 31 NSWLR 742; R v Bolamatu [2002] NSWCCA 454; R v LWP [2003] NSWCCA 215;  R v Keen [2004] NSWCCA 86; R v Jammeh [2004] NSWCCA 327. 
     
      
    22 Moreover there is plenty of authority to the effect that the accumulation of sentences can itself constitute “special circumstances”. See Simpson (supra); Close (supra) and R v Clissold [2002] NSWCCA 356. I am persuaded that this ground of appeal has also been established. 
     
      
    23 The question which then arises is whether or not this Court is of the opinion that some less severe sentence is warranted and should have been passed. The offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty revealed criminality of a very high order and salutary penalties were required. It is also necessary of course to ensure that the purposes for fixing an appropriate non-parole period are reflected in the ultimate sentence. See R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704. In my view the only extent to which this court could properly intervene is to reduce the non-parole period but then only to bring it into conformity with the normal statutory proportion of 75% of the head sentence.  
     
      
       
      
    24 I propose the following orders. 
     
      
       
      1 Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      2 Allow the appeal (in part). 
       
       
      3 Confirm the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1 and 2. 
       
       
      4 Confirm the head sentence in respect of count 3. 
       
       
      5 Quash the non-parole period imposed in respect of count 3 and in lieu thereof fix a non-parole period of 3 years and six months. The non-parole period will expire on 9 January 2008 at which time the applicant will be eligible for parole. 
       
      
    25 GILES JA: I agree and would add only this. It was suggested that insofar as there was error in failing to pay appropriate regard to the plea of guilty, it followed necessarily that some other sentence was warranted for the purposes of section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. That is not correct, as has been said on a number of occasions.26 SMART AJ: I agree with both judgments that have been delivered.27 GILES JA: The orders will be as proposed by Buddin J.
