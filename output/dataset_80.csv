        REGINA v RIMANTAS KUCKAILIS 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    HOWIE J: The appellant was arraigned before a jury on an indictment containing two counts. The first count charged an offence contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act alleging that the appellant had attempted sexual intercourse without consent. The second count on the indictment was in the alternative to the first count and charged an offence contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act alleging an assault with an act of indecency. 
      
       
     2    Both charges arose from the same incident which was alleged to have occurred on 18 March 2000 and involved the same complainant. After a trial of some four days the jury acquitted the appellant of the first count on the indictment but convicted him of the second alternative count. As a consequence of this conviction the appellant was sentenced by the trial Judge to imprisonment for one year, that sentence being suspended under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The appellant appeals against his conviction but does not seek leave to appeal against the sentence imposed. 
      
       
     3    There are two grounds of appeal filed on behalf of the appellant both of which assert in effect that it was not open to the jury to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the second count on the indictment in light of what is said to be the manifest deficiencies in the complainant's account of the events and circumstances in which she said that the appellant sexually assaulted her. However, as matters have transpired it is unnecessary for this Court to consider these grounds of appeal or to evaluate the evidence and assess whether the jury were entitled to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant committed the offence charged against him in the second count on the indictment. 
      
       
     4    The Crown Prosecutor on the hearing the appeal, Mr Berman of Senior Counsel, very fairly and properly brought to the Court's attention what he asserts to be a fundamental defect in the directions given by the trial Judge as to the elements of the offence contained in the second count. The Crown has conceded that these erroneous directions gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. As the Crown has pointed out, the misdirections appear to explain why the jury convicted the appellant of the second count on the indictment while not being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the allegation involved in the first count. Both counts on the indictment arose from almost identical facts and circumstances and it is difficult to distinguish any material difference between the findings to be made by the jury in order to convict the appellant of one charge but not the other. 
      
       
     5    The Crown has further conceded that, if this Court allows the appeal and quashes the conviction, it should not order a re-trial but direct a verdict of acquittal. In my view the Crown's concessions were appropriately made and, therefore, it is unnecessary to consider the grounds of appeal raised by the appellant which, if they had been successful, would have resulted in the very same orders being made. 
      
       
     6    The evidence given in the trial can, in the light of the Crown's concessions, be very briefly referred to. In effect the complainant asserted that the appellant, with whom she was sharing accommodation, had sexually assaulted her while he was under the influence of alcohol. Her evidence was that, taking the opportunity of finding himself alone with the complainant, he had committed acts of indecency against her in the premises in which they lived but that she was able to discourage him by pushing him away. 
      
       
     7    The complainant asserted that the appellant then went to the bathroom and, when he returned, he was naked. She gave evidence that the appellant then carried her forcibly into a bedroom where he threw her on to a bed and commenced to have sexual activity with her against her will. The complainant's version was that the appellant attempted to insert his penis into her vagina notwithstanding that she was struggling against him but that he failed in his endeavour because the two fell from the bed on to the floor as a result of her struggles. 
      
       
     8    The complainant stated that the appellant had struck his head on a piece of furniture in the bedroom causing his head to bleed. The complainant said that she was then ordered to leave the premises, which she did. She made complaint about the appellant’s conduct to friends a short time later. 
      
       
     9    The appellant gave evidence that, rather than he being the person who was interested in having sexual relations with the complainant, it was she who had attempted in effect to seduce him while she was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. He told the jury that he had rebuffed her approaches and no intimacy occurred between them. 
      
       
     10    This was the factual dispute between the complainant and the appellant that was before the jury for their determination. In effect the appellant asserted that he had never attempted to have sexual intercourse with the complainant let alone without her consent. 
      
       
     11    The first count on the indictment was explained to the jury by the trial judge as being an attempt by the appellant to insert his penis into the vagina of the complainant without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting and that he failed to complete that act simply because he fell from the bed and cut his head. The alternative count was put to the jury on the basis that, if the jury had a doubt as to whether he intended to have sexual intercourse without her consent, that is penile penetration of her vagina, then he would be convicted of an indecent assault. The Crown alleged that the act of indecency included the fact that the appellant had placed his penis on the outside of the vagina of the complainant. 
      
       
     12    The trial Judge summed up the case to the jury in a brief manner as was befitting the particular issues which were before them. In explaining the elements of the offence to the jury that were involved in the first count on the indictment, his Honour indicated that the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had attempted to have sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent and that he knew she was not consenting. It was the Crown's allegation that the appellant must have known of the fact that the complainant was not consenting by reason of her struggles and attempts to resist him. 
      
       
     13    The trial Judge explained to the jury that the second count on the indictment was available to the jury if they had some doubt as to whether the appellant was intending to actually carry on with the act of intercourse if the complainant did not ultimately consent to his sexual advances. His Honour explained to the jury that, before the accused could be convicted of the alternative offence, the Crown was required to prove that there was an act of indecency which was committed by the appellant without the complainant's consent. 
      
       
     14    After they were asked to consider their verdict, the jury raised a question with the trial judge as to the distinction between the two counts on the indictment. The question the jury asked was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Can your Honour please clarify once more for the benefit of the jury what precisely is the distinction of law between the two counts on the indictment""? 
         
        
       
     15    His Honour in effect repeated in a somewhat shortened form the directions he had given to the jury in relation to the elements of the two different offences in the major part of his summing-up. He indicated to the jury once more that the first count on the indictment required the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt not only that the complainant was not consenting but that the appellant also knew that she was not consenting to the act of intercourse. He explained to the jury that the second count on the indictment merely required that the Crown prove that the appellant had performed the indecent assault upon the complainant, that being attempting to put his penis into her vagina and that there was no consent to that act. 
      
       
     16    After his Honour had asked whether these further directions made clear to the jury the distinction between the two offences, the foreman of the jury said this: 
      
       
        
         
         ""We don't seem to have unanimous agreement that it is clear, still seems to be some doubt as to the distinction between the two."" 
         
        
        
       His Honour once more attempted to explain to the jury, in the way he had previously done so, the different elements of the two offences. 
        
       
     17    After he had concluded this further direction to the jury and asked whether they now understood the distinction, the following exchange occurred: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Foreman: So the critical difference in his knowing that there was no consent? 
          
          
         His Honour: Yes. 
          
          
         Foreman: Is that the case? 
          
          
         His Honour: Yes knowing - or continuing to do it realising there would be no consent. 
          
          
         Foreman: Which is the first. 
          
          
         His Honour: Which is the first. Thank you members of the jury…….."" 
         
        
        
       Then as I have indicated the jury further deliberated on the matter and eventually determined to acquit the appellant of the first count but to convict him of the second alternative count. 
        
       
     18    The point raised by the Crown Prosecutor is that the directions given by his Honour in respect of the second count were erroneous in that the distinction which his Honour drew between the two offences was that in the first the Crown had to prove the state of knowledge of the appellant that the complainant was not consenting, whereas in the second count, the indecent assault, all that the Crown had to prove was the lack of consent. However, there is no doubt that, in order for the appellant to be convicted of the indecent assault of the complainant, the Crown not only had to prove that the complainant was not consenting but also that the appellant knew that she was not consenting or was reckless to that fact: R v Bonora (1994) 35 NSWLR 74; Fitzgerald v Kennard (1995) 38 NSWLR 184. The distinction which his Honour drew between the two counts on the indictment in terms of the necessary mental element did not in fact exist. 
      
       
     19    The Crown accepts, as I have already indicated, that this would probably explain why it was that the jury were able to distinguish between the two counts on the indictment and acquitted the appellant of the first count but convicted him of the second count. There is clearly a substantial possibility of a miscarriage of justice arising from the erroneous directions. In those circumstances it is clear, as the Crown has conceded, that the conviction of the appellant cannot remain. It is also clear that the conviction should be quashed and that, in light of the nature of the offence and the sentence imposed upon the appellant, that there should be a verdict of acquittal entered and no order for a re-trial. They are the orders which I propose. 
      
       
     20    BELL J: I agree. 
      
       
     21    SMART AJ: I also agree. 
      
       
     22    BELL J: The orders of the Court will be as Howie J has proposed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
      1    SPIGELMAN : I agree with Simpson J2    SIMPSON J : This is a Crown appeal against the asserted leniency of sentences imposed upon the respondent in the District Court on 8 February 2001, following the respondent’s pleas of guilty to an indictment containing three charges, each brought under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. An additional thirteen offences, of a different kind, were taken into account under s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
      
       
     3    The three charges to which the respondent pleaded guilty were: 
      
       
       (i) supply of not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine; 
        
       (ii) conspiracy to supply not less than the commercial quantity of cannabis leaf; 
        
       (iii) supply of not less than the commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine. 
        
       
     4    All of the thirteen offences taken into account were offences under the Firearms Act 1996. Twelve involved possession of unauthorised firearms. Of these, three were shortened shotguns; one was a rifle; eight were pistols. The thirteenth offence was of possession of unauthorised ammunition. 
      
       
     5    The maximum custodial penalty applicable to the first and third counts on the indictment was (by reason of the quantity of the drug involved) imprisonment for life. The maximum custodial penalty applicable to the second count, that is possession of cannabis leaf, was imprisonment for fifteen years, again by reference to the quantity of the drug involved. It is unnecessary to mention the additional monetary penalties for which the legislation provides. 
      
       
     6    Each of the three counts of possession of shortened shotguns would, if charged separately, carry a maximum term of imprisonment for ten years. The Crown fairly conceded that each of the remaining counts potentially exposed the respondent to a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. (I describe this concession as fair because, on one view, the charges involving pistols potentially carried the same maximum penalties as the shotgun charges. In my view it is appropriate in accordance with the Crown concession, to work on the basis that the relevant maximum penalty was, in relation to each of these offences, five years.) The maximum penalty applicable to an offence of unauthorised possession of ammunition is a monetary one. 
      
       
     7    The sentencing judge imposed identical sentences on each of the three counts on the indictment. These were imprisonment for five years with a non-parole period of three years and nine months. In sentencing on the second count (the cannabis leaf count, carrying a statutory maximum of fifteen years) he took the s 33 offences into account. The Crown contends that these sentences were manifestly inadequate and, in particular, contends that they reflect that no proper consideration was given to the offences taken into account. It will be necessary to consider these contentions below. 
      
       
        
       Facts 
        
       
     8    The indictment specified 9 June 1998 as the date on which the first offence on the indictment was committed, and 1 April and 20 June 1998 as the dates between which the second and third offences on the indictment were committed. 20 June 1998 was specified as the date on which all the Firearms Act offences were committed. 
      
       
     9    A statement of facts placed before the sentencing judge by agreement outlined briefly the circumstances of the offences on the indictment and the respondent’s involvement in them. Two other men, beside the respondent, were identified as subjects of the investigation that led to the respondent’s arrest. One of the men was said to be the person on whose instructions the respondent acted.  
      
       
     10    Over a period in 1998 police maintained surveillance on a garage in Drummoyne. It was being used as a “safe house” for drugs, guns and chemicals. The respondent was observed coming to and going from the garage to which he had easy access. On a number of occasions he delivered to or removed from the premises drugs or chemicals.  
      
       
        
       Count 1 
        
       
     11    On 9 June 1998 the respondent delivered to the garage seven plastic bags containing in total 2.39 kilograms of methylamphetamine. Two days later he removed at least one of the bags. 
      
       
        
       Count 2 
        
       
     12    Also contained in bags in the garage were more 34.166 kilograms of cannabis leaf, the subject of the second charge. Over a period the respondent removed four of the bags. He drove to Pyrmont, where he met two co-offenders, into whose car he transferred the cannabis. 
      
       
        
       Count 3 
        
       
     13    On 1 June 1998 the respondent took from the garage a bag containing 10 kilograms of pseudoephedrine. Between that date and 20 June he took away two drums each containing 25 kilograms of the same drug. 
      
       
     14    Even on this short account of the facts, it is obvious that the enterprise was a major drug operation, and a sophisticated and organised one. It was appropriate, if the evidence permitted it, for the sentencing judge to determine the role played by the respondent in the enterprise: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270. 
      
       
        
       Subjective circumstances 
        
       
     15    The respondent did not give sworn evidence. He did, however, through his wife and others, present a favourable subjective case. He was born on 14 June 1961, and was thirty-seven years of age at the time of his involvement in the offences. He has been married since 1996 and has one daughter, born in 1998, to whom he is devoted. He retains the wholehearted support of his wife. He and his wife had experienced financial difficulties as a result of his wife’s having ceased work pending the birth of the child. There was some impressive evidence of community involvement by the respondent, particularly in relation to football coaching. His wife believed that he may have become involved in the offences because of his undue willingness to help others out. There was a favourable pre-sentence report which reviewed the respondent’s history. 
      
       
     16    He had a previous criminal history of some relevance, although rather aged. In 1989 he was convicted of possession of an unlicensed pistol, receiving, conspiracy to rob whilst in company and armed, possession of means to disguise face, and two counts of larceny of motor vehicles. After appeal, he was sentenced to a minimum term of three years and three months with an additional term of two years and nine months. 
      
       
        
       The sentencing regime enacted in the  
       Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
        
       
     17    By s 45 and Schedule 1 to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine is 250 grams. For this offence imprisonment for twenty years is the prescribed maximum penalty. A large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, exposing an offender to life imprisonment, is 1 kilogram. The quantity involved in the offence to which the respondent pleaded guilty was 2.39 kilograms. 
      
       
     18    A commercial quantity of cannabis leaf is 25 kilograms. Such an offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for fifteen years. A commercial quantity of cannabis leaf is 100 kilograms, carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty years. The respondent admitted an offence involving 34.166 kilograms, about double the commercial quantity, but less than half a large commercial quantity. 
      
       
     19    A commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine is 1.25 kilograms, and, like a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty years. A large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine is 5 kilograms, carrying life imprisonment. The amount of this drug in the respondent’s possession was 60 kilograms. 
      
       
     20    Although in the indictment to which the respondent pleaded guilty the Crown specified a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine and pseudoephedrine, the amount of drug actually involved in each of these offences constituted a large commercial quantity, exposing the respondent in each case to life imprisonment. It was on this basis that the sentencing judge sentenced the respondent. The Crown relies on the decision of this court in R v Lee (1994) 76 A Crim R 271 to support that approach, and no argument to the contrary was advanced on behalf of the respondent. 
      
       
        
       The s 33 offences 
        
       
     21    Only a bare outline of the facts of the s 33 charges was provided. That showed that, during the course of the surveillance of the Drummoyne garage, police covertly entered, pursuant to a search warrant. Inter alia, they located three bags containing the gun, ammunition and radio scanners. All items were left in the garage and constant surveillance was maintained. Nobody except the respondent was seen to enter over a four week period.  
      
       
        
       The Crown appeal 
        
       
     22    As orally argued, the Crown appeal focused primarily on the manner in which the sentencing judge approached the s 33 offences. It is convenient here to set out the relevant subsections of s 33:  
      
       
        
         
         33. Outstanding charges may be taken into account 
           
          
         (1) When dealing with the offender for the principal offence, the court is to ask the offender whether the offender wants the court to take any further offences into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence.  
          
         (2) The court may take a further offence into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence:  
          
         (a) if the offender:  
          
         (i) admits guilt to the further offence, and  
          
         (ii) indicates that the offender wants the court to take the further offence into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence, and  
          
         (b) if, in all of the circumstances, the court considers it appropriate to do so.  
          
         (3) If the court takes a further offence into account, the penalty imposed on the offender for the principal offence must not exceed the maximum penalty that the court could have imposed for the principal offence had the further offence not been taken into account.  
          
         (4) A court may not take a further offence into account:  
          
         (a) if the offence is of a kind for which the court has no jurisdiction to impose a penalty, or  
          
         (b) if the offence is an indictable offence that is punishable with imprisonment for life. 
         
        
       
     23    The Crown argument was founded on the proposition that it would be wrong in principle to approach sentencing as though the s 33 procedure was merely a device to enable an offender to clear the slate of outstanding charges or previous offences without suffering any additional penalty. So much is well established. A judge sentencing for an offence in relation to which he or she is asked to take into account additional offences should give due recognition to the gravity of those offences: R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368; R v Barton [2001] NSWCCA 63, unreported, 5 March 2001; R v Bavadra [2000] NSWCCA 292; 115 A Crim R 152 
      
       
     24    Morgan was decided under the forerunner of s 33, s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Its terms were not substantially or relevantly different. Hunt CJ at CL repeated a previous criticism (R v Vougdis (1989) 41 A Crim R 125, per Yeldham J) of the Crown where it consents to a serious offence being taken into account rather than being separately charged. Having said that, his Honour added: 
      
       
        
         
         “But, such an offence having been taken into account on this occasion, the whole situation had to be considered - both the murder and the armed robbery with striking . … The only limitation upon the penalty to be imposed when dealing with matters to be taken into account pursuant to s 21 of the  
         Criminal Procedure Act  
         1986 (NSW) is, as s 21(3) says, that the penalty must not exceed the maximum penalty which the court would have been empowered to impose if no other offence had been taken into account … Whatever the practice may have been before  
         Vougdis  
         it is wrong in principle that there should only ever be little by way of addition to the penalty imposed upon the offence charged when another offence is taken into account pursuant to s 21 ..."" 
         
        
       
     25    In Barton Spigelman CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express position in sub s 33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another.” 
         
        
       
     26    And in Bavadra, Wood CJ at CL said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[31] There is a considerable advantage to the administration of justice, and to accused persons, for a party facing sentence to clean up the record. For that purpose the Form 1 procedure is beneficial. The objective of individual rehabilitation can be advanced by its use, since the offender does not face the prospect of further trials. There is a utilitarian value in the admission of guilt that is involved so far as there can be a saving of the resources of the law enforcement agencies and the courts concerned. Additionally, the sentencing judge is placed in a position where it is possible to sentence the offender for the totality of his or her outstanding criminality to that point. However, unless proper weight is given to the additional offences that have been disclosed, this procedure fails its true purpose.” 
         
        
       
     27    Different views have been expressed in this court as to the approach to be taken to sentencing in these circumstances, and to the benefit (if any) an offender receives as a consequence of the use of the procedure, as distinct from being charged with and pleading guilty to each individual offence. In R v Lemene [2001] NSWCCA 5; 118 A Crim R 131, I expressed the view that an offender who adopts the procedure is entitled to expect an additional penalty significantly less than would have been imposed had separate charges been prosecuted; if that were not so then the section would provide no incentive for the use of the procedure, which is administratively convenient both to the prosecution and to the courts and must therefore be implemented in such a way as to afford some benefit to an offender. Hulme J, with whom Barr J agreed, expressed a different view in R v Dawson [2000] NSWCCA 399, unreported 18 December. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[50] It was asserted by Mr Byrne, senior counsel who appeared for the applicant that one of the purposes of s 21 was to enable an offender’s slate to be wiped clean and, perhaps as an inducement to have this done, the practice in the sentencing courts was to impose substantially less by way of penalty for matters taken into account than would occur if they were included in an indictment. To the extent to which the application to have matters taken into account amounts to an acknowledgment of guilt and any punishment for them and the offence charged must reflect principles of totality, it is of course proper that the penalty imposed for matters taken into account be less than if those matters had stood alone as individual and lone charges. Often the operation of the principle of totality may have the effect that relatively little is added for the charges taken into account. 
         
        
        
         
         However, subject to the limits imposed by s 21 itself, (now replaced by s 33 of the  
         Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
          1999) it seems to me that there is no basis in either the statute or logic to justify a general approach of treating matters taken into account as thereby meriting a lower penalty than had they been the subject of specific charge. If the practice of sentencing courts is as Mr Byrne asserts, it is in my view, wrong.” 
         
        
       
     28    The opinion I stated in Lemene appears to me to be consistent with that expressed by Wood CJ at CL (with whom Beazley JA and Greg James J agreed) in R v Bavadra at [31].  
      
       
     29    However, the fact that implementing the s 33 procedure might result in some benefit to the offender does not have the necessary consequence that no additional punishment will be imposed in respect of the offences dealt with in that way. In Bavadra, Wood CJ at CL said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[30] When serious offences are included in a Form 1, the sentence imposed, in respect of the count for which they are taken into account, must reflect the totality of the criminal involvement. It is not the case that Form 1 offences need only be noted in passing, or that little by way of additional penalty should be imposed by reason of their existence:  
         Morgan 
          …” 
         
        
       
     30    A particular difficulty confronts sentencing judges where the additional offences are numerous or very serious. The only restriction placed upon the sentencing judge is that the sentence imposed for the offence in relation to which the additional offence is (or offences are) taken into account must not exceed the: 
      
       
        
         
         “maximum penalty that the court could have imposed for the principal offence had the further offence not been taken into account.” 
         
        
       
     31    In this court an argument was floated (rather half heartedly, it seemed to me) that the phrase “the maximum penalty that the court could have imposed” in sub s (3) might mean something other than the statutorily prescribed maximum for the offence charged; for example, it might mean the maximum sentence that might properly be imposed for the offence having regard to all objective and subjective circumstances: in other words, as I understood the suggestion, the sentence that would represent the top of the range of sentences properly available in the exercise of sentencing discretion. In my opinion, that argument should be firmly rejected. The relevant words in sub s (3) should be taken to be a reference to the statutory maximum for the offence charged.  
      
       
     32    It has not been the practice in sentencing where additional offences are taken into account to identify any increase in the sentence imposed. This appeal, like others before it, raises the question whether any increase, by reason of the additional offence or offences, in the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, ought to be quantified. As the question was not fully argued, and as to require such a change to established sentencing practice might have implications not presently apparent, I would not now suggest a modification to the procedure generally followed. However, lack of quantification of any such increase leaves it unclear whether, and if so to what extent, the sentence was increased. In my opinion it would be appropriate to reconsider the approach taken to sentencing in these circumstances, if for no other reason than to achieve consistency. If the Crown is to persist in what appears to me to be its present practice (and I do not suggest that it should not - it has clear advantages for the administration of justice, not only economic, but in relieving witnesses of the ordeal and inconvenience of giving evidence) then sentencing judges are entitled to guidance as to the principles to be applied. 
      
       
     33    Senior counsel for the respondent also drew attention to a decision of Zelling J in the Supreme Court of South Australia: Flentjar v Daire (1983) 32 SASR 101. Zelling J was dealing with an appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed by a court of summary jurisdiction in relation to a number of charges, where the appellant had asked that four further offences be taken into account under the South Australian equivalent procedure. His Honour said:  
      
       
        
         
         “My own procedure, when I have been asked to take other offences into account, is that unless I am told in complete detail about the other offences that I am asked to take into account which has never so far happened is not to increase the sentence because of those other offences but to treat the other offences asked to be taken into account as matters counterweighing those which might otherwise have gone in reduction of sentence, as for example in the instant case the accu`sed’s pleas of guilty in terms of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the  
         Queen v Shannon  
         [(1979) 21 SASR 442]. 
         
        
       
     34    This court was invited to adopt the same approach, an invitation I would reject. It is, in any event, inconsistent with pronouncements of this court in Vougdis, Morgan, Barton and Bavadra.  Further, Zelling J went on to say: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am of the same opinion as Wells J in  
         Reiner’s  
         case [(1974) 8 SASR 102, at p116] where he said: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘It would, for example, be undesirable, in my opinion, to charge one breaking and entering offence as representative when there were several others alleged with respect to as many different premises; each of such breakings constitutes a new sortie into criminal conduct, and should be separately charged and taken into consideration according to established procedures.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Accordingly if the learned special magistrate imposed a higher sentence in the case of the offence at the home of Mr Parkin than he would otherwise have imposed, because of the other four counts of house breaking asked to be taken into account by the appellant, I cannot say that he was wrong in law in so doing although it is a practice that I do not follow myself.” 
         
        
       
     35    The procedure formerly provided by s 21 of Criminal Procedure Act 1986, now by s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, appears to me to have been used with increasing prevalence, both as to numbers of offences, and gravity of offences. In the present case, the suggestion that the firearms offences were available only to rebut favourable or mitigating circumstances, is, in my opinion, quite wrong. The penalty imposed had to include some recognition (by way of increased penalty) to accommodate the very serious offences taken into account.  
      
       
     36    In this case the decision by the Crown to have the Firearms Act offences dealt with by the s 33 procedure added to the level of complexity in sentencing the respondent. The firearms offences, though plainly related to the drugs offences, were of an entirely different kind. That made factoring them into the sentence imposed in relation to the cannabis leaf charge rather artificial. 
      
       
     37    The starting point of the Crown argument was that the gravity of the Firearms Act offences was not reflected in the sentence imposed on the cannabis leaf charge, in relation to which they were said to have been taken into account. In support of this argument, counsel for the Crown referred to the decision of this court in R v Thurgar (1999) 51 A Crim R 109 at 113. There Gleeson CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “As the learned judge observed, the offence of possessing an unlicensed pistol is one that can cover a very wide range of circumstances. … Plainly, a person may be in possession of an unlicensed pistol in circumstances which call for a light penalty, or even no penalty at all. The failure to have a licence might result from pure inadvertence, or accident, and the possession might in every other respect be completely innocent. On the other hand, the legislature clearly contemplated that there were circumstances in which possession of an unlicensed pistol might warrant a lengthy term of imprisonment. Subject to an important qualification that will be mentioned below, … the most obvious circumstance calling for the imposition of a penalty at the higher end of the range would be one relating to the purpose for which such a weapon was possessed. In particular, and again subject to the qualification to be mentioned below, the possession of such a pistol for a purpose connected with proposed criminal activities would be likely to be the kind of thing that would lead to the imposition of a penalty close to the maximum.” 
         
        
        
       [The qualification to which his Honour referred concerned circumstances appertaining particularly to the case there under consideration. The appellant had been charged with conspiracy to murder, but convicted of a charge of possession of an unlicensed pistol. Because of the acquittal, and the principle stated in  
       R v De Simoni 
        (1981) 147 CLR 383, the appellant in that case could not be sentenced on the basis that his purpose for possessing the unlicensed pistol was related to a conspiracy, or intention, to murder.] 
        
       
     38    That qualification has no application in the present case, although, of course, if the respondent were being sentenced for the firearms offences, he could not, in accordance with De Simoni principles be sentenced as though he had committed a more serious offence than the offence charged, or an aggravated form of that offence. As was pointed out by counsel for the Crown, there is no legitimate purpose in the possession of a sawn-off shotgun, even if it were possible to hypothesise a legitimate purpose for the possession of the other guns. 
      
       
     39    It was against this background that counsel for the Crown argued that the sentences, but in particular the sentence imposed in relation to the second count, failed adequately to reflect the gravity of the s 33 offences. 
      
       
     40    This court was provided with statistics maintained by the NSW Judicial Commission in relation to sentencing for the offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of not less than a large commercial quantity of amphetamines. 68 percent of offenders were sentenced to full terms of five years or more; 51 percent to minimum or fixed terms of four years or more. Of course, these statistics do not disclose whether the offender was being sentenced, as was the respondent, for a variety of offences, nor do they disclose any of the other objective or subjective circumstances. Certainly, at face value, they suggest that the total term imposed upon the respondent was toward the lower end of the available range; and the minimum term (being less than four years) was also in the lower range of sentences. 
      
       
     41    No similar statistics in relation to conspiracy to supply not less than the commercial quantity of cannabis leaf were provided. That sentence is of considerable significance because it was in respect of this charge that the additional offences were taken into account. It is important to remember that the maximum sentence available in relation to that charge was imprisonment for fifteen years, and yet the sentence imposed was identical to the sentences imposed in relation to the two offences which carried a maximum of life imprisonment. This does suggest that some weight was given to the firearms offences. If that were not so, then it could be expected that the cannabis leaf sentence would have been significantly less than the other two sentences, in order to reflect the substantially lesser maximum penalty. 
      
       
     42    I am, therefore, not satisfied that the sentencing judge omitted to take those offences into account. 
      
       
     43    Even so, in my opinion, having regard to the totality of the respondent’s offending, the overall sentences were very lenient. While a total term of five years, with a non parole period of three years and nine months may have been an acceptable sentence in relation to any one of the charges (including the cannabis leaf count, taking into account the firearms offences), I have come to the view that, for the combination of offences, the sentences were unduly lenient.  
      
       
     44    Against the possibility that the court might take such a view, senior counsel for the respondent drew attention to the familiar decisions of the High Court in Griffiths v R  (1977) 137 CLR 293 and R v Everett (1994) 181 CLR 295. It is unnecessary to restate the principles derived from these cases. They place a brake on Crown appeals. 
      
       
     45    This court retains a discretion, even when undue leniency has been demonstrated, to dismiss a Crown appeal. 
      
       
     46    In order to support a final argument that that discretion ought be exercised in favour of the respondent, an affidavit sworn by his solicitor was tendered. He recounted a conversation with the Area Manager of the prison where the respondent is serving his sentence, in which the respondent was described as “an exceptional inmate”, “in a trusted position, working as Officers Amenities Sweeper”, and maintaining the gym equipment, “an above standard worker, polite, complies with all prison rules”. This material tends to reinforce the evidence of rehabilitation that was put before the sentencing judge.  
      
       
     47    Although I remain of the view that, having regard to the total criminality demonstrated by the respondent, the seriousness of the offences, and the period of time over which he was involved, I have concluded that this is an appropriate case in which to exercise the residual discretion to dismiss a Crown appeal notwithstanding manifest inadequacy of sentence. Accordingly, I propose that the Crown appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     48    EINFELD AJ : I agree with Simpson J.

       Paul Henry JOHNSON v Judge PHELAN and DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (NSW) 
       
       
       
      The claimant, a litigant in person, seeks an order directing Judge Phelan to state a case for the Court of Criminal Appeal with respect to his District Court criminal proceedings. The offences for which the claimant was convicted in the District Court arose out of a Community Service Order issued in 1996, and the claimant’s arrest in 1997 for an alleged breach of such. The claimant submitted to the Court that as the Community Service Order had expired more than one month prior to his arrest, the execution of the warrant for his arrest was unlawful. The major issue in the appeal was the meaning of the word ‘proceedings’ in s 23 of the  
      Community Service Orders Act  
      1979.  
       
       
      Per Priestley, Meagher and Stein JJA: 
       
       
      1) The phrase ‘proceedings for an offence’ as found in s 23 of the  
      Community Service Orders Act  
      1979 does not refer to the actual arrest, but to the laying of the information for breach of the Community Service Order.

       Paul Henry JOHNSON v Judge PHELAN and DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (NSW) 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
       
     1    PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with Stein JA. 
     2    MEAGHER JA: I agree with Stein JA.3    STEIN JA: The claimant, Paul Henry Johnson, a litigant in person, seeks an order directing Judge Phelan, the first opponent, to state a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal with respect to the claimant’s District Court criminal appeal proceedings. The second opponent is the Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP). 4    In order to understand the submissions, it is necessary to set out some of the background of the matter. On 28 March 1996 the claimant was convicted in Wollongong Local Court for ‘drive manner dangerous’. A Community Service Order of 200 hours was imposed, and he was disqualified from driving for 3 years. The claimant was also convicted on that date of ‘malicious damage’, the sentence for which was deferred under the then s 558 of the Crimes Act 1900. The claimant entered a self- recognizance in the amount of $300, to be of good behaviour for two years. The recognizance was conditioned upon his accepting the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service for such period as deemed necessary. The claimant was also ordered to pay compensation in the sum of $2,226.19 to the Police Department within twelve months.5    On 25 September 1996 an information was laid at the Wollongong Local Court by Rhonda Freestone of the Probation and Parole Service. Within its heading, the document refers to s 23 of Act 192 of 1979 (the Community Service Orders Act 1979). The information alleged that the claimant had ‘failed without reasonable cause or excuse to comply with any requirement made by the Community Service Orders Act’. The information stated that the reason for his failure to comply was a ‘Reluctance To Finish The Work Assigned To Him & Unsuitability To Continue Work Order Due to Undocumented Medical Condition & Aggressive Attitude Towards Work Placements And The Conditions Of This Order’. The information continued to the effect that a Justice should proceed to issue a warrant for the claimant’s apprehension. 
     6    On the same day the informant sought and obtained the issue of a warrant for the apprehension of the claimant in order to bring him before a Magistrate to answer the allegation that he breached the CSO. 
     7    A further information was laid at the Wollongong Local Court on 14 October 1996 by William Bourke of the Probation and Parole Service. It alleged that the claimant had ‘failed to comply with a condition of the said recognizance, in that: Failed to keep an appointment on 24.6.96. Not complying with CSO. Present whereabouts unknown.’ The document continued: 
      
       
        
        AND I the undersigned Magistrate being satisfied by the information on oath that the said offender has failed to observe the condition of the recognizance: These are therefore to command you in Her majesty’s name forthwith to apprehend and bring to said offender before the Court to be further dealt with according to law. 
        
       
     8    On 13 August 1997, after receiving information that the claimant had returned to the area and was living in his car at Wombarra, police went to the area. They informed the claimant of the existence of the warrants and of their intention to arrest him. After what the second opponent describes as a ‘stand off’, the claimant walked away from the police.  
     9    On 15 August 1997, two police officers again went to Wombarra with the intention of arresting the claimant. Phelan DCJ, during the hearing of the appeals, found that the claimant was abusive towards the police from the outset, and that the claimant then ‘picked up a large stick from the ground and lifted it in a threatening manner… He began to walk towards Senior Constable Baird who had to retreat. He then approached the other officer with a stick held over his head… The [claimant] then picked up a steering lock which he held in one hand and a stick in the other. He said, “Come near me and I will kill you”. He then went into the nearby cemetery. A subsequent search failed to locate him’. 10    On 18 August 1997 police returned to Wombarra to arrest the claimant. According to police he was informed that he was under arrest under two outstanding warrants, and was asked to put down the stick he was holding. He ran from the police and hid within the cemetery, and when located he threatened the police by swinging the stick at them. He was then tackled, at which time be struggled violently, kicking and punching at the arresting officers. He was eventually subdued and taken to Wollongong Police Station where he was charged. When being transferred into the custody of Corrective Services, he refused to submit to a strip search and became aggressive. He allegedly spat at one of the Corrective Services Officers, striking him in the eye and mouth area. 11    The claimant was charged with common assault with respect to the Corrective Services Officer, with two counts of ‘assault police’ with respect to the events of 15 August 1997, and with assaulting police and resisting arrest on 18 August 1997.  
     12    On 14 October 1997, the claimant was before the Local Court with respect to the alleged breaches of the Community Service Order and recognizance. However, the Magistrate directed that no action be taken with regard to the alleged breaches of the Order and recognizance. The power of the Court to take no action is derived from s 25(1)(d) of the Community Service Orders Act (the Act) by reason of the expiry of the Order. 
     13    At the hearing of the summons, the claimant was under the impression that the Magistrate said that because the CSO had expired, the order was automatically revoked, therefore there was no breach of the CSO and the claimant was found not guilty. However, this was from the Claimant’s memory only without the benefit of the transcript.14    Once the transcript was obtained by the DPP, it became clear that the Claimant’s recollection was incorrect. The Magistrate in fact said ‘Order expired 27 March 1997. No action taken to revoke order’. He did not find that the Claimant had not breached the CSO. Indeed, it appears that he said to the Claimant: 
      
       
        
        So in effect Mr Johnson what’s happened is, you’ve got away with doing sixty and a quarter hours instead of 200. That’s the end of the Community Service Order matter. 
        
       
      15    On 23 July 1998 Mr Lyon, Magistrate convicted the claimant of common assault and imposed a fine of $750. The claimant appealed to the District Court. Mr Still, Magistrate convicted the claimant of two counts of ‘assault police’ on 13 October 1998 and imposed s 558 recognizances in the sum of $500 to be of good behaviour for two years and accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. The claimant appealed to the District Court. On 14 October 1998 Mr Maloney, Magistrate convicted the claimant of ‘resist arrest’ and ‘assault police’ and imposed two further recognizances in the sum of $500 to be of good behaviour for 12 months. The claimant appealed to the District Court. 
     16    All of the claimant’s appeals to the District Court were heard over several days in 1999 and 2000 by Judge Phelan. He reserved his decision in all matters and judgment was given on 19 October 2000. The claimant achieved a modicum of success. With respect to the conviction for common assault, his Honour found the offence proven but ordered that no conviction be recorded, and dismissed the appeal. Appeals were upheld and the convictions quashed with respect to five charges of assault police, assault special constable and resist arrest. On the remaining charges of assaulting police and resisting arrest, his Honour dismissed the appeals, and found the offences proven. Convictions were recorded but in lieu of the sentences imposed by the Local Courts, the claimant was to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 12 months for each offence. 17    After convictions were recorded by Phelan DCJ the claimant indicated that he wished to appeal. He maintains that his Honour indicated to him that the only way to do so was to ask him to state case to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The transcript does not indicate that such a conversation, in the terms claimed, took place. In any event, the claimant lodged a document seeking that a case be stated by his Honour on 14 November 2000, and was advised of Phelan DCJ’s response that the District Court was functus officio and accordingly a case could not be stated. The claimant then filed a summons in the Court of Appeal on 21 February 2001. The second opponent was joined into the summons on 15 March 2001, and was represented at the hearing by Ms Langley. The first opponent filed a submitting appearance.18    The hearing concentrated upon the claimant’s submission that the execution of the warrants for his arrest was unlawful. He referred the court to s 23 of the Act which provides:  
      
       
        
        (1) If a person in respect of whom a community service order is in force fails, without reasonable cause or excuse, to comply with the order or with any requirement made by or under this Act or the regulations in respect of the order, the person shall be guilty of an offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Proceedings for an offence under subsection (1) in respect of a community service order shall be brought in accordance with section 24. 
         
         
        (3) Notwithstanding section 56(1) of the Justices Act 1902 proceedings for an offence under subsection (1) in respect of a community service order shall not be commenced at any time later than one month after the order ceased to be in force. 
        
       
     19    It is convenient also to set out s 24 of the Act. 
      
       
        
        If it appears on complaint in writing to a justice that a person in respect of whom a community service order is in force has failed, without reasonable cause or excuse, to comply with the order or with any requirement made by or under this Act or the regulations in respect of the order, the justice may issue a summons requiring the person to appear before the supervising court at the time specified in the summons or may, if the complaint is in writing and on oath, issue a warrant for the arrest of the person and directing that the person be brought before the supervising court as soon as possible after the person’s arrest. 
        
       
     20    The claimant argued that as the relevant community service order had expired on 27 March 1997, by virtue of s 16(2)(a) of the Act, and since his arrest on 18 August 1997 was some three and half months outside of the one month period referred to in s 23(3), it was unlawful. He submitted to the court that the ‘proceedings’ referred to in s 23 were his arrest, and therefore the execution of the warrants was unlawful as being out of time. This would obviously have implications for his convictions for resisting arrest and assaulting police.21    On behalf of the DPP, Ms Langley submitted that when read as a whole, and with reference to s 24, the legislature intended that ‘proceedings’ would refer not to the actual arrest of the claimant, but to the laying of the information for breach of the Community Service Order and issue of a warrant for arrest. The laying of the informations and issue of warrants for arrest occurred on 25 September and 14 October 1996 respectively, at which time the Community Service Order was still in force. The proceeding was thereby appropriate and lawful under the Act. 
     22    The point of commencement of criminal proceedings was discussed in R v Hull (1989) 16 NSWLR 385, a matter in which a similar provision to s 23(3) of the Act was at issue. Gleeson CJ said that criminal proceedings ordinarily commence when one of three courses of action, or methods, are undertaken. He described these at 390 as being: 
      
       
        
        In serious cases it is common for the proceedings to be commenced by arrests without warrant. A person who has been arrested must be taken before a magistrate without delay. The arrested person may be questioned and then charged. A second method involves the issue by a justice of a warrant for the arrest of a person where an information has been sworn before a justice. Such an information, which is usually laid by a police officer or other law enforcement official, will then result in an issue of a warrant. A third method, which can be used whether the offence in question is indictable or summary, involves the issue by a justice of a summons requiring the appearance in court of the person named in the information. The summons sets out the offence that the person in question is alleged to have committed and requires the person to attend court to answer the allegation.  
        
       
       
      Grove and Studdert JJ agreed. See also  
      Allerton v DPP 
       (1991) 24 NSWLR 550 at 557. 
       
     23    Here the proceedings were commenced by the second method described by Gleeson CJ. The informations were laid before Justices by members of the Probation and Parole Service, and warrants were issued as a result. It was these actions, not the arrest of the claimant, which constituted the ‘proceedings for an offence’ under s 23 of the Act. It is plain that the procedure followed was in accordance with the requirements of s 24 of the Act.24    Although the claimant is quite certain that his interpretation of s 23 is correct, his construction is plainly wrong. In any event, it is not apparent that the claimant’s contentions, assuming them to be correct, run to the information and warrant of 14 October 1996 regarding the alleged breach of the recognizance under s 558 of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     25    As a result, it is not necessary to consider the DPP’s contention that since Phelan DCJ had made final orders, he no longer had jurisdiction to state a case. However, this submission also appears to be correct in light of Elliot v Williams (1985) 15 A Crim R 437 and DPP v Cassell (1995) 80 A Crim R 160. 
     26    Accordingly, the summons of the claimant should be dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
       
     1   WOOD CJ AT CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence of seven and a half years, with a non parole period of five and a half years, imposed by Studdert J, following a plea of guilty to manslaughter. That sentence was imposed on 31 August 2000, and was backdated to commence from 22 August 1999, that being the date upon which the applicant was arrested, pursuant to a warrant, following breach of his bail conditions. 
      
       
      FACTS 
       
     2   The victim, Adam Holbrough, was the eight month old son of the applicant’s partner. On the morning of 26 September 1996, Adam was left in the applicant’s care while his mother went to the shops. At about 9.30am the applicant summonsed an ambulance to the home. The boy was found to have stopped breathing and to have no pulse. He was taken to Bathurst Hospital after being resuscitated and later transferred to Westmead Childrens Hospital. His life was pronounced extinct on the following day. Post mortem examination disclosed bleeding in two layers over the brain together with retinal haemorrhage, along with some bruising. Death was attributed to severe shaking of the infant with repeated bending forwards and backwards of the head. 
     3   The applicant gave various accounts to the child’s mother, to a treating doctor, and to police, of the circumstances in which the infant came to suffer the fatal injuries. They were not all consistent, but in various ways they suggested that he had shaken the boy in a panic after finding him coughing or vomiting. The version of events which the applicant later gave to Dr Lucas was more incriminating in so far as he acknowledged that he had shaken the boy when he would not stop crying after his mother left the home. 
     4   The plea of guilty was based upon the applicant’s acknowledgment that he had shaken the boy in a manner that was entirely inappropriate having regard to his infancy, in circumstances amounting to manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. His Honour accepted that there was no suggestion of premeditation, and he expressly excluded from consideration the suspicion that other earlier injuries found at the post mortem examination, which appeared to have pre-dated 26 September, had been caused by the applicant. However, he did take into account, when assessing the objective criminality involved, the fact that the applicant had been convicted in 1994 in the Local Court, at Katoomba, of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm to his natural daughter, Jayde, when she was but seven weeks old. The injuries occasioned to this child were also consistent with the shaken baby syndrome. 
     5   This was taken into account, his Honour made clear, not by way of additionally punishing the applicant for the earlier offence, but upon the basis that this occurrence ought to have heightened the applicant’s awareness as to the dangers associated with the rough handling of an infant, and in particular with shaking a child. 
     6   Upon the basis of Dr Lucas’ report, his Honour found that the applicant had difficulty in controlling his temper and that it was in such a state that he shook Adam so violently as to cause the injuries which led to his death. 
     7   The applicant was twenty six years old when he appeared for sentence and had a criminal record which began as a juvenile and included many convictions for offences of dishonesty, including offences of break enter and steal. His parents had separated when he was a baby and he had then lived with his mother and sister in Katoomba until he was twelve. He then went to live with his father in Pennsylvania before returning to Australia to complete his secondary schooling. He had not entered into any steady employment and he began to drink heavily in 1990 and took up the use of marijuana and amphetamines. Dr. Lucas found that he did not suffer from any major psychiatric disorder, but suggested that his disruptive upbringing, his emotional deprivation and his lack of family stability were psycho-social factors that contributed to the offence, in so far as they had caused him difficulty in managing relationships and his temper. 
     8   It was to his credit, his Honour observed, that he appeared to have recognised his temper problems and had been seeing a psychologist whilst in prison. His prospects of rehabilitation were accepted as reasonable and he was found to have accepted responsibility for what he had done, and to be deeply regretful for it. 
     9   In sentencing the applicant, his Honour expressly stated his plea of guilty would be taken into account in his favour, and that the case would be treated as one in which the applicant had acted promptly to plead guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter once the opportunity to do so was presented to him in early 2000. The position in that regard is a little complex, in that the applicant had been committed for trial on a charge of manslaughter in the District Court. A trial date was fixed for 12 February 1998, but the date was vacated through no fault of the applicant. On 27 May 1998, the Director of Public Prosecutions presented an ex-officio indictment for murder and the venue was changed to the Supreme Court. The applicant was refused bail from 10 May 1998 to 15 June 1998, when he was released to conditional bail. He did not appear for arraignment on 23 March 1999, and he was then arrested on the warrant previously mentioned. On 1 October 1999, a trial date was set for 22 May 2000, with an estimate of four to six weeks. This was an assessment which, on the face of the record and the likely issues, would appear to have been somewhat excessive. However, it appears to have been accepted by his Honour and it would be inappropriate for this Court to proceed on any other basis. 
     10   His Honour noted these circumstances, along with his assessment that the Crown case was a strong one. That assessment was clearly correct. As was accepted by Mr Boulten of counsel today, the plea was in truth an acceptance of the inevitable. It would have been inappropriate for his Honour to have linked the strength of the Crown case to the utilitarian value of the plea: see Lo (2001) NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 271. There is, however, no reason to suppose that his Honour fell into error in that regard. In particular, his Honour found that considerable Court time and expense had been saved, and that the inconvenience and distress of witnesses and jurors had been avoided. Mindful of the guideline judgment in Thomson & Houlton, (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 a discount of “approximately 10%” was given for the plea. 
     11   His Honour also noted that the applicant had been in protection and also in strict custody and that it could be likely that he would have to serve his sentence on protection. This, it was accepted, would add to the burdensome nature of his imprisonment. 
     12   Special circumstances were found in the need for the applicant to have a substantial period of post release supervision with counselling, to assist in his rehabilitation and in the avoidance of further drug abuse, sufficient to “warrant a slight adjustment to the ratio set by S 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999”. The adjustment so given involved a reduction of the ratio from 75% to 73% equivalent to a reduction of 1.5 months, leaving a period of potential release on parole of two years. 
     13   The applicant has addressed three grounds of challenge: 
      
       
      Insufficient weight given to the plea of guilty 
       
     14   It was submitted that a discount of “approximately 10%”, which I take in the circumstances to have included a few points above that figure rather than below it, was a very modest discount for a plea of guilty which had a considerable utilitarian value and which reflected contrition. Rather than 10%, it was contended by reference to Lo that a discount should have been given in the order of 15% or thereabouts. In this regard it is important to remember what was said in Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, by Spigelman CJ at paras 153-154: 
      
       
        
        “153 The determination of where, within such a range, the discount should fall within a particular case is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge. 
         
         
        154. There are however two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case: 
         
          
           
          (i) the time at which a plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of a trial. 
           
           
          the complexity of the issue about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea. 
          
         
        
       
     15    
      
       
        
        154. The top of the range would be accepted to be restricted to pleas at the earliest possible opportunity and should not be given save in an exceptional case after a matter has been set down for trial. A discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for late pleas; e.g. on the date fixed for trial, unless there are particular facts arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial.” 
        
       
     16   As Studdert J observed in the present case, the applicant did have an opportunity to plead guilty in the District Court, but did not do so. Moreover, once the ex officio indictment was presented, he absconded. It is true that the discount given was at the very bottom of the suggested range and that the plea had a utilitarian value. However, in the circumstances earlier outlined, it was more properly categorised as a late plea and as one that potentially called for a lesser discount than an earlier plea. In this regard it is not to be overlooked that the 10% to 25% suggested in Thomson & Houlton do not constitute bright lines. Rather, they reflect a range which does not call for precise mathematical application. I am not persuaded that a discount in excess of one which would answer the description of “approximately 10%” was, in the special circumstances of this case, required. Additionally, I am of the view that any greater discount would have resulted in a sentence that was manifestly lenient. 
     17   It is to be recalled that this Court intervenes only where it reaches the conclusion that the sentencing order as a whole resulted in error; that is, that some sentence other than that imposed should have been imposed. This is not such a case. 
      
       
      Insufficient allowance for periods spent in Protective and Strict Custody 
       
     18   It is the fact, as Kirby J pointed out in AB (1999) 73 ALJR 1385 at 1408, that every year in protective custody is equivalent to a significantly longer loss of liberty under the ordinary conditions of prison. It is also the fact that such form of detention can deny to a prisoner the full opportunities for programs and courses available to mainstream prisoners. Additionally, any prisoner with a history of being on protection, particularly one who has killed or abused a child, is potentially a marked man for whom the risk of reprisal is high. Had his Honour ignored those circumstances then error would have been demonstrated. However, it was a matter expressly acknowledged and said to have been taken into account. The submission advanced in this regard to the effect that “given the length of the head sentence, it would seem that his Honour gave inadequate weight to it”, needs to be examined in the light of what is an appropriate sentence for an offence of manslaughter of this kind.  
     19   The authorities do show, as his Honour stated, that “the protection of children is of fundamental importance to society”, such that there is a special need, in this type of case, for both special and general deterrence. 
     20   A review of the decisions, at first instance, and upon appeal, do reveal that the consistently heavy sentences have been imposed for the manslaughter of infants. They include the two cases of Ditfort NSWCCA 17 March 1992 and Vaughan (1991) 56 A Crim R 355, to which his Honour made reference. To those cases I would add the sentences imposed at first instance in Woodland (2001) NSWSC 426 (Wood CJ at CL) of seven years nine months with a non parole period of four years 9 months; Dawney (1999) NSWSC 15 September 1999 (Barr J), of eight years with a non parole period of five years; Bilton (2000) NSWSC 1113 (Bell J), seven years with a non parole period of four and a half years; and Recalde (2000) NSWSC 1247 (James J) of nine years with a non parole period of six years. While some of these sentences were pronounced after that imposed in the present case, they do reflect a consistently heavy pattern of sentencing for comparable cases. Moreover, in each of them the need for protection, and the risk of reprisal was as much present as it was in the present case. 
     21   As has been observed frequently, comparison with sentencing statistics for the offence of manslaughter, or with cases involving adult victims is of little value for the reasons discussed in decisions such as Elliott NSWCCA 24 February 1991, and Green (1999) NSWCCA 97, which relate to the wide variety of circumstances which the offence encompasses. For those reasons, I have not made reference to the Judicial Commission statistics or to cases other than those involving the manslaughter of infants. 
     22   When reference is made to the stern approach which the Court takes to the unlawful killing, by a carer, of an infant, I am unpersuaded that the sentence here imposed failed to make sufficient allowance for the considerations which do attach to the applicant’s custodial position, both for the past and for the future. Added to that is the further circumstance, not mentioned by his Honour, that, at the time of this offence, the applicant was subject to a recognisance to be of good behaviour for three years which had been imposed in relation to a drug offence. That was itself a matter of serious aggravation: Readman (1990) 47 A Crim R 181. 
     23   This submission is not made good. 
      
       
      Failure to demonstrably take into account the pre sentence custody 
       
     24   In this regard it was the case that the applicant had spent ten days in custody between the time of his arrest, on 30 January 1997, and the date when he was granted bail on 10 February 1997, and a further period of one month and five days in custody between 10 May and 15 June 1998, totalling in all one month and fifteen days. His Honour made no mention of the first period of ten days, but expressly stated that he had taken into account the second period of one month and five days. It is, however, submitted that the sentence being expressed in round terms of seven years six months with a non parole period of five years six months, it did not demonstrate any such allowance, since one might reasonably have expected that it would either have been backdated, as is permissible: MacDonald NSWCCA 12 December 1995 and S47(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, or to have been reduced at the other end. 
     25   It is not clear why the two periods of pre sentence custody were not demonstrably reflected in the sentencing order. In my view, error did occur in this respect, having regard to the provisions of S 24 as well as S 47(2) and (3) of the Act, and to the principles and practice discussed in McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588; Deeble NSWCCA 19 September 1991, and English (2000) NSWCCA 245. Although I otherwise consider the sentence appropriate, in the absence of any statement or reason for not backdating for the periods in question or for reducing the sentence from the other end, I am of the view that the Court should intervene to adjust them accordingly. 
     26   Accordingly, I propose that leave to appeal be granted, and that the appeal be allowed only to the extent of backdating the sentence and non parole period by one month and fifteen days, so that each should commence on 7 July 1999. The formal orders which I would propose accordingly would be as follows: 
      
       
        
        1. Leave to appeal granted. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Sentence quashed. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The applicant to be sentenced in substitution for the original sentence to imprisonment for seven and a half years to date from 7 July 1999. 
        
       
       
        
         
        4. A non parole period is set of five years six months, similarly to date from 7 July 1999 and to expire on 6 January 2005. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The earliest date on which the applicant is eligible to be released on parole is, accordingly, 7 January 2005. 
        
       
       
        
       
     27   BEAZLEY JA: I agree. 
     28   SPERLING J: I agree with the orders proposed. 
     29   An adjustment for the time in custody is necessary to cure what appears to have been an oversight. 
     30   As to the discount for the plea of guilty, I would not wish to be taken as saying that a discount of as little as 10% is appropriate, in ordinary circumstances, for a plea of guilty proffered at a time significantly before the date fixed for trial. However, having regard to all the circumstances of this case specified by the Chief Judge at Common Law, I would not regard a sentence of less than that imposed, with an adjustment for time in custody, as appropriate. 
     31   On that account, because of the terms of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, I would allow the appeal to the limited extent that is proposed. 
     32   BEAZLEY JA: The orders of the Court are those proposed by the Chief Judge at Common Law.

     Remarks on Sentence 
      
      
     1      
     HIS HONOUR: The offender, Graham David Bartlett, was charged this morning with the murder of a man at a boarding house in Darlinghurst late last year. He pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, and the Crown has accepted that plea in discharge of the indictment on the basis of substantial impairment under s23A of the  
     Crimes Act 
     . The Crown accepts that, on the occasion in question, the offender's capacity to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, to use the language of that section. 
      
       
      
     2      
     The offender and the deceased had lived at the boarding house for some years. The offender occupied a room above that of the deceased. The deceased was given to complaining about the level of noise emanating from the rooms of other residents at the boarding house, including the offender's. For his part, the offender complained on a number of occasions about the smell of marijuana smoke which he believed to be emanating from the deceased's room and which he found particularly offensive. 
      
       
      
     3      
     On the evening of 25 October 2000, the deceased went to the offender's room to complain about the level of noise from the offender's television set. He entered the room, there was an altercation, and the offender attacked him with a hammer, striking him a number of times about the head. The deceased was taken to hospital, where he died of his injuries on 2 November 2000. 
      
       
      
     4      
     After the incident, the offender left the boarding house and for a time contemplated suicide. On 7 November 2000 he was located by police at the Matthew Talbot Hostel and was arrested. He has been in custody since that day. 
      
       
      
     5      
     He took part in an electronically recorded interview and admitted what he had done, saying that he must have had “a tantrum” or had “lost my temper or something”. As one would expect, the offence can be understood only in the light of the offender's background and his psychiatric history.  
      
       
      
     6      
     He is now fifty-one years old. He has no prior convictions and in the whole of the material before me, there appears to be no history of violence on his part. He appears to have been brought up in a somewhat dysfunctional family. His childhood was lonely and devoid of stimulation and affection. In his youth he had suicidal thoughts from time to time. He undertook secondary education although, as I understand it, he did not complete it and he has no tertiary qualifications. He did have unskilled employment for a time after leaving school but in more recent years he has been unemployed. He seems to have lived a solitary existence with little contact with his family, with no friends and no intimate relationships. It would seem that he has really never known happiness.  
      
       
      
     7      
     He has been given to what might be described as obsessive behaviour, being preoccupied with his health and his hygiene to an abnormal degree and, among other things, being unusually susceptible to unpleasant odours. It is this, in particular, which appears to have contributed significantly to the events of that tragic night. 
      
       
      
     8      
     I have the benefit of the reports of three well respected forensic psychiatrists, Dr Jonathan Carne and Dr Bruce Westmore, engaged by the offender's solicitor, and Dr Olaf Neilssen, engaged by the Crown. 
      
       
      
     9      
     Doctor Carne and Dr Neilssen both diagnosed a personality disorder with schizotypal traits and dysthymia, or chronic depression. In addition, Dr Neilssen thought that he probably had an obsessive compulsive disorder. Doctor Westmore's conclusion, although somewhat differently expressed, is to much the same effect. He diagnosed a long term depressive condition with “increasingly odd and eccentric behaviour with some compulsive and probably obsessive features”. All the doctors saw this psychiatric profile as the basis of the offender's behaviour on the night in question. Clearly, that is so. 
      
       
      
     10      
     Some months prior to the killing the offender had been prescribed medication for depression by a general practitioner but, unfortunately, he had not been taking it for a significant period before the incident. However, Dr Neilssen in his report noted that the offender has responded well in prison to anti-depressive medication. The doctor expressed the view that he needs long term psychiatric treatment. 
      
       
      
     11      
     I take into account the offender's plea of guilty to the alternative charge of manslaughter, which the Crown accepts has been offered at the earliest reasonable opportunity. Because of his obsessive traits, the offender has been on protection in prison and is likely to remain so for some time to come. That is a matter also properly to be taken into account. I think this incident is an isolated one and I do not believe that this man poses a threat to the community in the future.  
      
       
      
     12      
     Nonetheless, the sentence which I impose must reflect the objective gravity of the offence. Manslaughter necessarily embraces killings which, for one reason or another, are seen as less culpable than those which we classify as murder, but appellate courts have consistently enjoined sentencing judges not to lose sight of the fact that the crime involves the felonious taking of a human life. 
      
       
      
     13      
     It is common ground that there are special circumstances warranting a departure from the usual proportion between head sentence and non-parole period. Clearly, this is so in the light of the offender's background and his need for long term psychiatric treatment, which I believe would be assisted by his being subject to supervision and the sanction of parole for a lengthy period. 
      
       
      
     14      
     Graham David Bartlett, I sentence you to imprisonment for 8 years to date from 7 November 2000, with a non-parole period of 4 years. 
      
       
      
     15      
     I am indebted to counsel on both sides for their assistance in the matter.

       REGINA v Neil Andrew SIMPSON 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1 THE COURT: This application for leave to appeal against sentence was heard on 2 August 2001. 
     2 The principal argument advanced in the applicant’s written submissions focussed upon the statement by the sentencing judge that: “I see no reason to find special circumstances in this case.” 
     3 The submission was that the judgment is deficient because of inadequate disclosure of reasons. 
     4 As it happened, judgment in R v Hameed [2001] NSWCCA 287 was handed down on 2 August. That is a decision of Simpson J and Sperling J. Their Honours agreed in the result but each judge gave separate reasons.  
     5 The judgment of Sperling J reviews a number of cases decided before and after the enactment of the current s44 of the Sentencing Act 1989 (by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). Sperling J contrasted what he termed the strict and the liberal approach to “special circumstances”. The “strict approach” is identified as holding that the only relevant consideration is the need for a longer period under care and supervision on parole than would otherwise be the case for the purpose of rehabilitation. 
     6 It was submitted that Judge Gibson in the present case had wrongly confined himself to “the strict approach”. 
     7 The Crown disputed the latter proposition but contended in the alternative that Sperling J was not correct in discerning the sharp dichotomy in the case law between the strict and liberal approaches. It was submitted that “special circumstances” in s44 had the meaning attributed to it in Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446 and the other cases cited by Sperling J in Hameed [54]. The Crown invited the Court to reconstitute itself as a bench of five to determine whether s44 had the radical effect found by Sperling J. 
     8 We propose to do so. The matter will be listed for further hearing on a date to be fixed by the Registrar (in August if practicable). The parties are directed to file supplementary submissions dealing with the issues raised by Hameed, the applicant’s submissions to be filed within 14 days and Crown’s submissions within a further period of seven days.

      DHANHOA v REGINA 
     FACTSIn May 2000 the appellant was convicted by a jury of (i) aggravated robbery in company with wounding, and (ii) detaining for advantage and causing injury. He was sentenced to an effective total period of 7½ years with a non-parole period of 4 years. The evidence called by the Crown at trial included identification of the appellant, by the victim, from photographs. The trial Judge did not give a warning or direction to the jury in respect of this evidence. This formed the first ground of appeal. The second ground of appeal was in relation to untruths told by the appellant when interviewed by police. The trial Judge commented on the untruths but did not give any direction to the jury about it or analyse its significance. The appellant submitted that a direction should have been given in relation to that evidence. HELD per Meagher JA (Dowd J agreeing) & Kirby J:(i) The principle of Domican v R, requiring a warning to be given in respect of identification evidence only applies where “any significant part” of the Crown case turns on identification. Here, no part of the Crown case did.  (ii) Per Meagher JA (Dowd J agreeing): The evidence of the untruths was not led as evidence going to credibility, therefore  a Zoneff v R direction was not required. The evidence must have been relied upon  as evidence of consciousness of guilt, which requires an Edwards v R direction.  However, the Crown did not rely upon it when addressing the jury, the Judge did  not tell the jury its significance and the appellant’s counsel did not ask for an  Edwards direction. In all the circumstances, even if the ground is made out, the  appeal should nonetheless be dismissed by applying the proviso to s 6(1) of the  Criminal Appeals Act.  Per Kirby J (dissenting): The evidence of the untruths was led as evidence which may ultimately justify a  submission that the appellant had lied through a consciousness of guilt. However,  in the result, there was no evidence capable of supporting such a finding. Thus  there was no occasion for an Edwards direction. However, the submission by the  Crown attacked the credibility of the appellant’s account. That submission,  repeated in the summing up, and the prominence given to the issue, created the risk  of misunderstanding about the significance of possible lies, in the absence of some  explanation from the trial Judge. Thus ground two has been made out. ORDERS1 Appeal dismissed.IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL CCA 60336/00 MEAGHER JA DOWD J KIRBY J Friday, 10 August 2001 
      
      DHANHOA v REGINA 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
     1   MEAGHER JA: In May 2000 the appellant, Mr Dhanhoa, stood his trial before Kinchington DCJ and a jury charged with (i) aggravated robbery in company, with wounding, and (ii) detaining for advantage and causing injury. He was convicted of both offences by the jury, and sentenced by the judge to an effective total period of 7½ years with a non-parole period of 4 years, to date from 5 May 2000. He appealed to this court both on conviction and sentence. 
     2   The crimes of which he was accused arose out of certain events which took place on 19/20 January 1999. The victim, a certain Mr A H Schembri, went to the Bridge Hotel at Balmain to play some pool. He played pool with someone he had not previously met, of Indian origin, who introduced him to three of his friends, also of Indian (or possibly Sri Lankan) origin. After playing pool with these four people for some time (on one version of it, not always amicably), he invited the four of them back to his unit at 56 Rosser Street Balmain, in order to smoke some marijuana together. All four strangers accepted this invitation.  
     3   How long the guests remained there is a matter of some obscurity, but it would seem to be (on the victim’s account) something between 15 minutes and one hour. But what happened there, on the victims’ story, is not in the least obscure. After smoking a little marijuana, and discussing (of all things) Korean martial art, one of the guests gave him a severe head-butting, one of them held him by the throat against the wall, one of them took a Wiltshire knife from the kitchen drawer and stuck it into his back (thereby damaging both his kidneys and one of his lungs), one of them relieved him of his wallet, and one of them armed himself with the victim’s (imitation) Samurai Sword. 
     4   Whilst it is clear on the victim’s account that his assailants did all these things, his evidence as to which of them did what is less than clear.  
     5   On it being told to his four guests that he had a small sum of money in his bank, they escorted him down the street with a view to driving him in their car to an ATM. Mr Schembri was quite certain that all four of his guests did this: two of them had his arms, one walked in front of him, and one walked behind. 
     6   There were various scuffles in the street, and he eventually reached the house of a samaritan neighbour who looked after him. 
     7   Two of his neighbours, on hearing the noises emanating from the street scuffles, opened their windows and observed the affray. Both of these witnesses, a Mr Sullivan and a Mr Patterson, said they observed three assailants attacking Mr Schembri, not four. 
     8   The appellant gave evidence. He did not deny the playing of pool, the number of people at that game, the invitation to visit the victim’s flat, and the acceptance of that invitation. However, he denied being present at the flat when any assaults or fights took place, and said he left early (after perhaps ten minutes). This, according to his counsel, is verified by the fact that Messrs Sullivan and Patterson saw three assailants, not four. 
     9   There was some photographic identification evidence, procured not long before the trial. There was also evidence that Mr Dhanhoa’s fingerprints were found on a coffee table at the flat. 
     10   The appellant’s first ground of appeal is that;  
      
       
        
        “His Honour gave no direction or warnings to the jury in respect of identification … including the matters required by s 115(7). The summing up was defective given the failure of the trial judge to sum up at all on identification, and to warn the jury in accordance with s 165 of the  
        Evidence Act 
        ”.  
        
       
      (This is a quotation from the appellant’s written submissions).  
      Domican v R 
       (1992) 173 CLR 551 at 561 was prayed in aid. Certainly the identification evidence was not strong (indeed, one wonders why the Crown led it) and no warnings were given. However, that, in my view, does not matter. The principle of  
      Domican 
       only applies where “any significant part” of the Crown case turns on identification. Here, no part of the Crown case did. 
       
     11   The Crown’s case was that four people, including the appellant, were, at all material times, engaged on a joint criminal enterprise. The appellant’s case was that, whatever was true of his three companions, he was absent at the crucial moments. The case was fought on this basis - were there three assailants or four? There was plenty of evidence either way. The jury must have found in the victim’s favour, in which case no question of the appellant’s identification arose then or arises now. 
     12   The second, and only other, ground of appeal was in relation to the so called “lies”. This arises from an interview between a police officer and the appellant which took place on 27 September 1999. The appellant told the police officer that he could not imagine how his fingerprints appeared on a table in the victim’s flat; that he had never been to the Bridge Hotel at Rozelle; and that he knew “nothing about” playing pool on the night of 19 January 1999. These were obviously untruths; whether they were lies or not is not established. His Honour never categorised these as “lies”. The matter was raised by the Crown, cross-examined on by counsel for the appellant, and commented on by the Judge on four or five occasions in his summing up. But, whilst commenting on it, his Honour did not give any directions to the jury about it, or, indeed, analyse its significance. The appellant’s submissions are that it can only have been led as evidence of guilt, in which case an Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193 direction should be given; or as evidence going to credibility in which case a Zoneff v R (2000) 200 CLR 234 direction should have been given. It is clear enough that the second possibility can be discarded. Not so the first. I cannot see why the evidence was led unless the Crown sought to rely on it as evidence of consciousness of guilt, but if that be true, it is extraordinary that the Crown did not rely on it when addressing the jury, and equally extraordinarily that the Judge did not tell the jury exactly what its significance was. Nor, for that matter, did the appellant’s counsel ask for an Edwards direction. In all the circumstances, if the ground is made out (which I don’t think it is), I should nonetheless dismiss the appeal by applying the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeals Act. 
     13   The appeal against severity was withdrawn. 
     14   In my view, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     15   DOWD J: I have read the judgment in draft form of Meagher JA. I agree with the proposed order and his Honour’s reasons therefore. 
     16   KIRBY J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Meagher JA in draft. However, I have formed a different view in respect of the second ground of appeal. I should also say something about the first ground. 
      
       
      The Identification Evidence 
       
     17   The first ground of appeal was as follows: 
      
       
        
        “1. The trial Judge failed to direct the jury, adequately, or at all, in relation to identification evidence.” 
        
       
     18   The circumstances giving rise to the charge, and the way in which the case was fought, are described by Meagher JA. The evidence called by the Crown included an identification of the appellant by the victim, from photographs. However, the appellant acknowledged his presence in the flat, asserting that he had left the flat before the assault and robbery took place. 
     19   The Crown case did not seek to differentiate between members of the group, whether inside or outside the flat. All were said to have been parties to a joint criminal enterprise. The issue, therefore, was not one of identification. It was whether the group comprised three members or four. Should a warning have been given in these circumstances? 
     20   In Kelleher v The Queen [1974] 131 CLR 534, Gibbs J said this: (at 551) 
      
       
        
        “However, it seems to me that although it is perfectly true that the adequacy of a summing up can only be decided in the light of the circumstances of the particular case, and that where a warning is necessary no particular form of words is required, it is in practice generally desirable that where the case for the prosecution includes evidence of visual identification by a person previously unfamiliar with the accused, an appropriate warning should be given to the jury, since jurors may not appreciate as fully as a judge may do, or even at all, the serious risk that always exists that evidence of that kind may be mistaken. The failure to give an adequate warning where one is required may have the result that the conviction must be quashed …” 
        
       
     21   However, in this case, as Meagher JA points out (referring to Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 551 at 561), identification evidence did not play any significant part in the proof of the appellant’s guilt. In my view, no warning was called for. The first ground must fail. 
      
       
      A Direction in Respect of Lies 
       
     22   Ground 2 was in these terms: 
      
       
        
        “2. The trial Judge failed to direct the jury, adequately, or at all in relation to lies allegedly told by the appellant.” 
        
       
     23   The incident giving rise to the charges took place in January 1999. In September that year, Det Napper arrested Mr Dhanhoa. Shortly before his arrest Det Napper told Mr Dhanhoa that he was investigating an incident in which the victim had invited a group from a “pub” in Rozelle back to his unit. Once at the unit, the victim had been repeatedly stabbed and his property taken. He was later abducted in order to gain access to a bank account through an automatic teller machine. Having provided that background, Det Napper said this: (T.84/85) 
      
       
        
        “I said ‘I will be up front with you, your fingerprints have been located inside the unit where this happened can you explain how your prints came to be there?’ He said ‘I’ve got no idea how they came to be there.’ I said ‘Do you wish to take part in any form of interview regards to this matter?’ He said ‘No not at the moment.’” 
        
       
     24   Det Napper continued: 
      
       
        
        “I said ‘Have you ever been to the Bridge Hotel at Rozelle?’ He said ‘No, where’s the Bridge Hotel?’ I said ‘Allegedly you were playing pool and watching Sri Lanka playing cricket on the TV.’ He said ‘No I know nothing about it.’” 
        
       
     25   The appellant gave evidence. He was cross examined about his conversation with the police. The cross examination included the following: (T.103) 
      
       
        
        “Q. When you spoke to the police at Burwood on 27 September? 
         
        A. Yeah, yah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At that stage you didn’t remember being at Balmain at all? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
     26   Det Napper apparently provided the appellant with a copy of the “Facts Sheet”, being a short summary of the background to the charge. A cross examination proceeded as follows: 
      
       
        
        “Q. The fact is that you remembered about this event occurring when the police were charging you and they were giving you a copy of the (facts)sheet detailing what these events were? 
         
        A. I remember the night. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You didn’t say anything to the police at that stage that what I told you earlier was wrong I do remember? 
         
        A. Pardon. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You didn’t say anything to the police at that time? 
         
        A. No, no.” 
        
       
     27   Mr Dhanhoa acknowledged that he later received and read the police brief. The following was then put: (T.164) 
      
       
        
        “Q. You told the police that you didn’t really have any Indian acquaintances that’s not true is it? 
         
        A. Yeah it is true. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Isn’t a person by the name of Ahmed Abass and Harry Abass those two persons are very close friends of yours aren’t they? 
         
        A. Not close friends but I know them. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. They are Indian origin aren’t they? 
         
        A. They are Lebanese.” 
        
       
     28   Finally, the Crown asked the following questions: (T.165) 
      
       
        
        “Q. You knew about the Bridge Hotel prior to arriving at the hotel? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So it wasn’t true that you had never heard of the Bridge Hotel before? 
         
        A. I heard of it that night I was told that it was open after twelve.” 
        
       
     29   That is as far as the cross examination went. The evidence from Det Napper was, no doubt, led by the Crown as evidence which may ultimately justify a submission that the appellant had lied through a consciousness of guilt. There was an apparent contradiction between the appellant’s ignorance when first confronted, and the detailed knowledge he professed in the defence he ultimately provided. It was not inappropriate, in my view, that the Crown should have led the evidence, and explored that apparent contradiction. 
     30   However, in the result, there was no evidence capable of supporting a finding that the appellant had lied through a consciousness of guilt. There was no occasion, therefore, for a direction in conformity with Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193. Such a direction could only have been justified if the criteria identified by the High Court had arguably been satisfied, namely: 
     · First, proof of a deliberate lie by the appellant. 
     · Secondly, proof that the lie was in respect of a material issue, that is a central issue in the trial. 
     · Thirdly, proof that the lie was told because the appellant knew the truth would implicate him in the commission of the offence. 
     31   Here one may doubt that the Crown could even establish that the appellant had deliberately lied. Det Napper had not asked the appellant whether he knew anything about the incident which he had just described. He asked for an explanation as to how his fingerprints came to be found inside the unit. The appellant’s response (that he had “no idea”) may have been literally true. The only statement which may have been a lie, and which was certainly untrue, was the appellant’s denial that he had been to the Bridge Hotel at Rozelle. However, even were that a lie, one may doubt that it could have been regarded as a lie concerning a material issue. The events at the hotel took place some time before the incident. Moreover, no suggestion was made in cross examination by the Crown Prosecutor that the appellant had provided answers to the detective through fear that the truth may implicate him in the offence. 
     32   The Crown, understandably in these circumstances, did not seek a direction in conformity with Edwards v The Queen. Had the issue been abandoned by the Crown, there may have been no occasion for complaint by the appellant. However, the issue was not abandoned. The addresses of counsel were not recorded. His Honour referred to the following submission made by the Crown: (Summing Up 56) 
      
       
        
        “The Crown says … you will remember what the accused said when he was spoken to by the police officers at the time of his arrest and compare that to what he says to you now remembering that he received the police brief in this matter in February.” 
        
       
     33   His Honour then added the following comment: (Summing Up 56) 
      
       
        
        “All those matters are part of the Crown case and it is for you to determine whether there is any relevance in that or whether there is not. It is entirely a matter for you.” 
        
       
     34   Elsewhere in the summing up, his Honour, when reviewing the evidence, referred to the testimony of Det Napper, and the cross examination of the appellant, in the passages set out above. Given the way in which the Crown put its case, the issue arises whether the jury should have been given guidance, were they to take the view that the appellant had lied to Det Napper? 
     35   Written submissions made on behalf of the appellant asserted the following: (p5) 
      
       
        
        “If this evidence was relied upon as evidence of consciousness of guilt then directions should have been given in accordance with  
        Edwards v R 
         (1993) 178 CLR 193. If not, then directions should have been given in accordance with  
        Zoneff v R 
         (2000) 200 CLR 234.” 
        
       
     36   In Zoneff v The Queen [2000] HCA 28, the Court dealt with a case in which, as here, there was no basis upon which a finding could have been made against the appellant that he had lied out of a consciousness of guilt. The majority (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, and Callinan JJ) said this: (para 20) 
      
       
        
        “20. It follows in our opinion that it was unnecessary, indeed undesirable, that a direction of the kind with which  
        Edwards 
         was concerned be given in the circumstances of this case. In order to give it in this case the trial judge would have had to decide which of the appellant’s answers were or were not capable of being regarded as lies indicative of a consciousness of guilt. Such a direction here could have had the effect of raising an issue or issues upon which the parties were not joined, and of highlighting issues of credibility so as to give them an undeserved prominence in the jury’s mind to the prejudice of the appellant.” 
        
       
     37   The Court added the following: (paras 22/24) 
      
       
        
        “22. The trial judge was evidently concerned that, having regard to some of the cross-examination, there was a serious risk that the jury might engage in an impermissible process of reasoning in relation to the matter of lies. Unfortunately, his response was to give a direction which, as Olsson J observed, raised the topic and then left it largely up in the air. 
        
       
       
        
        23. A direction which might have appropriately been given and which would have allayed any concerns which the trial judge may have had, in this unusual case, in which the issues may not have been defined as they might have been had the prosecutor made a speech to the jury, is one in these terms: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘You have heard a lot of questions, which attribute lies to the accused. You will make up your own mind about whether he was telling lies and if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies have in relation to the issues in the case but I give you this warning: do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something, that is evidence of guilt.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        24. A direction in such terms may well be adaptable to other cases in which there is a risk of a misunderstanding about the significance of possible lies even though the prosecution has not suggested that the accused told certain lies because he or she knew the truth would implicate him or her in the commission of the offence.” 
        
       
     38   The Crown case against the appellant was not without difficulty. The events in the unit happened in a rush. The victim was outnumbered, and wounded. His description of his assailants makes it difficult to assign any particular role to the appellant. The Crown’s rebuttal of the suggestion by the appellant that he left the unit, substantially depended upon the victim’s assertion that the same four people were involved in the events inside and outside the unit. Yet the victim’s evidence on this aspect was less than dogmatic. He said this: (T.19) 
      
       
        
        “Q. You said that they walked you. Can you describe how they walked you? 
         
        A. One on either side of me with their arms around me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who were the men who walked either side of you with their arms around you? 
         
        A. I can’t say, I can’t recall exactly which of the four, which two of the four. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where were the other two men when two of them had hold of you by your arms either side? 
         
        A. I think just one in front and behind just up close next to me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So one in front, one behind and two either side? 
         
        A. Yeah.” 
        
       
     39   Shortly after the victim broke free, and escaped. 
     40   Two eye witnesses were called. They each saw the victim and his assailants in the street. Their evidence, however, furnished some support for the appellant’s account. Each described having seen the victim surrounded by three men, not four. Each acknowledged, however, that his vision may have been obscured. 
     41   In this context the credibility of the appellant was obviously important. The submission by the Crown attacked the credibility of the applicant’s account. 
     42   Here, I believe that the submission by the Crown, repeated in the summing up, and the prominence given to the issue, created the risk of misunderstanding about the significance of possible lies in the absence of some explanation from the trial Judge (cf R v Galea [2001] NSWCCA 270, paras 84 to 90). I therefore believe that ground 2 has been made out. 
     43   No redirection was sought by counsel then appearing for the appellant. Rule 4 therefore applies. However Zoneff v The Queen was handed down on 25 May 2000, that is, shortly after the trial. The guidance which it provided was therefore not available either to counsel or the trial Judge. I believe leave to appeal should be granted.  
     44   The matter is not one for the application of the proviso to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In my view the appellant lost a chance, which was fairly open to him, of acquittal. 
     45   I would therefore propose the following orders: 
      
       
      1. The appellant should be given leave under Rule 4. 
       
      2. The appeal should be upheld. 
       
      3. The convictions in respect of each charge should be quashed, and the sentence set aside. 
       
      4. There should be a new trial.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Einfeld AJ. 
      
       
     2 GROVE J: I also agree. 
      
       
     3 EINFELD AJ: The Appellant appeals against his conviction for murder said to have been committed on 11 March 1999 in Nyngan. 
      
       
     4 The victim was Kevin William Forester. The conviction took place at the hands of a jury on 11 October 2000 after a trial before her Honour Justice Bell, and a jury at Dubbo which commenced a week earlier. 
      
       
     5 On 13 October her Honour sentenced the Appellant to eighteen years imprisonment to commence on the day after the crime. She specified a non-parole period of fourteen years and fixed the first date for eligibility for release on parole as 11 March 2013. 
      
       
     6 The date 11 March for the offence is of some significance. In an incident on 12 February, just one month earlier, the Appellant was apparently dragged out of a car by the deceased and assaulted in a relatively minor but humiliating way. 
      
       
     7 On 6 March, just five days before the crime, the Appellant was noted as requesting information about the whereabouts of the deceased, but although a place where he might be found was identified, nothing happened. 
      
       
     8 Earlier, on the evening of 11 March, the deceased was at the home of the Appellant’s then female companion. The police watched the deceased thereafter and regarded him as potentially violent but did not apprehend him. 
      
       
     9 The deceased then went to the home of a Mr and Mrs Rogers in Cannonbar Street, Nyngan. The deceased arrived and shortly after assaulted the Appellant causing his nose to bleed and him to stagger and fall. The deceased went to the kitchen to seek a knife and returned to stand over the Appellant on the floor, threatening him with a knife. Mrs Rogers yelled at the two men to leave. Her evidence was that the deceased was the aggressor in the encounter and had not been provoked by the Appellant in any way. The Appellant was later heard on the same night to evince an intention to retaliate for this event. “I’m going to get Forester” was one expression quoted. Another one was, “I’ll go and stab him. See if he likes it”. 
      
       
     10 The Appellant explained these remarks at the trial as ‘big-noting’ himself. In fact what happened was that the Appellant then went to the home of a Mr and Mrs Ryan. Mr Ryan died in an accident before the trial so was not able to give evidence. The other evidence was that when the Appellant saw the deceased in the house he went straight up to him and with virtually no conversation inflicted a number of fatal stab wounds with the knife. 
      
       
     11 The Appellant’s case was that the late Mr Ryan killed the deceased while he was unconscious because of actions by the deceased, an argument her Honour dismissed as “frankly incredible” in her remarks on sentence. 
      
       
     12 This appeal centres on an alleged error by her Honour to instruct the jury on the defence of provocation and thus to leave open a verdict of manslaughter. Section 23(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 provides in part: 
      
       
        
         
         “An act or omission causing death is an act done or omitted under provocation where: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the act or omission is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased towards or affecting the accused …” 
           
          
         
        
       
     13 Neither party at the trial sought a direction on provocation. In fact, each expressly disavowed her Honour’s request in relation to the matter. It is well settled that a trial judge has a duty to leave to the jury any matter which might reasonably be found. 
      
       
     14 Defence counsel has sworn an affidavit stating that this was done in error on his part and that if he was doing the trial again he would not oppose her Honour’s offer, as he put it, to leave provocation to the jury. 
      
       
     15 Her Honour considered doing so, but decided that it was not appropriate because there was no evidence of a loss of self-control. 
      
       
     16 In Mancini v Director of Public Prosecutions [1942] AC 1 at 8, Viscount Simon said that the evidentiary threshold for provocation will be held to be satisfied when: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the evidence given before the jury is such as might satisfy them as the judges of fact that the elements were present which would reduce the crime to manslaughter, or, at any rate, might induce a reasonable doubt whether this was, or was not, the case.” 
         
        
       
     17 It was further held at 12: 
      
       
        
         
         “If the evidence before the jury at the end of the case does not contain material on which a reasonable man could find a verdict of manslaughter instead of murder, it is no defect in the summing-up that manslaughter is not dealt with.” 
         
        
       
     18 In Moffa v The Queen (1976-1977) 138 CLR 601 at 613 Gibbs J held: 
      
       
        
         
         “Although the onus of establishing that the killing was not provoked lies on the Crown, it is a question for the decision of the judge whether there is evidence upon which a jury could reasonably return a verdict of manslaughter on the ground of provocation, and it is established that a trial judge should withdraw an issue of provocation from the jury if the evidence could not reasonably support the conclusion that the provocation was of such a character as could have deprived a reasonable person of the power of self-control to such an extent as to lead him to do what the accused did.” 
         
        
       
     19 One of the examples given in the cases of failing to reach the necessary threshold was characterised by this Court as indicating: 
      
       
        
         
         “… nothing capable of supporting a rational assessment that an ordinary person answering to that description and in the appellant’s relevant position at the time could have so far lost his reason as to have formed an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon those who had recently been his adversaries.” (See  
         R v Hall 
          [2001] NSWCCA 202 at [62]) 
         
        
       
     20 In my opinion the conclusion by her Honour that there was no evidence upon which a jury, reasonably instructed, could make a finding in accordance with s23(2)(a) was manifestly correct. In these circumstances the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     21 The Appellant raised also a second ground that the trial judge erred in the course of her summing-up as to whether there was evidence of a second voice heard by a witness, Wardman, immediately following the fatal altercation which the Crown allege occurred between the Appellant and the deceased. Mr Wardman was not in the house at the time but is said to have heard a voice that may not have been the Appellant’s, which was making appropriate remarks that might have pointed to another person having committed the crime. 
      
       
     22 I have carefully considered the submissions made in this regard and concluded that there is no substance to them. On this ground also the appeal is dismissed. 
      
       
     23 SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is that the appeal is dismissed.

       JUDGMENT 
       
       
        
       
       
      1     
      SPIGELMAN CJ: I call on Grove J to deliver the first judgment. 
       
        
       
      2     
      GROVE J: The appellant was convicted upon an indictment charging that she had attempted to obtain possession of narcotic goods, being more than the trafficable quantity of methylamphetamine, following a trial before Judge Howie (as he then was) and a jury. His Honour sentenced the appellant to a total of seven years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years. 
       
        
       
      3     
      The application seeks reduction of that sentence. In support, certain material concerning the effect of the incarceration of the appellant upon her teenage son has been tendered to the Court, and I will turn to this material but first I will recapitulate the essential circumstances of the offence. 
       
        
       
      4     
      These facts were found by the learned sentencing judge and are not the subject of challenge in this Court. On 13 September 1998 a parcel arrived in Australia from the Philippines addressed to Leticia Artiagar, 19 Monterey Street, Monterey through the Federal Express forwarding agency. The documentation included a contact mobile telephone number, 0413 166 285. 
       
        
       
      5     
      The package was subjected to a random check by customs officers and there was found a computer hard drive which, upon being dismantled, was found to contain powder analysed as 83.2 grams of pure methylamphetamine. 
       
        
       
      6     
      A person named Leticia Artiagar was outside of Australia at this time and did not enter the country until November. The address on the package was that of the appellant. The telephone number related to a service to a mobile phone which the appellant initially told police had been lost, but she later produced it from a lounge chair within which it had been hidden during a police search of her premises. 
       
        
       
      7     
      An employee of Federal Express, unaware of the Customs interception, called the number and spoke to the appellant, who identified herself as ""Leticia"". The appellant telephoned another employee of Federal Express, again masquerading as ""Leticia"" and gave certain information relevant to the delivery of the package. 
       
        
       
      8     
      On 17 September a Federal police officer, assuming the role of a Federal Express employee, delivered the package (from which the drugs had been extracted) to the address where it was received by the appellant. About ten minutes after delivery, the appellant was seen to depart the premises and she was intercepted by police, who found the package in the Saab motor vehicle which she was driving. 
       
        
       
      9     
      The appellant gave evidence at trial asserting in substance that she had been duped into receiving the package which she believed contained some medical supply required by a friend. It was noted that after arrest, charge and release to bail, the appellant contacted Federal police and alleged that she was concerned that people were coming to her home in connection with the parcel. Police responded to this and secreted themselves in her premises but nothing of the sort said to have been anticipated in fact transpired. 
       
        
       
      10     
      His Honour concluded that the jury had clearly found the appellant's evidence to be dishonest. He expressly found that the appellant was a clever, cunning and devious woman and that the incident just described was an attempt to exculpate herself by manufacturing material which she intended to rely upon at trial. Of course, his Honour correctly did not take this material into account in respect of punishment, but it was relevant to assessing whether weight should be given to character testimonials advanced on her behalf. The appellant had no prior conviction. 
       
        
       
      11     
      The appellant was born on 21 December 1956. She was born in the Philippines and arrived here in 1979 to enter a marriage arranged for her by her parents with an older Australian male. The husband was violent and she suffered at his hands. She separated from her husband and obtained Australian citizenship. She came to New South Wales from Queensland in 1985 and met her present husband in 1991. They married in 1997. 
       
        
       
      12     
      Her husband is a master mariner and spends little time in Australia, although it has been the practice of the appellant on occasions to meet him in overseas ports, usually in the United States or South Africa, and spend time with him. Her husband supports her and her teenage son financially, but he did not give evidence at trial or in the sentence proceedings. 
       
        
       
      13     
      Part of the material tendered today includes an affidavit in which it is said that the appellant has seen her husband only once since her incarceration. He is a German citizen. He called at Emu Plains in October last year. Since then, in June this year, the appellant has been served with documents issued out of the Family Court in which he is seeking a divorce. 
       
        
       
      14     
      The learned sentencing judge was unable to form any view of the role played by the appellant in the importation other than that she was to be the recipient of the drug and to commence its dissemination into the community. However, he found that she was substantially involved in an attempt to import methylamphetamine from the Philippines into Australia and, acknowledging the guidance available from  
      Olbrich v The Queen 
       (1999) 199 CLR 270, he assessed her position as ""more than a courier but something less than being the person ultimately responsible for the dissemination of the drug to the community"". 
       
        
       
      15     
      Counsel for the appellant in written submissions expressly indicated that there was no complaint about those findings. 
       
        
       
      16     
      It was submitted that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. Reference was made to  
      R v Wong and Leung 
       (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 in which this Court promulgated guidelines concerning sentences for couriers and others in the hierarchy of importation of heroin or cocaine.  
       
        
       
      17     
      The first observation is that methylamphetamine should be classed as what is described as middle order drug in distinction from heroin and cocaine:  
      R v Bimahendali 
       (1999) 109 A Crim R 355. Low level quantity of the higher order of drugs was defined in  
      Wong and Leung 
       (supra) as between 2 and 200 grams, and it seems to me to be of no assistance to observe as a submission on behalf of the appellant did, that 83.2 grams of pure methylamphetamine was in terms of weight in the lower half of a 2 to 200 gram range. 
       
        
       
      18     
      The Court has been assisted, however, by an extensive schedule of decisions of this Court relating to sentences for offences in connection with the importation of methylamphetamine and other mid-range narcotics, most frequently that commonly referred to as Ecstasy. It is not necessary to detail the content of the schedule, but I would express the conclusion that as a matter of range and giving weight to the subjective matters elucidated at trial, I would conclude that the sentence imposed was of a comparatively higher severity, but I would be unpersuaded on that basis alone that this Court should intervene. 
       
        
       
      19     
      The appellant argued that there was express error in a remark by his Honour concerning s 16A(2)(p) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. In the course of his remarks his Honour referred to the requirement that he take into account the effect of the imposition of sentence on members of the offender's family. He observed that this was consistent with the common law situation. In so saying his Honour was correct. (See for example  
      R v Herrera 
       NSWCCA (Unreported 6 June 1997). 
       
        
       
      20     
      Complaint is made about his observation that the matter of effect upon family is always a matter taken into account, but only in an exceptional case would such a consideration allow a court to abstain from passing custodial sentence where every other aspect of sentencing required it and the offence is a serious one. 
       
        
       
      21     
      For my part, I do not perceive that his Honour has fallen into the error of asserting that s16A(2)(p) is relevant only to a discrimination between custodial and non-custodial sentence. What his Honour said needs to be taken in the context of the whole of what he had to say on the occasion. He had already said that it was a particular concern that there was an absence of persons to look after the teenaged son of the appellant. I would not sustain the argument advanced in this regard. 
       
        
       
      22     
      I have already made some reference to the fresh material that was sought to be put before the Court. For my part I would be prepared to look at this material but I should indicate that I have come to the ultimate conclusion that it will not affect the outcome of the proceedings. 
       
        
       
      23     
      The material related essentially to the appellant's fifteen-year-old son. As I have said, his situation was not overlooked at the time of sentence, and his Honour expressed great concern that the youth was apparently still attending school but living by himself with little or no support, other than some care at nights from a friend of the appellant. He acknowledged that imprisonment of the appellant would deleteriously affect, in a significant way, the wellbeing and welfare of a child left to fend for itself in the community. He did observe, however, that the appellant apparently had taken no steps to provide for the eventuality of her conviction. 
       
        
       
      24     
      Given the material to which I have already referred, it can be concluded that the appellant has no family in Australia other than her son. She has sought the assistance of an organisation called Children of Prisoners to arrange a refuge for him. There are welfare case notes, the entire content of which I need not recite, but there is a notation at least in October last year that at that time the youth had settled down well at Dr Barnado's Kingston House. 
       
        
       
      25     
      There have been changes since that time. One significant event appears to have been that the youth had broken his ankle at a railway station and he intermittently was admitted and discharged himself from hospital. The latest information from the fresh material before the Court is in an affidavit which attests that he ""no longer lives at the refuge but instead stays at different places, such as his girlfriend's, girlfriend's relatives and friend's places"". 
       
        
       
      26     
      The appellant's affidavit also attests that her son has been arrested as an accessory to robbery. He has been released on conditional bail and due to appear at Sutherland Children's Court on 21 August. I note that the appellant, however, attests her son has not been in trouble before. 
       
        
       
      27     
      The Court has no direct evidence concerning the reference to the girlfriend other than her name and her existence provides scant evidence for assessment of the level of maturity of the youth, although this would seem to be a significant matter when the thrust of argument is that he is in need of care. 
       
        
       
      28     
      Pursuant to the present sentence, the appellant is not eligible for consideration for release on parole until March 2004. I would accept as accurate the submission by the appellant's counsel that consideration must be given pursuant to the statute to the effect upon members of the family when setting the period of sentence and also, I apprehend, in specifying the non parole period. 
       
        
       
      29     
      Nevertheless, even giving account to the present material, it does not seem to me that anything is shown which is so exceptional as would require the intervention of this Court. Indeed, the needs all would seem to be immediate, but it is not part of the appellant's submission that she should be immediately released as it is clear that such a proposition would in the circumstances be insupportable. 
       
        
       
      30     
      The affidavit of the appellant tacitly recognises this situation in its final paragraph which states, ""A reduction in my sentence would not only mean that I will be able to look after my son, but also will allow me to properly deal with emotional and physical health concerns"". The latter is an omnibus reference to the circumstances that the appellant has been consulting a psychologist about her inability to cope with stress in custody and some physical ailments of hypertension and a non-specific heart-related illness for which she anticipates being referred for consultation. 
       
        
       
      31     
      Accordingly, although for present purposes I have looked at the fresh material, it does not persuade me to depart from the view earlier expressed in relation to the submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Accordingly, I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
       
        
       
      32     
      SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with the reasons of Grove J. Objection was taken to the admissibility of additional evidence said to be fresh evidence. It is not necessary to finally determine that question. Even if the evidence were admitted it would not make a difference to the result. 
       
        
       
      33     
      I agree with the reasons of Grove J and the orders he proposes. 
       
        
       
      34     
      EINFELD AJ: I agree with the other members of the Court.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
     1    STEIN JA:  
      
      Introduction 
       
     2    On 31 October 1996 the appellant, James Francis Murray, was found guilty by a jury of a charge that between 5 and 11 February 1991 he conspired with Eddie Kaadi to rob, while armed with an offensive weapon, certain named employees of Armaguard. The charge related to an agreement to commit an armed robbery on the Armaguard employees at the Macquarie Shopping Centre on 11 February 1991, following the collection of the weekend takings of the Grace Bros store situated within the Centre. 
     3    The appellant was sentenced to a minimum term of four years and ten months to commence on 11 March 2000, being the date of expiration of the minimum term he was then serving for an unrelated offence, and to expire on 11 January 2005. An additional term of 15 months was specified to commence on 11 January 2005 and expire on 11 April 2006. The co-conspirator, Kaadi, had been found guilty at a separate trial held earlier. 
     4    The indictment, to which the appellant pleaded not guilty, is as follows: 
      
       
        
        That he between 5 February 1991 and 11 February 1991 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did conspire with Eddy Kaadi to rob whilst armed with an offensive weapon employees of Armaguard, namely Gregory Richard Hunt, Trevor Arthur Gehl and Robert James Webeck of divers large sums of money. 
        
       
     5    The Notice of Appeal dated 15 December 1997 specifies five grounds of appeal against conviction. The appellant also appeals against sentence. Grounds 1 to 4 are pressed while ground 5 is abandoned. Grounds 1 to 4 are as follows: 
      
       
        
        1. His Honour erred in law in directing and failing to direct the jury adequately and properly as to conspiracy and the elements of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        2. His Honour erred in law in failing to exercise his discretion under the  
        Evidence Act 
         1995 in particular Sections 137, 138 re evidence of Det. Lambie and Det Sgt. Brown. 
        
       
       
        
        3. His Honour erred in law in admitting the evidence in paragraph 2. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The verdict of the jury was unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
        
       
     6    It may be noted that the submissions of counsel for the appellant, Mr Papayanni, ranged wider than the Grounds of Appeal. 
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
     7    The submission on behalf of the appellant makes the following points, said to be errors in the summing up. 
      
       
      (a) Failure to direct the jury that the conspiracy was to commit the particular armed robbery. 
       
       
      (b) Failure to summarise to the jury the evidence relating to the elements in the charge. 
       
       
      (c) It was impossible for the offence to have been committed because the agreement was to rob the Armaguard van in the parking lot of the Macquarie Centre, whereas the procedure had been changed and the van proceeded to the loading dock at the Centre. 
       
       
      (d) Failure to direct the jury on the mens rea of conspiracy, namely the requirement that the appellant must have intended to achieve the common design. 
       
     8    None of these directions were sought by experienced defence counsel at the trial and leave is accordingly required. 
     9    Although I am unpersuaded that leave ought be granted, I will deal with each of these sub-grounds seriatim on their merits. 
     10    (a) It is the submission of Mr Papayanni that according to the evidence, the agreement (if there was one) was to commit the particular offence set forth in the indictment. The agreement was to rob the particular Armaguard employees in the parking lot of the Centre, not in the loading dock. It is submitted that his Honour failed to put the true agreement to the jury and failed to sufficiently sum-up on it.  
     11    Both counsel agree that it is necessary to define the agreement. The appellant submits that his Honour did this too widely and the agreement was narrower and more specific. The Crown supports his Honour’s directions on what the agreement comprised. 
     12    His Honour commenced his summing up by reading the indictment to the jury. At pages 10 - 11 of the summing up his Honour said: 
      
       
        
        In this case the allegation is that it was intended to divest the Armaguard employees of a large amount of cash by putting them in fear by pointing this quite fearsome weapon at them and the Crown must establish that the plan included robbing these named employees, who were named in the indictment, each of whom gave evidence before you, of money they had in their immediate and personal care and responsibility. 
        
       
     13    The summing up then continued in terms of the specific agreement alleged in the indictment. For example: 
      
       
        
        … If there was an agreement between Kaadi and the accused to commit  
        this 
         armed robbery, well then there would be a conspiracy and if you accept that, it would be open to you to convict. [My emphasis added] 
        
       
     14    Again, his Honour directed the jury that: 
      
       
        
        … in order for you to find the accused guilty, the Crown must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt so far as this accused is concerned of three matters to prove he was party to a conspiracy. First of all, that there was  
        an agreement to rob Armaguard at the Macquarie Centre; 
         … [Emphasis added] 
        
       
     15    Thereafter his Honour directed the jury on the details of the evidence with regard to the specific armed robbery at the Macquarie Centre, being the subject of the indictment. 
     16    In my opinion, his Honour instructed the jury on the fundamental matters which had been agreed upon between the conspirators. The essential agreement between the appellant and Kaadi was to rob the named Armaguard employees on 11 February 1991 at the Macquarie Centre. It was not a term of the agreement but a peripheral part of the joint plan to rob the Armaguard employees from a lift within the Centre after they had parked in the parking area. The agreement contended for by counsel for the appellant was not the agreement the subject of the indictment. 
     17    In any event, the evidence indicates that the conspirators did not have an immutable plan, and that they accepted that changes may have to be implemented if circumstances altered. For example, the possibility of Armaguard having a back-up vehicle was considered. The matters relied on by the appellant are concerned with the means required to implement the fundamental agreement, not with the agreement itself. In my opinion, his Honour properly instructed the jury on the agreement between the appellant and Kaadi and this aspect of ground 1 should be dismissed. 
     18    (b) There is no substance in the submission that his Honour failed to summarise the evidence with respect to the elements in the charge. Indeed, he did so in some considerable detail. A fair reading of the summing up confirms this. It may be that this aspect of the submission made on behalf of the appellant is more directed to criticism of the judges’ Summing-Up as erroneous because of his Honour’s use of the words ‘being involved’ and ‘participated’. I can see no error in his Honour’s use of the words when considered in their context. The words used did not have the capacity to mislead the jury. The direction on conspiracy reveals no error. 
     19    (c) Given the content of the agreement, it is difficult to comprehend how it can be asserted that it was impossible to commit the offence which was the object of the conspiracy. The conspirators discussed the need to change the detail of the plan on the day if necessary. Their plan called for Stansfield (who, unbeknown to the appellant and Kaadi, was a wired-up police informer) to be the look-out at Grace Bros once they arrived at the centre and to give the appellant and Kaadi ‘the nod’. 
     20    There was no reason why the conspirators could not have changed the detail of their plan on the day given that they knew they would have to wait half an hour while the Armaguard employees collected the moneys from Grace Bros. There was evidence (from Mr Webeck of Armaguard) that regardless of whether the loading dock or the car park was used by their van, it was necessary for the guards to walk through a public area to get to the Grace Bros pay office, and that the lifts were used by them every day, see T 173 - 174. It follows that the conspirators could still gain access to the guards to rob them. There is no evidentiary basis for the assertion that it was impossible to commit the offence the subject of the agreement between the conspirators. In the circumstances it is unnecessary to address the authorities and any conflict which may be inherent in them. R v Barbouttis (1995) 37 NSWLR 257, R v Smith [1975] AC 476, DPP v Nock [1978] AC 979, R v Mai [1992] 26 NSWLR and R v Lee (1990) 47 A Crim R 187 
     21    (d) This submission is also lacking in substance. His Honour did sum up on the mens rea of the conspiracy. His Honour referred to the requirement of the Crown to establish the necessary intention by the conspirators to carry out the common design to rob the Armaguard employees. On pages 10 and 11 of the summing up, his Honour referred on four occasions to the need for the Crown to prove that the appellant intended to achieve the common design to carry out the armed robbery. This discussion culminated in his Honour directing the jury that the Crown must ‘prove an intention by the conspirators to permanently deprive the owner of the money …’. 
     22    In my opinion, the various ways in which ground 1 is put ought all be rejected. 
      
       
      Grounds 2 and 3 
       
     23    These grounds relate to the admission of two statements alleged to have been made by the appellant at the scene of the arrest at the Macquarie Centre and about an hour later at the Eastwood Police Station. The first statement was that police alleged that the appellant said ‘Fucking dog. Shouldn’t have trust him’. The later statement at the police station was to similar effect but contained a little more detail. Neither conversation was recorded by audio or video. This was in February 1991, before the days of the ERISP. The second statement was recorded by a police officer in a note book but not signed by the appellant. A voir dire was held as to the admissibility of the statements. The appellant denied making the statements. He also alleged that he was assaulted by police at the scene of his apprehension at the Macquarie Centre. However, he did not claim that the statements were made because of the assault. He simply denied that he made them. 
     24    Although his Honour was critical of the police evidence, especially the failure to call Detective Inspector Davidson, he concluded that he was ‘unable to make a finding that excessive force was used’ (in the arrest of the appellant). He added: 
      
       
        
        Personally, I doubt if I were the ultimate tribunal of fact that I would be satisfied to the requisite degree that the accused uttered the words attributed to him, but that is not the test. Whether or not there was a fabrication of evidence by police is a jury question.  
        
       
     25    His Honour observed that the appellant was in a catch-22 situation. He said: 
      
       
        
        On the one hand he denies the conversation, but on the other he alleges police brutality. I do not totally reject the evidence of the accused, however, his testimony goes to the question of fabrication, not unfairness.  
        
       
     26    His Honour ruled that s 84 of the Evidence Act 1995 was inapplicable and this is not challenged. He continued concluding that he was unable to make a finding that the appellant had been ‘verballed’ by the police. 
     27    His Honour’s conclusion was as follows: 
      
       
        
        … no proper basis exists, in my opinion, for me to reject evidence of the alleged conversation at North Ryde,  
        even on a discretionary basis 
        . [My emphasis added] 
        
       
     28    Although the Notice of Appeal refers to ss 137 and 138 of the Evidence Act, the submission made on the appellant’s behalf also embraces ss 88, 90, 135 and 142 of the Act. 
     29    His Honour discussed the dispute between the appellant and the police about the authenticity of the alleged admissions during his summing up. He suggested to the jury that they decide the case on the other evidence (to which he referred) rather than the disputed admission. While it was a matter for the jury, as the judge of facts, that is what he said he would do if he was the judge of fact. Later his Honour said: 
      
       
        
        I have already warned you about the extreme care that you should take in evaluating that material. 
        
       
     30    From the above, it is apparent that his Honour found that no issue of fairness arose and directed that whether or not the words were said by the appellant was a matter for the jury. Also, his Honour did not find any police misconduct associated with the arrest or interview. His Honour further indicated that there was no discretionary basis to reject the evidence. Although his Honour did not specifically refer to the relevant sections in Part 3.11 of the Evidence Act, it is clear from his Honour’s remarks that he considered his discretion to exclude the evidence, as well as the discretion contained in s 90 of the Act. His Honour was a very experienced judge and it is difficult to conclude that he was not referring to the provisions in the Evidence Act regarding the discretion to exclude evidence and admissions, when he ruled that the evidence should not be rejected on discretionary grounds. 
     31    In any event, his Honour made his view of the particular evidence very plain to the jury. He invited the jury to ignore it and to decide the case on other evidence. In this circumstance, it is hard to perceive how the admission of the evidence, assuming it to be in error, could have lead to a miscarriage of justice. It is likely that the jury decided the case on the very strong evidence against the appellant to be found in the listening device tapes, together with the surveillance evidence of 8 and 11 February 1996 and the contents of the motor vehicle when the arrest took place. In the vehicle was a sawn-off 12 gauge shot gun, white gloves, a red bandanna (with cut-out eye-holes) and sunglasses. The appellant had also dyed his hair black prior to the proposed robbery. All of this material could have been relied on by the jury to conclude that the appellant was guilty beyond reasonable doubt. The contested evidence of the so-called ‘admissions’ pales into insignificance alongside the balance of the evidence against the appellant. This is all the more so in light of his Honour’s remarks to the jury about the care which should be taken in considering the evidence. 
     32    Finally, should the admission of the evidence be in error, the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 ought be applied. The evidence did not mean that the appellant was deprived of the chance of an acquittal. Grounds of appeal 2 and 3 are rejected. 
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
     33    It is submitted that the verdict of the jury was unsafe and unsatisfactory. A number of ‘dot points’ are relied on in the written submissions filed on behalf of the appellant. Little was added in the oral address of counsel. None of the points sought to be made have any cogency to this ground. On the whole of the evidence adduced at the trial, it was plainly open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant (M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487). 
      
       
      Further Submission 
       
     34    During his oral address to the Court, counsel for the appellant submitted that the listening device tapes of 11 February 1991 should not have been admitted into evidence. It was submitted that this was so because the first and last mentioned dates in the indictment should be excluded from consideration on the basis that the indictment alleges the commission of the conspiracy between 5 and 11 February 1991. 
     35    The trial took place in 1996. The indictment was not demurred to nor was any objection made to its form. No objection to the admission of the tapes was made to the court on the basis now sought to be advanced. If objection had been taken to the form of the indictment, it could doubtless have been cured. 
     36    Leave to raise this ground is required under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. I am firmly of the view that leave should be refused. The point is, in any event, lacking in merit and I will briefly state why that is so. 
     37    In R v Dossi (1918) 13 CR App R 158 it was stated that: 
      
       
        
        From time immemorial a date specified in an indictment has never been a material matter unless it was actually an essential part of the alleged offence … 
        
       
     38    In R v Stringer [2000] NSWCCA 293 10 August 2000, Grove J said: 
      
       
        
        Although it is usual to insert the date or dates between which offences alleged to have been committed, time has been stated to be of the essence in four situations, namely: 
        
       
       
        
        (i) when an act is criminal only when done within a certain time of some other act or event; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) when it is an essential ingredient of a particular offence that certain consequences should follow a particular act; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) when it is an essential ingredient of a particular offence that the act alleged was committed between certain hours of the day or night; and 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) when the prosecution for a particular offence must be commenced within a certain time of the commission of the criminal act alleged. 
        
       
     39    See now s 58(g) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and, prior thereto, s 360 of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     40    Time is not of the essence with respect to the offence alleged in the subject trial and none of the exceptions mentioned in Stringer apply. The evidence of the events of 11 February 1991 were clearly admissible to prove the conspiracy charged. 
     41    To the extent that remarks made by Ferguson J in Ex Parte Bignell (1915) 32 WN (NSW) 91 are relied on, it is sufficient to note that the remarks were obiter and related to an alleged defect in an information before a magistrate. 
      
       
      Sentence 
       
     42    It is argued that the sentence is excessive. In particular, it is submitted that the additional term of 15 months was about one-quarter of the sentence (of 58 months) and that, in the absence of special circumstances, his Honour did not explain why it was not one-third. It is also submitted that the sentence should have been mitigated because of the conduct of the police informer in instigating or, at least, encouraging the offence. 
     43    I am firmly of the view that the sentence appeal should be dismissed. Bearing in mind the serious nature of the offence, involving a sawn-off shot-gun (albeit unloaded) and the appellant’s appalling criminal history, the sentence may be seen to be lenient. His Honour was clearly entitled to find that there were no special circumstances given that the appellant was unlikely to benefit from rehabilitation. The conduct of the police informer provides no basis to reduce the sentence. It is by no means clear that he instigated the planned robbery or encouraged the appellant to participate. 
     44    It is plain that the appellant willingly entered into the agreement and participated in its furtherance. The tapes reveal this to be the fact. There were, in fact, little or no mitigating factors. 
     45    Notwithstanding the relatively short additional term, I do not believe that this Court should intervene. Overall, the result of the sentence was a fair one and within the discretionary range available to the trial judge. While leave to appeal against sentence should be granted, the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
      Orders 
       
     46    1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
      
       
      2. Leave granted to appeal against sentence. 
       
       
      3. Appeal against sentence dismissed. 
       
     47    O’KEEFE J: I agree with Stein JA. 
     48    SIMPSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by Stein JA and with his reasons therefor.

        Peter Charles THORNELOE v Barbara FILIPOWSKI 
         
        
        
       
     The Appellant was the Master of a vessel from which a small amount of oil was discharged into the waters of Botany Bay during loading operations. Both he and the owner were charged and pleaded guilty to an offence against s27(1) of the Marine Pollution Act 1987. At sentencing proceedings before Talbot J in the Land and Environment Court, the owner was fined $38,000. The Appellant sought that his Honour apply s10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Act”) and dismiss the charge against him. His Honour refused to do so and fined the Appellant $7,000. The Appellant appealed.HeldA Inconsistencyper Spigelman CJ, Hulme and Howie JJ agreeing1 The decision of the trial judge not to dismiss the charge under s10 was not inconsistent with other sentencing decisions of the Land and Environment Court. There is no practice in the Land and Environment Court to apply s10 of the Sentencing Act in the case of a blameless Master when the company is also convicted and punished. Each case turns on its own facts. Morrison v Peers (1995) 87 LGERA 39, Morrison v Dilmun Navigation Co Pty Ltd (1995) 87 LGERA 257, Morrison v Ausmarine Fisheries Pty Ltd (1995) 88 LGERA 442, Valle v Morrison (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 22 November 1995, unreported), Morrison v Spliethoffs Bevrachtingscantoor BV (1996) 91 LGERA 318, Morrison v Che Mat (1997) 95 LGERA 212, Morrison v Kingston Marine Corporation Inc (Pearlman J, 26 February 1997, unreported), Leighton v Office of Marine Administration (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 5 December 1997, unreported), Filipowski v De Ocampo [1998] NSWLEC 119, Filipowski v Fratelli D’Amato Srl (2000) 108 LGERA 88 discussed.B Potential for Harmper Spigelman CJ and Hulme J, Howie J agreeing2 Section 27 of the Marine Pollution Act is a “result offence”. Sentencing for an offence under s27 may not take into account the potential for the result to occur. Brownlie v State Pollution Control Commission (1992) 27 NSWLR 78, Environment Protection Authority v Bathurst City Council (1995) 89 LGERA 79, McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Environmental Protection Authority (2000) 50 NSWLR 127, Taylor v Environment Protection Authority (2000) 50 NSWLR 48, The Queen v De Simoni (1980-1981) 147 CLR 383 referred to.3 The issue in the present case turns on s10 of the Sentencing Act. Section 10 has a scope and purpose which extends beyond the elements of the offence charged. The risk to which society was subjected is a proper consideration to be taken into account under s10, even in the context of a strict liability result offence like s27 of the Marine Pollution Act. Talbot J did not err in taking into account potential for harm. Cobiac v Liddy (1969) 119 CLR 257, R v Ingrassia (1997) 41 NSWLR 447 referred to.C The Exercise of the Statutory Powerper Spigelman CJ, Howie J agreeing4 Even in an offence of strict liability, no public purpose is served by recording a conviction or imposing a penalty where the accused could not have done anything to ensure that the offence or the adverse consequences did not occur. Lim Chin Aik v The Queen [1963] AC 161, Federal Steam Navigation Co Ltd v Department of Trade and Industry [1974] 1 WLR 505, Gammon (Hong Kong) Ltd v Attorney General of Hong Kong [1985] AC 1, He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1984-1985) 157 CLR 523 applied. 
      
       
     5 When, as in the case of s27 of the Marine Pollution Act, Parliament has expressly provided that both the owner and Master may be held liable for the same pollution, there is no reason to invoke a concept like “double penalty” as if it restricted the sentencing court in any way. Federal Steam Navigation Co Ltd v Department of Trade and Industry [1974] 1 WLR 505 referred to.per Spigelman CJ and Hulme J, Howie J agreeing6 His Honour erred in failing to take into account a relevant consideration under s10, namely, what the Master could effectively have done. 
      
       
     D Exercise of the Discretionper Spigelman CJ and Hulme J, Howie J agreeing 
      
       
     7 In this case it is appropriate to exercise the discretion under s10 of the Sentencing Act.Orders1 Appeal allowed.2 Order of the Land and Environment Court convicting and fining the Appellant set aside.3 The offence in proceedings No. 50039 of 2000 in the Land and Environment Court is proved but no conviction is recorded and the proceedings are dismissed.4 Costs order made by Talbot J in proceedings No. 50039 of 2000 in the Land and Environment Court against the Appellant to stand.

        JUDGMENT 
         
        
       
     1    SPIGELMAN CJ: The Appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of an offence against s27(1) of the Marine Pollution Act 1987. He was sentenced by Talbot J in the Land and Environment Court on 12 December 2000. The sentence imposed upon him was a fine of $7,000. 
      
       
     2    This appeal is brought pursuant to s5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 as applied by s5AB of that Act. Section 5AA was amended by the Courts Legislation Amendment Act 2000 which repealed the former ss5AA(3) and (3A). 
      
       
     3    The amendments to s5AA apply to appeals with respect to convictions or orders made after 25 September 2000 (see clause 6 of schedule 1, Criminal Appeal Act). For appeals after that date, of which the present is one, the appeal is an appeal in the strict sense. 
      
       
        
       Facts 
        
       
     4    At 11:18am on 12 August 1999, the tanker MT Eburna berthed at the No. 1 berth at the Caltex wharf at Kurnell. After appropriate safety checks, gas oil, which had been loaded in Western Australia, commenced to be discharged. That operation was carried on without incident between 1.10pm on 12 August 1999 and 5.15am on 13 August 1999. 
      
       
     5    On 13 August, the Master of MT Eburna, the Appellant, Peter Charles Thorneloe, received instructions to back-load a cargo of unleaded petrol which was to be transported to Melbourne. That petrol was to be loaded and distributed into a number of tanks on board the vessel. 
      
       
     6    Prior to the back-loading, appropriate checks were carried out by the crew of the vessel. In addition the Loading Master and the Surveyor from the Caltex terminal went on board to carry out checks, including a tank inspection and to take ullages - that is measure the capacity of the tanks. Permission was given by the terminal for the commencement of the loading. The operation commenced at 7.46am on 14 August 1999. It was anticipated that loading would continue for approximately 22 hours. 
      
       
     7    During the loading operation, the deck of the vessel was contained by the plugging of scuppers from the deck. This was intended to ensure that any spillage or overflow of oil product onto the deck area remained contained on board the vessel. 
      
       
     8    Rain fell during the loading period. On several occasions during the night, in order to allow rain water to drain from the deck, the scupper plugs were loosened and then re-tightened. Part way through the operation, the loading was suspended due to a thunderstorm. This was at approximately 7.35pm on 14 August 1999. 
      
       
     9    At 5.00am on 15 August 1999, Mr John Porter, a Sydney Ports Corporation Officer, prepared for a routine inspection of the tanker. At approximately 5.15am, having just left the Loading Master’s office, Mr Porter saw petrol coming from a vent about 5 metres aft of MT Eburna’s manifold and flowing over the deck. He immediately alerted the Load Master and went to the cargo room to speak to the Duty Officer. 
      
       
     10    The Appellant had been physically on duty on 14 August 1999 until 11.00pm when he retired. On the morning of 15 August he arrived at the cargo room at about the same time as Mr Porter did. He was able to give instructions to deal with the incident when it occurred. According to the sentencing judge, he acted “promptly and responsibly”. Pumping ceased very shortly afterwards. 
      
       
     11    Mr Porter observed that although there was petrol on the deck area of MT Eburna up to four to five inches in depth, only a small amount came down the side of the vessel and into the water. 
      
       
     12    The estimates of the amount of oil which was discharged to the water varied from a few litres up to 30 litres. On all accounts it was not large and did not require remedial action. It was barely detectable on the surface of the water. 
      
       
     13    The petroleum that was discharged escaped from the deck through a scupper plug which had not been fully re-tightened after it had been loosened to let rain water escape. When pumping was ceased a crewman tightened the nut on the relevant scupper plate. 
      
       
     14    A Nakakita gauge is used on tankers to measure the ullage in a tank. It consists of a float in the tank suspended on a wire which is attached to a drum mechanism on deck. There is an air supply and a spring in the drum which applies a tension to the wire. As the liquid level lightens, the float in the drum revolves, taking in the wire and this is displayed on a digital readout on deck and in the cargo control room. 
      
       
     15    If the liquid does not lighten the load of the float sufficiently, the drum will not revolve and therefore a false reading is given. The float moves below the surface of the liquid and becomes “stuck”. The Appellant said in his evidence before Talbot J that: “It is not uncommon for the Nakakita gauge to become stuck because of the way it operates”. 
      
       
     16    During the reloading, the No. 5 port Nakakita gauge had been “sticking”. It was reported on the changeover of watch at 4.00am on 15 August 1999. 
      
       
     17    It is of significance in this case that the Chief Officer who failed to recognise the defective reading being given by the Nakakita gauge on this occasion, did not do so as a result of the fact that he did not know that such gauges do behave in this manner. Indeed, he had been expressly told by the Second Officer, on the changeover, that this particular gauge had been sticking on that night. In view of the relatively simple nature of the required remedial action - a mere flicking motion - his failure to act on this information becomes pertinent to the issue as to what, if any, further action could have been expected on the part of the Master. 
      
       
     18    Talbot J, adopted the Appellant’s submissions before him with respect to the cause of the discharge. Those submissions were: 
      
       
        
         
         “The discharge into the water of a portion of the unleaded petrol on deck was directly caused by the failure of the crew to have properly tightened a scupper plug or plugs on the port aft side of the ship. Scupper plugs had been in place and secured before the loading operation commenced, but had been slackened off to permit rain water to escape on occasion through the procedure. The weeping of unleaded petrol through the scupper, and hence down the ship’s side and onto the water, was stopped by a tightening of the bolt holding the scupper plug. 
         
        
        
         
         The discharge of unleaded petrol to deck was clearly caused by the failure of the Chief Officer to adequately monitor a Nakakita gauge indicating the level in the No. 5 port wing tank. The gauge had been reported as ‘sticking’ when the Chief Officer came on duty. 
         
        
        
         
         Had the Chief Officer properly observed and monitored the gauge, and had he immediately reacted to the alarm which would have sounded as the tank approached completion, the discharge of petrol onto the deck would have been avoided.” 
         
        
       
     19    The owner of the ship, Shell Tankers (UK) Ltd (“Shell”) and the Appellant, as the Master of the ship, were summoned to appear in the Land and Environment Court on 8 September 2000 by the prosecutor, the Respondent in this appeal, to answer a charge which alleged contravention of s27(1) of the Marine Pollution Act 1987 (“the Act”). 
      
       
     20    Section 27(1) is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “If a discharge to which this Part applies occurs, each appropriate person in relation to the discharge and any other person whose act caused the discharge, are each guilty of an offence punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) if the offender is a natural person - 2,000 penalty units, or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) if the offender is a body corporate - 10,000 penalty units.” 
         
        
       
     21    The conversion of those penalty units into amounts is $220,000 for a natural person and $1,100,000 for a body corporate. 
      
       
     22    “Appropriate person” is defined in s25(1)(b) and means, relevantly, “the owner or the master of the ship”. 
      
       
     23    Section 26 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “This Part applies to a discharge of oil … into State waters: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) from a ship … in or in connection with a transfer operation.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     24    “Transfer operation” is defined in s25(1) to mean, relevantly: 
      
       
        
         
         “… any operation that is involved in the … carrying on … of, a transfer of oil … to or from a ship or a place on land.” 
         
        
       
     25    On the return date, both the Appellant and Shell pleaded guilty. The proceedings before Talbot J concerned only the issue of penalty. The hearing occurred on 11 December 2000 and judgment was given the following day. 
      
       
     26    His Honour noted that Shell conceded that it was liable for the failure of the Chief Officer to adequately monitor the Nakakita gauge and for the failure of the relevant crew member to properly tighten the scupper plugs on the port side of the ship after they had been slackened off to allow rain water to escape during the loading and unloading operation. 
      
       
     27    Shell was fined $38,000. In his Honour’s opinion, that penalty: 
      
       
        
         
         “… takes account of the actual circumstances under which the offence occurred where there was a faulty gauge and operational error and carelessness on the part of the chief officer and an unidentified crew member, the clean record of the defendant, and the early plea of guilty. Otherwise the appropriate penalty would, in my view, be significantly over $50,000.” (at [35]) 
         
        
       
     28    No appeal is brought from this aspect of his Honour’s decision. 
      
       
     29    Although Shell conceded its liability, it was submitted on behalf of the Appellant, that because his involvement in the events which caused the incident was such that there was no direct fault on his part and, having regard to the penalty that was to be imposed on the owner, he should be given the benefit of s10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Act”) by dismissing the charge against him. 
      
       
     30    Section 10 empowers a court to dismiss a charge without proceeding to a conviction, notwithstanding a finding of guilt. His Honour did not think it was appropriate in the circumstances of this case to apply s10. His Honour referred to a number of decisions including four decisions of Bignold J, namely Morrison v Peers (1995) 87 LGERA 39; Morrison v Dilmun Navigation Co Pty Ltd (1995) 87 LGERA 257; Morrison v Ausmarine Fisheries Pty Ltd (1995) 88 LGERA 442 and Morrison v Valle (1995) 87 LGERA 278. 
      
       
     31    The Appellant relied upon his Honour’s own decision in Filipowski v Fratelli D’Amato Srl (2000) 108 LGERA 88 at [137] where his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the Captain of the ship is properly to be regarded as the direct and immediate representative of the owner while the ship is under his command. To punish the Master or Captain of the ship personally for an occurrence over which he had no personal control, except in a detached overall sense where the owner had already been punished on the basis of its vicarious responsibility and the person directly responsible will also be punished, would, in my opinion be an excessive and unreasonable punishment.” 
         
        
       
     32    Talbot J distinguished that decision when he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “In that case it should be noted that both the owner and the person actually responsible were convicted and heavy penalties imposed on them.” (at [28]) 
         
        
       
     33    His Honour said that neither the Appellant nor Shell had had any prior convictions for this type of offence, and, in particular, that the Appellant had “an impeccable record at sea dating back to 1973”. 
      
       
     34    His Honour was of the opinion that although the amount of discharge was small: 
      
       
        
         
         “…nevertheless, the potential for significant harm arose as a consequence of the two established serious lapses in proper procedure. The Master must ultimately bear a responsibility for these breaches as the person in overall charge of the ship’s operations. It is not appropriate in the circumstances to apply the provisions of s10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.” (at [33]) 
         
        
       
     35    His Honour concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “An appropriate fine for the Master having regard to the whole of the circumstances is $7,000.” (at [36]) 
         
        
       
     36    The Appellant appeals from Talbot J’s decision. 
      
       
        
       Appeal 
        
       
     37    The Notice of Appeal asserts a single ground of appeal: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the circumstances of the commission of the offence, the objective features of the appellant, and the concurrent prosecution and conviction of the owner of the ship, it was inexpedient to record a conviction against the Master.” 
         
        
       
     38    This is a reference to s10 of the Sentencing Act. Section 10 states: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Without proceeding to conviction, a court that finds a person guilty of an offence may make either of the following orders: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) an order directing that the relevant charge be dismissed, 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding 2 years. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) An order referred to in subsection (1)(b) may be made if the court is satisfied: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment (other than nominal punishment) on the person, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) that it is expedient to release the person on a good behaviour bond. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (3) In deciding whether to make an order referred to in subsection (1), the court is to have regard to the following factors: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the person’s character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition, 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) the trivial nature of the offence, 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed, 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     39    Section 10 commenced operation on 3 April 2000. It replaced s556A of the Crimes Act 1900, which was to the same effect. Much of the relevant case law deals with s556A of the Crimes Act.  
      
       
     40    The Appellant submitted that he should not have been convicted and fined, but should have been given the benefit of s10. Submissions were directed to a dismissal under s10(1)(a), not a conditional discharge under a10(1)(b). 
      
       
     41    The former s556A contained the formulation “it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment” as a stepping stone to both a dismissal and a conditional discharge. This is reflected in the ground in the notice of appeal in this case. As set out above, s10(2) now refers to “inexpediency” only as a stepping stone to an order under s10(1)(b) i.e. a conditional discharge. Nothing turns on this for present purposes. 
      
       
     42    The Appellant particularly relied on the following factual matrix. 
      
       
        
       (i) The Appellant has an impeccable record at sea, commencing in 1973. 
        
        
       (ii) The Appellant pleaded guilty. 
        
        
       (iii) The ship owner pleaded guilty and was convicted and fined. The Appellant has no “additional moral culpability”; punishing him is a “double penalty”. 
        
        
       (iv) The person who should have carried the blame was the Chief Officer who failed to properly attend to the sticking Nakakita gauge in accordance with prescribed procedure and who subsequently ignored the alarm which ought to have alerted him to the prospect of an overflow. 
        
        
       (v) The second person with some direct culpability was an unidentified crew member who was negligent in failing to adequately re-tighten the scupper plug after it was loosened to allow the discharge of foam water from the deck. 
        
        
       (vi) During the period when the proper procedure was not adequately followed in the above two respects, (the lapses in procedure arose as a result of identifiable negligence by an unidentified crew member under the responsibility of the officer of the watch, namely, the Chief Officer) the Appellant was either asleep or had only recently wakened. 
        
       
     43    The submissions proceeded on the basis that the Appellant had to identify an error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion by Talbot J. A number of specific submissions were made as to how the discretion miscarried. 
      
       
     44    The first submission was that his Honour failed to give appropriate effect to the principle of consistency in sentencing. 
      
       
     45    The second submission was that his Honour erred when he took into account the “potential” for damage to the environment and not merely the actual harm that had occurred. 
      
       
     46    The third submission was that his Honour failed to take into account the circumstances of the case, in that he failed to give any or, alternatively, adequate consideration to the grounds that existed for the exercise of the statutory power under s10(1). 
      
       
     47    The fourth submission was that Talbot J failed to adequately articulate his reasons for decision. 
      
       
     48    The fifth submission was that the decision to record a conviction and impose a penalty was, in the circumstances, “contrary to public policy and the evinced purposes of the Act”. 
      
       
     49    The Respondent submitted that the decision of Talbot J was appropriate for three reasons. First, the factual circumstances show that the Appellant was culpable in failing to ensure that the Chief Officer monitored the Nakakita gauge and that the crew were reminded of their responsibilities when loosening the scupper plugs; secondly, due to the principles in the case law relevant to s10 of the Sentencing Act (and its precursor - s566A of the Crimes Act); and thirdly, by application of the principles said to have been laid down by this Court in Valle v Morrison (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 22 November 1995, unreported) and in Leighton v Office of Marine Administration (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 5 December 1997, unreported). 
      
       
     50    As to the first point, the Respondent submitted that the Appellant was culpable in that he knew of the potential problems associated with Nakakita gauges in “light” cargo and should have ensured the Chief Officer was aware of these problems too. Further, he was aware of the wet conditions and should have reminded the officers and crew of the need to tighten scupper plugs after rain water was drained off the deck. 
      
       
     51    In relation to the second point, the Respondent submitted that the cases which have applied s10 (or s556A) are distinguishable from the present case.  
      
       
     52    The third point arises from the statement of Allen J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Sully J agreed in Valle v Morrison (supra): 
      
       
        
         
         “It is a matter of notoriety that all too often it is not possible to sheet home to any individual responsibility for a spillage in the sense of establishing that it was his act or omission which caused it. The purpose of s8 in imposing strict liability upon the owner and upon the master, as well as upon any individual found to be responsible, is to deal with this potential disaster of oil spillage by making the owner and the master responsible without personal fault. In those circumstances an argument that no punishment should be visited on a master, unless personal fault is established, is clearly untenable.” (at 7-8) 
         
        
       
     53    The Appellant submitted that Talbot J’s finding that the Master must bear responsibility as the person in overall charge does not imply a finding of culpability as suggested by the Respondent. It was not the Appellant’s duty to “follow the Chief Officer around” to ensure he did everything correctly. It was submitted to be “absurd” to assert that the Appellant should constantly have reminded the crew to tighten the scupper plugs. 
      
       
        
       The First Submission 
        
       
     54    Consistency in sentencing is an important objective - Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610-11. Nevertheless, within a range, there is room for differences in approach - R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371; R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 221D-E. The Appellant contended that a pattern had emerged in the practice of the Land and Environment Court to apply s10 in the case of an entirely blameless Master, when the company is also convicted and penalised. 
      
       
     55    In my opinion, the case law does not reveal any such pattern. 
      
       
     56    Indeed, the sentencing judges have been at pains to point out that it was always open to the court to convict both the company and the Master. Furthermore, the cases relied on by the Appellant are distinguishable. Accordingly, a different result raises no issue of consistency. 
      
       
     57    In Morrison v Peers (supra) a small amount of oil was discharged into the water. The estimate in that case was that the amount discharged was 5 to 10 litres. The ship’s crew acted promptly and efficiently in order to clean up the oil and the Master co-operated with the following investigation. Both the owner and the Master pleaded guilty early in the proceedings. In addition, neither the owner or the Master had any prior convictions in respect of an environmental offence. The Master had been at sea since 1961 and had captained ships since 1991. It was also submitted as a factor in mitigation that a conviction of the Master would be likely to prejudice his professional career and expressly present problems for him being in United States waters. 
      
       
     58    Bignold J thought that it was a case where a reasonably lenient penalty should be imposed upon the ship’s owner in view of the fact that it was the owner’s first environmental offence, the owner co-operated with the investigation and that an early plea of guilty was entered. His Honour was satisfied that the failure did not occur as a result of defective equipment or inefficient cargo handling procedures, or from negligence or carelessness on the part of the ship’s Master or crew. (The cause of the discharge in that case was traced to a gasket which had become loose in the cam-locks which connected the hose which was used to transfer the cargo from the ship’s manifold to the pipeline). 
      
       
     59    His Honour imposed a fine of $40,000 on the owner. However, his Honour said that he came to the “firm conclusion” that the Master should obtain the benefit of the favourable exercise of the then s556A of the Crimes Act. His Honour noted: 
      
       
        
         
         “Although this Court has often suggested that it will be a fairly rare case for s556A to be applied to a person guilty of an environmental offence it has never foreclosed the availability of that judicial discretion, and has, on occasions, exercised it in favour of a defendant … 
         
        
        
         
         In forming the necessary opinion in the present case I not only rely upon the mitigating circumstances … that I have earlier summarised but also upon the fact that I have already convicted and imposed an appropriate fine upon the ship owner of its offence  
         arising out of the same oil discharge incident 
          which  
         also 
          constitutes the basis for the master’s liability under s8(1) of the Act. The facts of that conviction and that fine in my judgment are proper matters to consider in the exercise of the discretion conferred by s556A in favour of the master.” (at 42-43 emphasis in original) 
         
        
       
     60    His Honour concluded that the punishment of the owner adequately vindicated the Act and its enforcement. In Bignold J’s opinion, to go further and punish the Master for the same oil discharge incident, would be excessive and involve the risk of a double penalty in respect of the single event. Nevertheless, his Honour did note that his conclusion in the case before him was not such that “there may not be cases in the future where punishment of both the master and ship owner is called for”. Bignold J said that it was simply the case that “the present circumstances do not require the conviction and punishment of the master in addition to the ship owner” (at 43). 
      
       
     61    In Morrison v Dilmun (supra) a reasonably small amount of oil was discharged into the waters of Botany Bay. The estimates in this case ranged between 40 and 50 litres - this is a slightly larger amount than the amount in the present case. The discharge occurred during loading operations and was caused when a gasket forming part of the loading equipment broke. A swift clean-up was effected and there was no actual environmental harm. The Master, who had retired after a long and unblemished career of service, was acting as a relief Master. Neither he nor the owner had knowledge of the inadequate and makeshift nature of the gasket. 
      
       
     62    Bignold J said that although he readily accepted that the owner had no actual prior knowledge, he was unable to excuse the owner given the strict liability imposed by the Act. In the circumstances of the case, he thought the owner should be punished and imposed a penalty of $30,000. 
      
       
     63    Nevertheless, he came to the conclusion that the Master should receive the benefit of s556A of the Crimes Act. As in Morrison v Peers, his Honour said that the conviction and fining of the owner “adequately vindicates the Act and the prosecutor’s enforcement of it and that to go further and to punish the Master for the same incident would involve an excessive sentencing response in the circumstances of this case” (at 260). However, his Honour went on to say: 
      
       
        
         
         “… I would not wish my decision to be understood (either by itself or in combination with my earlier decision in  
         Morrison v Peers 
         ) as suggesting that where an owner is convicted and fined, the discharge of the master pursuant to s556A of the  
         Crimes Act 
          will follow as a matter of routine. Far from it, and neither case (nor the cases taken together) can possibly justify such a proposition. Rather each case, decided on its own facts, merely demonstrates that the Court has been satisfied that a master should have the benefit of a discharge pursuant to s556A of the  
         Crimes Act 
          in circumstances where the master’s character and antecedents and the extenuating circumstances of the case justify that conclusion in the light of the Court’s concurrent conclusion that the conviction and fining of the owner is a sufficient curial response on behalf of the public for the oil discharge incident.” ( 
         ibid 
         ) 
         
        
       
     64    In Morrison v Valle (supra) both the owner and the Master pleaded guilty to the charge. In that case a small amount of diesel oil escaped into the water during the loading of the diesel from a bunkering vessel; the amount was between 10 and 15 litres of diesel fuel. It was quickly contained by a boom and successfully cleaned up. The Master co-operated fully with the authorities, but was unable to say how the spillage had occurred other than it emanated from the diesel fuel tank within the ship via an air vent pipe leading from the tank and which extended about 70 centimetres above the deck level. It was said that there was a safety margin in the fuel tank of 3.3 cubic metres and that the spillage, accordingly, was not the result of overflowing the tank. (The immediate cause of the spillage was the clearing by a blast of air pressure from the vessel of the connecting fuel line between the ships, rather than any cause referrable to the equipment or the operation of the ship). 
      
       
     65    For both the owner and the Master, it was their first environmental offence. Both entered early guilty pleas. His Honour was of the opinion that notwithstanding the mitigating factors, it was appropriate that both the owner and the Master be fined. The penalty imposed upon the owner was $40,000 and, in the case of the Master, $20,000. In this case, Bignold J referred both to Morrison v Peers and Morrison v Dilmun and noted that in those cases he had discharged the Masters pursuant to s556A of the Crimes Act. In his Honour’s opinion: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the facts of the present case are quite distinguishable and are such that I consider the master must be held accountable for the pollution incident in what was a routine fuel bunkering operation which apparently had been undertaken  
         with some want of operational care 
         , resulting in an avoidable discharge of oil into the port waters. In these circumstances, clearly it would not be reasonable to attribute full or major blame for the pollution incident to the owner (who is exposed to a far greater maximum penalty prescribed by the Act). The greater blame in the present case must be held to lie with the Master. The objects of the Act are achieved by the conviction and penalty of both defendants.” (at 281 emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     66    Bignold J also considered the question in Morrison v Ausmarine (supra). In that case, the discharge of oil occurred during bunkering operations. The vessel was receiving diesel oil from road tankers while moored at Darling Harbour. Oil flowed out of the forward overflow pipe and through both the port and starboard drain holes and then into the water. The only explanation for the spillage was that the valve on No. 1 tank had been left open during the loading of the stern tanks after the forward fuel tanks had been filled. His Honour estimated that about 200 litres escaped onto the decks of the vessel and that a “somewhat smaller amount” found its way into the harbour. 
      
       
     67    Both the owner and the Master (who was also the Chief Engineer) pleaded guilty. In dealing with the benefits of pleading guilty for this offence his Honour said that the benefit: 
      
       
        
         
         “… is however not great, given the strict liability nature of the offences and the consequent high probability, all other things being equal, of conviction following from circumstances such as those attendant on this case.” (at 444) 
         
        
       
     68    His Honour noted that the amount of oil discharged was “significantly greater” than the amounts involved in the cases of Morrison v Valle, Morrison v Peers and Morrison v Dilmun. Bignold J said that the fact that the ship did not have all the standard safety systems cannot be seen as the mitigating factor in the context of remedial legislation such as that provided by the Act. His Honour fined the owner $80,000 and the Chief Engineer $40,000. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “This case is distinguishable from those recent cases in which the discretion under s556A of the  
         Crimes Act 
          1900 has been applied favourably to an individual defendant (in each case, the master). 
         
        
        
         
         In this case, given the knowledge that the chief engineer undoubtedly had of the ship’s bunkering facilities, especially in this technical capacity qua an engineer, and the apparent  
         want of operational care 
          associated with the failure to close the relevant valve in this case, it cannot be said, (as I held in  
         Peers 
         ) that the conviction and fining of the owner alone adequately vindicates the Act and the prosecutor’s enforcement of it. To ‘go further and punish the master ‘is not’ an excessive sentencing response’ in the circumstances of this case, but is the required and just response. In  
         Peers 
         , it was emphasised that the failure did not occur due to defective equipment or negligence (at 42). Such was not the case here. In  
         Dilmun 
         , a case decided after  
         Peers 
         , I again invoke s556A. In that case it was also decided that merely punishing the owner, was a sufficiently curial response to the pollution incident. … Additionally, in that case the master was a temporary or ‘relief master’, and that was regarded as an extenuating circumstance. Nothing could be further removed from this case, in which the chief engineer would in all probability be highly familiar with the ship and its operational requirements.” (at 446-447 emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     69    His Honour referred to his judgment in Morrison v Dilmun at 260, quoted above, and added: 
      
       
        
         
         “Consistency in sentencing is desirable, and achievable, especially with respect to the amounts imposed by way of fines.  
         But each case depends intrinsically on its own facts, and this principle has a special application in the case of the exercise of discretion under s556A. Section 556A is an exceptional discretion and is very much the exception to the rules 
         . This view is supported by the most recent decision under this Act,  
         Morrison v Valle 
         , where the application of s556A was rejected in a case concerning bunkering operations held to have and engaged in without due care.” (at 447 emphasis added). 
         
        
       
     70    On the appeal of Morrison v Valle to this Court (Valle v Morrison (supra)) Allen J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Sully J concurred, expressed (at 11) his “entire agreement” with these observations of Bignold J in Morrison v Ausmarine. 
      
       
     71    In Morrison v Spliethoffs Bevrachtingscantoor BV (1996) 91 LGERA 318, the amount of oil discharged was small. This case was concerned with s8 of the Act. The owner and the Master relied upon the defence provided by s8(2)(b) with respect to “damage” to the “ship or its equipment”. They submitted that the oil leaked out of a faulty hatch which was damaged and would not close properly. His Honour concluded that that defence was not satisfied and found the offence proved against the owner and the Master. 
      
       
     72    Neither the owner nor the Master had had any prior convictions. The Master had only joined the ship in Brisbane. He knew little or nothing about the condition of the ship’s hatch machinery. A conviction and fine was imposed on the owners, but the Master was discharged pursuant to s556A. 
      
       
     73    In Morrison v Michel (Stein J, unreported, 14 June 1996), at least 100 litres of oil was discharged into Botany Bay due to a damaged stiffener of the tank bulkhead in one of the starboard tanks. Both the Master and owner pleaded guilty and had no prior record for an environmental offence. The Master had no knowledge of the damaged stiffener. 
      
       
     74    In relation to a submission that he apply s556A, Stein J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I have considered the submission but conclude that it would be inappropriate, in the circumstances of this incident, to extend the benefit of the section to the defendant. I regard the offences to be of moderate seriousness … .” 
         
        
       
     75    In Morrison v Che Mat (1997) 95 LGERA 212, the vessel in question was at Port Botany loading heavy bunker fuel oil. There was an oil leak into the hold of the vessel due to a faulty manhole seal over one of the tanks. Heavy rainfall occurred at the relevant time and, as the hatch covers were opened to permit cargo operations, an amount of rain water entered the hold. The Chief Officer ordered that the hold bilge be pumped overboard. This occurred for about one hour. Sheahan J found that 150 litres of oil was discharged during this pumping operation. The owner, the Master and the Chief Officer pleaded guilty to offences under s8(1) of the Act. None had prior convictions. 
      
       
     76    His Honour found that the discharge of oil resulted from the order to pump given by the Chief Officer who was in effective command of the ship at the time. He gave that order without reference to the Master. His Honour said that if the Master had been asked, he would not have approved of the order. However, his Honour said that: 
      
       
        
         
         “While he must bear some responsibility, as the person who performed the relevant act, the real failure in this case is the failure to publish some policy manual, and to educate crew members in, and enforce, perfectly commendable policies such as forbidding bilge pumping in port. 
         
        
        
         
         Both the company and the Master have responsibilities in that regard.” (at 226) 
         
        
       
     77    Sheahan J said that he could see no grounds for applying s556A. The penalties imposed were $50,000 for the company, $10,000 for the Master and $1,000 for the Chief Officer. 
      
       
     78    In Morrison v Kingston Marine Corporation Inc (Pearlman J, 26 February 1997, unreported) between 100 and 150 litres of oil was discharged into White Bay. The incident occurred during the discharge of ballast from a heeling tank. There was a fracture in the bulkhead between the heeling tanks and an oil settling tank. During the emptying of the ballast, oil leaked into the healing tank and from there was pumped into the water. 
      
       
     79    Pearlman J found that there was no reason to suspect that the ballast system was contaminated. Her Honour said that although the spill was significant, it was contained and there was no actual environmental harm. 
      
       
     80    Both the owner of the vessel and the Master pleaded guilty. Neither had been involved in a pollution incident before. The owner was fined $50,000, however her Honour dismissed the Master’s charge under s556A. Her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The application of s556A is not a routine matter in cases such as these, and it is to be applied as an exceptional discretion (see  
         Morrison v Ausmarine 
          …). However, given the lack of blame that can be attributed to Captain Haacker personally in this matter, and taking into account his unblemished environmental record in over 36 years of seafaring, over 20 of which have been in command of vessels, I think that it is appropriate in this case to extend the benefit of s556A to him.” 
         
        
       
     81    In Morrison v MAFI (Bignold J, 8 August 1997, unreported) coconut oil was discharged from a vessel into White Bay. Both the Master and the owner pleaded guilty to the offence. The coconut oil was being transferred from the vessel to road tankers when a rupture in the flexible rubber hose via which the coconut oil was being pumped to the tankers caused 500 litres to escape. The oil escaped initially onto the ship’s deck, however 300 litres spilled over the ship into the water via a starboard scupper plug which had been left open. No harm was caused. 
      
       
     82    In an unchallenged affidavit, the Master said that the transfer operation was being conducted by a stevedore employee, not by a member of the ship’s crew. The defence submitted that that fact, together with the fact that neither the Master nor the owner had a prior conviction and the circumstances of the case meant that no conviction should be recorded. Bignold J did not accept the Defendant’s submissions, noting that: 
      
       
        
         
         “… it is apparent that the spill may not have occurred if the scupper plug had not been left in the open position. This default is clearly the responsibility of the ship’s crew and ultimately of the Master.” 
         
        
       
     83    Bignold J went on to say: 
      
       
        
         
         “Clearly there was fault on the part of the ship’s crew in the failure to close the starboard scupper through which the escaped coconut oil was discharged from the ship into the Port Waters.” 
         
        
        
       and 
        
        
         
         “… the offence … involved an obvious element of carelessness by the ship’s crew in leaving open the starboard scupper.” 
         
        
       
     84    His Honour fined the owner $20,000 and the Master $10,000 for this discharge described by his Honour as “at the very low end of the spectrum of seriousness.” 
      
       
     85    In Leighton v Office of Marine Administration (supra) the owner, the Master and the Third Mate were charged. Oil escaped via a vent pipe from a water ballast tank. At the time the Third Mate was filling a heeling tank with ballast. The ultimate cause was due to the wasting, and presence of a hole, in a ballast pipe. The quantity discharged was between 1.5 and 2 tonnes. 
      
       
     86    At trial, Bignold J had found the charges made out. His Honour refused to apply s556A and sentenced all the defendants. Although the Master had had an unblemished prior record, he was fined $10,000. It was from this that the Master appealed. 
      
       
     87    Ireland J, a judge with considerable personal knowledge of the merchant marine and with whom Gleeson CJ and Bruce J agreed, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “With respect to the appellant, it was submitted that having regard to his prior unblemished seafaring record throughout his career, he also should not be the subject of penalty. … 
         
        
        
         
         Notwithstanding the mitigating factors to which he made reference, his Honour was firmly of the opinion that the offences charged in this case were so serious and the circumstances of their commission so grave that convictions in respect of the offences committed by both the owner and the Master were undeniably justified.” 
         
        
       
     88    His Honour discussed the relevant case law and concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “This is not a case in which a statutory offence has been established in the absence of knowledge on the part of the Master of a vessel of circumstances which could give rise to the offence unless properly attended to. Unfortunate as the consequences of the imposition of a penalty are to a person of unblemished record in the position of the appellant, in my view it could not be said in the circumstances of this case that the failure on the part of the learned sentencing judge to exercise the discretion available to him not to proceed to conviction by exercise of the powers available under s556A of the  
         Crimes Act 
          miscarried.” 
         
        
       
     89    In Filipowski v Ryong [1998] NSWLEC 63, 500 litres of soya bean oil was discharged into White Bay. About 98 percent of the soya bean oil was recovered. No environmental harm ensued from the discharge and Sheahan J placed the discharge in a “less serious” category of case. The owner was fined $50,000 and the Master $25,000. His Honour said that the two Defendants were “not entitled to the benefit of s556A”. It should be noted, however, in this case that the Defendants, the owner and the Master, did not respond to the service of process and the proceedings were conducted ex parte. 
      
       
     90    Filipowski v De Ocampo [1998] NSWLEC 119, involved a spill of fuel oil from a vessel, the Stolte Otome, berthed at Kurnell. The Stolte Otome was bunkering 60 tonnes of diesel bunkers. Prior to the load being finished, one of the bunkers overflowed the ship’s starboard diesel tank. The Chief Engineer asserted that the ship had already received 60 tonnes, but the tank gauges on the delivery tank showed that only 50.5 tonnes had been delivered. Most of the oil that had overflowed onto the deck was mopped up, however, about 20-30 litres of oil overflowed the side of the ship and spilled into the waters of Botany Bay. After the immediate clean up operation, the oil was dispersed; there was no evidence of any oil on the water (or of any environmental harm) later that day. 
      
       
     91    Lloyd J found the reason for the discharge was that either the crew did not adequately monitor the rising level of fuel in the recipient tank, or they did not direct the shore base loading personnel to stop the delivery of fuel oil in sufficient time to avoid the spillage. His Honour said that the responsibility for the spill “lies on those receiving the fuel oil to ensure that the receiving tank does not overflow” (at [25]). Both the owner and the Master pleaded guilty; the Chief Engineer did not. However, since the Chief Engineer admitted that he was on duty supervising the bunkering operations at the time, his Honour was satisfied that the Chief Engineer was a person whose act “caused the discharge” (s8(1)) and was also guilty of the offence. 
      
       
     92    Lloyd J noted that the owner had not previously been charged with a pollution offence. His Honour compared the penalties imposed on owners in relation to similar cases “of a minor oil spill” and said that having regard to the circumstances of the case, it should be fined $30,000. 
      
       
     93    However, in relation to the Master, his Honour noted that the Master “was not on duty when the incident which gave rise to the present charges occurred. He had apparently left the chief engineer in charge of the bunkering operation” (at [26]). When the alarm sounded the Master proceeded to the deck and took command of the crew in relation to the clean up operation. The Master had been at sea for 18 years and never previously been involved in an oil spill. Lloyd J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “In light of all these facts, to go further and punish the master for the same oil discharge incident, where the mere fact that the basis for his liability under s8(1) of the Act arises by dint of his status would, in this instance, be an excessive response. 
         
        
        
         
         Accordingly, I accept Mr Williams’ submission that the court should exercise its discretion under s556A of the  
         Crimes Act 
          1900 in favour of the master. This approach is consistent with the approach to penalty adopted by Bignold J in  
         Morrison v Peers 
          … and in  
         Morrison v Dilmun Navigation 
          … although the facts in other cases need not necessarily call for the same approach.” (at [26]-[27]) 
         
        
       
     94    The Chief Engineer, whom his Honour found was the person whose act caused the discharge, was fined $10,000. 
      
       
     95    In Filipowski v Esar Bunkering Group Ltd (Lloyd J, 17 November 1998, unreported) both the Master and the owner pleaded guilty to an offence under s8(1) of the Act. The circumstances of the case were that the Esar Sydney, a bunkering barge, was berthed unattended at Brotherson Dock at Port Botany. While berthed, there was a discharge of oil into the waters from the vessel. This happened on 26 January 1997. The discharge was not discovered until 29 January 1997. At that time, it was cleaned up satisfactorily and there was no evidence of any environmental damage as a consequence of the incident. 
      
       
     96    The discharge occurred because one of the scupper plugs had been left in the inboard position. Rain which fell while the vessel was unattended flowed into the slop tank instead of overboard. The slop tank filled and the bunded area of the vessel overflowed and oily water in turn overflowed onto the waters at the dock. It was estimated that the quantity of oil spilled was small and that the discharge was a light sheen covering less than 100 square metres. There was no evidence of any environmental damage. 
      
       
     97    At the time of the incident, the owner had a set of standing operation instructions (“marine standing orders”) which contained maintenance and operating instructions of a general nature. They did not refer specifically to the operation of scupper valves. Nevertheless, it was asserted by the owner’s general manager that written instructions were given to all crew specifically instructing them that the scupper valves were to be left in the overboard position when the vessel was unmanned and in the slop tank position when work was being carried out. 
      
       
     98    After the incident, the scupper valves were reconditioned and a sign was placed adjacent to each stating that they were always to be locked in the overboard position when the vessel was unattended. 
      
       
     99    The owner had a prior conviction. (The circumstances of that previous conviction were similar in that a scupper valve had been left in an inboard position which caused an overflow of oily water into Berry’s Bay.) His Honour said that whilst the maximum penalty should be reserved for the worse case of offence, “a repeat offender should not obtain the leniency which might otherwise be afforded even in a case involving a small discharge without any environmental damage” (at [13]). His Honour fined the owner $50,000. 
      
       
     100    The factors in mitigation argued in respect of the Master were that it was his first offence, the incident rose out of an “inadvertent incident” and that there was no evidence that the Master was personally aware that the valve was in the wrong position. Lloyd J referred to the passage of Allen J in Vale v Morrison referred to above and which was also quoted by Talbot J in this case. His Honour then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “In applying what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
         Vale 
          above, I also take into account the evidence of Mr Green [the general manager], to which I have referred in paragraph 8 above: the Master is the person responsible for pollution prevention and it is his responsibility to check that the scupper valves are turned to the outboard position rather than the inboard position when the vessel is to be left unattended. In my view, these considerations lead to the conclusion that the Master should not receive any special leniency. It was his responsibility to check the valves when the vessel was to be left unattended. I can only conclude that he did not do so.” (at [16]) 
         
        
       
     101    The Master was fined $20,000. 
      
       
     102    Filipowski v Terminals Pty Ltd (1999) 105 LGERA 165 was a decision of Pearlman J. Nonyl phenol was discharged into Botany Bay during the unloading of a vessel. A stainless steel ball valve on the pressure relief line had been left open. The amount discharged into the water was less than 40 litres. 
      
       
     103    The owner and an employee were charged; both pleaded guilty. In relation to the s556A argument, her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I do not think that this is an appropriate case for the exercise of the Court’s discretion. First, the application of s556A is rare, especially in cases concerning environmental offences: see  
         Morrison v Peers 
          … 
         
        
        
         
         As to Mr Ethell, I take note that, in some marine pollution cases, the master of the vessel has sometimes been given the benefit of s556A. But this is not a case of indirect responsibility such as may pertain in the case of a master. Mr Ethell was the only person from Terminals on the wharf platform at the time of the spill, and he was directly responsible for the operation of the apparatus from which the discharge emanated. I can discern no extenuating circumstances which would justify dismissal of the charges against him.” (at [73]-[74]) 
         
        
       
     104    The case on which the Appellant placed particular weight was the decision of Talbot J in Fratelli D’Amato (supra), that case concerned a very large spill of oil which occurred into the waters of Gore Bay on 3 August 1999. That discharge took place while cargo was being unloaded to the Shell Oil Terminal in Gore Bay. It went unobserved for at least 25 minutes and 294,000 litres of Murban oil escaped into the Bay. The ship owner, the Master and the Chief Officer were charged. All pleaded guilty. 
      
       
     105    The spill occurred due to the failure to carry out proper tests on particular valves, sea chest valves, on the sea suction line. The sea suction line permits water to be pumped into the cargo system, for example, to provide extra ballast. In this operation, it was a supplementary line to the cargo pipeline system and was being used as a cargo cross-over line. 
      
       
     106    It was the failure of the Chief Officer to carry out a proper and adequate test of the sea chest valves before engaging in the sea cross-over line that allowed the oil to be discharged. 
      
       
     107    Talbot J, in relation to the owner, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Court recognises that a company must rely almost entirely upon the capability and diligence of its employees. In the case of a shipping company, the extent of delegation and trust is essentially remote in the sense that direct control over every day actions and decisions is not possible. That is not to say, however, that the company is entitled to abdicate its responsibility so far as it extends, particularly in relation to the provision and maintenance of appropriate directions in regard to protocol and procedure.” (at [115]) 
         
        
       
     108    His Honour said that at all relevant times the Master (the Captain), the Chief Officer and other crew members were severally responsible for the management and functions of the ship. In particular, it was the responsibility of the Master to oversee the total operation. However, the Chief Officer: 
      
       
        
         
         “…had direct and immediate responsibility for the management of cargo handling, including the operation or decisions relating to the use of the various lines and valves within the ship. 
         
        
        
         
         The system broke down when procedures that fell within the ambit of the Chief Officer were not followed. The Court is satisfied that the Chief Officer was performing a function he was employed and authorised by the agent of the owner to carry out. The failure to perform that function in a proper manner is therefore attributable to the owner as the ultimate employer … .” (at [122]-[123]) 
         
        
       
     109    The owner was fined $510,000. As to the Chief Officer, he acknowledged that although he reported directly to the Master on a day-to-day basis, and the Master is in overall charge of the ship, the Master has no practical role in pumping and transfer operations. The responsibility for opening and closing the valves rested with either the Chief Officer or the Chief Mate. Talbot J said that though he had acknowledged his error and pleaded guilty, he was directly responsible and accordingly he was fined $110,000. 
      
       
     110    According to Talbot J, the situation of the Master was different. He was not directly involved in the process of unloading cargo, although he was monitoring the activity on board at the time. The Court accepted that he had no direct responsibility for the operation of the sea valve. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The most that can be said against the Master of the ship is that he had a responsibility to ensure that safety procedures were followed in all respects of the tanker’s operation. … 
         
        
        
         
         The prosecutor asserts that the Captain is nevertheless responsible to see that the Chief Officer carries out his tasks correctly, including the necessary tests of the sea chest valves. … 
         
        
        
         
         However, the Captain of the ship is properly to be regarded as the direct and immediate representative of the owner while the ship is under his command. To punish the Master or Captain of the ship personally for an occurrence over which he had no personal control, except in a detached overall sense where the owner has already been punished on the basis of its vicarious responsibility and the person directly responsible will also be punished, would, in my opinion be an excessive and unreasonable punishment.” (at [134], [135] and [137]) 
         
        
       
     111    It was this last passage which the Appellant asked Talbot J to apply in the present case. In the judgment of Talbot J in this case he distinguished his earlier reasoning by saying that in Fratelli D’Amato both the owner and the person actually responsible were convicted and heavy penalties were imposed on them. 
      
       
     112    In Fratelli D’Amato, his Honour concluded with regard to the Master that having regard to the whole of the circumstances surrounding the event and its cause “and after taking into account the respective duties of the Master of the ship and the Chief Officer” he was satisfied that it would not be appropriate to convict the Master and that the offence, while proved, should be dismissed under s556A of the Crimes Act. 
      
       
     113    My review of the authorities indicates that the Court has consistently stated that there is no practice for a “blameless” Master to be discharged without conviction, whenever the company is convicted (Morrison v Dilmun at 260; Morrison v Ausmarine at 447; Valle v Morrison at 11). Each case requires the exercise of a discretion on the basis of the whole of the circumstances.  
      
       
     114    No pattern of sentencing has been shown to exist with which the judgment of Talbot J in this case can be said to be inconsistent in any relevant sense.  
      
       
     115    The authorities indicate that the Master is not discharged under s10 in cases where the discharge has been caused by a failure in the operations on board, save where another senior employee with direct responsibility has been convicted. 
      
       
     116    The present case is distinguishable from those where the discretion has been exercised in favour of a Master. In Morrison v Peers and  Morrison v Dilmun the discharge was not caused by any error on the part of the crew - in the first case the gasket became loose, and in the second a gasket blew. In Morrison v Spliethoffs the Master had joined the ship very recently and knew little about the ship’s machinery which proved defective. In Morrison v Kingston Marine Pearlman J also relied on the absence of any reason to suspect the defect in the equipment. 
      
       
     117    As noted above, the Appellant placed particular reliance on the decision in Fratelli D’Amato. As to his Honour’s way of distinguishing the present case, (namely that in Fratelli D’Amato both the owner and the person actually responsible were convicted and heavy penalties imposed on them), the Appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is odd that Captain Thorneloe has been convicted and fined because the prosecutor failed to prosecute the person really responsible.” 
         
        
       
     118    In Fratelli D’Amato, the Chief Officer was prosecuted on a different basis from the owner and Master in that case, or in this. The owner and Master were not accused of culpable conduct in either case. The Chief Officer in Fratelli D’Amato was, however, charged with “causing the discharge”. In the present case the discharge was the combined effect of two acts: the negligence of the Chief Officer, which caused the release of oil onto the deck of the ship, and the negligence of an unidentified seaman, which caused the discharge into the harbour. 
      
       
     119    By s26 of the Act, s27 applies to a discharge “into State waters”. The liability of the Chief Officer on the basis of “causing the discharge” was at best problematic. His act did not directly lead to a discharge into State waters. The seaman was not identified. I do not suggest that these facts could not constitute an offence on the part of the Chief Officer. However, it is understandable why he was not charged. 
      
       
     120    In the present case, Talbot J expressly distinguished his own decision in Fratelli D’Amato on the basis that in that case the person who was actually responsible for the discharge was convicted and charged. This was also regarded as a relevant factor by Lloyd J in Filipowski v De Ocampo. 
      
       
     121    In Morrison v Che Mat Sheahan J found that the liability of the Chief Officer was not sufficient to discharge the Master in that case. Nor was the liability of the Third Mate in Leighton v Office of Marine Administration. Each case will turn on its facts. However, in my opinion Talbot J was entitled to distinguish his own earlier decision on the basis that a person on board the ship, with more direct hands-on responsibility than the Master, had been convicted in that case.  
      
       
     122    No relevant inconsistency has arisen. This ground of appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       The Second Submission 
        
       
     123    His Honour’s reference to both the small amount actually discharged and the “potential for significant harm” was made in the paragraph of his reasons where his Honour was dealing with s10. By subs 10(3) the Court is obliged to take into account the “triviality of the offence”, “the extenuating circumstances” and any “other matter”. The issue is whether risk of harm, being harm which does not eventuate, is a relevant consideration in the exercise of the statutory discretion to make an order that “without proceeding to conviction … the relevant charge be dismissed”. 
      
       
     124    The “potential for harm” arose because a substantial quantity of oil had been discharged onto the deck but which had not gone overboard. This is the ‘potentiality’ to which I understand his Honour was referring in par [33] of his reasons as quoted above.  
      
       
     125    It is often, perhaps usually, relevant to sentencing to take into account the potential harm of a crime, a potential which has not occurred or been averted. Relevance will, however, depend on the nature of the offence.  
      
       
     126    For example, in the case of an armed robbery, it is relevant that a firearm was in fact loaded, even though the potential harm did not eventuate. In the case of importation or supply of drugs, quantity is material because of the potential harm to the community if the drugs had in fact been distributed. (See e.g. R v Wong (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 at [130]). 
      
       
     127    The general principle is that sentence must be “proportionate to the gravity of the crime considered in the light of its objective circumstances” (Hoare v The Queen (1989) 169 CLR 348 at 354). The question whether the “objective circumstances” are limited to actual consequences or extend to potential consequences, is surprisingly free of direct authority. 
      
       
     128    In Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 at 473 the High Court emphasised that the protection of society is a relevant consideration in the exercise of the sentencing discretion: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is one thing to say that the principle of proportionality precludes the imposition of a sentence extended beyond what is appropriate to the crime merely to protect society; it is another thing to say that the protection of society is not a material factor in fixing an appropriate sentence. The distinction in principle is clear between an extension merely by way of preventative detention, which is impermissible, and an exercise of the sentencing discretion having regard to the protection of society among other factors, which is permissible.” 
         
        
       
     129    With respect to most criminal offences, the protection of society is served by taking into account the threat to society even if, in the particular circumstances, the threat has not eventuated. 
      
       
     130    The potential for harm has frequently been taken into account in the context of offences for which mens rea is a requirement. The potential for harm often affects the individual culpability of the offender. Whether a gun is loaded during an armed robbery is an example of this proposition. 
      
       
     131    Text writers support the relevance of potential harm in such a context. An example is Fox & Freiberg: “Sentencing: State and Federal Law in Victoria” (2nd ed) at 225-226: 
      
       
        
         
         “The sentencer is entitled to look at the potential or actual consequences of the criminal conduct even if there is a difference between what the accused intended to occur, or took the risk of occurring and what in fact happened.” 
         
        
       
     132    There will, however, be statutory offences for which the potential for harm will not be a relevant consideration. The issue is one of statutory construction. In the case of s27 of the Marine Pollution Act, two matters are particularly significant. First, it is an offence of strict liability. Secondly, it is an offence which turns on a particular result the actual discharge of oil into waters. (For present purposes the distinction between “strict” and “absolute” liability is not material. See Mosley “Oil Spills - State and Federal Legislative Conundrums” (1998) 15 EPLJ 212). 
      
       
     133    For some purposes it has proven useful to distinguish cases which focus on the conduct of an alleged offender, from cases in which that conduct must be followed by some specified consequence. The former have been referred to as “conduct offences” and the latter as “result offences”. This form of differentiation is sometimes of significance for purposes of identifying the requisite territorial connection between the offence and the alleged infringement. (See e.g. Treacy v Director of Public Prosecutions [1971] AC 537 at 560; Director of Public Prosecutions v Stonehouse [1978] AC 55 at 65; Thompson v The Queen (1988-1989) 169 CLR 1 at 24).  
      
       
     134    Section 16 of the Clean Waters Act 1970 which provides that “A person shall not pollute any waters” has been described as a result offence by Gleeson CJ in Brownlie v State Pollution Control Commission (1992) 27 NSWLR 78 at 83: 
      
       
        
         
         “To adopt and modify a term used elsewhere … the offences created by s16 are ‘result offences’. The occurrence, or likelihood of occurrence, of a certain consequence is a necessary element of the offence and is, indeed, the focal point of the legislature’s concern with the conduct in question. The relevant consequence is the polluting of New South Wales waters. So far as the  
         Clean Waters Act 
          is concerned, for a farmer to spray his crops with pesticide is an entirely neutral activity unless it has, or is likely to have, a particular consequence for New South Wales waters.” 
         
        
        
       See also  
       Environmental Protection Authority v Bathurst City Council 
        (1995) 89 LGERA 79 at 81-82 and  
       McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Environmental Protection Authority 
        (2000) 50 NSWLR 127 at [48]-[49]. 
        
       
     135    In the context of some environmental offences the effect of pollution identifies a particular result or consequence which is an essential ingredient of the offence. (See McConnell Dowell (supra) [47] and [49] and Taylor v Environment Protection Authority (2000) 50 NSWLR 48 at [23]). 
      
       
     136    In Hunter Water Board v State Rail Authority of New South Wales [No 2] (1992) 75 LGRA 22 at 23 Stein JA said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is accepted by the prosecution that there was very little environmental harm as a result of the spill. However, on behalf of the Board, Ms Murrell relies on the potential harm - which was serious - and points to the good fortune of the community, and the defendant, that serious environmental damage was avoided in great part by reason of favourable tides.” 
         
        
       
     137    It appears that Stein J regarded “potential harm” as relevant to penalty. On appeal to this Court, State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Hunter Water Board (1992) 28 NSWLR 721 at 726 Gleeson CJ, with whom Cripps JA and Slattery AJ agreed, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “There was no error of fact or principle in his Honour’s approach to the discretionary issue of penalty …” 
         
        
       
     138    Gleeson CJ made no express reference to the way Stein J took into account “potential harm”. Nor does it appear from the report of the appeal that there was any suggestion that his Honour’s discretion miscarried by having done so. 
      
       
     139    Section 16(1) of the Clean Water Act 1970 created the offence in direct terms: “A person shall not pollute waters”. However, by s16(1)(a)(ii) a person is deemed to pollute waters if matter is placed where “it is likely to fall, descend, be washed, be blown or percolate into any waters etc.” Furthermore, by s16(c) of the Clean Waters Act contravention of s16 constitutes an offence against the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 1989 (the “EOP Act”). By s9 of the EOP Act a court is required to take into consideration on penalty “the extent of the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment”. 
      
       
     140    The word “likely” is protean. (See Minister Administering the Crown Lands Act v Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council (No 2) [2001] NSWCA 28 at [28]-[57]). If it means “real chance or possibility”, then it encompasses “potential for harm”. If it means “better than 50-50 chance”, it probably does not. This issue was not raised in this Court in State Rail Authority of NSW v Hunter Water Board. The EOP Act does not apply to contraventions of the Marine Pollution Act. It is not necessary to decide it in this case. 
      
       
     141    By s15 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983: 
      
       
        
         
         “15(1) Every employer shall ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all the employer’s employees.” 
         
        
       
     142    By sub15(2) an employer is deemed to contravene the subsection if, inter alia, it fails to provide or maintain plant and systems which are “without risks to health”, or fails to make arrangement “for ensuring safety and absence of risks to health …” with respect to certain activities or fails to provide a working environment “that is safe and is without risks to health and adequate as regards facilities for their welfare at work”. 
      
       
     143    By reason of the extended application of the statutory prohibition to various kinds of “risks”, the potential for harm becomes a material consideration and has been so regarded in the case law. (See e.g. WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v Ecolab Pty Ltd (1999) 90 IR 413 at 429-431; Lawrenson Diecasting Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (1999) 90 IR 464 at 476; Tyler v Sydney Electricity (1993) 47 IR 1 at 5; Wong v Melinda Group Pty Ltd (1998) 82 IR 118 at 131; WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v Fernz Construction Materials Ltd (No 2) (2000) 100 IR 23 at 32-33). 
      
       
     144    Furthermore, s15 is not a result offence. Its focus is on a state or condition rather than a result or consequences. The potentiality for harm arises by reason of the existence of the state or condition. 
      
       
     145    Unlike, s16(1) of the Clean Water Act and s15(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, nothing in s27 of the Marine Pollution Act expressly extends the scope of the statutory prohibition beyond a specific consequence to encompass the creation of a potentiality - whether probability or possibility - for that consequence to occur. 
      
       
     146    In my opinion, a sentence for an offence under s27 of the Marine Pollution Act may not take into account the potential for the result to occur, the actual occurrence of which is an essential ingredient of the offence. To take potential for harm into account would be to punish the offender for conduct which would constitute a difference offence for sentencing purposes, i.e. a larger “discharge”.  
      
       
     147    This analysis is analogous to, but not dependent on, the principle reflected in the High Court decision in The Queen v De Simoni (1980-1981) 147 CLR 383. In that case the High Court determined that it was not appropriate on sentence to take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence. What the High Court was considering was an offence created by a difference section of the Act, being an aggravated version of the offence with which the accused was charged.  
      
       
     148    In a context where an actual result is an essential ingredient of the offence, taking into account the potential for greater harm that may have, but did not, occur, also punishes the accused for an offence which he, she or it did not commit.  
      
       
     149    The present case turns on s10 of the Sentencing Act. By subs10(3)(b), (c) and (d) the Court is required to have regard to the “triviality” and “extenuating circumstances” of the offence. In both cases the restriction imposed by the word “offence”, in the case of s27 of the Marine Pollution Act, focuses on an actual discharge. Issues of potentiality do not arise. 
      
       
     150    The submission that Talbot J took into account irrelevant considerations, turns, in my opinion, on whether potential harm is a “proper matter” for a sentencing judge to “consider” when exercising the discretion to order that “the relevant charge be dismissed”. As the reference to “relevant charge” makes clear, a primary consideration in determining what it is “proper” to “consider” will be the essential elements of the offence. This will vary from case to case. 
      
       
     151    The discretion conferred by s10 is wide-ranging. There is no warrant for treating the scope and range of matters which it is “proper” for a sentencing judge to take into account in a narrow way. Nevertheless, it is a discretion which must be exercised judicially. The identification of relevant considerations turns on the scope and purpose of s10. 
      
       
     152    As Windeyer J said in the context of concluding that the then equivalent of s10 in South Australia applies to the offence there under consideration: 
      
       
        
         
         “The whole history of criminal justice has shewn that severity of punishment begets the need of a capacity for mercy. The more strict a rule is made, the more serious become the consequences of breaking it, the less likely it may be that Parliament would intend to close all avenues of exception. Especially when penalties are made rigid, not to be reduced or mitigated, it might seem improbable that Parliament would not retain a means of escaping the imposition of a penalty which must follow upon conviction, that it would abolish it, not directly but by a side wind. This is not because mercy, in Portia’s sense, should season justice. It is that a capacity in special circumstances to avoid the rigidity of inexorable law is of the very essence of justice.” ( 
         Cobiac v Liddy 
          (1969) 119 CLR 257 at 269). 
         
        
       
     153    The last sentence of this passage was quoted with approval by Gleeson CJ when he said in R v Ingrassia (1997) 41 NSWLR 447 at 449: 
      
       
        
         
         “The essence of s556A is that it empowers a court which considers that a charge has been proved, in certain circumstances, to take certain steps ‘without proceeding to conviction’. The legal and social consequences of being convicted of an offence often extend beyond any penalty imposed by a court.” 
         
        
       
     154    Notwithstanding, the width of the ameliorative purpose of s10, it does, in terms, direct attention to “the relevant charge”. The scope and purpose of s10 will, to some extent at least, vary from one offence to another. 
      
       
     155    I have not found it easy to determine whether a factor which is not relevant on sentencing for the charge, can nevertheless be a “proper” matter to be considered when exercising the discretion under s10. On balance, I have concluded that s10 does have a scope and purpose which extends beyond the elements of the offence of the “relevant charge”. I refer in particular to the effects of the act of recording a conviction, to which Gleeson CJ referred in Ingrassia. 
      
       
     156    The risk to which society was subject is, in my opinion, a relevant and, accordingly, a “proper” consideration to be taken into account in deciding whether to dismiss proceedings without proceeding to a conviction. This is so even in the context of a strict liability result offence like s27. 
      
       
     157    The offence in this case would bear a different complexion if the small amount of oil actually discharged into the water, being 10-30 litres, had been the only oil negligently released onto the deck of the ship. The significance of the conduct for which the Master was held responsible would be lower. The conduct would be properly regarded as less serious. 
      
       
     158    In my opinion, when Talbot J referred to, and took into account, the potentiality for harm, he was “having regard to” a consideration which it was open to him to regard as “proper to consider”. The second submission should be rejected. 
      
       
        
        
        
        
       The Third Submission 
        
       
     159    This rolled up submission, in essence, is that the proper exercise of discretion in all of the circumstances ought to have led the Court to exercise the statutory power under s10(1). A number of specific propositions were advanced in support of this general submission. One is of particular significance. The Appellant submitted that Talbot J failed to give any, or alternatively, adequate consideration to what the Appellant could have done to avert the discharge. 
      
       
     160    The various elements, to all of which his Honour referred, pertinent to the exercise of the s10(1) power, included the small actual discharge, the lack of blame on the part of the Master, his good character and lack of prior convictions. All of these matters are, of course, entitled to weight and his Honour referred to them. The balancing of such considerations is a process on which reasonable minds may differ. The essence of the Appellant’s general case was that the result itself shows that his Honour must have given inappropriate weight, or failed to give appropriate weight, to a relevant matter. 
      
       
     161    The submissions emphasised the fact that the company was convicted. The Appellant asked rhetorically:  
      
       
        
         
         “… what is the utility in convicting and punishing a blameless Master on precisely the same facts for which the corporate owner was also convicted and punished.” 
         
        
        
        
       
     162    This submission fails to acknowledge the distinctive roles of the owner and the Master with respect to the operation of ships. In Federal Steam Navigation Co Ltd v Department of Trade and Industry [1974] 1 WLR 505 Lord Salmon said at 526: 
      
       
        
         
         “The object of making the owners liable is to discourage them from taking a tolerant attitude towards a master who causes pollution. The object of making the master personally liable is to ensure that he will do everything he can to avoid pollution.” 
         
        
       
     163    Some of the case law in the Land and Environment Court refers to a “double penalty”. The origins of that phrase is the judgment of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in Federal Steam Navigation where his Lordship said at 516-517: 
      
       
        
         
         “… there is some force in the contention that if both owner and master are liable to be convicted there could be the risk of a double penalty in respect of the one event.” 
         
        
       
     164    When, as in the case of s27 of the Marine Pollution Act, the Parliament has expressly provided that both the owner and Master may be held liable for the same pollution, there is no reason to invoke a concept like “double penalty” as if it restricted the sentencing court in any way. In Federal Steam Navigation Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest was in dissent on this very point. He concluded that under the statute there under consideration, either the owner or the Master - but not both - could be convicted. The majority decided otherwise. The identification by Lord Salmon of the distinct bases for responsibility of the owner and the Master represents the majority view. The idea of “double penalty” has no role to play in this context. 
      
       
     165    In Hunter Water Board v State Rail Authority of New South Wales [No 2] (supra) at 23, Stein J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “This Court has not infrequently stated that it will be a rare case when a dismissal under s556A is seen as appropriate for an environmental offence, especially a breach of the  
         Clean Waters Act 
         .” 
         
        
       
     166    On appeal to this Court, Gleeson CJ, with whom Cripps JA and Slattery AJ agreed, said at 726G that there was no error in his Honour’s approach to penalty. 
      
       
     167    The formulation “a rare case”, or equivalent words, has been applied in the Land and Environment Court a number of times. (See e.g. Morrison v Peters (supra) at 42; Morrison v Kingston Marine (supra); Clarke v Environment Protection Commission (1997) 98 LGERA 114 at 116; Filipowski v Terminals Pty Ltd (supra) at [73]). 
      
       
     168    Similar issues have arisen under s15 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act which I have set out above. In Schultz v Tamworth City Council (1995) 58 IR 221 at 229, Fisher CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The use of s556A of the  
         Crimes Act 
         , which in the light of the strongly defined duty of care, clear public policy considerations in the Act and major penalties provided, ought to be rare indeed … .” 
         
        
       
     169    This formulation has frequently been used in the Industrial Relations Commission. See the joint judgment of Wright, Walton and Hungerford JJ in WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v Profab Industries Pty Ltd (2000) 49 NSWLR 700 at [19], [21], [26]. 
      
       
     170    I would reject the Appellant’s general submission that the result itself suggests legal error. However, one of the Appellant’s specific submissions requires further consideration. As noted above, the Appellant challenged whether Talbot J had given any, or, alternatively, adequate consideration to the fact, for which the Appellant contended, that no reasonable action on the part of the Master could have averted the incident. 
      
       
     171    Even in the case of an offence of strict liability, no public purpose is served by recording a conviction or imposing a penalty in circumstances where the relevant accused could not, as a matter of practical reality, have done anything to ensure that the offence or, in the case of a result offence, the adverse consequences of the conduct, did not occur. 
      
       
     172    Lord Scarman expressed the purpose of imposing strict liability in Gammon (Hong Kong) Ltd v Attorney General of Hong Kong [1985] AC 1 at 14: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the creation of strict liability will be effective to promote the objects of the statute by encouraging greater vigilance to prevent the commission of the prohibited act.” 
         
        
       
     173    To similar effect are the observations of Lord Evershed in Lim Chin Aik v The Queen [1963] AC 161 at 174: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is pertinent also to inquire whether putting the defendant under strict liability will assist in the performance of the regulations. That means there must be something he can do, directly or indirectly, by supervision or inspection, by improvement of his business methods or by exhorting those whom he may be expected to influence or control, which will promote the observance of the regulations. Unless this is so, there is no reason in penalising him, and it cannot be inferred that the legislature imposed strict liability merely in order to find a luckless victim.” 
         
        
       
     174    In He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1984-1985) 157 CLR 523, immediately prior to quoting this passage from Lim Chin Aik, Brennan J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It requires clear language before it can be said that a statute provides for a person to do or to abstain from doing something at his peril and to make him criminally liable if his conduct turns out to be prohibited because of circumstances that that person did not know or because of results that he could not foresee. However grave the mischief at which a statute is aimed may be, the presumption is that the statute does not impose criminal liability without mens rea unless the purpose of the statute is not merely to deter a person from engaging in prohibited conduct but to compel him to take preventive measures to avoid the possibility that, without deliberate conduct on his part, the external elements of the offence might occur. A statute is not so construed unless effective precautions can be taken to avoid the possibility of the occurrence of the external elements of the offence.” 
         
        
       
     175    Brennan J, Lord Evershed and Lord Scarman were concerned with determining whether a particular offence required mens rea. However their Honours’ reasoning suggests that in the case of any criminal offence the Parliament will be strongly presumed to be concerned to impose liability only in the case of events that could have been avoided by some action on the part of the accused.  
      
       
     176    As Lord Salmon said in the Federal Steam Navigation case, immediately after the passage quoted above, at 526: 
      
       
        
         
         “I can see nothing unfair in making the master guilty for any contravention of section 5. If the vessel is not fitted with the proper equipment and the master knows it, he should refuse to put to sea until the vessel is properly equipped. If he puts to sea when there has been some contravention of section 5 of which he could not have known, no court, were he to be prosecuted, would do more than impose a nominal fine, or give him an absolute discharge.” 
         
        
       
     177    Although Lord Salmon understated the responsibility of the owner - which extends to establishing systems, guidelines and practices - nevertheless, there is a difference between the absentee character of ownership and the direct involvement in operations of the Master. Both share responsibilities. The object of ensuring greater vigilance in the context of strict liability is served by imposing as the Parliament has done, coordinate, and not merely derivative, obligations on both. 
      
       
     178    It is, in my opinion, relevant to the exercise of the discretion under s10 of the Sentencing Act, in the context of a strict liability offence, to consider what the applicant for the benefit of s10 could have done to avert the event that has occurred. While questions of weight are always for the sentencing judge, it is unlikely that this consideration will be given determinative weight in the case of a serious offence or a repeat offender. Where, as here, there was a comparatively minor pollution by a first offender, this consideration is entitled to weight. 
      
       
     179    In par [33] of his Reasons, where Talbot J considered s10, there is no reference to anything the Master could have done. Nor is there any such reference elsewhere in the judgment. To repeat part of par [33], the crucial step in his Honour’s reasoning appears to be:  
      
       
        
         
         “… the potential for significant harm arose as a consequence of two established serious lapses in proper procedure. The Master must ultimately bear a responsibility for these breaches as the person in overall charge of the ship’s operations.” 
         
        
       
     180    His Honour was referring to “responsibility” for the two operation breaches which combined to cause the discharge: the Chief Officer’s error with the gauge and the seaman’s failure to properly tighten the scupper. His Honour described these as “two established serious lapses in proper procedure”. 
      
       
     181    Nothing in his Honour’s formulation “The Master must ultimately bear a responsibility …” suggests that in determining the application of s10, his Honour took into account what, if anything, the Master could have done to prevent the discharge. I have come to the conclusion that this was a relevant consideration to which his Honour failed to have regard. 
      
       
     182    His Honour appears to have applied a practice that has developed in the Land and Environment Court to hold the Master responsible for discharges occasioned by some defect in operations, save where the senior officer directly responsible is convicted. That will be an appropriate outcome in many, if not most cases. The approach is not applicable in all cases. 
      
       
     183    I have concluded that the exercise of the s10 discretion miscarried by reason of his Honour’s failure to take into account a relevant consideration. It falls to this Court to exercise the discretion afresh. In this respect I agree with Hulme J and the reasons his Honour gives. 
      
       
     184    The circumstances, particularly the unblemished record of the Appellant and the small size of the discharge indicate that this is an appropriate case for the exercise of the discretion. Consideration of what the Master could have done to avert the discharge supports this conclusion. 
      
       
     185    In the case of the failure to tighten the scuppers after the rain, this was an operational breach. However, unlike the cases of Morrison v MAFI and Filipowski v Esar Bunkering Group, the scuppers were not ignored completely - there was an inadequate attempt to tighten them. With respect to the Nakakita gauge, the Chief Officer did not merely know that such gauges sometimes stick. He was expressly told that this particular gauge was sticking on that night. He neglected to take the simple remedial step of flicking the gauge. 
      
       
     186    No doubt some further guidance or training might have made a difference in each case, but it is difficult to identify any effective step which the Master could have taken that does not require virtual perfection. 
      
       
     187    I would uphold this submission. 
      
       
        
       The Fourth Submission 
        
       
     188    I have summarised his Honour’s reasons above. His Honour stated that the Appellant must “bear a responsibility for the breaches as the person in overall charge of the ship’s operations”. The breaches had been identified earlier in the reasons, namely the combined effect of the sticking Nakakita gauge and the failure to properly tighten the scupper plate. 
      
       
     189    Both these acts were done by persons under the Appellant’s overall control and for whom it was appropriate the Appellant bear responsibility, subject to the considerations I have outlined in dealing with the third submission. In my opinion his Honour’s express reference to “bearing responsibility” for breaches which his Honour had earlier identified, constituted an adequate statement of reasons. 
      
       
     190    I would reject this submission. 
      
       
        
       The Fifth Submission 
        
       
     191    This was barely pressed. It was submitted that the public policy underlying the enactment of the Marine Pollution Act was adequately met by conviction of the owner. As outlined above, the Master has distinctive obligations. Indeed, these are emphasised by the statutory scheme which separately refers to owners and masters. 
      
       
     192    I would reject this submission. 
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
     193    The orders I propose are: 
      
       
        
       1. Appeal allowed. 
        
        
       2. Order of the Land and Environment Court convicting and fining the Appellant set aside. 
        
        
       3. The offence in proceedings No. 50039 of 2000 in the Land and Environment Court is proved but no conviction is recorded and the proceedings are dismissed. 
        
        
       4. Costs order made by Talbot J in proceedings No. 50039 of 2000 in the Land and Environment Court against the Appellant to stand. 
        
        
       
     194    HULME J: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading, in draft form, the Reasons for Judgment of the Chief Justice. 
      
       
     195    I agree with his Honour’s conclusions in respect of the first, fourth and fifth grounds of appeal and with his Honour’s reasons for those conclusions. 
      
       
     196    Turning to the second ground of appeal, substantially for the reasons given by his Honour, I am of the view that in the determination of a sentence for an offence under s27 of the Marine Pollution Act, it is not permissible to take into account the potential for a discharge of a greater quantity than in fact occurred or of the potential for damage of such a larger discharge. That is not to say that the potential for harm of the actual discharge the subject of the offence is not relevant, even if greater than the harm that did occur. Thus I would respectfully agree with the approach of Stein J in Hunter Water Board v SRA (No 2) (1992) 75 LGRA 22 at 23 that where harm is less than it might otherwise have been by reason of fortuitous events for which a Defendant can claim no credit a Court is entitled to take into account against a Defendant what might have happened as a result of the discharge which constitutes the offence. To go this far accords with the general tenor of authority which permits weight to be given to the possible consequences of a Defendant’s conduct in the course of commission of a crime.  
      
       
     197    In relation to this second ground, there remains the question whether in any consideration of s10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999, the potential for harm of a (potential) greater discharge which did not occur may be taken into account as an “other matter that the court thinks proper to consider.” 
      
       
     198    In empowering a court to either dismiss a charge or discharge on a good behaviour bond an offender who is guilty, s10 permits the adoption of a more lenient approach than merited by the strict application of the relevant law against which a defendant has offended. However it is clear that it is not only mitigating circumstances to which regard may be had. Thus while the matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of sub-section 3 are of that nature, those in sub-paragraph (a) are not necessarily so.  
      
       
     199    The express reference in sub-paragraph (c) to only those circumstances which are “extenuating” provides some ground for the view that “any other matter” in sub-paragraph (d) should not be regarded as extending to circumstances which are of an aggravating kind. On the other hand any judgment of whether the circumstances in which an offence is committed are extenuating of necessity requires attention to all such circumstances including those which, in isolation, might be regarded as of an aggravating nature. It would be unreal to suggest that such matters could be taken into account in determining whether an offence is committed in extenuating circumstances but for no wider purpose and thus it seems to me that “any other matter” in sub-paragraph (d) includes all the circumstances of an offence. 
      
       
     200    In the circumstances of this case that includes the discharge of fuel onto the deck of the ship with the potential consequences associated with that event. I agree that the second ground of appeal fails. 
      
       
     201    I turn to the third ground. One may accept the numerous statements to which the Chief Justice has referred to the effect that, in the case of environmental offences, it is rare for s556A (the precursor to s10) to be applied. However, when one comes to consider a particular case, it seems to me preferable to look primarily at the considerations which arise in that case. These will, of course, include the nature of the offence as defined in the statute creating it and the penalty provided together with the perceived object of the relevant statutory provision. But, subject to such matters, there is no reason to give s10 any more restricted operation in the case of environmental offences than in the case of the general run of offences to which it applies. 
      
       
     202    What Talbot J said when directing attention to the possible application of s10 in this case was:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The Master, Captain Thorneloe, has an impeccable record at sea dating back to 1973. He was first appointed master of a vessel in 1997. He has never had or been involved in spillage of product either as chief office or as a master. 
         
        
        
         
         That record together with his plea of guilty clearly entitles him to a significant discount ( 
         R v Thompson; R v Houlton  
         [2000] NSWCCA 309) on the penalty which might otherwise be imposed absent those matters in mitigation. 
         
        
        
         
         Although the amount of product discharged from the ship may have been low (between 10 and 30 litres), nevertheless, the potential for significant harm arose as a consequence of the two established serious lapses in proper procedure. The master must ultimately bear a responsibility for these breaches as the person in overall charge of the ship’s operations. It is not appropriate in the circumstances to apply the provisions of s10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
         
        
        
         
         Both defendants have shown contrition in statements presented to the Court.” 
         
        
       
     203    The “lapses” and “breaches” were, of course, the Chief Officer’s neglect to attend properly to the gauge and the failure of a crew member to tighten one scupper plug sufficiently.  
      
       
     204    From the passage I have quoted, it appears that His Honour regarded the potential for significant harm, the lapses in proper procedure and what he saw as the Master’s ultimate responsibility for these as sufficient to outweigh the other factors he mentioned and which argued for the application of s10. His Honour did not advert to the topic of what, if anything, the Master could have done to prevent the lapses.  
      
       
     205    That such a matter is relevant to the exercise of the discretion under s10 is amply demonstrated by the reasons of the Chief Justice. To them I would add only this. Of the 5 principal general considerations in sentencing - general deterrence, personal deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation and protection of the community - see Veen v R (No 2) (1987-88) 164 CLR 465 at 476, the last two are normally of little additional consequence where, as in this case, the penalty takes the form of a fine. Retribution may well have a part to play but save insofar as considerations of deterrence may cause actual or prospective offenders to cease activities which have associated with them risks of the commission of strict liability offences, there is little point in punishing someone for an event which he could have done nothing to avert. 
      
       
     206    And the topic of what the Appellant could have done is in my view of such significance that Talbot J’s failure to refer to it is indicative of error. His Honour has failed to “take into account some material consideration … his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so” - House v R (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. 
      
       
     207    It was submitted on behalf of the Respondent that there were 3 things the Appellant could have done to prevent the discharge occurring. It was submitted firstly that the gauge was faulty and, implicitly, should have been fixed; secondly, the Appellant could have issued a news bulletin or standing instruction in relation to the operation of the gauge; thirdly, aware of the need to drain rain water from the decks, he should have ensured that the officers and crew were reminded of their responsibilities when loosening scupper plugs. 
      
       
     208    The first of these matters was not one of the 2 matters relied on by Talbot J and although his Honour did, elsewhere in his Reasons, refer to the gauge as “faulty” he gave no reasons for that conclusion. There was evidence before him that the gauge did have problems or the possibility of problems when lighter cargoes of the nature of that the subject of the discharge were being loaded but there was a known way of dealing with them. The fact that an item of equipment does not work perfectly in all conceivable circumstances without additional human intervention does not, of itself, demonstrate it is necessarily faulty. His Honour did not discuss whether he accepted or rejected the evidence to which I have referred and in light of the absence of discussion on this topic, and his Honour’s failure to refer to it in the passage I have quoted, it does not seem to me that this matter is one which should be regarded as of present relevance. 
      
       
     209    The suggestion that the issue of a news bulletin or standing instruction in relation to the operation of the gauge was something further that the Appellant might have done cannot be denied. It is always possible to issue yet one more piece of paper or a repeat of an instruction. But in light of the fact that the Chief Officer ignored the specific warning of the Second Officer, I see no grounds to infer that a general instruction or standing order would have made the slightest difference. Indeed, it seems to me that the probabilities are that they would not.  
      
       
     210    In part similar remarks may be made in respect of the one scupper plug through which the discharge occurred and which, according to remarks of Talbot J, apparently required only one nut to be tightened when the problem was discovered. The fact that there was only one plug which leaked despite the quantity of liquid on deck which has led to the view that the potential for harm was serious suggests that the crew knew what they were to do and that the error was in the execution of the very simple task of tightening one nut. It is sheer speculation to suggest that more training or instruction would or even might have made any difference. 
      
       
     211    And in relation to these matters, it is relevant to bear in mind an instruction which the Appellant did give. Talbot J did not refer to it but it appears at page 89 of the Appeal Book. It is entitled “Master’s Orders to the Chief Officer” and contains the following:- 
      
       
        
         
         “You are responsible for the safe loading and discharge of the cargo with the assistance of the Deck Officers, Crew and, if necessary, Engineers. … 
         
        
        
         
         When setting up systems or altering them during the operation make sure someone double-checks your actions.” 
         
        
       
     212    The evidence does not disclose whether or not the tightening of the scupper-plugs was double checked but whatever be the situation in that regard, what is there to suggest another instruction from the Appellant would have made any difference? 
      
       
     213    Relevant also is evidence given by the Appellant, and not challenged, that prior to this incident the Chief Officer had, since his boarding the vessel 6 weeks earlier, performed his duties satisfactorily and without difficulty and evidence that following the incident the owner of the vessel determined that the Chief Officer should be demoted (though he resigned to prevent this). This evidence establishes that the Chief Officer was at all times at risk of disciplinary action. It is reasonably to be inferred that he would have known that defaults on his part such as that which has led to these proceedings would be likely to be followed by significant sanctions, and thus there is further ground for thinking that no further instruction from the Appellant would have made the slightest difference so far as the Chief Officer’s conduct is concerned. 
      
       
     214    In summary, I see no grounds for thinking that there was anything further the Appellant could have done to avoid the discharge which occurred. While that, of course, does not relieve him of liability under s27 of the Marine Pollution Act 1987, it is a matter properly to be taken into account under s10. Talbot J did not do so and thus his sentencing discretion miscarried and it falls to this Court to re-sentence. 
      
       
     215    For reasons indicated above I do not regard considerations of deterrence or retribution as requiring the imposition of any penalty on the Appellant. In light of his impeccable record, the minimal harm which actually occurred and the absence of any personal fault, the case is one in my view where, despite the terms of s27 and the objects of the Marine Pollution Act, it is appropriate to exercise the discretion under s10(1)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
      
       
     216    In that regard, I should acknowledge the practice of the Land and Environment Court to which the Chief Justice has referred of holding the Master responsible (and not applying s10) save where the senior officer directly responsible is convicted. Clearly the conviction and punishment of another senior officer (and/or the Owner) as a vindication of the policy behind the legislation and perhaps as sufficient retribution for the commission of the offence may be relevant to the exercise of the discretion under s10. However, it would be quite wrong to regard the happening of such events as pre-conditions for the exercise of the discretion.  
      
       
     217    In my view the appeal should be allowed, the conviction and sentence quashed and in lieu thereof the Court should, while finding the offence proved, direct that the charge be dismissed. 
      
       
     218    In case there be any doubt, I should indicate that I would allow the order of Talbot J in relation to costs before him to stand. The charge was properly brought. Section 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act precludes any order in respect of the costs in this Court.  
      
       
        
       
     219    HOWIE J: I agree with the orders proposed and reasons given by both Spigelman CJ and Hulme J.

     Judgment 
      
       
        
       
     1    SIMPSON J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Sperling J and I agree with the orders he proposes. I wish to add a little about the first ground of appeal. That is the ground concerning the credit afforded to the applicant in relation to his pleas of guilty. 
      
       
        
       
     2    It must be borne in mind that Howie DCJ sentenced the applicant on 29 March 2000, before publication of the guideline judgment of this court in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSW CCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. That judgment significantly altered the approach to be taken in relation to the manner in which a plea of guilty is to be treated. Most importantly, as a result of the decision in Thomson and Houlton, the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty is treated as a separate and distinct issue. That does not necessarily diminish the recognition that may be given to it for other reasons such as contrition, of which it may be evidence, although care must be taken not to overvalue a plea of guilty to the extent that the sentence imposed becomes inadequate. Relevant to the determination of the utilitarian value of a plea are its timing, and the length and complexity of the trial that is avoided thereby: Thomson and Houlton [154]. 
      
       
        
       
     3    A plea of guilty may (but does not necessarily) provide evidence of contrition, which itself is a matter that may reduce the length of the sentence to be imposed. Contrition alone is, in any event, of little relevance to sentencing; it is significant because it, in turn, offers some hope that the offender has renounced criminality. Contrition is not evidenced only by a plea of guilty, and is, in my opinion, most commonly evidenced in other ways, such as apology (where accepted as genuine) or reimbursement of losses caused by the crime. A plea of guilty entered in relation to a weak Crown case is more likely to suggest contrition than a plea entered in the face of a strong prosecution case, where the plea may be no more than a recognition of the inevitable.  
      
       
        
       
     4    The dichotomy between the utilitarian value and the other benefits of a plea of guilty had not been drawn at the time these sentences were imposed. When recognition is given to that fact, the sentencing remarks quoted in [35] of Sperling J’s judgment are more readily understood. I am not persuaded, as is Sperling J ([38]), that the sentencing judge did hold that the value of the plea as evidence of contrition was reduced because the Crown case was strengthened by the applicant’s assistance to the authorities. In my view, his Honour was taking the then conventional approach to the question of the relevance of the plea of guilty to the ultimate sentence. Pre Thomson and Houlton, a plea of guilty was one factor to be taken into account in the overall sentencing decision. Its effect on the sentence finally imposed was not, ordinarily, quantified. Its utilitarian value was not regarded as distinct from its value (if any) as evidence of contrition. 
      
       
        
       
     5    At first blush it may appear that one passage in the remarks bespeaks error. That is the following: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “It is in such a case [ie where conviction was inevitable] almost impossible to consider the discount appropriate for the plea of guilty independent of the discount given for assistance. This is because his assistance to the police after his arrest reduced the value of the plea of guilty by strengthening the prosecution case against him.” 
          
         
        
       
     6    A superficial reading of these sentences could leave the reader with the impression that the applicant, by giving assistance to police at an early stage, and confessing his guilt, diminished the value of his later plea of guilty. There would be an obvious element of unfairness in such an approach. An offender who took the course of admitting guilt at an early stage should not thereby lose the benefit of a subsequent plea of guilty. However, I think it would erroneous so to construe those sentences. What his Honour had in mind, in my opinion, was that, to allow an identifiable discount for the plea of guilty, and an identifiable discount for assistance to police, would, in reality, be potentially to allow the applicant a double benefit. When the passage quoted is construed in this way, it is abundantly plain that there was no error in the approach taken by the sentencing judge. 
      
       
        
       
     7    SPERLING J: On 29 March 2000, after entering pleas of guilty to an indictment presented on 9 March 2000, the applicant was sentenced by Howie DCJ in the District Court at Sydney, in relation to the following offences: 
      
       
        
         
          
          (i) On 8 January 1999 supply prohibited drug, being heroin, the quantity being not less that the commercial quantity; s25(2)  
          Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
          1985. The maximum penalty for this count is 20 years imprisonment; s33(2)  
          Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
          1985. (Count 1). 
          
         
         
          
          (ii) On 28 January 1999 supply prohibited drug, being heroin, the quantity being not less that the large commercial quantity; s25(2)  
          Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
          1985. The maximum penalty for this count is life imprisonment; s33(3)  
          Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
          1985 
          . 
           (Count 2). 
          
         
         
          
          (iii) On 4 February 1999 supply prohibited drug, being heroin, the quantity being not less that the large commercial quantity; s25(2)  
          Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
          1985. The maximum penalty for this count is the same as that for count 2. (Count 3). 
          
         
        
       
     8    His Honour was asked to take into account two offences contained in a Form 1 under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The first offence was one of supply prohibited drug, being heroin, the quantity being not less than the large commercial quantity. The second offence in the Form 1 was an offence of supply prohibited drug, being heroin, the quantity being not less than the large commercial quantity, the supply being by way of an offer to supply. 
      
       
        
       
     9    In respect of Count 2, his Honour took into account the offences on Form 1 and imposed a sentence consisting of a minimum term of five and a half years commencing on 4 February 1999 and concluding on 3 August 2004, together with an additional term of 22 months to commence on 4 August 2004. In respect of count 3, his Honour imposed a sentence consisting of a minimum term of three years to commence on 4 February 1999 and expiring on 3 February 2002. In respect of count 1, his Honour imposed a fixed term of two years to commence on 4 February 1999 expiring on 3 February 2002. 
      
       
        
       
     10    The effective total sentence imposed on the applicant was, accordingly, one of seven years and four months, comprising a minimum term of five and a half years and an additional term of 22 months. 
      
       
        
       
     11    The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of these sentences. 
      
       
        
       
     12    The objective facts are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
        (a) On 8 January 1999 the applicant arranged a meeting between an undercover officer and a person called Issa after telling the officer that he had something to give him. At the meeting Issa gave to the officer a package which was later found to contain 671 grams of heroin. This supply was the subject of the first count. 
         
         
        (b) On 14 January 1999 the applicant met with the undercover officer and discussed the supply of a further 4 packages and the price to be paid. Arrangements were made to meet later and on 18 January contact was made between them in Lidcombe. The applicant directed the officer to a meeting with the man Issa and after the applicant had spoken to Issa, Issa placed a package in the officer’s vehicle. The package was later found to contain 2.6894 kilograms of heroin. This supply gave rise to the first offence contained in the Form 1. 
         
         
        (c) The applicant again met the undercover officer on 21 January 1999. It was agreed that there would be another supply of 2.8 kilograms to take place at Lidcombe on 28 January 1999. On 28 January 1999 the applicant and the officer met in a car park and the applicant removed a bag from a parked vehicle and took it to the officer’s vehicle. The bag was later found to contain 2.746 kilograms of heroin. This supply was reflected in count 2 on the indictment. 
         
         
        (d) The applicant again met the undercover officer on 3 February 1999 and told him that he had 1.4 kilograms of heroin for him. The next day when a search warrant was executed at the premises of the man Issa, 1.359 kilograms of heroin was located. After he was arrested, the applicant told police the he had supplied the drug to Issa so that it could be supplied to the police officer. This supply was reflected in count 3 on the indictment. 
         
         
        (e) On 3 February 1999 the applicant had also agreed to supply the officer with a further 2.8 kilograms of heroin at Lidcombe on 4 February 1999. This offer to supply gave rise to the second offence contained on the Form 1. 
         
         
        (f) His Honour described the applicant’s role in the offences as that of a “middle man”, in that he made arrangements with the potential purchaser as to the delivery of amounts of drug and for the payment of money. His Honour also found that although the supplies which gave rise to the offences were part of the one course of criminal conduct, there was a substantial degree of planning and organisation involved. His Honour found that the applicant’s involvement in the offences was motivated by greed although the money the applicant was to make from the offences was relatively minor. 
         
        
       
     13    The maximum penalty for the offence involving a large commercial quantity (under two of the counts and both offences in Form 1, four such offences in all) is life imprisonment. The quantities in the present case were substantially in excess of the large commercial quantity specified in the legislation for heroin, that being 1 kg. The street value of the drugs involved in the offences of which the appellant was convicted was $12.37m according to the agreed statement of facts. 
      
       
        
       
     14    The sentencing judge said there was no suggestion that the transactions were induced by the undercover police officer or that the quantity supplied was “talked up”. That finding was not disputed There was, therefore, no question in this case of the Court reducing the sentence as a mark of disapproval. The police acted with propriety. 
      
       
        
       
     15    That having been said, however, sale to an undercover agent does have certain features which are relevant. Generally speaking, the sale is one that would otherwise not have been made. In a particular case - as in this case - one could be confident that the self-same drugs would have been sold to a genuine purchaser if they had not been sold to the undercover operative, but it may also be plain - as in this case, where there appears to have been a ready source of supply - that a sale to the undercover agent would have been an extra sale, over and above the sales that would otherwise have been made. So the sales in this case were sales additional to those which would otherwise have been made in the ordinary course of the appellant’s activities.  
      
       
        
       
     16    Another consideration is that, in such a case, the drug does not go into the community for use. The crime is, in this sense, without a victim. 
      
       
        
       
     17    One has also to recognise, however, that - as in this case - sales to an undercover agent may be a practical way of apprehending a person actively engaged in the drug trade, who might otherwise not be apprehended at all or who might be apprehended only at greater public expense. There is therefore a public interest in establishing criminality in this way.  
      
       
        
       
     18    It is also to be borne in mind that the offender’s state of mind accompanying the act - the wrongful intent - is no different in the case of sale to an undercover agent.  
      
       
        
       
     19    For these reasons, undercover sales have to be treated as having an order of seriousness similar to that of ordinary sales, unless the police have drawn the offender into criminal activity in which he/she would not otherwise have engaged or have “talked up” the quantity. 
      
       
        
       
     20    For a discussion of these considerations see Chan [1999] NSWCCA 103 per Smart AJ at [13-31] and the authorities cited there.  
      
       
        
       
     21    The applicant’s subjective features are not in dispute. The applicant was 32 years old at the time of sentencing and had no criminal record of any significance. The sentence imposed would be the first period that the applicant had spent in custody.  
      
       
        
       
     22    The applicant admitted his involvement in the offences when interviewed by police. Immediately after his arrest on 4 February 1999, he agreed to assist the authorities. The assistance offered and given, on the evidence before the sentencing judge, was very substantial and was productive. The assistance had been given at the first available opportunity, was continuing and posed considerable risk to the applicant whilst in prison. The applicant was being held in protection within the prison system as a consequence of the assistance he provided to the authorities and it was likely that, upon his release, he would enter the witness protection scheme and would need to be relocated with a new identity. 
      
       
        
       
     23    The applicant had also indicated at an early point of time that he intended to plead guilty, but deferred doing so at the request of the police so that he could continue with his assistance to them.  
      
       
        
       
     24    This Court was provided with information concerning substantial further assistance provided by the applicant since he was sentenced, to be taken into account if the applicant were to be re-sentenced. 
      
       
        
       
     25    The grounds on which the sentences were impugned, as argued before this Court, can be summarised as follows: 
      
       
        
         
        (1) His Honour erred in the way he took the strength of the Crown case into account in evaluating the plea of guilty as a mitigating factor. 
         
         
        (2) His Honour erred in principle in the approach he took to special circumstances and in failing to find special circumstances. 
         
         
        (3) His Honour erred either in relation to his starting point before discount for plea and assistance, or in relation to the amount of the discount allowed for these factors, or in both respects. 
         
        
       
     26    It is convenient to deal with Ground 3 first. 
      
       
        
         
        Ground 3: His Honour erred either in relation to his starting point before discount for plea and assistance, or in relation to the amount of the discount allowed for these factors, or in both respects. 
         
        
       
     27    The sentencing judge did not specify his starting point for the effective sentence, nor the discount allowed for early plea and assistance to the authorities. He was not bound to do so. These sentences were passed before the guideline decision in Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. The guidelines include, at [160], the following: that sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of a plea of guilty, particularly in relation to its utilitarian value; that where assistance to the authorities is taken into account, a single combined qualification may be appropriate; and that the utilitarian value of a plea should generally be assessed in the range of a 10 to 25 per cent discount on sentence. 
      
       
        
       
     28    The range of 10 to 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of a plea was, conformable with existing practice: see [145-151]. 
      
       
        
       
     29    An important rider appears in Thomson and Houlton at [156-158], and in [160] being guide (iv).  
      
       
        
         
          
          “[156] Rare cases involving exceptional complexity and trial duration may justify a higher discount. In some cases no discount is appropriate at all. In some cases the “discount” will be reflected in a step down in the hierarchy of sentencing options. 
          
         
         
          
          [157] There are circumstances in which the protection of the public requires a long sentence to be imposed so that no discount for the plea is appropriate. (See e.g.  
          R v Stabler  
          (1984) 6 Cr App R (S) 129 at 131;  
          R v Costen 
           [1989] 11 Cr App R (S) 182 at 184). 
          
         
         
          
          [158] There are crimes that so offend the public interest that the maximum sentence, without any discount for any purpose, is appropriate. This includes situations in which a life sentence can be and is imposed, notwithstanding the plea. (See e.g.  
          R v Kalache  
          [2000] NSWCCA 2, see esp per Sully J at [38] - [42].) 
          
         
         
          
          [160](iv) In some cases the plea, in combination with other relevant factors, will change the nature of the sentence imposed. In some cases a plea will not lead to any discount.” 
          
         
        
       
     30    In Chu (NSWCCA, 16 October 1998, unreported), it was said that there is no fixed tariff for assistance to the authorities, but that the range in this State appeared to be from 20 to 50 per cent. A guideline judgment was suggested. That has not yet occurred. 
      
       
        
       
     31    Again, there is an important rider, in this connection by statute. Section 442B of the Crimes Act 1900 was in force at the time of sentencing in this case (now substantially re-enacted as s23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). It provided that a court must not reduce a sentence on account of assistance to the authorities so that the sentence becomes unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. 
      
       
        
       
     32    The sentencing judge expressed the intention to allow the applicant “the maximum discount that is available by reason of his plea of guilty and past and future assistance”. That was an appropriate approach. The applicant was to taken to have pleaded guilty at the earliest possible time. Assistance to the police had been of a very high order. The qualifications to which I have referred were implicit in what his Honour said about his intention.  
      
       
        
       
     33    It was not suggested to this Court that his Honour should have aggregated a discount at or near the top of the range for each of the two considerations and discounted the sentence by something in the order of 70 or 75 per cent. What was submitted was that his Honour was bound to discount the sentence by at least 66 per cent by reason of these factors combined. 
      
       
        
       
     34    This analysis does not disclose error on the part of the sentencing judge. The offences for which the applicant was sentenced were very serious. The maximum penalty for the more serious of them was life imprisonment. There were four such offences. The drug was heroin which is regarded as a particularly harmful prohibited drug: Dang (NSWCCA, 7 November 1997, unreported). The applicant supplied that drug as part of a commercial enterprise. That is a matter of aggravation: Olbrich (NSWCCA, 6 July 1998, unreported), Traicioni (1990) 49 A Crim R 417, 419. He was motivated solely by financial gain; as found by the sentencing judge, he made himself available in order to make “easy money”. As to his position in the hierarchy of the enterprise, the applicant was not a mere courier; as found by the sentencing judge, he was directly involved with the importer and was actively engaged in making sales at what I would describe as the wholesale level. 
      
       
        
       
     35    In these circumstances, a starting point for the effective sentence of say 15 years imprisonment would not have been manifestly excessive by any means. It would have been well within the range of sentences imposed for this offence and consistent with the objective features of the case. I would not regard a combined discount of, say, 50 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea and for assistance as so low as to involve error. That would reduce the sentence to seven and a half years, which is conformable with the effective sentence imposed of seven years and four months. 
      
       
        
       
     36    A further difficulty about the applicant’s approach is that even if a combined discount of 66 per cent were regarded as the minimum, as the first step in the exercise, a sentencing judge is then required to ensure - before implementing the discount - that the sentence is not reduced below what is appropriate having regard to the degree of criminality involved. In view of the seriousness of the course of conduct in this case, it would not be an error in the exercise of the judge’s discretion to regard a full term of seven years and four months as the least that could reasonably be imposed irrespective of the discount factors. 
      
       
        
       
     37    The difficulty for the applicant is that the sentencing judge’s discretion operated at a number of points in a way that is not disclosed: the starting point for the full term, the combined discount for plea and assistance, and the over-riding qualification of proportionality with the degree of criminality involved. When one has regard to the breadth of discretion available in each of these areas, error in the exercise of discretion cannot be established.  
      
       
        
       
     38    It was submitted that a sentencing judge should be required to disclose the steps by which the result was achieved in these respects. That would be very helpful to everyone in a case such as this. But that is contrary to authority, particularly, now, Thomson and Houlton (supra), which makes quantification of a combined discount for the plea and for assistance optional. That approach would apply equally to the other elements in the sentencing exercise which I have mentioned. 
      
       
        
       
     39    This ground of appeal, accordingly, fails. 
      
       
        
         
        Ground 1: His Honour erred in the way he took the strength of the Crown case into account in evaluating the plea of guilty as a mitigating factor. 
         
        
       
     40    Apart from submissions relating to the quantification of a discount for plea and assistance, which I have dealt with under Ground 3, the applicant argued under Ground 1 that there was an error of principle in the sentencing judge’s approach to the discount for the plea. 
      
       
        
       
     41    In that connection, his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “The plea of guilty is of course a matter to be taken into account but when one considers the evidence which the police have against the accused, the evidence of the undercover police officer supported by taped conversations and the admissions of the prisoner, conviction was inevitable. 
          
         
         
          
          It is in such a case almost impossible to consider the discount appropriate for the plea of guilty independent of the discount given for assistance. This is because his assistance to the police after his arrest reduced the value of the plea of guilty by strengthening the prosecution case against him. A plea in light of an inevitable conviction does not attract a great degree of leniency. Matters such as remorse and contrition which can be seen to flow from a plea of guilty are also manifested by assistance given by a person after arrest. 
          
         
         
          
          It is however a matter to be weighed in determining the overall sentence to be passed upon the prisoner that he was prepared to plead guilty at a very early time in the course of these proceedings, although that plea of guilty was deferred at the request of investigating police officers.” 
          
         
        
       
     42    It was submitted that his Honour confused the utilitarian value of the plea and the plea as evidence of contrition, the strength of the Crown case being relevant to the latter but not to the former: Thomson and Houlton (supra) at [137]. 
      
       
        
       
     43    I do not read the quoted passage that way. It seems to me that his Honour related the strength of the Crown case only to the role of the plea as evidence of contrition. 
      
       
        
       
     44    His Honour did, however, err in principle in holding that the value of the plea as evidence of contrition was reduced in consequence of the Crown case being strengthened by the appellant’s assistance to the authorities. 
      
       
        
       
     45    This cannot have been a material error, however, because the Crown case was extremely strong with or without the assistance provided by the applicant. The plea was therefore of negligible value anyway as evidence of contrition. (That is not to say, of course, that it was not open to his Honour to find contrition on other grounds.) 
      
       
        
       
     46    There was accordingly no material error of principle in the way his Honour dealt with the plea of guilty. However, I will give consideration at a later point in this judgment to the implications of any such error in this area of the case. 
      
       
        
         
        Ground 2: 
          
        His Honour erred in principle in the approach he took to special circumstances and in failing to find special circumstances. 
         
        
       
     47    The following is the relevant passage from the remarks on sentence: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “A question arises as to whether there are special circumstances in this case. As I have already indicated the assistance that he has given and is intending to give in the future is primarily to be reflected to give in the future is primarily to be reflected in the diminution of the total sentence, which is reduced not only to reward the prisoner but also to reflect the additional burden that imprisonment will present for him, by reason of the nature of his custody, flowing from the assistance he has given. 
          
         
         
          
          There is nothing in the prisoner’s background or present circumstances which indicates that he will require the assistance or intervention of the Probation Service, or any other community agency, in order to address any problem which caused him to involve himself in the criminal activity which is before the Court. His prospect of future offending it seems to me will depend upon whether he is minded to ‘chance his arm’, should the opportunity arise again to make money through criminal activity, once he is released from prison, although clearly he will need support when he is released, simply because of the lengthy period he must spend in custody, a parole period which will result from the application of s5 of the Act in the minimum term I intend to impose will be, in my view, sufficient for that purpose. 
          
         
         
          
          As I have already indicated the likelihood is that the prisoner will be relocated on his release as part of a witness protection scheme. There are, in my view, no special circumstances in this case, notwithstanding that it is his first period in custody and that he will spend that period in protection.” 
          
         
         
        
       
     48    Section 5 of the Sentencing Act 1989 (now repealed) required the court to set a minimum term and an additional term. It further provided that the additional term should not be longer than one third of the minimum term unless there were special circumstances. The prisoner was eligible to be released at the end of the minimum period and was amenable to supervision on parole during the balance of the total sentence. 
      
       
        
       
     49    The new regime was intended to create greater public disclosure of the way time served in prison was determined. It was called “truth in sentencing” because the intention was avoid the large disparities between sentences passed and the time actually served in prison under the previous regime (Hansard, 10 May 1989, Vol 208, p 7910). 
      
       
        
       
     50    The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 replaced s5 with a new provision, s44. The court was now to set a sentence and then to set a non-parole period which could not be less than three-quarters of the sentence unless there were special circumstances. The prisoner was eligible to be released on parole at the end of the non-parole period. 
      
       
        
       
     51    The proportion between the two parts of the sentence was preserved (3:1). So was eligibility for release at the end of the first segment of the sentence. So was the exception to the provisional relationship between the two segments (special circumstances). 
      
       
        
       
     52    There was the potentiality for a different approach to the construction of s44 relative to s5. Whereas s5 mandated a second segment of not less than the specified relationship absent special circumstances, s44 mandated a first segment of not more than the specified relationship absent special circumstances. That could suggest that, whereas special circumstances in s5 had to provide reason for enlarging the second segment (not necessarily at the expense of the first segment), special circumstances in s44 had to be reason for shortening the first segment (necessarily enlarging the second segment). There was the potentiality of throwing the emphasis away from rehabilitation under supervised parole (the second segment of the sentence) and onto the incidences of imprisonment (the first segment of the sentence). The second reading speech which induced the 1999 legislation (Hansard, 28 October 1999, Vol 274, p. 2326) indicated that there was no intention to make any such shift in concept. 
      
       
        
       
     53    The authorities as to what may constitute special circumstances - some of which were cited in argument here - are, not consistent. Some of the authorities state that the only relevant consideration is the need for a longer period under care and supervision on parole than would otherwise be the case for the purpose of rehabilitation. I will call this “the strict approach”. (I would observe in passing that no regard seems to have been paid by the courts in this connection to the actual nature, incidence and duration of the care and supervision that the Probation and Parole Service is able to provide to prisoners on their release from prison on parole. The courts have proceeded on the basis - rightly or wrongly - that whatever may be contemplated in this regard will be provided and over the whole of the term of the sentence remaining when the prisoner is released.) 
      
       
        
       
     54    Authorities supporting the strict approach include the following: Moffit (1990) 20 NSWLR 114, per Samuels JA at 115-116 and Badgery-Parker J at 136; Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446, per Hunt CJ at CL at 449-50 (James J agreeing), holding that none of the following were special circumstances, alone or in combination: plea of guilty, co-operation with the authorities, restitution, prior good character, age; Morrissey (NSW CCA, 15 July 1994, unreported) per Carruthers, Finlay and Badgery-Parker JJ at 6-7; and PPB [1999] NSWCCA 36 per Kirby J at 7-8 (Simpson J agreeing), citing Lewis (following) but not with approval.  
      
       
        
       
     55    There are then authorities which allow a variety of considerations to be taken into account which are said to be relevant to the need for a longer period under supervision on parole. These include Moffit (supra) per Wood J at 120 (assistance to the authorities and immediate confession of guilt, conviction of serious crimes, recidivism, cumulative sentences, young offender with clear prior record) and Giurgis [2000] NSWCCA 129, per Wood CJ at CL at [9] (Smart J agreeing) (youth of the prisoner and positive attempts by the prisoner to remove himself from the drug scene). The way in which such considerations led to the need for a longer period of supervision on parole is not spelled out in these judgments. 
      
       
        
       
     56    Then there are authorities that allow a variety of considerations to be taken into account without any, intended nexus (so far as is apparent) with the provision of supervision on parole over an extended period of time, for the purpose of rehabilitation. These include Griffiths (1989) 167 CLR 372 per Brennan and Dawson JJ at 379 (combination of youth, no serious criminal history, affected by drugs at the time of the offences, offending episodic rather than an ingrained tendency, better than average prospect of rehabilitation); Sellen (1991) 57 A Crim R 313, per Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Campbell J at 320 (the prisoner’s poor health); Astill (No 2) (1992) 64 A Crim R 289, per Kirby P at 294 (the hardship of strict protection in prison); McLear (NSWCCA, 1 September 1992, unreported), per Sheller JA (Matthews and Sharpe JJ agreeing) (plea of guilty and offer of assistance); GDR (1994) 35 NSWLR 376, per Gleeson CJ, Mahoney JA, McInerney, Badgery-Parker and Dunford JJ (alone or in combination: protective custody, first term of imprisonment, surrender, admission of guilt, and plea of guilty); Lewis (1998) 100 A Crim R 361, per Dunford J (Simpson and Bell JJ agreeing) (protective or other restrictive custody in prison); S [2000] NSWCCA 13; (2000) 111 A Crim R 225, per Hulme J at [30] and [32] (Barr J agreeing) (combination of plea of guilty, assistance to authorities, strict protection, resolve to rehabilitate and change lifestyle); Bruce [2000] NSWCCA 39, per Hidden J (Carruthers J agreeing) at [9] (particularly onerous conditions in custody). 
      
       
        
       
     57    GDR is of particular importance. Although the scope of special circumstances was not the point of the appeal, the passage to which I have referred reflects the view on the present point of five judges including Gleeson CJ, then the Chief Justice of this Court and now Chief Justice of the High Court, a judge of the Court of Appeal who later became President of the Court of Appeal and three very experienced judges of the Common Law Division of the Court. To this opinion is to be added that of Kirby P (now a justice of the High Court) and Wood CJ at CL to similar effect in the earlier cases to which I have referred. 
      
       
        
       
     58    The weight of authority is strongly in support of a liberal construction of special circumstances. It seems that circumstances which qualify as special circumstances include factors making imprisonment significantly more burdensome in the particular case and other considerations such as an early plea or assistance to the authorities, notwithstanding that such latter factors will have been taken into account in setting the full term. 
      
       
        
       
     59    However, again, there is an important rider. The minimum term or non-parole period should not be reduced below what is appropriate to reflect the criminality of the offence: Morrissey (supra); Kenworthy (NSW CCA, 3 August 1995, unreported); McDonald (NSW CCA, 12 October 1998, unreported) particularly having regard to the need for general deterrence: Stone (1995) 85 A Crim R 436, applying Moffatt (NSW CCA, 21 June 1994, unreported). 
      
       
        
       
     60    The sentencing judge adopted what I have called the strict approach - or something very close to it - rather than the more liberal approach adopted in the more recent authorities. In so doing, he excluded from consideration factors such as the early plea of guilty, assistance to the authorities and the consequence of the appellant having to serve his sentence in protection as factors which could, on authority, be taken into account in reduction of the minimum term. 
      
       
        
       
     61    It is then necessary to consider the implications of this error in relation to the outcome of the appeal. 
      
       
        
         
        The implications of error in relation to plea of guilty and special circumstances 
        . 
         
        
       
     62    In my view, whatever discount could legitimately be given for the plea of guilty and for assistance (including assistance provided since sentence) and however liberal the correct principles may be in relation to special circumstances, I would not, on any fresh determination of the sentence in this case, propose an effective full term sentence less than the effective full term sentence of seven years and four months imposed by his Honour or an effective non-parole period less than the minimum term of five years and six months imposed by his Honour. 
      
       
        
       
     63    What is the effect of that? Section 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that a person may appeal with leave against sentence. Section 6(3) provides (so far as is relevant) that, on such appeal, the court shall, “if it is of opinion that some other sentence....less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed”, quash the sentence and “pass such other sentence in substitution therefore, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal”. 
      
       
        
       
     64    If my view of the effective total sentence and effective minimum term imposed by the sentencing judge is the view of this Court, the consequence is, if leave is allowed, that this Court must dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
        
         
        Conclusion 
         
         
        I propose the following orders: 
         
         
        (1) Grant leave to appeal; 
         
         
        (2) Appeal dismissed.

        REGINA v Tomislav Markuleski 
        
       
     The appellant was charged with six sexual offences (comprising four counts of indecent assault on a person under the age of 16 years and two counts of sexual intercourse without consent with a person under the age of 16 years) against a young girl. On 23 August 2000, the jury returned five verdicts of guilty and one verdict of not guilty (on one of the counts of sexual intercourse). The case was largely one of the word of the complainant against the word of the appellant. The offences were said to have occurred in 1981 and 1982.HeldA. Unreasonable Verdictsper Spigelman CJ, Grove J and Carruthers AJ agreeing;Wood CJ at CL The jury’s differentiation between verdicts was justified in the circumstances of the case. Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 distinguished. M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487; MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348; Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316; Farrell v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 286 referred to. R v RAT (2000) 111 A Crim R 360 disapproved. R v Barnett [2000] NSWCCA 283; R v Carbone [2000] NSWCCA 387; R v Dickson [2001] NSWCCA 39; R v S [2001] NSWCCA 204 not followed.per Simpson J (dissenting)The jury’s doubt about the complainant’s evidence on the one count on which it returned a verdict of not guilty meant that that doubt should have been translated to the complainant’s credibility in general. Jones v The Queen applied.B. Direction Relating to Delay in Complaint per Spigelman CJ, Carruthers AJ agreeing; Wood CJ at CL;Simpson JA direction should have been given by the trial judge to the jury that the complainant’s delay in complaint may be taken into account in its assessment of the complainant’s credibility. Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427; Kilby v The Queen (1973) 129 CLR 460 applied. R v Davies (1985) 3 NSWLR 276 referred to.per Grove J (dissenting)The trial judge’s directions, in the context of the conduct of the trial, were adequate.C. Question from Jury about Complainant’s motivation for Complaintper Spigelman CJ, Carruthers AJ agreeing; Grove JThe fact that the jury asked a question as to why the complainant had come forward after such a passage of time did not suggest an impermissible process of reasoning. Palmer v The Queen (1998) 193 CLR; R v Jovanovic (1997) 42 NSWLR 520 referred to. The trial judge’s response to the question was adequate in the circumstances.per Simpson J (dissenting)The question from the jury raised the danger that the jury would reason that in the absence of evidence of a motive for the complainant to lie, her credibility would be enhanced. This impermissible process of reasoning required an explicit direction from the trial judge prohibiting it. 
      
       
     D. Direction Relating to Relevance of Acquittal on Any Count to Jury’s Assessment of all Countsper Spigelman CJ, Carruthers AJ agreeing; Wood CJ at CL As a general rule the trial judge should direct the jury that a reasonable doubt with respect to the complainant’s evidence on any count, ought to be taken into account in its assessment of the complainant’s credibility generally. R v Robinson (2000) 111 A Crim R 388; R v ARD [2000] NSWCCA 441 referred to; R v RAT overruled. The trial judge did not give an adequate direction of this nature in this case.per Grove J (dissenting)Whilst in some circumstances a direction of the kind envisaged may be appropriate, this is a matter for trial judges and the giving of the direction should not be referred to as ‘crucial’. In the circumstances of the case, no further direction of this nature was required.Orders1. Appeal allowed;2. Convictions quashed;

        JUDGMENT 
        
        
         
        
       
     1    SPIGELMAN CJ: Tomislav Markuleski (“the appellant” or “TM”) appeals against his conviction in the District Court on 23 August 2000 in respect of five offences of a sexual nature against B P (“the complainant”). The appellant was arraigned in relation to six offences against the complainant alleged to have occurred between 29 January 1981 (count 1) and 4 February 1982 (count 6). There were four counts pursuant to s76 of the Crimes Act 1900 alleging indecent assaults of a person under 16 years (counts 1-4) and two counts pursuant to s61D(1), alleging sexual intercourse without consent with a person under 16 years (counts 5-6).2    The case, as is usual in these situations, was in large measure one of word against word, i.e. that of the complainant against that of the appellant. The verdicts of the jury were guilty in relation to the first five counts and not guilty in relation to the sixth count. The course of the trial and the issues on the appeal are set out in the judgment of Simpson J, which I have read in draft. 
      
       
        
       Unreasonable Verdicts 
        
       
     3    The first ground of appeal is that the verdicts of guilty in relation to counts 1-5 are “unreasonable and cannot be supported” in terms of s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, in the light of the not guilty verdict in relation to count 6. Reliance was placed on the High Court’s decision in Jones v the Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439.4    The test of whether a jury verdict is “unreasonable or cannot be supported” within the meaning of s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is as established by the joint judgment of the High Court in M v The Queen (1984) 181 CLR 487 at 494-495: 
      
       
        
         
         “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displayed inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.” [references omitted] 
         
        
       
     5    The application of this test in a case of alleged inconsistency between a verdict or verdicts of acquittal and of conviction received an authoritative exposition in the joint judgment of Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Jones v The Queen esp at 453-455. Their Honours quoted extensively from the judgment in M.  
      
       
     6    The general principles with respect to inconsistent verdicts had been set out in authorities before Jones, particularly MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 366-368 per Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ. The threshold proposition, relevant for present purpose, enunciated by their Honours in MacKenzie at 366 was: 
      
       
        
         
         “Where, as is ordinarily the case, the inconsistency arises in the jury verdicts upon different counts of the originating process in a criminal trial, the test is one of logic and reasonableness.” 
         
        
       
     7    The reasoning of the joint judgment in Jones, where there was nothing illogical about the divergent verdicts, represents a particular application of this test of “reasonableness”.  
      
       
     8    The reasoning in MacKenzie at 367 is pertinent to the present case: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the respect for the function which the law assigns to juries (and the general satisfaction with their performance) have led courts to express repeatedly, in the context both of criminal and civil trials, reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense. Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge’s instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.” [references omitted] 
         
        
       
     9    The respect which the Court pays to the constitutional role of the jury was emphasised in M at 493, in a passage referred to with approval in Jones at 451: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to these considerations.” [references omitted] 
         
        
       
     10    It is against this background, that the test for an unreasonable verdict - whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty - must be applied to the whole of the facts and circumstances of a particular case. 
      
       
     11    I do not understand there to be any relevant difference between a ‘no reasonable jury test’ (MacKenzie at 366 quoting Lord Devlin) and a ‘not open to the jury’ test (Jones at 450-452 adopting M). 
      
       
     12    In Jones, especially at 453-455, passages of which I will set out below, the joint judgment referred to three matters in detail. First, the effect on the credibility of the complainant of the acquittal on one count. Second, the absence of corroboration. Third, the difficulties occasioned to the defence by the unexplained long delay in making a complaint. The joint judgment concluded at 455: 
      
       
        
         
         “When the credibility factor is combined with the uncorroborated nature of the complaints and the effect of the lengthy and unexplained delay in the making of the complaints, the convictions on the first and third counts can only be regarded as unsafe and unsatisfactory.” 
         
        
       
     13    As to the first matter, their Honours analysed the effect of the acquittal on one count upon the credibility of the complainant. I will refer to this passage in detail below.  
      
       
     14    As to the second matter the joint judgment referred at 453 to:  
      
       
        
         
         “the lack of any corroborative evidence, in particular, the absence of any medical evidence” [reference omitted] 
         
        
        
       as a factor which:  
        
        
         
         “made it necessary for a reasonable jury to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence with considerable care”. 
         
        
       
     15    As to the third matter, their Honours said at 454: 
      
       
        
         
         “The unexplained absence of a complaint for four years is a matter that made it essential for a reasonable jury to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence with great care.” 
         
        
        
       And continued: 
        
         
          
         “Furthermore, in some cases - and we thought that this was one - the delay in making a complaint may be so long that it hampers an accused person’s right to defend him or herself.” 
         
        
        
       The joint judgment at 454-455 referred to the specific difficulties which delay had posed for the defence in the particular circumstances of the case. 
        
       
     16    Accordingly, it was the combined operation of three factors - credibility, absence of corroboration and the effect of a lengthy and unexplained delay - which led the court to conclude that it was not open to the jury to convict. Two of these factors - credibility and effect of delay - involve matters of fact and degree the significance of which turned on the particular circumstances of the case. 
      
       
     17    A noteworthy feature of Jones was the fact that the trial judge did not give a warning to the jury about the adverse effects of delay upon the ability of the accused to defend himself. There was no warning in accordance with the decision in Longman v The Queen (1987) 168 CLR 79 (reaffirmed in Crampton v The Queen (2000) 75 ALJR 133; [2000] HCA 60). 
      
       
     18    In Jones the Court of Criminal Appeal rejected leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to raise this issue. Leave was required because no application had been made to the trial judge after his summing-up for a relevant redirection. See R v VRJ (NSWCCA, 22 November 1996, unreported). 
      
       
     19    In the High Court the fourth member of the majority, Brennan CJ, at 445-446, expressly referred to the absence of a Longman warning as a relevant factor in his Honour’s conclusion that the verdict on one count was unsafe and unsatisfactory. Although the joint judgment does not explicitly refer to the absence of a Longman warning, the significant emphasis that their Honours gave to the adverse effects of delay in concluding that the verdicts were unsafe, may also have been affected by the fact that the jury was not instructed about the adverse effects of delay. 
      
       
     20    The absence of a Longman warning in Jones, was not raised directly in the High Court. It appears to have been subsumed (expressly in the judgment of Brennan CJ and implicitly in the joint judgment) under the “unsafe and unsatisfactory” ground. The apparent inconsistency of the verdicts in Jones may have appeared to have been of lesser force if a full Longman warning had been given. The element of delay, which the joint judgment mentioned as one of the factors which led their Honours to conclude that it was not open to the jury to convict, would have appeared in a quite different light. 
      
       
     21    This aspect of Jones has not received appropriate emphasis in subsequent cases. In the case law since Jones, as in the present case, attention has focused on the consideration of the “credibility factor” in the joint judgment. 
      
       
     22    Australian jurisprudence on inconsistent verdicts has developed a much higher degree of intolerance to inconsistency than appears to be the case in some other jurisdictions. 
      
       
     23    In England, save in exceptional cases, “logical inconsistency is an essential prerequisite for success on this ground”. (R v W, Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) 30 March 1999, unreported, per Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ). The fact that different counts all depended on the uncorroborated evidence of the same witness does not render different verdicts inconsistent. (See the following cases decided in the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division): R v Cilgram [1994] Crim LR 861; R v Warner (17 February 1997, unreported); R v Bell (15 May 1997, unreported); R v Clarke & Fletcher (30 July 1997, unreported); R v Britton (5 October 2000, unreported)). In R v Guest (23 January 1998) partially reported as R v G [1998] Crim LR 483, the court was referred to Jones but concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the mere fact that credibility of the complainant is in issue and her evidence is acted upon in some counts and not in others does not constitute a logical inconsistency.” 
         
        
       
     24    New Zealand courts also apply a “no reasonable jury” test. (See R v Irvine [1976] 1 NZLR 96 at 99; R v Kino and Mete [1997] 3 NZLR 24 at 27). The position appears to be broadly similar to the approach in Australia. (See  R v O (No. 2) [1999] 1 NZLR 326; R v H [2000] 2 NZLR 581). 
      
       
     25    Canadian courts are prepared to inquire whether the error was in the acquittal rather than in the conviction (Koury v The Queen (1964) 43 DLR (2d) 637 at 652). A diversity of approach is apparent in R v R (D) (1996) 136 DLR (4th) 525 which is of limited assistance as it was an appeal following a trial by judge alone. 
      
       
     26    In the United States most jurisdictions do not intervene even with logically inconsistent verdicts (see E. L. Muller “The Hobgoblin of Little Minds? Our Foolish Law of Inconsistent Verdicts” (1998) 111 Harvard Law Review 77).

     30    Differences in approach are apparent within this Court and between judgments of this Court and of courts of criminal appeal in other states. In these circumstances, the Court has convened a bench of five. 
      
       
        
       The Duty of the Jury to Consider Charges Separately 
        
       
     31    Nothing in Jones casts any doubt on the appropriateness of a jury accepting a witness’ evidence in one respect, whilst retaining a reasonable doubt about the commission of events about which that same witness is the only substantive witness.  
      
       
     32    Indeed, in a case handed down by the High Court exactly one week after Jones (KBT v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 417) Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 424 emphasised the importance of the instruction traditionally given in this respect: 
      
       
        
         
         “As the trial judge correctly instructed the jury in his summing up, it was open to the jury to accept some parts of M’s evidence and to reject others.”  
         
        
       
     33    The appropriateness of the direction traditionally given has also recently been confirmed by McHugh J in KRM v The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR 550; [2001] HCA 11 where his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[36] It has become the standard practice in cases where there are multiple counts, however, for the judge to direct the jury that they must consider each count separately and to consider it only by reference to the evidence that applies to it (a “separate consideration warning”). The universal giving of a separate consideration warning and the omission of a universal propensity warning indicates that the giving of a separate consideration warning is ordinarily sufficient to avoid miscarriages of justice in cases such as the present. This indication is confirmed by the many cases where juries acquit accused persons of some charges and convict them of others where the presentment contains multiple counts involving the same or similar offences. Indeed, so freely do juries acquit of some charges and convict of others on presentments with multiple counts that appellate courts often hear arguments that there is such an inconsistency in the verdicts that the convictions are unsafe and must be set aside [60] … [60] cf  
         Jones v The Queen 
          (1997) 191 CLR 439.” 
         
        
       
     34    In the common case of multiple sexual assaults against a single complainant, often over a period of time, juries frequently acquit on some charges and convict on others. The issue raised by Jones is to determine when an acquittal so affects the credibility of the complainant that, in combination with other factors, a conviction was not open to the jury. A court of criminal appeal must perform this task whilst acknowledging the role of the jury as emphasised in M, MacKenzie and Jones quoted above. 
      
       
        
       The Centrality of the Facts of a Particular Case 
        
       
     35    Several aspects of the reasoning in Jones pertinent to the issue of credibility of the complainant in that case, often arise in other cases. These include: 
      
       
     · Absence of corroboration in a word against word case. 
      
       
     · Delay in making complaint, 
      
       
     · Lack of apparent difference in the quality of the complainant’s evidence amongst the different incidents. 
      
       
     · Availability of contradictory evidence with respect to some, but not all, incidents. 
      
       
     36    Although the specific aspects of a case may be characterised in this way - including in the specific language, quoted below, of the reasoning in Jones - each such matter raises questions of fact and degree which may affect the ultimate assessment of the effect upon the credibility of the complainant in the particular case before the Court when the complainant’s evidence is not accepted to the criminal standard on some counts. The fact that the High Court found in Jones that the effect on credibility was such that, together with other factors, it was not open to the jury to convict, does not determine the outcome of other cases. The variation in fact and degree will differ from case to case. 
      
       
     37    The proposition that these cases turn on their particular facts is confirmed by High Court authority, both before and after Jones. 
      
       
     38    In MacKenzie the joint judgment relevantly concluded at 368: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside.  
         It is impossible to state hard and fast rules. ‘It all depends upon the facts of the case 
         .’” [Emphasis added; reference omitted] 
         
        
       
     39    In Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316, inconsistency of verdicts was raised in the context of allegations that the appellant Osland and her son had murdered the appellant’s husband, the son’s stepfather. At trial the mother was convicted, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict with respect to the son. The son was later tried again and acquitted. The assertion that the verdicts were inconsistent was raised for the first time in the High Court.  
      
       
     40    The appeal was dismissed by majority. Each of the majority judgments gave careful attention to the particular facts and issues raised in the course of the proceedings. I do not understand either Kirby J or Callinan J to disagree with the general thrust of the following reasoning of McHugh J: 
      
       
        
         
         “[120] When there is no legal or technical inconsistency in the verdicts, a conviction can only be set aside where the inconsistency in the verdicts demonstrates that no reasonable jury who had applied their minds to the evidence could have arrived at the two different verdicts. In such a case the Court of Criminal Appeal sets aside the conviction because it is unsafe or unsatisfactory. 
         
        
        
         
         [121] In determining whether the inconsistency points to an unsatisfactory conviction, the appellate court must consider the evidence, the issues, and the  
         directions 
          which the jury were given. … An examination of the directions, issues and evidence may confirm that apparently inconsistent verdicts are in fact inconsistent and demonstrate that the conviction is unsafe. Just as frequently, however, examination of the issues, evidence and directions may show that apparently inconsistent verdicts are not inconsistent and that there has been no failure in the reasoning process of the jury.” [references omitted] 
         
        
       
     41    The central significance of the facts of a particular case is also emphasised in the High Court judgment in Farrell v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 286. The appellant had been charged with eight counts of rape, two counts of aggravated sexual assault and two counts of assault. He was found guilty of one count of assault, one count of aggravated sexual assault (by majority) and four counts of rape (three by majority). The jury returned verdicts of not guilty on five counts and on one count there was a verdict of not guilty by direction. All of the offences had occurred in the course of one night on which the complainant said that he had been sexually assaulted and beaten by two men. Two of the five counts of which the appellant was acquitted were those in which the principal offender was alleged to be the other person, with the appellant being charged with aiding and abetting that person. 
      
       
     42    Hayne J noted at [64] that there was very little evidence of the appellant encouraging the other person by his alleged presence. His Honour concluded at [65]: 
      
       
        
         
         “In those circumstances I attach no weight to the different verdicts given by the jury to the various counts charged. The verdicts are entirely consistent with the jury not reaching the requisite degree of satisfaction that the appellant had aided and abetted Frank in his assaults on the complainant.” 
         
        
        
       McHugh and Gaudron JJ agreed with Hayne J.  
        
       
     43    Both Kirby J at [25] and Callinan J at [99] referred to the differentiation that Cox CJ had made in the Court of Criminal Appeal. Cox CJ had said (Farrell v R (TASSC, 7 June 1996, unreported)): 
      
       
        
         
         “[The jury] did not, in fact, convict on any counts proof of which required a finding of the commission of a crime by the third man. … There was no corroborative evidence in respect of such counts - no corroborative evidence even of the existence, let alone presence, of that person; but as there was, in my view, significant corroborative evidence in the form of the tie which linked the appellant to the complainant not only earlier in the evening but up until shortly before the complainant’s arrival at his brother’s home with his hands bound, it seems likely that the jury were fully alive to the deficiencies in the complainant’s credibility and were only prepared to convict where his evidence was in fact corroborated.” 
         
        
       
     44    Callinan J said at [99]: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the Court of Criminal Appeal, Cox CJ explained this differentiation in the verdicts. The evidence concerning the distinctive tie was logically corroborative of much of the complainant’s evidence and capable clearly of linking the appellant with the commission of the offences of which he was charged. There was no similar corroboration of the offences involving the second man. The position may simply have been that the jury were left in a state of doubt about those offences. It cannot be said that there is no rational basis for the respective verdicts of guilty and not guilty.” 
         
        
       
     45    Only two of the five counts on which the appellant was found to be not guilty were aiding and abetting counts. He was also found not guilty of one of the six counts of anal penetration, one count of fellatio and one count of assault (see [98] in the judgment of Callinan J). It does not appear that the presence or absence of the third man was relevant to these counts. Nevertheless, no fatal inconsistency was found to exist on the facts of this case, although no separate consideration was given to the three counts not involving the third man for which an acquittal was found. 
      
       
     46    In my opinion, Osland and Farrell support the proposition that the reasoning in Jones is directed to the facts of that case. 
      
       
        
       The Reasoning in  
       Jones 
        
       
     47    There are three key passages in the reasoning of the joint judgment in Jones on the issue of credibility. 
      
       
        
         
         (i) “The jury’s finding of not guilty on the second count damaged the credibility of the complainant with respect to all counts in the indictment. Implicit in the appellant’s acquittal on the second count was a rejection of the complainant’s account of the events which were said to give rise to that count.” (453) 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) “It is difficult then to see how it was open to the jury to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant with respect to the first and third counts. There is nothing in the complainant’s evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gives any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to those counts than it was in relation to the second count.” (453) 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) “In our opinion, the proper application of the test formulated by the majority of this court in  
         M 
          required the convictions of the appellant to be set aside on the basis that they were unsafe and unsatisfactory. Given the jury’s findings on the second count, it was not open to them, on the whole of the evidence, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant on the first and third counts. Once the jury found that the evidence of the complainant with respect to the second count lacked sufficient cogency to convict, the Crown case on the first and third counts wore a different complexion. For it meant that, when her evidence could be set against other reliable evidence, it failed to carry sufficient conviction to reach the criminal standard of proof. 
          
          
           
           As we have already said, nothing in the complainant’s evidence gave any ground for thinking that the quality of her evidence was higher in respect of the first and third count than it was in respect to the second count.” (455) 
           
          
         
        
       
     48    These considerations operated in a, frequently occurring, context of delay in complaint and absence of corroboration which, as the joint judgment emphasised, required the jury “to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence with considerable care” (453.9). 
      
       
     49    In each of passage (ii) and (iii), the joint judgment notes that there was no reason to believe that the complainant’s evidence with respect to those counts on which a conviction was recorded was either “more reliable” (453.8) or of a “higher quality” (455.8). However, I do not understand their Honours to be propounding a proposition that unless a finding of that character can be made, then in a word against word case where the complainant’s version is uncorroborated, the only conclusion is that it was not open to the jury to convict. This appears from the addition of the words “or the surrounding circumstances” [emphasis added] in passage (ii). 
      
       
     50    In passage (iii), their Honours said that the count on which an acquittal was entered was the only count on which, given the delay, the complainant’s evidence “could be set against other reliable evidence” (455.7). Again, I do not understand that their Honours were propounding a proposition that in any word against word case, where such a characterisation can be made, the only conclusion is that it was not open to the jury to convict. 
      
       
     51    Both of these considerations are, of course, important and often critical, but their significance gives rise to questions of fact and degree which will vary from case to case. The reasoning has not always been treated in this way. 
      
       
        
        
        
       Application of the Reasoning in  
       Jones 
        
       
     52    The reasoning in Jones appears to have been treated as determinative of any analogous case by Dunford J in R v RAT [2000] 111 A Crim R 360 when his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[44] The fact remains that all counts depended on the evidence of the complainant being accepted as true beyond reasonable doubt and  
         on the only two counts where her evidence could be set against other apparently or potentially reliable evidence, it failed to carry sufficient conviction to reach the criminal standard of proof in the eyes of the jury. There is nothing in her evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gives any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to the first three counts where it could not be tested than it was in relation to the other counts where it could be, and was, tested. 
          On the two counts where on the complainant’s evidence, corroboration was available, such corroboration was not forthcoming. The very matters which justify a finding that the verdicts are not inconsistent in the sense of being a compromise are matters which call into question the complainant’s credibility in respect of the counts on which the appellant was acquitted. 
         
        
        
         
         [45] In those circumstances, notwithstanding the fact that her evidence as transcribed carries conviction, that it does not, in my opinion, contain discrepancies or inconsistencies such as were apparent in  
         M 
          and the trial judge who like the jury had the opportunity of seeing the complainant and other witnesses was satisfied she was telling the truth, I consider that in accordance with  
         Jones 
          the convictions on counts 1-3 must be regarded as unreasonable and cannot be supported, and must be set aside and judgments of acquittal entered.” [Emphasis added] 
         
        
       
     53    The matters emphasised in par [44] of Dunford J’s judgment paraphrase the terminology in the majority judgment in Jones which his Honour had earlier set out. His Honour’s recitation of countervailing facts in par [45] are, in my opinion, facts and matters relevant to a conclusion in that, or any analogous case, that the result in Jones should not apply on the facts in that case. Nevertheless his Honour considered that “in accordance with Jones”, the court should set aside the convictions in the case before the court. In my opinion, it is wrong to approach the authority of Jones on the basis that whenever facts of a similar character are found to those set out in the passages of the joint judgment to which I have referred above, the finding must be the same as in Jones. Whether or not such a conclusion is appropriate depends on all of the circumstances of the case. 
      
       
     54    Dunford J went on to reiterate his understanding of the effect of Jones as a precedent in the context of formulating a direction which he concluded ought to be given in such cases. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[46] If I am correct in my understanding of the effect of  
         Jones, 
          then I believe consideration needs to be given to the directions regularly given to juries in such trials. Juries are constantly told that they should consider each count in the indictment separately and also that they may accept part of a witness’ evidence and not accept other parts of the evidence of that same witness. But  
         Jones 
          appears to establish a qualification to these directions to the effect that in sexual cases, where the only direct evidence of the commission of the offences is that of the complainant, if they are for any reason not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant is telling the truth in relation to one count, it is not open to them to be satisfied to the criminal standard that she (or he) is telling the truth in relation to any other count; and therefore in such cases (that is, where there is no independent evidence of the commission of the offences) if they find an accused not guilty on one count, they must also find him not guilty on all counts. They should also be warned specifically that if they return different verdicts where there are no distinguishing features in the evidence, such verdicts are liable to be regarded as a compromise and the guilty verdicts set aside.” 
         
        
       
     55    His Honour’s statement that, in the identified circumstances, the jury “must … find” the accused “not guilty on all counts” elevates the conclusion in Jones to a proposition of law. In my opinion, this approach is wrong. The appropriateness of the suggested direction will be discussed below. 
      
       
     56    In R v Barnett [2000] NSWCCA 283, Dunford J applied the approach he had adopted in RAT. In Barnett the counts on which the appellant was convicted were distinguished by the fact that there was independent evidence of opportunity to commit the offences. His Honour found that, applying MacKenzie, the different verdicts were not “an affront to logic and commonsense” but, nevertheless, applying Jones: 
      
       
        
         
         “[28] The independent evidence of opportunity of them being alone … did not render her evidence more credible on those counts than on the others.” 
         
        
       
     57    In R v Carbone [2000] NSWCCA 387, Wood CJ at CL referred to the decisions in this Court applying Jones and to Dunford J’s analysis of the cases in RAT. Wood CJ at CL added: 
      
       
        
         
         “[56] … In summary those decisions give recognition to the circumstance that,where in sexual assault cases with multiple counts involving a single complainant and a single accused, the only direct evidence of the commission of the offences is that of the complainant, then acquittal on any one of the charges will in the absence of an acceptable explanation, normally require acquittal on the remainder. 
         
        
        
         
         [57] This follows from the circumstance that, in such a case, the rejection of the complainant’s evidence will involve a diminution in his or her overall credibility which cannot be overcome, in the absence of some circumstance that might restore that credibility for the other counts. This requires identification of some fact or surrounding circumstance that would provide a rational basis for accepting the complainant’s evidence upon the other counts, ie something which would justify the conclusion that the evidence, on those other counts, was more reliable, or stronger, than it was for the count upon which it was rejected.” 
         
        
       
     58    Similarly, in R v Dixon [2001] NSWCCA 39, Whealy J said at [52]: 
      
       
        
         
         “In  
         R v RAT 
          (2000) NSWCCA 77 Dunford J (with whom Barr J agreed) at (46) held that  
         Jones v The Queen 
          (1997) 191 CLR 439 appears to have established that in sexual assault cases where the only direct evidence of the commission of the offences is that of the complainant, if the jury is for any reason not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant is telling the truth in relation to one count, it is not open to them to be satisfied to the criminal standard that the complainant is telling the truth in relation to any other count. Therefore, in such cases, if the jury finds an accused not guilty on one count it must also find him not guilty on all counts.” 
         
        
       
     59    To similar effect is the conclusion of Sully J in R v S [2001] NSWCCA 204. In that case the appellant had been convicted on three counts and acquitted on three counts. With respect to the latter the complainant’s evidence about the surrounding circumstances of the alleged incidents had been successfully challenged. Sully J, with whom Dowd J agreed, referred to Jones at 453 and added at [14]: 
      
       
        
         
         “ … whilever that reasoning remains on foot with the authority of the High Court of Australia then this applicant would, given the facts of the present case seem to me to entail necessarily that the convictions on counts 1, 2 and 3 cannot stand.” 
         
        
       
     60    The approach to the reasoning in Jones reflected in RAT, Barnett, Carbone, Dixon and S has not been universally applied in this Court. If it had been adhered to, it is likely that a number of decisions would have been different (e.g. R v JJT (NSWCCA, 3 December 1997, unreported); R v Kiskarpati (NSWCCA, 4 November 1998, unreported); R v W (1999) 109 A Crim R 51; R v AG & RJM [2000] NSWCCA 86; R v ACK [2000] NSWCCA 180; R v AT [2000] NSWCCA 342 (as to the first count at [79]); R v ARD [2000] NSWCCA 443; R v MFA [2001] NSWCCA 71).  
      
       
     61    Furthermore, the approach does not appear to have been adopted by courts of criminal appeal in other States. (See e.g. R v J (No 2) [1998] 3 VR 602 esp at 628; R v KET [1998] VSCA 73 at [29]; R v Hilsley [1998] VSCA 143 at [60] and [78]; R v Maddox (QCA, 4 December 1998, unreported); R v Petterwood (QCA ,11 August 1998, unreported); R v Knuth (QCA, 23 June 1998, unreported); R v R [2000] QCA 27 at [26]-[28]; R v C [2000] QCA 385 at [47]; R v KWG [2000] SASC 398 at [65]-[67], [77]-[83]; RM v The Queen (WASCA, 23 February 1999, unreported); Ellis v The Queen (WASCA, 26 September 1997, unreported); Williams v R [2000] TASSC 182 at [6]; Asplin v The Queen, (WASCA, 26 August 1999, unreported) at [26] and [39]; Balaam v The Queen [2000] WASCA 292 at [17]; Spiteri v The Queen [2001] WASCA 82 at [6]). 
      
       
     62    There are, however, cases which appear to be consistent with the approach in the line of New South Wales authorities to which I have referred (see e.g. R v Kenward [2000] QCA 482 at [6], [8] and [149]-[150]; R v Ritchie [2001] QCA 142). 
      
       
     63    In these circumstances it is appropriate that prior authority in this Court should be reviewed by a bench of five. 
      
       
     64    The reasoning in RAT, Barnett, Carbone, Dixon and S suggests that Jones established the proposition that in a pure word against word case a mixture of acquittals and convictions cannot be sustained unless the Court can detect a relevant difference in the quality of the complainant’s evidence. 
      
       
     65    In my opinion this is not what the High Court intended. Whether or not the failure of the jury to accept the complainant’s version in one respect ought to have led to the jury to have a reasonable doubt with respect to other matters, must depend on the full range of relevant circumstances. The High Court held in Jones that on the facts of that case the acquittal necessarily undermined the credibility of the complainant’s evidence about other alleged incidents. By reason of the wide range of matters of fact and degree that must be considered in making a credibility finding, that conclusion does not, in my opinion, follow in every such case unless the Court is positively satisfied that there is some relevant difference in the quality of the complainant’s evidence. 
      
       
     66    I repeat, with my emphasis, a sentence from the joint judgment in Jones at 453: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is nothing in the complainant’s evidence  
         or the surrounding circumstances 
          which gives any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to those counts than it was in relation to the second count.” 
         
        
        
       The reference to “the surrounding circumstances” requires an appellate court to consider all the facts of the case. 
        
       
     67    I agree with the reasoning of Winneke P in R v KET [1998] VSCA 73: 
      
       
        
         
         “[28] …  
         Jones’s 
          case, in my view, is a case which has to be looked at in the light of its own particular facts, as indeed all cases where this issue raised must be. In  
         Jones’s 
          case three discrete acts of sexual penetration were alleged and the jury convicted the accused on two and acquitted on one, in circumstances where the acquittal, as the judgments made clear, must necessarily on the facts of that case have reflected upon the credibility of the complainant’s evidence on the other two counts. Furthermore, it would seem from the judgments in  
         Jones’ 
          case that special emphasis was laid on the prejudice flowing to the accused from the delay in complaint because it was apparent from the special facts of the case that there was a real risk that the delay had deprived the accused of what the majority judges had called ‘a cast iron alibi’. 
         
        
        
         
         [29] However, in my view, it would be wrong to draw from the decision of  
         Jones’  
         case the general proposition that, in cases where multiple sexual offences are alleged involving the one complainant, the jury’s acquittal on some of those counts should compel an appellate court to conclude that the jury must necessarily have regarded the complainant generally as an untruthful witness or that her credibility was impacted upon in respect of the counts upon which they had convicted.” 
         
        
        
       (See also  
       R v KWG 
        [2000] SASC 398 at [79] per Martin J). 
        
       
     68    There have, of course, been cases since Jones in which the Court was able to detect from the transcript that there were relevant differences in the way the complainant gave evidence on the matters which led to an acquittal when compared to those which led to a conviction (see e.g. R v RJB [1999] VSCA 188 at [26]; R v Tee [1999] SASC 352 at [70]; R v A [2000] QCA 520 at [23] and [106]; Jaensch v The Queen [2000] WASCA 212 at [37]; Miles v The Queen [2000] WASCA 364 at [66]; R v OGD (No. 2) [2000] NSWCCA 404 at [126]; Strickland v The Queen [2000] WASCA 68 at [65]-[70], [74]; Duniam v R (TASSC, 22 September 1997, unreported). 
      
       
     69    The absence of any relevant difference in the complainant’s evidence was emphasised in Jones, as it had been in M (at 494 quoted at para 4 above). It is not, however, in my opinion, the case that the reasoning in Jones requires a court of criminal appeal to quash a conviction in a pure word against word case, unless the differences between or amongst the verdicts can be explained in this way. 
      
       
     70    Indeed, the courts’ respect for the constitutional role of the jury, affirmed in Jones itself, is such that a court of criminal appeal could conclude that subtle differences in the way evidence was presented - differences not apparent from the transcript available on appeal - may explain what appear to be, at first sight, inconsistent verdicts. 
      
       
     71    In R v J (1994) 75 A Crim R 522 at 540, Brooking J referred to “the inability of the transcript to record pauses or other indications of indecision”. In R v Robinson (2000) 111 A Crim R 388 at [61] Barr J referred to the possibility that the jury may make an assessment of reliability “… by the way he gave his evidence rather than by what he said”. Adams J made similar observations in ARD supra at [201] and [203]. See also Spiteri v The Queen [2001] WASCA 82 at [34]. 
      
       
     72    Furthermore, in a number of cases a court of criminal appeal has expressed its conclusion in terms of what a jury “may” have done, which suggests that some form of differentiation about the character of the complainant’s evidence was accepted by the jury, although it was not apparent to the appellate court. (See e.g. Miles v The Queen (WASCA, 21 December 1998, unreported); R v Hilsley [1998] VSCA 143 at [78]; R v C [2000] QCA 385 at [47]; R v Knuth (QCA, 23 June 1998, unreported); Balaam v The Queen [2000] WASCA 292 at [9], [14], [17]; Spiteri v The Queen [2001] WASCA 82 at [22], [32] and [37]). 
      
       
     73    The circumstances of a particular case may lead to the conclusion that a jury which has found that it had a reasonable doubt with respect to a complainant’s evidence on one count, ought to have had such a doubt with respect to other counts. However, it does not follow that that must necessarily be the case.  
      
       
     74    It is not, however, easy to formulate principles as to when a jury should conclude that a reasonable doubt on one count, notwithstanding the complainant’s evidence on that matter, means that the jury ought to have a reasonable doubt about other counts, about which the only evidence is from the complainant. 
      
       
        
       When is Partial Rejection of the Complainant’s Evidence Acceptable? 
        
       
     75    The joint judgment in MacKenzie supra at 367-8 quoted with approval from the judgment of King CJ in R v Kirkman (1987) 44 SASR 591 at 593: 
      
       
        
         
         “Sometimes juries apply in favour of an accused what might be described as their innate sense of fairness and justice in place of the strict principles of law. Sometimes it appears to a jury that although a number of counts have been alleged against an accused person, and have been technically proved, justice is sufficiently met by convicting him of less than the full number. This may not be logically justifiable in the eyes of a judge, but I think it would be idle to close our eyes to the fact that it is part and parcel of the system of administration of justice by juries. Appellate courts therefore should not be too ready to jump to the conclusion that because a verdict of guilty cannot be reconciled as a matter of strict logic with a verdict of not guilty with respect to another count, the jury acted unreasonably in arriving at the verdict of guilty.” 
         
        
       
     76    This particular application of the principle that an appellate court should respect the constitutional role of the jury, must be given careful consideration in cases alleging inconsistency in verdicts. There are often a number of possible explanations for divergent verdicts that do not necessarily give rise to a doubt about the complainant’s credibility on all counts. For example, where there is contradictory evidence on one count but not on others, the jury may well have taken the view that there was no point in adding yet another verdict of guilty, so that it was unnecessary to fully consider the conflicting evidence. 
      
       
     77    Considerations of this character appear to lie behind this Court’s judgment in R v Kiskarpati (NSWCCA, 4 November 1998, unreported) in which three counts of sexual intercourse without consent and one count of common assault were alleged to have occurred on the same occasion. The allegations relating to the sexual offences involved digital penetration, cunnilingus and vaginal intercourse. The appellant was convicted of the count of vaginal intercourse and acquitted of the other two sexual offences. Hidden J with whom McInerney and Ireland JJ agreed concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “… I think it sufficient to say that the jury may have taken a practical view of the whole encounter and decided that those two verdicts of guilty, that is, in relation to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent and in relation to the charge of common assault, were sufficient to reflect the appellant’s culpability.” 
         
        
       
     78    There are cases in which nothing at all appears to differentiate the complainant’s evidence, which the jury accepted beyond reasonable doubt, from the evidence which the jury did not so accept. In such a case the MacKenzie test of ‘logic and reasonableness’ is not satisfied. 
      
       
     79    Difficult issues arise when a reason for differentiating between the verdicts does exist but that reason relates to the credibility - whether in terms of veracity or reliability - of an uncorroborated complainant. The case law since Jones has frequently concluded that a jury was not obliged to have a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s credibility in general, when it did not accept her (it usually is a “her”) version of events to the criminal standard in some respect or respects. The distinction has been variously expressed: 
      
       
     · “accepted the complainant as truthful but admitted the possibility of faulty recollection in some cases” R v J (1994) 75 A Crim R 522 at 540 referred to with approval in R v J (No 2) [1998] 3 VR 602 at 628. 
      
       
     · distinguish a case in which the jury “rejected as unreliable the substance of the complainant’s evidence” from a case in which it was “cautious about some details” (R v Maddox (QCA, 4 December 1998, unreported) at [1] per McPherson JA) and “doubts” about “details” (per Thomas JA at [21] and White J at [2]). 
      
       
     · “still accept the basic story at less than the full alleged detail” (R v Russell (QCA, 24 March 1999, unreported)). 
      
       
     · “generally truthful, even if she might have been exaggerating in this part of her evidence” (R v ACK [2000] NSWCCA 180 at [53]). 
      
       
     · whether the jury found the complainant’s evidence “dishonest rather than unpersuasive in the circumstances” (R v C [2000] QCA 385 at [47]). 
      
       
     · “the jury did not disbelieve the complainant but they thought her evidence lacked the requisite particularity as to time, place or circumstance to justify conviction” (Duniam v R (TASSC, 22 September 1997, unreported)). 
      
       
     80    In a number of other cases, courts of criminal appeal have concluded that in the circumstances of the case, an acquittal contrary to the complainant’s evidence did not necessarily mean that the complainant’s general credit was undermined (see e.g. R v KET supra at [29]; R v Hilsley [1998] VCSA 143 at [78]; R v Maddox supra at [1]; R v R [2000] QCA 27 at [28]; R v AT [2000] NSWCCA 342 at [18]; R v AG & RJM [2000] NSWCCA 86 at [51]; Williams v R [2000] TASSC 182 at [4]; R v McNamara (QCA, 1 December 1998, unreported)). 
      
       
     81    It is usual in such cases to give a strong warning about the dangers of acting on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. Where the jury accepts and implements such a direction, it does not necessarily mean that the jury ought to have had a doubt about the complainant’s credibility generally. 
      
       
     82    In a number of cases the presence or absence of corroboration has been accepted as a relevant point of differentiation. The jury convicted in cases where there was corroboration, but not otherwise (see e.g. King, Bull and Marotta v The Queen (WASCA, 19 January 1998, unreported) (an appeal to the High Court was successful on other grounds - Bull v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 443); R v Petterwood (QCA, 11 August 1998, unreported); R v Hilsley [1998] VSCA 43 at [60] and [78]; R v KCW [1999] NSWCCA 112 at [95]-[106]; R v ARD [2000] NSWCCA 443 at [23], [121]-[124] and [201]; R v PLV [2001] NSWCCA 282 at [21]-[34]. 
      
       
     83    In some cases a jury has acquitted on counts which were not the subject of the original complaint. Although such a discrepancy is capable of affecting credit, it has not been found to require an acquittal on other counts. 
      
       
     84    In R v JJT (NSWCCA, 3 December 1997, unreported) a factor distinguishing the acquittal and the conviction was that the day after the alleged incidents, the complainant went to the police but lodged a complaint only in terms of the count on which the jury convicted but not in terms of the other count. Gleeson CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “True it is, as the jury were instructed, that the complaint did not amount to corroboration. Nevertheless, the question of consistency was one which the jury were entitled to regard as important and they were entitled to regard the complaint that was made on the day following the events as inconsistent with the evidence in relation to count 3, but as consistent with the evidence in relation to count 2.” 
         
        
       
     85    In R v ACK [2000] NSWCCA 180 a similar discrepancy arose. The original complaint did not include reference to the incident on which the jury acquitted. No relevant inconsistency arose ([51]-[53]). 
      
       
     86    In Asplin v The Queen (WASCA, 26 August 1999, unreported) a number of not guilty verdicts were distinguished on the basis that they had not been included in the original complaint ([26] and [34]). 
      
       
     87    In Williams v R [2000] TASSC 182 the appellant was charged with six sexual offences committed within one three and a half hour period in the complainant’s home. The jury returned unanimous guilty verdicts on the first count (indecent assault) and the sixth count (vaginal rape). The jury acquitted on the remaining counts (digital penetration, oral rape, and two counts of vaginal rape). The acquittal on the count involving oral rape was a unanimous acquittal, the other three acquittals were by majority. The appellant had admitted the event comprising the alleged indecent assault but denied an absence of consent. He said that none of the other events occurred at all. 
      
       
     88    Cox CJ, with whom Crawford and Blow JJ agreed, noted that this was a word against word case at [3] and said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[4] The jury was rightly told to examine each count and not to convict the appellant thereon unless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt on that count. The findings they made are consistent with their having been satisfied that the acts comprising counts 1 and 6 occurred without her consent, but that they were not satisfied to the requisite degree that the acts comprising the other four counts had occurred. In the circumstances, it would be remarkable had they been satisfied she had consented to some acts but not to others, two of which were of precisely the same kind, that is, vaginal intercourse, as that on which they had convicted. Indeed, had the only issue been one of consent, then having regard to the close link in time and nature of the alleged conduct, an acquittal on one or more counts would almost certainly have carried an acquittal on the others (see  
         R v Whelan 
          [1973] VR 268,  
         R v Kelly 
          (1985) 38 SASR 561). However, this was not a case where the conduct complained of, other than in respect of count 1, was admitted and the issue therefore confined to consent. The more likely explanation for the differentiation is absence of satisfaction as to the occurrence of all the acts themselves. Disbelief of the complainant’s claims on some of these matters did not logically require them to disbelieve her on all her claims. The doing of the acts comprising count 1 is common ground, consent being the only issue.  
         There was no evidence of recent complaint in respect of digital penetration or the penetration of her mouth, and her complaint that she had been raped did not extend to a complaint of having been raped on several occasions. 
          The verdict is consistent with a jury having been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that without her consent the complainant had been sexually assaulted and raped at least once. The presence of semen, confirmed by the medical evidence, was capable of corroborating her claim that the appellant had ejaculated inside her on the last occasion she said vaginal penetration had occurred. In my view, there is nothing inconsistent in the jury, satisfied that counts 1 and 6 had occurred in the absence of any evidence other than her own, failing to be satisfied that all the other incidents had occurred, as she had described and giving to the appellant the benefit of such doubt as they had on the matter. There is no affront to logic and commonsense in their verdicts.” [Emphasis added] 
         
        
       
     89    One of the factors emphasised in the majority joint judgment in Jones was the proposition that the complainant’s evidence “failed to carry sufficient conviction” in the circumstances where, “her evidence could be set against other reliable evidence” (455). This proposition has been applied, e.g. R v Russell (QCA, 24 March 1999, unreported); R v D [2000] QCA 417 at [12]; R v James [1999] NSWCCA 191 at [64] cf [10]; Eastough v The Queen (WASCA, 12 March 1998, unreported). 
      
       
     90    However, there are a number of cases where the existence of contrasting or contradictory evidence has been referred to as providing a rational basis for the jury bringing in different verdicts, but the court of criminal appeal concluded that it was open to the jury to convict. This line of authority emphasises the significance of the facts of a particular case. 
      
       
     91    An express differentiation in this respect was made by this Court in R v AT [2000] NSWCCA 342. In the case of an acquittal on one count on which there was contradictory evidence this was found to be an acceptable basis for differentiation at [79]. (The appeal was successful because of an acquittal on another count which relied solely on her credit ([83]). 
      
       
     92    Similarly in R v J (No 2) [1998] 3 VR 602 at 628 Winneke P and Charles JA concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the jury was prepared to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt in respect of particular offences alleged on the presentment where there was acceptable evidence from independent sources pointing to the possibility that the offence had not occurred at the time or in the circumstances particularised in the relevant count. The verdicts, so viewed, do not in our opinion demonstrate inconsistency, nor do they demonstrate that the jury regarded the complainant,  
         on matters of substance 
         , as other than a witness of truth.” [Emphasis added] 
         
        
       
     93    The issue in each case may well turn on what, in the circumstances of the case, should be regarded as a “matter of substance”. In a word against word case, cross-examination on surrounding contextual detail is often essential for the defence case. Some surrounding circumstances are of sufficient significance that the Court will conclude that the jury ought to have had a doubt about the complainant’s evidence with respect to other incidents. Not all surrounding circumstances are of such significance. 
      
       
     94    In Jones, on the count on which the jury acquitted, the appellant’s wife and daughter gave evidence that they were always present at weeknight training sessions and always travelled home with him. On this basis the complainant and the appellant could not have been alone when, as she alleged, he had given her a lift home and the sexual assault allegedly occurred. This was a matter of substance on which the jury did not accept the complainant. 
      
       
     95    In Jones, the first count of which the appellant had been convicted was alleged, in the end, to have occurred on a Saturday. An assistant coach had said that the appellant drove her home after each such session, but she conceded in cross-examination that it was possible that she had travelled home by train on occasions during the relevant period. This, of course, was precisely the kind of detail affected by the four year delay in the complaint. The jury were not given a Longman warning about the adverse effects of delay, which was particularly pertinent to the evidence of the assistant coach, as emphasised by Brennan CJ, the other member of the majority at 445-446. 
      
       
     96    The third count, being one of two of which the appellant was convicted, occurred in circumstances where, at least after the delay, no suggestion of third party presence arose and was, accordingly, entirely word against word.  
      
       
     97    It is important to recognise the significance of the evidence in Jones which contradicted the complainant’s evidence. That evidence was to the effect that no sexual assault of any kind could have happened because the complainant and the appellant were not alone at the relevant time. On the first count the evidence could well have had, but for the delay, the same certainty and would then have been of the same quality as the evidence which led the jury to entertain a doubt about the second count, on which it acquitted. Jones did not involve a conflict over some circumstantial aspect of an alleged assault, cross examination about which could have an effect on whether the complainant’s evidence should be believed, but which did not directly challenge the central allegation of sexual assault. 
      
       
     98    The case law since Jones indicates that it is not always the case that the jury ought to have had a doubt about the complainant’s evidence with respect to all counts, whenever the relevant distinction between the verdicts of guilty and of acquittal is explicable on the basis that, in the case of the former there was not, and in the case of the latter there was, evidence contradicting or calling into question the version given by the complainant. 
      
       
     99    It is not desirable to lay down any general principle to determine when the impact of contradictory evidence which appears to have led the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt on one or more counts, ought to have so undermined the credibility of the complainant that the jury should have felt such a doubt about other counts, with respect to which there was no contradictory evidence. This court and other courts have reached different conclusions when faced with such a situation, the result turning on the particular facts of the case. 
      
       
     100    In R v James [1999] NSWCCA 191 the appellant was found guilty of three counts of indecent assault on a female under the age of sixteen, not guilty on a fourth count, with the jury unable to reach an unanimous verdict on a fifth count. Some twenty-one years had elapsed between the date of the alleged incidents and the trial. 
      
       
     101    With respect to the count of which the appellant was acquitted, the complainant had given detailed evidence about the nature of a house that was on the property at which the incident was said to have occurred. Notwithstanding the lapse of twenty-one years, the appellant was able to testify that there was no building on the property at that time and to call an independent witness to confirm that proposition. With respect to the count on which the jury was unable to agree there was an odd feature of a most improbable statement which the complainant had attributed to the appellant. Simpson J, with whom Bell J agreed, referred to Jones and said that there was “no relevant distinction between Jones and the present case” [64]. Referring to the matters which led the jury to reach different conclusions her Honour said at [64]: 
      
       
        
         
         “All that can be drawn from these is that, where there was any positive material to contradict, or create a doubt about, the complainant’s claims, the jury doubted her credibility. As in  
         Jones 
         , if they had a doubt about her credibility on the fourth count (and some, at least obviously had doubts about her credibility on the third as well) then, axiomatically, they must (or ought) to have doubted her credibility generally.” 
         
        
       
     102    Simpson J referred at [65] to the passage from MacKenzie at 367 specifically the sentence: 
      
       
        
         
         “But, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted.” 
         
        
       
     103    Her Honour said, with respect to MacKenzie and Jones: 
      
       
        
         
         “[66] The key to reconciling the two High Court judgments lies in the opening words of the second sentence in the passage from  
         MacKenzie 
          extracted above. An appellate court will not interfere with a verdict of guilty if there is a proper way of reconciling the different verdicts. In  
         Jones 
          the only reasonable explanation for the differing verdicts was doubt about the complainant’s credibility. That does not provide a proper way of reconciling the verdicts.” 
         
        
       
     104    Beazley JA dissented. Her Honour referred to the passage at 366 in MacKenzie with respect to inconsistency, saying “the test is one of logic and reasonableness”. Beazley JA added: 
      
       
        
         
         “[7] In determining whether verdicts are logical and reasonable, the court is also required to ascertain whether the verdicts can be reconciled or explained in some way. ... . Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ provide a number of examples of how apparently inconsistent verdicts are explainable. Thus, if there is some evidence to support the inconsistent verdict, the appellate court is not to substitute its own view of the facts ... . Another explanation for the verdicts may be that the appellate court considers: ‘… that the jury simply followed the judge’s instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count …’.” 
         
        
       
     105    With respect to the count on which the appellant was acquitted her Honour noted the contrary evidence about the existence of a building on the property at the relevant time. Her Honour indicated that she agreed that the jury must have had doubts about this and added: 
      
       
        
         
         “[10] …A number of possibilities of course present themselves as to the complainant’s version. She may, for example, have made up the incident. Her recollection may have been seriously awry as to the condition of the property. There may have been some such incident which she confused or perhaps even merged different incidents. Whatever be the correct position, there is no doubt that the complainant was not believed on her oath in respect of the incident alleged. This, of course, is a matter which affects her credit. However, the jury had the benefit of seeing and hearing both the appellant and the complainant and clearly believed the complainant on the count in respect of which they returned a guilty verdict. A logical and reasonable explanation of the differences in the verdict is that the jury obeyed, as they were bound to do, the directive that each charge had to be considered on its own and they had to be satisfied of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt before being able to come to a guilty verdict.” 
         
        
       
     106    With respect to the count on which the jury could not agree, her Honour indicated that a question of credit also arose, although there was no independent evidence contradicting the complainant’s version. Her Honour then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[12] … the question arises whether the doubt as to the complainant’s credit in respect of the third and fourth counts so infected her evidence generally that there should have been a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant on all counts.” 
         
        
        
       Beazley JA referred to  
       Jones 
        and concluded that the case was not directly governed by  
       Jones 
        and in her opinion the verdict was not unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
        
       
     107    In R v W (1999) 109 A Crim R 51 the appellant was convicted of two sexual offences and acquitted of one sexual offence against the same child during the same period. The Crown case was entirely dependant on the evidence of the complainant (p53). Greg James J, with whom Newman and Sperling JJ agreed, rejected the ground of appeal based on the reasoning in Jones. The count upon which the appellant was acquitted was said by the complainant to have occurred in the presence of the appellant’s then nine year old daughter. That daughter was called to give evidence and denied the happening of the events in count 2 (on which the appellant had been acquitted). She could not recall any circumstances consistent with the allegations comprising count 3. This established a rational basis for the decision of the jury. Greg James J concluded at p58: 
      
       
        
         
         “True it was that the complainant’s evidence was challenged, not only by that of the appellant but also by the evidence of the appellant’s daughter on count three also … but in my view the evidence of the complainant was not such that her credibility should be considered so tainted that there should be acquittals entered. I do not consider the verdicts were not supported by the evidence or that the evidence was insufficient:  
         Fleming  
         (1998) 103 A Crim R 121. Nor do I consider that the convictions were unreasonable applying the test in  
         James 
          [1999] NSWCCA 191 …” 
         
        
       
     108    In R v AG & RJM [2000] NSWCCA 86 one of two appellants was found guilty of three counts, acquitted on one, with the jury unable to reach a verdict on two counts. The other appellant was indicted on four counts and found guilty on all four. One of the counts upon which the jury were unable to agree was said to have occurred on an oval near what the complainant said was a toilet block. The count on which the appellant was acquitted was said to have occurred in that toilet block. Other evidence showed that at the relevant time there was no toilet block.  
      
       
     109    Simpson J with whom Spigelman CJ and Ireland J agreed said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[29] The existence of a toilet block was of fundamental importance to proof of the charge in count 8. Its existence was not fundamental to proof of the charge in count 1, but was of some significance as a collateral matter in the assessment of C’s evidence in relation to that count. 
         
        
        
         
         [30] It is a reasonable inference that the doubts created about the existence of the toilet block were the reason for the doubts in the minds of those jurors who were not satisfied of RM’s guilt on count 1, and the reason for the doubt in the minds of all the jurors in relation to count 8.” 
         
        
       
     110    With respect to the other charge on which the jury was unable to reach a verdict, there was other evidence suggesting the presence of other persons at the time and the place where the offence was alleged to have occurred “rendering the description of the events given by [the complainant] unlikely” [35].  
      
       
     111    Simpson J concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “[38] The three charges on which the jury did not convict can be explained by reference to particular objective circumstances I have mentioned - the absence of the toilet block in 1978-1979, and the public nature of the Prospect County Council at the time of the events alleged to constitute count 5. True it is that, in accordance with  
         Jones 
         , it is necessary carefully to scrutinise the jury verdicts, having regard to the possibility that the acquittal and the disagreements are properly to be seen as representing a doubt in the jury’s minds about C’s credibility, a doubt that would necessarily apply to his credibility on other counts as well. I do not think this is such a case.” 
         
        
       
     112    Similar issues arose in RM v The Queen (WASCA, 23 February 1999, unreported). The case involved three counts. With respect to one there was a verdict of acquittal by direction by reason of the absence of evidence. The jury convicted on one count and acquitted on the other.  
      
       
     113    Murray J, with whom Malcolm CJ and White J agreed, referred to Jones in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the circumstances of that case the High Court found it impossible to discern any distinguishing factual features logically capable of explaining the different outcomes. Indeed, in relevant respects it appeared that the evidence was substantially the same and so their Honours concluded that once the jury found that the complainant’s evidence, which was uncorroborated, lacked sufficient cogency to convict of the offence of which the jury acquitted the appellant, it was impossible to see how they could have arrived at a different conclusion with respect to the counts upon which they convicted.” 
         
        
       
     114    In the case before the court, his Honour found that the jury could conclude that “despite some inconsistencies and uncertainties, the child’s evidence was an essentially reliable account in relation to the conduct constituting the element of sexual penetration ...”. With respect to the count of which the appellant was acquitted, the complainant had said the offence was committed in Karratha. She gave evidence that there was a shower block with two cubicles in which the alleged incident occurred. When she was cross-examined there appeared to be inconsistencies between her evidence and police statement about how many showers there were at Karratha.  
      
       
     115    Significantly, an independent witness gave evidence to the effect that the trip that the appellant made in his employment to the north was unlikely to have included Karratha. Murray J concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “In my view it is perfectly feasible to suppose that the jury, being required to deal with a specific incident, found the evidence … to be a significant barrier to their capacity to rely upon the child’s evidence as being not only a truthful recollection, but also an accurate and reliable one, and I can see no reason to suppose that the jury might not reasonably have concluded that they remained in reasonable doubt about that alleged offence, while they accepted the accuracy and reliability of the child’s account of digital penetration. 
         
        
        
         
         This is not a case, I think, where it must be concluded that the failure of the jury to accept the complainant’s evidence as reliably establishing the offence of indecent dealing imported an incapacity for them to accept her as a witness of truth whose evidence did reliably establish the offence of sexual penetration.” 
         
        
       
     116    Malcolm CJ described the evidence of the independent witness as “sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt”.  
      
       
     117    In R v ARD [2000] NSWCCA 443 with respect to one count, the explanation of the complainant’s presence with the appellant was that she had been asked to feed the birds in the appellant’s de facto wife’s absence. The de facto, who otherwise gave evidence against the appellant, said that she had made no such arrangement about the birds. I concluded at [28]: 
      
       
        
         
         “In view of this direct contradiction between RD Junior and RD Senior with respect to the circumstances of Count 11, there was in my opinion a relevant basis for differentiation upon which the jury could distinguish Count 11 from other counts. That differentiation was based on the surrounding circumstances of the specific incident. It was not of a kind which damaged the credibility of RD Junior on all counts.” 
         
        
        
       Adams J said at [202]: 
        
        
         
         “I think it likely that the jury accepted that there were a number of sexual assaults perpetrated on RD by the appellant but, where there was apparently credible evidence which showed that a closely connected fact asserted by her to be part of the sequence of events may not have occurred, it was not prepared to convict. That was sufficient to give rise to a reasonable doubt. So far as count 11 was concerned, the contradictory evidence was rather slight, which indicates, perhaps, that the jury’s judgment was a somewhat finely balanced one.” 
         
        
       
     118    In R v J (No 2) the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria had before it a case in which sexual offences had allegedly been committed by a father on his daughter over a period of 21 years, when the complainant was aged between eight and 29. There were three counts of indecent assault and ten counts of incest. The accused was convicted on three counts of indecent assault and four counts of incest and acquitted on the other six counts of incest. Winneke P and Charles JA in a joint judgment with which Callaway JA relevantly agreed concluded at 628: 
      
       
        
         
         “… it seems to us to be clear from the verdicts that the jury accepted the complainant as a witness of truth when she testified that she had been the subject of sexual abuse from the applicant …. However it is also clear from their verdicts that the jury was prepared to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt in respect of particular offences alleged on the presentment  
         where there was acceptable evidence from independent sources pointing to the possibility that the offence had not occurred at the time or in the circumstances particularised in the relevant count 
         . The verdicts, so viewed, do not in our opinion demonstrate inconsistency, nor do they demonstrate that the jury regarded the complainant, on matters of substance, as other than a witness of truth. On the contrary they demonstrate that, in respect of the charges upon which they convicted the applicant, they must have accepted the complainant as a witness of truth and accuracy. 
         
        
        
         
         It is necessary to bear steadily in mind as Hayne JA and Southwell AJA pointed out in  
         R v Girgines 
          (unreported, Court of Appeal, 26 March 1996) that the jury’s verdicts of acquittal on some counts do not amount to a positive finding by the jury that the events as recounted by the complainant did not occur. As we have already pointed out, the verdicts of not guilty show no more than that the jury was not satisfied to the requisite standard that the acts alleged in those counts occurred or occurred at the time or in the circumstances particularised in them.” [Emphasis added] 
         
        
       
     119    In R v R [2000] QCA 27 the appellant was convicted of two counts of sexual offences with a child and found not guilty with respect to six counts. The complainant was ten or eleven at the time of the alleged offences which occurred over a period of almost two years. McMurdo P said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[26] I am satisfied there was a rational basis open for the jury to reach its verdict of guilty on counts 6 and 7, whilst acquitting on the remaining counts. As to count 1 there was evidence from the appellant’s mother that at all times when the complainant visited her she was present with the appellant and the complainant. The complainant was unsure as to when it occurred and failed to give the evidence opened in respect of count 2. This may well have caused the jury to have a reasonable doubt in respect of her evidence as to count 1. 
         
        
        
         
         [27] As to counts 3 and 4, the complainant’s brother Damien said in cross-examination that the complainant was picked up after Damien met up with the appellant at the boat in dry dock, not before. This may well have left the jury in doubt about the complainant’s evidence on this count. 
         
        
        
         
         [28] As to count 5, there was no evidence supporting the complainant’s version of what was a brazen and bold incident in a small boat with two others in close proximity, neither of whom noticed anything untoward. The jury may reasonably have decided that they could not accept the evidence of the complainant beyond reasonable doubt on this count. In not being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the complainant’s evidence on these counts they were not necessarily deciding she was not credible.” 
         
        
       
     120    The fine line often involved in resolving these issues is illustrated by two contrasting decisions of the Supreme Court of Western Australia: Eastough v The Queen (WASCA, 12 March 1998, unreported) and Wimbridge v The Queen [2000] WASCA 117. The different results is a manifestation of the proposition that each case must turn on its own facts. 
      
       
     121    In Eastough, the applicant was indicted on nine counts involving sexual offences against his daughter over a period of six to seven years. He was convicted of seven counts and acquitted of two counts, one of sexual penetration and the other of indecent assault. Kennedy J, with whom Steytler J agreed, applied Jones. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Appeals based on inconsistency of verdicts commonly fail by reason of the fact that there is to be found in the evidence some particular feature which explains why the jury could have distinguished between the evidence on the various counts in the indictment and convicted the accused on some counts, while acquitting him on others. There is a relevant feature in this case, but it is that, in relation to the counts on which the appellant was found not guilty, there was present in the house a third person, the appellant’s then wife, who gave evidence which contradicted that of the complainant. 
         
        
        
         
         In relation to the counts on which the appellant was acquitted on his trial, the complainant was very precise in her evidence. The infant Roslyn was sleeping in her cot in her bedroom. She described the appellant’s coming in and waking her up and whispering her name, and she gave detailed evidence as to the complainant’s other actions and as to the surrounding circumstances. The evidence of the complainant was that these offences occurred before the appellant’s son Timothy was born, at a time when Roslyn and the complainant were sleeping in the middle room in the appellant’s house. The evidence of the appellant’s then wife was that, before her son Timothy was born, Roslyn had always slept in the main bedroom, and, furthermore, there had never been any occasion when she had been awakened by Roslyn’s crying when she found that the appellant was not in his bed. It is therefore clear that the complainant’s evidence was not accepted where another witness was available to give evidence throwing significant light on the surrounding circumstances … . 
         
        
        
         
         In this case, as in  
         Jones v The Queen 
         , implicit in the appellant’s acquittal on counts 5 and 6 was a non-acceptance of the complainant’s account of the events which were said to give rise to these counts, and her overall credibility was diminished. The only reasonable conclusion is that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of her evidence concerning these counts. There was nothing to give any cause for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to the other counts than it was in relation to these counts.” 
         
        
       
     122    Pidgeon J dissented. His Honour referred to the fact that the test involved an allegation of continuous misconduct from an early period in the life of the complainant by her father over an extended period of time, in contrast with an allegation of misconduct over a shorter period by an unrelated person (as was the case in Jones). His Honour concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “I do not consider on the facts of this case that it would be a proper judgment for this Court to make that the acquittal damaged the credibility of the complainant in respect of her evidence of the acts of impropriety. The complainant was having difficulty in putting them into a time frame and the acquittal is consistent with a doubt of them occurring in the circumstances outlined by her when describing the fifth and sixth counts. She could have been mistaken on the fact that her stepbrother had not been born. This would give rise to a reasonable doubt as to whether the conduct occurred in the circumstances outlined by her.” 
         
        
       
     123    In Wimbridge the applicant had been convicted of two offences of sexually penetrating his daughter but was acquitted of a third charge of a similar nature.  
      
       
     124    In the case of the third count, on which the acquittal was entered, the complainant described the offences occurring on the applicant’s boat shortly after the complainant’s aunt who was visiting from Melbourne had left the boat. The effect of the aunt’s evidence was that the only time that she visited the boat with both the applicant and the complainant was some years before the alleged date of the offence. Pidgeon J, with whom Wallwork and Murray JJ agreed, concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “[58] I consider that the convictions on the other two counts can be explained on the basis that the jury did not believe the applicant’s evidence generally by reason of the first two convictions. The jury had been instructed to look at the complainant’s evidence with great care and to treat each matter separately. The jury were then required to assess the position that a witness called by the Crown to support the complainant’s evidence as to the date a vessel was visited and the identity of the vessel said no visit was made by her with the complainant on the date in question. Her evidence was the visit described by both the complainant and the applicant was at an earlier time and prior to the applicant acquiring the vessel  
         Pretty 
           
         Woman 
         . His Honour referred to the fact that the aunt’s evidence did not support the complainant. It did not do so because the aunt’s evidence showed that the only time that they were on a launch together was at a much earlier time. I consider the aunt’s evidence as to time would be a likely cause for the jury not to convict having regard to the directions they received and it is not an indication that the complainant’s overall credibility was diminished.” 
         
        
       
     125    This review of the authorities indicates that a reasonable jury is not obliged to have a doubt about the occurrence of some incidents about which it has only a complainant’s uncorroborated evidence, if they have such a doubt about other incidents whenever, in the latter but not the former case, there is evidence contradictory of, or failing to support, the evidence of the complainant. Any conclusion about this matter depends on the full range of relevant circumstances. Insofar as previous decisions of this Court such as RAT, Barnett, Carbone, Dixon and S, suggest the contrary (and the actual results in those cases depend on their particular facts) they should not be followed. 
      
       
        
       The Evidence on Count 6 
        
       
     126    In the present case, count 6 alleged an act of sexual intercourse without consent. Counts 1 to 5 occurred over the period 29 January 1981 to 24 July 1981. There were no charges relating to alleged incidents later in 1981, although the complainant gave evidence that such conduct continued to occur. Count 6 was said to have occurred on 4 February 1982. At first the complainant said that this was the first day of the school term. After cross-examination she admitted that it occurred on the second day of the school term being a Thursday. All of the evidence indicated that it was on Thursdays and Fridays that her mother came home late from work and, accordingly, the complainant stayed at the Appellant’s apartment. 
      
       
     127    Each of counts 1 to 5 allege a single identifiable act of indecency (in four cases) and intercourse (in one case). Count 6 differs in this regard. In the light of the extended definition of sexual intercourse, a number of different possible acts were left to the jury as constituting the offence, including penile penetration, digital penetration and cunnilingus. 
      
       
     128    The complainant’s evidence on count 6 was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. What happened on that day after the accused came home? 
          
         A. [TM] pointed to the bedroom door and he was pushing my - he pulled his pants down, pulled his penis out. 
         
        
        
        Q. Is this when you were in the bedroom? 
        
        A. It was behind the door in the bedroom, yes. 
        
        
         
         Q. Which bedroom? 
          
         A. His, [TM]’s bedroom. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What happened? 
          
         A. I remember I had like my school uniform on and I saw his hand come down to go under my dress and I didn’t want it to happen so I pulled my dress down tight so he couldn’t do it but he kept trying to pull my dress and I ended up with my dress up around my waist. He pulled my pants down and he pulled his penis out and he put his penis to my vagina and to my arse also. I remember his finger - he was putting his finger into my arse and it hurt. 
         
        
        
         
         I remember that I cried out, I made a sound. I didn’t scream, I cried out a little bit and he told me to be quiet and he still kept fiddling around with his finger and pushing his penis on to me. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What do you mean by fiddling with his finger? 
          
         A. He was putting his finger in and out of my vagina, in and out and around on my vagina and also he was putting it up into my arse as well. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did anything else happen? 
          
         A. I went into the lounge room and he pointed to the bedroom again and told me to get under the bed, so I went under the bed. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How were you positioned under the bed? 
          
         A. I went around the side of the bed and my head went under the bed first and my legs were sticking out of the bed. My legs were straight and they were closed and he pulled my legs apart, trying to part my legs. He pulled my pants down and then he licked me on the vagina and he was pointing his tongue into my vagina and putting his finger in, so he would put his tongue first and then his finger, then his tongue and his finger and it was very painful. It hurt me a lot. He was forcing his finger in and it was very rough. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you do anything to try and stop him? 
          
         A. I was pushing him on the head telling him to stop. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did he do? 
          
         A. He kept going for a while and then he stopped. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did you do? 
          
         A. I got out from under the bed, pulled my pants up myself.” 
         
        
       
     129    The complainant had earlier given evidence about another incident that had occurred at the end of February 1981, being an incident about which there was no count in the indictment. She had given evidence that this incident had also occurred under the same bed in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. When you went into that bedroom, were you told to go somewhere? 
          
         A. He told me to go under the bed. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What sort of bed was this? 
          
         A. It was just a mattress but there was nothing under the bed. It was very low to the floor, the mattress. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And was it a single mattress or a double mattress? 
          
         A. Double. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You said you were told to go under the bed? 
          
         A. Yes, he kept pointing to get under the bed. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And did you do that? 
          
         A. I said, “No.” I pointed to the other side and he kept pointing to going under the bed and he grabbed my arm and told me to get under the bed. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And did you go under the bed? 
          
         A. I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And how much of your body was under the bed? 
          
         A. My legs were out but my body was under the bed. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How much space was there between the floor and the bottom of the bed? 
          
         A. Not much, the mattress - there was probably, maybe an inch and a half, two inches between my face and the bottom of the mattress. But I was on my front and he turned me around and my legs were sticking out. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did something happened whilst you were partially under the bed? 
          
         A. He pulled my dress up. [TM] pulled my dress up and pulled my pants across and looked at my vagina. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you place his right little finger which had a long fingernail --? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. -- after he wet his finger with his own saliva into your vagina? 
          
         A. Yes, he did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can you describe what happened? 
          
         A. First of all he used his left hand to pull my pants across to look at my vagina. Then he wet his finger with his own mouth, inserted his finger into my vagina and was scratching me and I pulled, put my hand down on to his head to push him away but he ignored me and just continued to do it.” 
         
        
       
     130    In his summing up, the trial judge left count 6 to the jury in the following way: 
      
       
        
         
         “The sixth count, that is the 4 February 1982 date. Again, according to the complainant, they were playing. The accused pointed to the bedroom door and pulled his pants down, pulled his penis out. And according to her, ‘he pulled my pants down and pulled his penis out and put his penis to my vagina and to my arse. I remember him putting his finger into my arse too’. Then she said she cried out. ‘I made a scream. I didn’t scream. I cried out a little bit’, and so on. 
         
        
        
         
         Then; ‘He putting his finger into and out of my vagina and in and out and around my vagina. Also he was putting it up and into my arse as well.’ After that activity - that is what the Crown relies on in support of the charge of sexual intercourse without consent, count number six. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown also relies on evidence that after the activity I have just described, he engaged in cunnilingus and licking her in the vaginal area using his tongue and putting his finger in and alternating between his tongue and finger. She said, ‘It was very painful. It hurt me a lot. He was forcing his finger in, very rough.’ So those are the various physical activities the Crown relies on in support of each of the six counts.” 
         
        
       
     131    The cross-examination of the complainant included a number of specific matters relating to particular charges and suggestions of inconsistency between the original statement that she made to the police and the evidence she gave in court. The thrust of the cross-examination concentrated on one general theme and one specific theme.  
      
       
     132    The general theme was the improbability of the events occurring in circumstances of likely discovery. On the complainant’s version of events at all times the appellant’s wife was present in the apartment and cooking in the kitchen. Furthermore, with respect to a number of counts, the alleged incidents occurred during the course of a game of hide and seek in which the appellant’s then four year old son was a participant. On no occasion did he disturb the appellant during the alleged incidents, some of which occurred over several minutes, even though he would have been looking both for the appellant and the complainant in a small flat after counting for ten seconds. 
      
       
     133    The specific matter related to count 6 and concerned the bed which featured in one aspect of the alleged incident. The defence case asserted that the bed was still owned by the appellant at the date of trial and used in his new residence. This was in the form of an ensemble bed with a base very close to the ground and a mattress on top of it. That bed clearly would not permit any person, even a young child, to lie underneath it. Another focus of the cross-examination was on the improbability of the event occurring as the complainant testified, even if the bed had been of the nature described by the appellant with an inch or two above her face when she lay underneath it. 
      
       
     134    The appellant’s submissions in this Court focused on the evidence concerning the nature of the bed present in the main bedroom at the appellant’s family’s apartment. Although the appellant’s evidence in this regard was expressed in a number of ways, he, his wife and his son each asserted that the bed which was present in that bedroom in 1981 and 1982 was taken by the family to their new residence and was the same bed that they still had. Photographs of that bed showed a gap of only a few inches between the floor and the bottom of the bed and, accordingly, the events as recounted by the complainant as to part of count 6 could not have occurred. She could not physically have been under the bed in the way she asserted, if the bed was of the character described by the appellant’s witnesses. 
      
       
     135    Count 6 alleged an act of sexual intercourse but there are a number of different acts capable of constituting the act of intercourse. The events said to have occurred behind the door on this occasion included penile penetration of both the vagina and the anus as well as digital penetration of both the vagina and the anus. Events said to have occurred under the bed on the same occasion included cunnilingus and penile penetration of the vagina.  
      
       
     136    It does not appear that the Crown was confined by particulars to any specific act of penetration as constituting the act of intercourse for the purposes of count 6. The trial judge’s summing up, to which no objection was taken, left a number of these alleged acts to the jury. Accordingly, it was open to the jury to find the appellant guilty on count 6 on the basis of events that allegedly occurred behind the door whilst setting aside the events which allegedly occurred under the bed. The fact that they found the appellant not guilty on count 6, suggests that they may have been concerned with some aspect of the case which went beyond the conflict of evidence about the bed. 
      
       
     137    In its submissions the Crown identified a factor distinguishing count 6 from other counts. Count 6 was specific in terms of the date alleging that the offence occurred “on 4 February 1982”. Two of the other counts used the formulation “on or about” particular dates. The other three counts which used a formulation of “on” a particular date did not give rise to any dispute as to the date. As Simpson J notes, nothing in the summing-up suggests that any issue arose during the course of submissions with respect to the evidence on this matter. Nevertheless, the evidence was not entirely satisfactory and could well have given rise to a question in the minds of the jury. The jury received no direction to the effect that the date was not essential. 
      
       
     138    In the course of her evidence in chief the complainant answered “yes” to the question: “Was 4 February 1982 the first day of the new school term?”. She then gave the evidence as to the events that transpired relevant to count 6. Her evidence, as confirmed by other witnesses, was that it was only on a Thursday or Friday that she spent time at the home of the appellant. In the course of cross-examination she admitted that Wednesday rather than Thursday was the first day of school and confirmed that it was only on the Thursday that she was at the apartment. Her attention was drawn to her statement to the police where she had asserted, as she had asserted in her evidence in chief that it was Thursday 4 February that was the first day of a new school term. She agreed that that was what she had told the police and then was asked the following and answered as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q: Was what the (sic) told the police accurate? 
         
        
        
         
         A: No, it was the right information.” 
         
        
        
       It is not clear what this meant. 
        
       
     139    In the event, after cross-examination, it was clear that she said that the alleged offence occurred on the Thursday, which she now accepted was the second day of the school term. 
      
       
     140    The difficulty for present purposes is not the minor change to her evidence as to whether or not the incident occurred on the first or second day of the school term. This Court was informed, and it may be that the Court could take judicial notice, that 4 February 1981 was, in fact, a Thursday. However, the jury did not know that. It may have been left in doubt as to whether the date of the offence being a Thursday, was as specified in the indictment, being 4 February.  
      
       
     141    No-one identified to the jury that the date was not an essential aspect of the charge (see R v KWG [2000] SASC 398). In the circumstances, where the jury did not have any evidence before it as to whether or not 4 February was the first or the second day of the school term, it may have concluded that the Crown had not established that the alleged offence occurred on the date specified in the indictment. This is a possible explanation for the acquittal on this count. 
      
       
     142    This would be enough to dismiss the appeal on this ground. As a different view may be taken in this regard, it is appropriate to consider other bases for differentiation between the divergent verdicts. 
      
       
     143    Even if the jury did have some doubt based on the evidence of the appellant, his wife and the son about the identity of the bed, the not guilty verdict does not necessarily indicate that they ought to have had a doubt about the complainant’s evidence of a character which would have required them to have a doubt about her evidence with respect to the other counts.  
      
       
     144    It is possible for the jury to have decided that a conviction of the appellant on five out of six counts was sufficient to reflect the total criminality of his conduct and that there was no point in deciding the issue as to whether or not the contrary evidence did give rise in their minds to a reasonable doubt with respect to the complainant’s evidence about this count based only on the question of the nature of the bed. 
      
       
     145    The evidence in relation to the bed included the assertions by the appellant, his wife and the son of the continued identity of the bed in its new location, which established that it was not possible for even a young girl to lie underneath it. There was, however, evidence from a police officer that when she inspected the bed at the new apartment she formed the impression that it was “new”. The police officer was cross-examined to establish that she had not undertaken the kind of inspection that would enable her to make such a judgment. Nevertheless, no other attempt was made to establish in any objective way that the bed was in fact an old one. The jury could well have concluded that, the issue of age having been raised, the police investigations should have determined the age one way or the other. In the absence of any such evidence, the jury may have decided that the appellant was entitled to the benefit of the doubt. That does not mean that the jury’s failure to accept the complainant’s recollection about the bed ought to have led them to doubt her credibility generally. 
      
       
     146    There is another explanation for the not guilty verdict with respect to count 6 which, in my opinion, is a more likely explanation of the jury’s differentiation amongst the counts. There was a difference between the complainant’s evidence about count 6, which may satisfy the description of a differentiation in the “quality” of her evidence in accordance with the reasoning in Jones, albeit one which raises its own issue of credibility. 
      
       
     147    The complainant’s evidence with respect to the essential aspects of the acts constituting the offence for the first five counts was as follows: 
      
       
     · Count 1 - touching and biting a breast behind the bedroom door. 
      
       
     · Count 2 - touching a breast behind the bedroom door, return to the loungeroom and then back to the bedroom door and an act of masturbation. 
      
       
     · Count 3 - rubbing of the penis in the toilet, then moving to the adjacent bedroom where an act of fellatio occurred. 
      
       
     · Count 4 - rubbing of the vagina while sitting on the balcony, then going to the bedroom where an attempt was made of penile penetration and actual digital penetration occurred. 
      
       
     · Count 5 - act of fellatio behind the bedroom door. 
      
       
     148    Part of the cross-examination of the complainant was directed to establish the inherent improbability of many of the events that were said to have occurred by reason of the likelihood of discovery. On all relevant occasions the appellant’s wife was in the kitchen and on most of the occasions the then four year old son of the appellant was present and on many occasions in the course of playing a game of hide and seek. Finally with respect to the incident alleged on the balcony the evidence suggested that it may have been possible for neighbours to observe the acts said to have occurred there.  
      
       
     149    Each of counts 1-5 represented a limited number of sexual acts capable of being completed within a comparatively short period of time. Count 6 was, in this respect, different. During the course of the events said to constitute count 6, the complainant alleged: 
      
       
     · penile penetration of the vagina. 
      
       
     · penile penetration of the anus. 
      
       
     · digital penetration of the vagina. 
      
       
     · digital penetration of the anus. 
      
       
     · cunnilingus alternating with further digital penetration. 
      
       
     150    It was open to the jury to find that it was inherently unlikely that all of these events had occurred at the same time. The existence of such doubt would not necessarily affect the jury’s assessment of the complainant’s evidence on the other counts. There was evidence of sexual assaults on occasions other than those specified in the six counts before the court The jury may well have formed the view that the complainant had telescoped a number of different events into a single event on that particular day which was the subject of count 6. This could raise a question in the jury’s mind as to the reliability of her evidence with respect to that specific count, being a question which did not necessarily lead them to have a doubt as to her honesty, or otherwise affect their preparedness to accept her evidence with respect to the other counts. 
      
       
     151    As in the case of a doubt about the identity of the bed, the possibility that she had telescoped a number of different events into one, was capable of affecting her credit on other counts. Whether it did so was quintessentially a jury question. Having carefully read the whole of her evidence, I have concluded that it was open to the jury to accept the balance of her evidence to the criminal standard, while entertaining a doubt, if that is what happened, about her evidence relating to count 6. 
      
       
     152    The complainant was deaf and gave evidence by signing. The transcript suggests that all her evidence was given with assurance and, given the lapse of time, with an extraordinary range of detail. In this regard nothing differentiated the evidence on count 6. Nonetheless, the lapse of time was such as to affect anyone’s capacity to recall. It was open to the jury to conclude that some aspect of the fragility of memory had affected the complainant’s recollection with respect to count 6, but did so for that count alone. The clarity and conciseness of her evidence with respect to counts 1-5, as it appears to me from the transcript, carries conviction. It obviously did so for the jury who saw her give her evidence. In my opinion, it was open to the jury to accept that evidence, even if it had a doubt about her evidence on count 6 of the character I have discussed. 
      
       
     153    When it comes to assessing the alleged inconsistency in the overall context, further points of distinction appear between this case and Jones. 
      
       
     154    One aspect of the evidence in Jones which was emphasised in the joint judgment, as quoted above, was the fact that the delay in that case was unexplained. That is not the case here. The complainant indicated that at one stage the appellant had made a sign to her indicating that he would cut her throat, telling her to be quiet. This occurred after the incidents which comprise counts 1 to 3. 
      
       
     155    In her evidence, the complainant admitted that on all occasions the complainant’s wife (VM) was in the kitchen and she did not complain to her. The appellant said in re-examination: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Why didn’t you go straight to [VM] and complain to her? 
          
         A. Because he had threatened. He had gestured to me the cut throat gesture and told me to ‘shush’ putting his index finger over his mouth and also because I was afraid my mother would smack me because - and that’s why I just didn’t say anything to anybody. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Before he made that gesture about cutting your throat do you recall the occasions when you say the accused did things to you? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why didn’t you tell [VM]? 
          
         A. I was afraid I was a young child. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why didn’t you tell your mother about any of these things? 
          
         A. I didn’t want to. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why? 
          
         A. My mother would smack me; she smacked me often.” 
         
        
       
     156    Although no immediate complaint was made after counts 1-3, the victim was a young girl with a significant disability. Thereafter, unlike Jones, an explanation was proferred for the absence of complaint. 
      
       
     157    Secondly, as I have indicated above, an important feature of Jones was the fact that there was no Longman warning. In the present case there was such a warning. The emphasis which the judgment in Jones gave to the significant effect of delay upon the ability of the appellant to defend himself, in the context of reaching the ultimate conclusion that it was not open to the jury to convict was, in my opinion, affected by the absence of such a warning. That is not the case here. 
      
       
     158    Thirdly, in Jones the evidence of the complainant was entirely uncorroborated. In the present case, with respect to count 2 the complainant said that she remembered the acts of forced masturbation had hurt her because the appellant had a long fingernail which was scratching her hands and her arm and she told him that it hurt. Furthermore, in cross-examination about count 4, she said that the act of digital penetration hurt her, because of the length of the appellant’s fingernail. 
      
       
     159    In his Record of Interview with the police the appellant admitted that he did in fact grow a fingernail long enough to remove staples at work, although in his evidence at the trial he sought to describe his fingernails as “normal” in length. In this respect the jury could accept that with respect to counts 2 and 4 that there was corroboration of the complainant’s evidence. 
      
       
     160    I would dismiss this ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       Alleged Defects in Directions 
        
       
     161    The trial judge told the jury that the delay of almost twenty years that occurred in this case between the events and the trial adversely impacted upon the ability of the defendant to test the evidence against him. He gave, as an example, the issue that had arisen as to the nature of the bed present in the main bedroom at the date of the alleged incident in count 6 and the other uncharged incident that allegedly occurred under the bed. He pointed out that if delay had not occurred an accurate date of manufacture could have been established. He concluded by directing the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “If you are of the view it was difficult to test the complainant’s evidence because of the passage of almost twenty years, then you are entitled to take the view that it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless, scrutinising the evidence with great care considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning I have given you, you are satisfied of its truth and accuracy.” 
         
        
       
     162    This is a warning in accordance with the authority of the High Court in Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 as affirmed in Crampton v The Queen (2000) 75 ALJR 133; [2000] HCA 60. No complaint is made in this case of the warning given in this regard. The warning itself highlights the centrality of the credit of the complainant. Complaint was, however, made as to his Honour’s failure to give directions with respect to other matters relevant to the jury’s assessment of the complainant’s credit. 
      
       
     163    In his opening remarks to the jury, the trial judge had emphasised that the jury must look at the six charges separately. His Honour indicated in his summing-up to the jury that it was open to them to accept some parts of a witness’s evidence and reject other parts. He also said: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the Crown is totally reliant on the complainant’s evidence. It is a matter of commonsense as well as law that you would need to scrutinise her evidence with great care before you decided that a verdict of guilty was the appropriate answer and you would certainly need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the truth and reliability of the evidence that she gives.” 
         
        
       
     164    His Honour also said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is up to you how you deal with the evidence and how you find your verdicts, but you may consider that it would be very difficult to find him guilty on one and not guilty on others. You either might accept the complainant as a truthful, accurate, credible witness or you do not. It is difficult to see how.”  
         
        
       
     165    With respect to the delay in complaint his Honour gave the jury the statutory direction in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “The law requires me to give you a direction that an absence of complaint in respect to the commission of an alleged offence by the person on whom the offence is alleged to have been committed, or delay by the complainant in making such complaint, does not necessarily indicate the allegation was false. 
         
        
        
         
         I am directed to tell you that there may be good reason why the victim in a sexual assault would delay in making …a complaint about the assault. … You remember the evidence the complainant gave about it. Firstly, she said that she was frightened of being smacked by her mum and also she was frightened because of the accused saying ‘shush’ and making the motion across the throat sign. That was the reason she gave.”  
         
        
       
     166    Immediately upon retiring the jury sent a note which asked the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “We would also like to propose a question to [the complainant] as to the reason for coming forward and reporting an incident that occurred several years ago.” 
         
        
       
     167    His Honour directed the jury in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “As to your final inquiry that you would like to propose a question to [the complainant] as to the reason for coming forward and reporting an incident that occurred twenty years ago, I have given you a bit of a direction that we are required to go in in that respect. Again, the difficulty is that [the complainant] is not here and the whole of the evidence in the case is finished. We are, in effect, stuck with that situation. The Crown is not in a position to call her back and certainly would not want to call her and it is not for me to put her back in the witness box after the case is finished insofar as the evidence is concerned. 
         
        
        
         
         So I am sorry to be so negative, members of the jury, but that is about all I can say.” 
         
        
       
     168    In the course of his directions the trial judge indicated to the jury that matters of consistency were of significance when assessing the credibility of the witness. After the jury retired it asked for clarification of the dates on which the complainant had made statements to the police. 
      
       
     169    The appellant submitted that the jury’s question about the “reason for the complainant coming forward” in substance raised an issue as to whether or not the complainant had a motive to lie. Where such an issue has arisen during the course of the trial by reason of conduct, usually by the prosecution but sometimes by the defence, it will often lead a trial to miscarry (see Palmer v The Queen (1998) 193 CLR 1; R v Jovanovic (1997) 42 NSWLR 520). There are dangers involved in any line of reasoning that suggests a reversal of the onus of proof. It was submitted that the trial judge should have directed the jury in this regard. 
      
       
     170    The question that the jury posed was not in terms, nor in my opinion in substance, a question which suggested an impermissible line of reasoning on the part of the jury. It was, in my opinion, a natural question which does not necessarily point in one direction or another as far as the impugned reasoning process is concerned.  
      
       
     171    The jury’s question was not, in my opinion, directed to the proposition that the credibility of the complainant could be enhanced by the absence of a motive for the complainant to lie. The question was probably directed to exploring why the complainant had brought upon herself the inconveniences and, perhaps, the humiliation of a public process with respect to such matters after the passage of so long a period of time. This is a natural question to ask in the context of an assessment of credibility. Of itself, it does not suggest a reversal of the onus of proof. 
      
       
     172    The form of the question does not indicate in any way that the absence of an answer would redound to the benefit or disadvantage of the appellant. In my opinion this ground of appeal should be rejected. 
      
       
     173    The appellant made two distinct criticisms of the directions with respect to the jury’s assessment of the credibility of the complainant. 
      
       
     174    The first criticism was the failure of the trial judge to expressly inform the jury that the delay in the making of the complaint was itself a matter to be taken into account in assessment of the credibility of the complainant. The second criticism was the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury as to the assessment of the complainant’s credibility if the jury were minded to acquit on any count. 
      
       
     175    As noted above, the trial judge gave the jury a direction as required by s107 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (previously s405B of the Crimes Act 1900). There is authority that such a direction, which tells the jury that there may be reasons for delay in the complaint, should be balanced by the jury being informed that it was entitled to take into account the delay in assessing the complainant’s credibility (see Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427). Indeed authority supports the proposition that such a direction should be given “as a general rule” (Kilby v The Queen (1973) 129 CLR 460 at 465; R v Davies (1985) 3 NSWLR 276 at 278). Nevertheless in Davies the appeal was dismissed on the basis that in the particular circumstances of the case the issue of the complainant’s credibility had been adequately put before the jury (see 279). 
      
       
     176    In this case the central significance of the credibility of the complainant must have been obvious to the jury. His Honour informed them that they needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt “as to the truth and reliability of the evidence that she gives”. His other directions reinforced this proposition. 
      
       
     177    It may be reasonably obvious to most persons that delay in coming forward in the making of a complaint is required to be taken into account in assessing credibility. Nevertheless, in a case such as the present, where the delay is of a lengthy period, in my opinion, a direction of this character should have been given to ensure a fair trial. 
      
       
     178    In view of the clear direction that the Crown did depend on the complainant’s evidence and the strong Longman warning, I may have been minded to reach the same conclusion as in Davies that the complainant’s credibility had been adequately left to the jury. However, when this omission is combined with the next matter complained of, a different conclusion is appropriate. 
      
       
     179    The appellant put its submissions with respect to the appropriate direction in the event of a mixture of acquittals and convictions in a number of ways. At first, the appellant sought, but eventually resiled from, a direction in the form propounded by Dunford J in RAT, which I have set out in full above. For the reasons I have given above, such a direction was based on a misunderstanding of Jones.  
      
       
     180    In part, the direction proposed by Dunford J referred to the consequences on appeal of a finding of a particular character. This is inconsistent with the High Court’s decision in Lucas v The Queen (1970) 120 CLR 171 at 175. Insofar as the direction stated that if the jury finds an accused not guilty on one count, it “must also find him not guilty on all counts” [emphasis added], it constitutes an impermissible interference with the proper function of the jury. No such direction should be given. 
      
       
     181    The appellant eventually relied on alternative formulations of a direction requiring the jury to take into account the failure of the complainant’s evidence to satisfy it beyond reasonable doubt in one or more respects on any count, when assessing her evidence on other counts. In this respect the appellant relied on the observations of Fitzgerald JA in R v Robinson (2000) 111 A Crim R 388 at [9]: 
      
       
        
         
         “The circumstances might be such that the jury should also be instructed that if they hold a reasonable doubt concerning the reliability of a complainant’s evidence on one or more counts, whether by reference to the complainant’s demeanour or for any other reason, they must take that into account in assessing the reliability of his or her evidence in relation to other counts.” 
         
        
       
     182    In R v ARD [2000] NSWCCA 441 I referred at [12] and [14], to Fitzgerald JA’s comments in Robinson. I had earlier, in [8]-[9], indicated directions that might be given. It was directions of this character that I had in mind when I said in par [10] that it will often be prudent, and sometimes necessary, to assist the jury in this way. I did not intend to indicate that a direction of the kind proposed by Dunford J as to what a jury must do was appropriate (cf R v KWG [2000] SASC 398 at [8] and [74]). 
      
       
     183    Fitzgerald JA’s observations in Robinson were made in a context in which his Honour had identified the usual practice of directing a jury to consider each count separately and tell it that it was entitled to accept part of what a witness said and reject other parts. His Honour indicated that directions of this character may not always be sufficient.  
      
       
     184    As with many aspects of the process of weighing evidence, a judge may be able to assist the jury by drawing its attention to certain matters, even matters which would be regarded by many to be obvious. I express considerable reluctance to add to the number of directions and warnings which trial judges are already required to give. McHugh J noted in KRM v The Queen (2000) 75 ALJR 550; [2000] HCA 11 at [37]: 
      
       
        
         
         “The more directions and warnings juries are given the more likely it is that they will forget or misinterpret some directions or warnings.” 
         
        
       
     185    Nevertheless, the case law on inconsistent verdicts, particularly in the context of sexual assault cases but not limited to that context, indicates that there is a recurring difficulty in this respect. It may appear to be obvious that a reasonable doubt about one aspect of a complainant’s evidence ought to be taken into account when assessing that witness’s evidence on other matters. However, there have been a significant number of cases in which courts of criminal appeal have acted on the basis that the jury may have failed to do so.  
      
       
     186    In the light of the number of cases it is desirable that the traditional direction as to treating each count separately is supplemented in a word against word case. Some reference ought to be made to the effect upon the assessment of the credibility of a complainant if the jury finds itself unable to accept the complainant’s evidence with respect to any count. 
      
       
     187    Some form of direction assisting the jury in this respect should be given, to employ the terminology found in Kilby and Davies “as a general rule”. Its absence is not necessarily fatal (as it was not in Davies itself). Furthermore, as the joint judgment in Crofts affirmed, the “general rule” does not apply “where the peculiar facts of the case and the conduct of the trial do not suggest the need for a warning to restore a balance of fairness” (at 451). 
      
       
     188    It is not necessary to specify any precise words for such a direction. That will depend on the circumstances of the case. It will often be appropriate to direct a jury that where they entertain a reasonable doubt concerning the truthfulness or reliability of a complainant’s evidence in relation to one or more counts, that must be taken into account in assessing the truthfulness or reliability of the complainant’s evidence generally. 
      
       
     189    On other occasions it may be appropriate for a judge to indicate to the jury, whilst making it clear that it remains a matter for the jury, that it might think that there was nothing to distinguish the evidence of the complainant on one count from his or her evidence on another count.  
      
       
     190    Or it may be appropriate to indicate that, if the jury has a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s credibility in relation to one count, it might believe it difficult to see how the evidence of the complainant could be accepted in relation to other counts. 
      
       
     191    The precise terminology must remain a matter for the trial judge in all the particular circumstances of the specific case. The crucial matter is to indicate to the jury that any doubt they may form with respect to one aspect of the complainant’s evidence, ought be considered by them when assessing the overall credibility of the complainant and, therefore, when deciding whether or not there was a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s evidence with respect to other counts. 
      
       
     192    In the present case the trial judge attempted to give a form of direction in this regard. The full quotation indicates that the grammar of the passage was either not precise or, given other apparent defects of the transcription, was not accurately recorded.  
      
       
     193    The appellant focused on the fact that the passage inverted the proper reasoning process, when his Honour is recorded to have said: 
      
       
        
         
         “You may consider that it would be very difficult to find him guilty on one and not guilty on others.” 
         
        
        
       The proposition discussed above would require a formulation of: 
        
        
         
         “You may consider that it would be very difficult to find him not guilty on one and guilty on others.” 
         
        
       
     194    If the appeal was concerned only with this matter, I would not have concluded that this particular passage was of sufficient significance to allow the appeal on the basis that the trial judge invited the jury to engage in tendency reasoning, without warning it against the dangers of such reasoning. The inversion appears to have been a slip, which passed without comment by counsel at the trial. The very next sentence was “[y]ou either might accept the complainant as a truthful, accurate, credible witness or you do not”. The context prevented an impermissible course of reasoning. Plainly, by acquitting on one count, the jury did not adopt such an approach. 
      
       
     195    Nevertheless, the jury did not have its attention expressly directed to the proposition that a reasonable doubt with respect to the complainant’s evidence on any count, ought to be taken into account on the complainant’s credibility generally. This would have been pertinent whether or not the doubt in the mind of the jury arose by reason of the evidence about the bed, or the extended nature of the incidents that were alleged to have occurred in the space of a short period or for some other reason. 
      
       
     196    Again, if the only inadequacy in the summing-up had been this omission, I would not have allowed the appeal on this basis. This Court has no basis for correcting what may have been a transcription error rendering the trial judge’s comments unclear. Nevertheless, he did direct the jury’s attention generally to the interconnection of credibility issues amongst the various charges. In the overall context, particularly the strong Longman warning, this may have been sufficient. However, there are two matters which relate to the critical issue in the case, namely the complainant’s credibility. The cumulative effect of these matters casts a doubt in my mind on the fairness of the trial. 
      
       
     197    In my opinion, in the circumstances of this trial the jury required greater assistance in two respects than the trial judge gave in the relevant parts of the summing-up, which I have set out above. The combined impact of the absence of directions on the effect on credibility of delay in complainant and of an acquittal on one count, is such that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.  
      
       
     198    As the High Court said in Crofts supra at 451: 
      
       
        
         
         “The overriding duty of the trial judge remains to ensure that the accused secures a fair trial.” 
         
        
        
       In my opinion, the appellant did not receive a fair trial. 
        
        
       New Trial? 
        
       
     199    The appellant was sentenced to a period of two and a half years imprisonment with a non parole period of one year for the fifth count. For counts 1-4 the trial judge imposed concurrent fixed term sentences of one year. He will be eligible for release on parole on 12 October 2001. Accordingly, the appellant has served a major part of his minimum term. 
      
       
     200    I have given careful consideration to whether, in these circumstances, the Court should direct verdicts of acquittal on all counts. The public vindication of the claims of a victim of offences of this character is significant. The appellant was convicted on five counts of sexually interfering with an eight to nine year old child. Whether or not, in all the circumstances, he should be put to trial again is appropriately determined by the executive branch of government. Accordingly, I propose that the appeal be allowed, the convictions quashed and a new trial ordered. 
      
       
        
       
     201    WOOD CJ at CL: I adopt the statement of facts and issues for appeal identified in the judgments of Spigelman CJ and Simpson J. By reference to that material, I shall confine myself to those grounds of appeal in respect of which I wish to add my own observations. 
      
       
        
        
        
       Differentiation in verdicts 
        
       
     202    With the benefit of the extensive analysis by Spigelman CJ of the many decisions, since Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439, which have addressed the question whether a jury verdict is “unreasonable or cannot be supported,” within the meaning of S6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) or its equivalent in other jurisdictions, I consider it necessary to restate my own position in respect of that provision. That involves some qualification of the passage in my judgment in R v Carbone (2000) NSWCCA 387, which is extracted in that analysis. 
      
       
     203    That decision, and other decisions to similar effect (e.g. R v RAT (2000) 111 A Crim R 360; R v Barnett (2000) NSWCCA 283; R v Dixon (2001) NSWCCA 39, R v Mills (2001) NSWCCA 48, and R v S (2001) NSWCCA 204), had dealt with the situation where a jury had returned a verdict of acquittal on one or more counts preferred in an indictment charging multiple counts. They were cases where the only direct evidence of the offences was that of the complainant, and where the jury had convicted the accused upon the remaining counts. They appear to have reflected a presumption that, in such a case, absent the positive identification of some fact or surrounding circumstance providing a rational basis for accepting the complainant’s evidence on the counts of which the accused was found guilty, the other verdicts should be regarded by a Court of Criminal Appeal as unreasonable. 
      
       
     204    The rationale for such conclusion was that the rejection, by the jury, of the complainant’s evidence, in relation to the counts or counts upon which verdicts of not guilty were returned, involved a fatal diminution in that witness’s overall credibility. These decisions, accordingly, required the Crown, if it were to maintain the convictions, to point to circumstances that could positively restore the complainant’s credibility on the remaining counts, or to identify some rational basis for the jury having distinguished between the counts on which it returned verdicts of guilty and not guilty respectively. 
      
       
     205    Upon reflection, and with the benefit of a comprehensive review of the decisions to date, I have reached the conclusion that this line of decision has read too much into Jones, and has advanced a principle that is altogether too rigid.  
      
       
     206    A convenient starting point is the decisions of the High Court in MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 where Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ emphasised, at 366: 
      
       
        
         
         “Where, as is ordinarily the case, the inconsistency arises in the jury verdicts upon different counts of the originating process in a criminal trial,  
         the test is one of logic and reasonableness”. 
         
        
       
     207    As their Honours continued, at 367: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the respect for the function which the law assigns to juries (and the general satisfaction with their performance) have led courts to express repeatedly, in the context both of criminal and civil trials, reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense. Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate courts may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge’s instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.” 
         
        
       
     208    The respect which is properly to be afforded to the constitutional role of the jury, and the advantage which it has in seeing and hearing the evidence unfold was recognised in M v The Queen (1984) 181 CLR 487 at 493, in a passage cited with approval in Jones at 451: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay  
         full regard 
          to these considerations”. (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     209    It is with this fundamental respect for the role entrusted by the criminal justice system to the jury, to find the facts according to the evidence, that this court should apply the test enunciated in M at 494 to 495, and in Jones, when it is required to determine whether guilty verdicts are unreasonable and incapable of being supported. That test necessarily requires close reference to the evidence, since it was said in M at 494 to 495: 
      
       
        
         
         “… where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displayed inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.” 
         
        
       
     210    In applying the decision in Jones it is not to be overlooked, as was made clear in the judgment at 455, that it was the combination of the credibility factor arising from the acquittal of the appellant on one count, “with the uncorroborated nature of the complaints,” and the effect of the lengthy and unexplained delay in the making of the complaints, that led to the conclusion that the convictions were “unsafe and unsatisfactory” (as the ground was conventionally described before the decision in Fleming v The Queen (1999) 197 CLR 250 and R v Giam (1999) NSWCCA 53). 
      
       
     211    These two additional factors, their Honours confirmed, made it “necessary” or “essential” for the jury to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence in the case with “considerable” or “great care”. Additionally, there was the circumstance, to which considerable importance had been attached in Longman v The Queen (1987) 168 CLR 79, and Crampton v The Queen (2000) 75 ALJR 133, concerning the considerable difficulty which the defence may face in dealing with allegations made of events occurring many years in the past. 
      
       
     212    So understood, I do not regard Jones as an authority for the presumption previously mentioned. It does not deny to a jury the right to accept the evidence of a complainant in relation to one event, and to maintain a reasonable doubt about another event described by that witness. It leaves unimpaired the traditional instruction given to juries that they are not obliged to wholly accept or to wholly reject what a witness says, but are free to accept part and to reject part of his or her account - an instruction accepted as perfectly appropriate, if not one that should be given, in KBT v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 417 at 424, and in KRM v The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR 550, where McHugh J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[36] It has become the standard practice in cases where there are multiple counts, however, for the judge to direct the jury that they must consider each count separately and to consider it only by reference to the evidence that applies to it. … The universal giving of a separate consideration warning and the omission of a universal propensity warning indicates that the giving of a separate consideration warning is ordinarily sufficient to avoid miscarriages of justice in cases such as the present. This indication is confirmed by the many cases where juries acquit accused persons of some charges and convict them of others where the presentment contains multiple counts involving the same or similar offences. Indeed, so freely do juries acquit of some charges and convict of others on presentments with multiple counts that appellate courts often hear arguments that there is such an inconsistency in the verdicts that the convictions are unsafe and must be set aside cf  
         Jones v The Queen 
          (1997) 191 CLR 439”. 
         
        
       
     213    That his Honour assessed the outcome, which is at the centre of this aspect of the appeal, as a frequent occurrence, an assessment with which I would agree, does of itself tend to indicate that something more than illogical reasoning lies behind the return of different verdicts. 
      
       
     214    The kind of direction mentioned, and the reasoning behind it, are matters of common sense which tend, if anything, in favour of an accused so far as they discourage tendency reasoning and invite specific focus on the evidence in relation to each count. Moreover, such a direction allows the jury to bring to their task matters such as the conviction, or apparent persuasiveness, with which complainants describe events of which they have a clear recollection, and the lesser certainty which they may display in relation to other events, of which their recollection may be less clear or where there may be a reasonable possibility of them being mistaken, for example as to dates or places.  
      
       
     215    This to my mind, reflects the practical, commonsense approach to fact finding which is expected of jurors, as well as the necessity, in some cases, for the prosecution to fit an alleged event within the territorial reach of the relevant statutory provision, or within a specific time frame (as may occur where there have been amendments to the Section defining the offence).  
      
       
     216    In each of these respects, legitimate questions may arise concerning the evidence of a complainant, or a central prosecution witness, which go to the reliability of their recollection or their full awareness of the facts, without in any way reflecting upon their veracity or honesty. Allowance for uncertainty, or imprecision, or lack of persuasiveness in relation to some acts alleged, particularly where the Crown overloads an indictment, does no more than reflect the important difference between reliability and credibility or honesty, a distinction also commonly drawn to the attention of juries. 
      
       
     217    In my view the decisions which have presumed the demonstration of a fatal blow to the credibility of the complainant, or central witness, where there are different verdicts in a multi-count indictment, have overlooked this distinction and drawn too much from Jones. More helpful is the conclusion expressed in MacKenzie at 368: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside.  
         It is impossible to state hard and fast rules. ‘It all depends upon the facts of the case’”. 
         
        
       
     218    To similar effect were the observations of McHugh J in Osland v The Queen (1998) 199 CLR 316: 
      
       
        
         
         “[120] When there is no legal or technical inconsistency in the verdicts, a conviction can only be set aside where the inconsistency in the verdicts demonstrates that no reasonable jury who had applied their minds to the evidence could have arrived at the two different verdicts. In such a case the Court of Criminal Appeal sets aside the conviction because it is unsafe or unsatisfactory. 
         
        
        
         
         [121] In determining whether the inconsistency points to an unsatisfactory conviction, the appellate court must consider the evidence, the issues, and the  
         directions 
          which the jury were given … An examination of the directions, issues and evidence may confirm that apparently inconsistent verdicts are in fact inconsistent and demonstrate that the conviction is unsafe. Just as frequently, however, examination of the issues, evidence and directions may show that apparently inconsistent verdicts are not inconsistent and that there has been no failure in the reasoning process of the jury”. 
         
        
       
     219    These passages, to my mind, underline the importance of not assuming too readily that a difference between the verdicts returned demonstrates inevitably a want of credibility in the complainant or central witness. I would add that it may well be that the use of the term “inconsistent verdicts,” to describe the situation where an accused has been convicted on some counts and acquitted on others, may itself be a misnomer, and part of the reason why too much has been read into Jones. In truth, a difference in verdicts may not involve any inconsistency at all, when the case is considered as a whole. 
      
       
     220    Indeed, this is implicit in the judgment of Hayne J, with whom McHugh and Gaudron JJ agreed in Farrell v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 286, a case where the accused was convicted of the several offences in respect of which he was charged as the principal offender, and acquitted of the one count in respect of which he was charged as an aider and abetter. There being an absence of evidence of him offering encouragement to the person charged as the principal offender for that count, it was held that the different verdicts were “entirely consistent with the jury not reaching the requisite degree of satisfaction” concerning it. 
      
       
     221    In the context of a system of justice that requires proof of criminality beyond reasonable doubt, the occurrence of different verdicts is entirely to be expected and is understandable. As is often said of such a system, acquittal does not amount to a positive finding that the act alleged did not occur, or that the evidence of the complainant or central witness concerning it was rejected as a lie, or as lacking in credibility: R v Girgines VICCA 26 March 1996. 
      
       
     222    What it can involve is proof falling short of satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt of one or more of the elements of the offence charged. In the context of a case involving stringent warnings of the kind required by Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 and by R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12, or those customarily given where the prosecution case depends essentially upon an accomplice or prison informer, it is often well understandable that a jury would be hesitant to convict without necessarily finding that the complainant or central witness was altogether lacking in credibility. 
      
       
     223    The basis for the presumption which seems to have been drawn from Jones concerning the impact upon the credibility of the complainant where different verdicts have been returned, lies in three passages in the joint judgment of Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ. The first appears at page 453. 
      
       
        
         
         “The jury’s finding of not guilty on the second count damaged the credibility of the complainant with respect to all counts in the indictment. Implicit in the appellant’s acquittal on the second count was a rejection of the complainant’s account of the events which were said to give rise to that count.”  
         
        
        
       Their Honour’s later said (also at 453): 
        
        
         
         “It is difficult then to see how it was open to the jury to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant with respect to the first and third counts. There is nothing in the complainant’s evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gives any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to those counts than it was in relation to the second count.” 
         
        
        
       In the final passage, at 455, their Honours concluded: 
        
        
         
         “In our opinion, the proper application of the test formulated by the majority of this court in  
         M 
          required the convictions of the appellant to be set aside on the basis that they were unsafe and unsatisfactory. Given the jury’s findings on the second count, it was not open to them, on the whole of the evidence, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant on the first and third counts. Once the jury found that the evidence of the complainant with respect to the second count lacked sufficient cogency to convict, the Crown cases on the first and third counts wore a different complexion. For it meant that, when her evidence could be set against other reliable evidence, it failed to carry sufficient conviction to reach the criminal standard of proof. 
         
        
        
         
         As we have already said, nothing in the complainant’s evidence gave any ground for thinking that the quality of her evidence was higher in respect of the first and third count than it was in respect to the second count.” 
         
        
       
     224    Properly understood, I do not understand their Honours to have been enunciating any general principle for the guidance of appellate courts when dealing with a similar ground of appeal. Rather, the practical significance of the different outcomes was considered, in the context of the particular facts of the case (“the surrounding circumstances”) together with the other problems affecting the prosecution evidence, to have led to convictions that could not be supported. 
      
       
     225    Although Kirby J was in the minority, in my respectful opinion, his Honour was correct when he rejected the existence of any general proposition, or presumption, of the kind which seems to have led to the line of decisions which are under question in this appeal. At 470, his Honour observed in this respect: 
      
       
        
         
         “Any other hypothesis would require a conclusion that, in all cases of this kind, complainants must be wholly believed or wholly disbelieved. That would put at naught the need for separate verdicts on the separate counts of the indictment and the principle of particularity in the proof of separate offences charged upon such separate counts. That principle necessarily posits the possibility (at least in the way this trial was conducted) that different verdicts may be returned on different counts as occurred here. It would also overlook the  
         practical way 
          in which juries often approach different charges expressed in different counts of an indictment. (83)” 
         
        
       
     226    I am reinforced in this view by the reasons of Winneke P in The Queen v KET (1998) VSCA 73 where his Honour observed: 
      
       
        
         
         “[28]…  
         Jones’s 
          case, in my view, is a case which has to be looked at in the light of its own particular facts, as indeed all cases where this issue raised must be. In  
         Jones’s 
          case three discrete acts of sexual penetration were alleged and the jury convicted the accused on two and acquitted on one, in circumstances where the acquittal, as the judgments made clear, must necessarily on the facts of that case have reflected upon the credibility of the complainant’s evidence on the other two counts. Furthermore, it would seem from the judgments in Jones’ case that special emphasis was laid on the prejudice flowing to the accused from the delay in complaint because it was apparent from the special facts of the case that there was a real risk that the delay had deprived the accused of what the majority judges had called ‘ a cast iron alibi’. 
         
        
        
         
         [29] However, in my view, it would be wrong to draw from the decision of  
         Jones 
         ’ case the general proposition that, in cases where multiple sexual offences are alleged involving the one complainant, the jury’s acquittal on some of those counts should compel an appellate court to conclude that the jury must necessarily have regarded the complainant generally as an untruthful witness or that her credibility was impacted upon in respect of the counts upon which they had convicted.” 
         
        
       
     227    This conclusion also permits proper respect be given to the right of a jury to return what has perhaps been unfortunately referred to as a “merciful verdict”, when faced with an indictment containing a large number of counts. The expression involves something of a misnomer, since a conviction, upon any count in a criminal trial, cannot properly be regarded as “merciful”. However, it is understandable, and in accordance with experience, that a jury faced with a number of counts involving similar conduct, can be permitted without disobedience to their oath, to take a “merciful view” of the facts upon one count. 
      
       
     228    Similarly, they may be well justified in coming to the conclusion that enough is enough, and to return verdicts of guilty in relation to the strongest of what may be regarded as representative charges selected by the Crown, out of the much broader and longer history of sexual abuse, that is often seen in cases of sexual assault within a family or within an educational, sporting, recreational or religious environment. It cannot be overlooked that a jury drawn from the community will have an awareness of this, and of the regrettable reality of paedophiliac behaviour. 
      
       
     229    Support for such an approach has been recognised in the oft cited judgment of King CJ in R v Kirkman (1987) 44 SASR 591 at 593: 
      
       
        
         
         “Sometimes juries apply in favour of an accused what might be described as their innate sense of fairness and justice in place of the strict principles of law. Sometimes it appears to a jury that although a number of counts have been alleged against an accused person, and have been technically proved, justice is sufficiently met by convicting him of less than the full number. This may not be logically justifiable in the eyes of a judge, but I think it would be idle to close our eyes to the fact that it is part and parcel of the system of administration of justice by juries. Appellate courts therefore should not be too ready to jump to the conclusion that because a verdict of guilty cannot be reconciled as a matter of strict logic with a verdict of not guilty with respect to another count, the jury acted unreasonably in arriving at the verdict of guilty.” 
         
        
        
       
     230    That passage was cited with approval in the joint judgment in MacKenzie at 367-368 and the freedom or entitlement of a jury to return a merciful verdict was noted in Crisologo NSWCCA 12 December 1997. An example, in which this Court assumed that the jury had taken the practical step of regarding a conviction on portion of the indictment, as sufficiently reflective of the culpability of the accused, can be seen in Kiskarpati NSWCCA 4 November 1998. Other examples confirming that the option of returning a “merciful verdict” is open, and is often exercised, can be seen in R v Hunt (1968) 2 QB 433 and R v Johnstone (2000) QCA 234. 
      
       
     231    The view which I favour also preserves for the jury the advantage which it has over a Court of Appeal in having seen and heard the witnesses, including the subtle conclusions which can be drawn from hesitation and other marks of indecision which may flag that, for some counts, the evidence of the complainant was less certain or reliable than for others. As I have already observed, there is an important difference between reliability and credibility which has been recognised, for example, in decisions such as : R v Robinson (2000) 111 A Crim R 388 and ARD (2000) NSWCCA 443. 
      
       
     232    In the light of the foregoing, I move forward to the conclusion which Dunford J, reached in RAT, concerning the principle which his Honour considered should be derived from Jones.  
      
       
        
         
         “[46] If I am correct in my understanding of the effect of  
         Jones 
          then I believe consideration needs to be given to the directions regularly given to juries in such trials. Juries are constantly told that they should consider each count in the indictment separately and also that they may accept part of a witness’ evidence and not accept other parts of the evidence of that same witness. But  
         Jones 
          appears to establish a qualification to these directions to the effect that in sexual cases, where the only direct evidence of the commission of the offences is that of the complainant, if they are for any reason not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant is telling the truth in relation to one count, it is  
         not open 
          to them to be satisfied to the criminal standard that she (or he) is telling the truth in relation to any other count; and therefore in such cases (that is, where there is no independent evidence of the commission of the offences) if they find an accused not guilty on one count, they  
         must 
          also find him not guilty on all counts. They should also be warned specifically that if they return different verdicts where there are no distinguishing features in the evidence such verdicts are liable to be regarded as a compromise and the guilty verdicts set aside.” ( 
         emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     233    For the reasons already stated, I consider this approach to be incorrect so far as it would elevate the conclusion in Jones either to a principle of law, or to a rebuttable presumption. Rather, I am of the view that the fact of differing verdicts is but one aspect of the review which an appellate court must conduct, and that it should take its place alongside all the other circumstances of the case. 
      
       
     234    There may well be cases where the fact of acquittal on one or more counts will support an argument that the jury looked with real disfavour upon the credibility of the complainant or central witness. This may arise, for example, where: 
      
       
        
       a) verdicts of not guilty were returned on a preponderance of the counts in an indictment; 
        
        
       b) there was positive evidence in the defence case to establish that the version of events offered by the complainant or central witness was fabricated in relation to the counts upon which the accused was acquitted,  
        
        
       c) where the evidence offered by the prosecution, in relation to the counts on which the accused was acquitted, appears to be fanciful or inherently improbable  
       (R v W 
        (1999) 109 A Crim R 51 provides a possible example); or 
        
        
       d) where the complainant or central witness has given versions, in relation to the count or counts upon which the accused was acquitted, which were significantly inconsistent. 
        
       
     235    In many cases, conversely, it will be possible to identify a possible basis for a differentiation between verdicts, for example where: 
      
       
        
       a) the complainant or the central witness has conceded the possibility of faulty recollection, in relation to the details of the event the subject of the charge on which the accused was acquitted; 
        
        
       b) there was a lack of particularity as to time or place in relation to such charge, and where fixing the event at a particular time or place is either of the essence or of central importance (  
       R v AT 
        (2000) NSWCCA 342 provides an example of a case where, (but for other circumstances concerning another count), the existence of uncertainty as to time would have provided an acceptable explanation; and see  
       R v J 
        (No.2) (1998) 3 VR 602); 
        
        
       c) the accused has called positive evidence in relation to the charge or charges on which he was acquitted but not in relation to the others; 
        
        
       d) there was corroboration in relation to the charge on which the accused was convicted, but not in relation to the others; 
        
        
       e) it is fair to assume that, in relation to a count or counts in respect of which the accused was acquitted, there was room to suppose that the complainant or central witness resorted to a degree of exaggeration in order to reinforce his or her account; 
        
        
       f) the acquittals were returned in relation to less serious events, particularly when they were not mentioned in the original complaint ( 
       R v JJT 
        NSW CCA 3 December 1997, provides an example of such a case) 
        
        
       g) the history of wrongdoing is lengthy and involves very many incidents over a period of time, or conversely involves a large number of events within a very short time frame such that a faulty recollection as to one or other of them, or some telescoping of them, may be entirely understandable (see  
       R v J 
        (1994) 75 A Crim R 523 at 539/540); or where 
        
        
       h) the jury were entitled to conclude, in relation to the event in respect of which the accused was acquitted, that the complainant misunderstood or misinterpreted what it was that had occurred ( 
       R v ACK 
        (2000) NSW CCA 180 provides an example of such a case). 
        
       
     236    By this selection of examples, I am not to be taken as suggesting that there must inevitably be a search for an explanation for a difference in verdicts. Rather, my purpose is to underline the need for careful consideration to be given to the process which jury deliberations may properly take, as well as the need for setting that in the full context of the circumstances of the trial, including the terms, and the firmness with which Longman, Murray and other directions are given, and the ‘staleness’ or otherwise of the complaints. What is important in this regard is to give full attention to those matters that go to an assessment of credibility, and to recognise that not all of them operate to the same degree. 
      
       
     237    I am not, accordingly, persuaded that it is necessarily helpful, or indeed essential, to narrow the search for an actual or possible logical basis for distinction. There will be cases where, once the entirety of the case is reviewed, the appellate Court will maintain a comfortable satisfaction as to the verdicts of guilty in relation to the relevant counts, upon the basis of the evidence separately considered concerning them.  
      
       
     238    Ultimately, the question remains one of fact and degree as to whether the difference in verdicts is such that, as a matter of logic and reasonableness, bringing to account all of the factors which I have mentioned, including the practical approach which juries are entitled to bring to their task, the conviction should be regarded as unreasonable or incapable of being supported upon the evidence. 
      
       
     239    In the present case I am of the view, having regard to the various considerations identified by Spigelman CJ in his judgment that there is an acceptable explanation for the differentiation between the divergent verdicts returned in this case. It is not one where there was such an integral connection between the counts, or where there were other circumstances present, such as to compel the conclusion that the complainant’s overall credibility was so diminished that the guilty verdicts should, for that reason, be overturned. 
      
       
     240    I would dismiss this ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       Credibility directions 
        
       
     241    The first matter that arises, in this respect, concerns the failure of his Honour to give a direction in accordance with the decision in Crofts v The Queen (1996) CLR 427, by way of a counterbalance to that given in accordance with S 107 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
      
       
     242    It was entirely appropriate that his Honour inform the jury, in accordance with this Section, that the absence of a complaint or a delay in making a complaint, do not necessarily indicate that the allegation was false, and that there may be good reasons why a complainant may delay making a complaint, or remain silent about it. 
      
       
     243    However, it has become customary since Crofts for that direction to be accompanied by a reminder that the inconsistency of conduct, which the High Court assumes to be implicit from the absence of, or a delay in, the making of a complaint by a person who had been sexually assaulted, can adversely affect the complainant’s credibility. Current authority favours the view that such a direction should be given as a general rule: Kilby v the Queen (1973) 129 CLR 460 at 465; R v Davies (1985) 3 NSWLR 276 at 278, R v Omarjee (1995) 79 A Crim R 355 and Miletic SC VIC CA 9 August 1996. 
      
       
     244    So far as these decisions assume that, as a matter of ordinary human experience, victims of sexual assault will complain promptly of the assault, then I express my reservation as to the correctness of such a proposition, both generally and specifically in relation to children. While in relation to other forms of criminality it might be expected that a prompt complaint will be made by a victim, I am by no means persuaded that the same expectation exists in relation to sexual assault. Both trial experience and an understanding of the dynamics of sexual invasion, an event that involves multiple and complex emotions of shame, guilt, embarrassment, conflicting loyalties, inexperience, fear and threat lead me to suspect that this assumption is flawed. I also express my reservation as to whether judicial insight into such a matter has any advantage over the experience of lay persons, drawn from the community, sufficient to justify a mandatory direction of the kind sought. 
      
       
     245    Nevertheless, I respect as authoritative the current line of decision both in the High Court, and at appellate level in this State and elsewhere, in respect of this matter. Their effect is to interpret the legislation in a way which would not sterilise complainants from critical comment concerning the impact of delay or silence, so far as their credibility is concerned. In substance, they call for a balancing direction to be given where the particular facts of the case justify that course. 
      
       
     246    The reservations I have, as to the assumption which underlie the balancing direction, do however underline the importance of the qualifications suggested in Crofts: 
      
       
        
         
         “Two qualifications to the duty to provide the warning suggested by  
         Kilby 
          may be accepted. The first is where the peculiar facts of the case and the conduct of the trial do not suggest the need for a warning to restore a balance of fairness. The second is that the warning should not be expressed in such terms as to undermine the purpose of the amending Act by suggesting a stereotyped view that complainants in sexual assault cases are unreliable or that delay in making a complaint about an alleged sexual offence is invariably a sign that the complainant’s evidence is false. So long as the purpose of the legislation, to rid the law of such stereotypes, is kept in mind, and the terms in which the legislation is expressed are followed, judges striving to assist juries in their consideration of the facts are unlikely to fall into the kind of error that occurred in this case.” 
         
        
       
     247    In this regard, it is not to be overlooked that, in Crofts, there was a serious misdirection so far as the trial Judge had assumed that a Kilby direction was no longer permissible, and so far as the jury was directed “as a matter of law” that the lack of complaint about the offences immediately after they happened, would not permit of an inference that the complainant was lying about them. That clearly went too far, and denied to the jury an opportunity of bringing their common sense and experience of life to the case, so far as it concerned this aspect of their evaluation of the evidence. 
      
       
     248    Understood in this way, and approaching a summing up by reference to whether, in its full context, and in the particular circumstances of the trial, it would be unbalanced for there to be no reference to silence or delay in relation to credibility, my concerns are to a degree alleviated. 
      
       
     249    The present is a case where a strong Longman warning was given, along with a clear warning concerning consistency or inconsistency of account. It is also one where it may be assumed, both from the terms in which the statutory direction was given, (in particular so far as it was expressed in terms that this “does not necessarily indicate”, and “there may be good reasons”, and from the jury questions concerning the reason for the late complaint, and also concerning the dates of the complainant’s statements, that they were well alive to the possibility that inaction, particularly for the lengthy period involved, could reflect upon the complainant’s credibility.  
      
       
     250    Similarly to Spigelman CJ, I would not be minded to allow the appeal on this ground were it to stand alone. However, when taken in conjunction with the second matter to which objection has been taken, I have, with some reservations, come to the conclusion that the jury were insufficiently assisted in relation to the complainant’s credibility. 
      
       
     251    This second aspect of the appellant’s submission concerns the observation by his Honour: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is up to you how you deal with the evidence and how you find your verdicts, but you may consider that it would be very difficult to find him guilty on one and not guilty on others. You either might accept the complainant as a truthful, accurate, credible witness or you do not. It is difficult to see how.” 
         
        
       
     252    Although the final sentence of this paragraph appears to have been cut short, the message conveyed is clear enough, namely that the jury might have a difficulty in coming to a different conclusion between the various counts charged. It was, however, a direction that watered down the requirement for the jury to consider each count separately by reference to the evidence relating to it. 
      
       
     253    Moreover, although it seems not to have had that result, (since differing verdicts were returned), it potentially risked inviting an all or nothing approach. It also potentially invited a form of tendency reasoning, whereby the jury would consider it appropriate to transfer acceptance of guilt on one count for which there was convincing evidence, to a finding of guilt upon the other counts where the evidence was not so clear, or where a residual doubt may have arisen. 
      
       
     254    Of more immediate relevance, however, is the submission that the directions were inadequate in not including the instruction propounded by Dunford J in RAT, noted earlier. So far as that submission depends upon the need for a direction in the precise terms proposed by his Honour, I would reject it, since for the reasons earlier given, I am of the opinion that it overstates the law, and that Jones does not constitute authority for it. 
      
       
     255    Although not fatal to the direction, as Spigelman CJ noted in ARD 2000 NSWCCA 443 (at para 3), Barwick CJ and Owen and Walsh JJ made reference, in Lucas v The Queen (1970) 120 CLR 171, to the general undesirability of complicating a summing up by reference to extraneous considerations, such as the consequence of a particular verdict, unless legislation so requires (as it now does in cases involving special hearings for those found unfit to be tried, and in cases where an issue of mental illness arises - Mental Health (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1990 sections 21 and 37) The point at issue for this appeal concerns not this point, but rather, whether the RAT direction, or some variation of it, should have been given by the trial judge. 
      
       
     256    Caution needs to be exercised in giving any direction of that kind, lest the jury see it as an encouragement to a process of reasoning in the obverse way previously mentioned. For them to assume that a tendency or propensity to similar behaviour has been established by proof of some counts, which might then make it more likely that the accused offended similarly in relation to the remaining counts, would involve a prohibited line of reasoning. 
      
       
     257    On the other hand, there is merit, as a matter of common sense, in reminding the jury that the existence of a question mark in their minds concerning the credibility, or reliability of the evidence given by a complainant or central witness in relation to one count, may properly be taken into account, in conjunction with all the other circumstances of the case, when they consider the reliability or credibility of the evidence of that complainant or witness in relation to the other counts. 
      
       
     258    An additional consideration arises so far as the giving of a direction of this kind may alleviate the concern which might otherwise subsequently arise, where differing verdicts are returned in relation to a multi count indictment. In such a case, the Court may feel greater confidence than the jury has focussed closely upon the issues of reliability and credibility of the evidence going to each charge, and has found good cause for differentiating between the individual counts. 
      
       
     259    In Robinson (2000) 111 A Crim R 388, Fitzgerald JA said in relation to such a direction, (at para 9): 
      
       
        
         
         “The circumstances might be such that the jury should also be instructed that if they hold a reasonable doubt concerning the reliability of a complainant’s evidence on one or more counts, whether by reference to the complainant’s demeanour or for any other reason, they  
         must 
          take that into account in assessing the reliability of his or her evidence in relation to other counts.” 
         
        
       
     260    I have two reservations in relation to this direction: first, that it appears to be dependent upon the jury having a reasonable doubt concerning the reliability of the complainant’s evidence, on any one or more of the counts; and secondly, that if given, it is to be phrased in mandatory terms. 
      
       
     261    I see no reason to confine the direction to reliability. It is equally, if not more, applicable in relation to credibility or truthfulness. Moreover, I see no reason to do more than bring to the attention of the jury the circumstance that, depending upon the nature of, and the degree of, any question which arises in relation to the evidence going to the count in respect of which they have a reasonable doubt, it is both permissible and proper for them to take that into account when considering the evidence of the complainant or central witness upon the remaining counts. 
      
       
     262    This should, however, be kept in context, in that the jury should be reminded that it is but one of the circumstances that they can properly take into account, when evaluating the overall credibility and reliability of the complainant, as it impacts upon the remaining counts, including any other fact or circumstance which may provide an explanation for any question which may arise. It is, in my view, inappropriate for any direction, or comment, in this regard to become elevated, by reason of the mandatory terms in which it is expressed, to a principle of law or to operate as a straight jacket for the jury. 
      
       
     263    In some cases, where it is obvious that the witness’s reliability or credibility has been seriously undermined, in relation to one count, a strong comment may be appropriate. In other cases, it may be appropriate to indicate to the jury that they may have a difficulty in accepting the witness’s evidence on some counts, or on particular counts, if they have a reasonable doubt about his or her reliability in relation to the other counts. In other cases a more neutral reminder of the entitlement of the jury to take such matter into account may suffice. In yet other cases, it may not be necessary to say anything. 
      
       
     264    In this regard, I similarly share the concern expressed by McHugh J in KRM v The Queen (2000) 75 ALJR 550, and by Spigelman CJ in this appeal, as to the danger of adding ever more directions and warnings to the repertoire of a trial Judge. It is not to be forgotten that the purpose of a summing up is not to deliver an impeccable and exhaustive lecture on the law, or even upon all matters that might conceivably impact on the fact finding process. Nor is it to state the obvious. Rather, it is to explain the relevant law in the light of the issues which arise, and to give the jury such assistance as they need in determining those issues upon the facts relevant to them. 
      
       
     265    Where it is necessary that a direction of the kind discussed be given to ensure a balance of fairness, then it should be phrased in terms that meet the needs of the case, and with the reminder that the assessment of reliability and credibility remains entirely a matter for the jury. Whatever is said, however, it is critical to ensure that it is not so worded as to encourage or invite the obverse form of reasoning which derives from tendency or propensity. 
      
       
     266    In my view, the somewhat brief direction given in this case insufficiently brought these matters to attention. Once his Honour opened up this subject, it was necessary for him to give a sufficient direction drawing to attention the considerations mentioned. 
      
       
     267    When taken in conjunction with the absence of a Crofts direction, I have reached the conclusion, although not without some hesitation, that the appellant lost the opportunity for a fair trial 
      
       
     268    I would accordingly allow the appeal, and order a new trial. 
      
       
        
       
     269    GROVE J :  I have had the advantage of reading the draft judgments of Spigelman CJ and Simpson J and I gratefully adopt their respective expositions of the facts and background material relevant to the appeal. By reference to that material I can express my own views with relative brevity. Since the preparation hereof, I have also read the judgment of Wood CJ at CL. 
      
       
     270    The grounds of appeal relied upon by the appellant were as follows: 
      
       
        
       (1) The verdicts of guilty in relation to counts 1 to 5 are unreasonable and cannot be supported in light of the verdict of not guilty in relation to ground 6. 
        
        
       (2) The trial miscarried due to the failure of the learned trial judge to direct the jury that the delay in complaint, or failure of the complainant to make a complaint was a matter to be taken into account in its assessment of the credibility of the complainant. 
        
        
       (3) The trial miscarried as a result of the failure of the learned trial judge to direct the jury, once a question on the subject was asked in the course of its deliberation, that it was not for the appellant to establish a motive in the complainant to lie or that a failure to establish a ‘reason for coming forward and report the evidence that occurred some twenty years ago’ assisted or 
         
       supported the case against the appellant and that such a reasoning process was erroneous and inverted or reversed the onus of proof 
       . 
        
       
     271    I agree with the reasons of Spigelman CJ for rejecting ground 1 and in particular with his qualifications upon the authority of cases such as R v RAT (2000) 111 A Crim R 360, R v Barnett [2000] NSWCCA 283, R v Carbone [2000] NSWCCA 387, R v Dixon [2001] NSWCCA 39 and R v S [2001] NSWCCA 204 in their purported applications of Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439. I would add my concurrence to that of Wood CJ at CL with Spigelman CJ concerning that case and express my agreement with observations which he has made. 
      
       
     272    In relation to grounds 2 and 3 the draft judgments which I have mentioned recite extracts of directions given by the learned trial judge and I will not set them out again.  
      
       
     273    The question by the jury and the presiding judge’s response which are the subjects of ground 3 are set out in the judgment of Spigelman CJ at pars 167 and 168. I am unpersuaded of either proposition advanced on behalf of the appellant that the jury’s question implied that inquiry was being directed to motive of the complainant to lie or that his Honour’s response invited reversal of the onus of proof. I would reject this ground. 
      
       
     274    Ground 2 directly complains of the absence of a “balancing” direction in favour of the appellant to the effect that delay in complaint may be taken into account in assessment of the complainant’s credibility when giving a direction pursuant to s107 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 drawing attention to the possibility of reasons for such delay: Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427. The firstmentioned direction has been said to be required as a general rule: Kilby v The Queen (1973) 129 CLR 465. In this trial the learned trial judge adverted to reasons testified to by the complainant but did not in express language associate delay in complaining and credibility. 
      
       
     275    The warnings which he gave to the jury accorded with the requirements Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79. Whilst I respect the views expressed by Simpson J concerning Crampton v The Queen 2000 75 ALJR 133 I do not share her conclusion that his Honour’s warnings were inadequate in drawing attention to the impact of delay upon the appellant’s ability to respond to matters of fact. No complaint was made at trial (which preceded delivery of judgment in Crampton) and although detached from the atmosphere of the trial it is compelling to infer that the factual contest including the effects of lapse of time upon the abilities of all concerned to engage in it must have been obvious to the jury.  
      
       
     276    The issue is whether ground 2 must be sustained. In R v Davies & Ors 1985 3 NSWLR 276 it was affirmed (applying Kilby) that a failure to make timely complaint should be the subject of a direction that such circumstance was relevant to the assessment of a complainant’s credit. However it was concluded in that case that the jury could not have been under any misapprehension as to the relevance to credit of the issue of complaint and leave to rely upon a ground similar to the one under consideration was refused. The requirement for direction articulated in Davies was approved in Crofts but no criticism was made of the course adopted to dispose of the appeal adversely to the appellant. I consider that the present circumstances and the content of directions in essence parallel those in Davies and I would reject ground 2. 
      
       
     277    Spigelman CJ has raised the question of a particular direction in relation to multiple counts such as suggested by Fitzgerald JA in R v Robinson (2000) 111 A Crim R 388: 
      
       
        
         
         “The circumstances might be such that the jury should also be instructed that if they hold a reasonable doubt concerning the reliability of a complainant’s evidence on one or more counts, whether by reference to the complainant, or for any other reason they must take that into account in assessing the reliability of his or her evidence in relation to other counts.” 
         
        
       
     278    The Chief Justice made explicit his “considerable reluctance to add to the number of directions and warnings which trial judges are already required to give” and his consciousness of the adjuration of McHugh J in KRM v The Queen (2000) 25 ALJR 550: 
      
       
        
         
         “The more directions and warnings juries are given the more likely it is that they will forget or misinterpret some directions or warnings”.",2001-07-31 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

      Judgment 
      
      
       
       SIMPSON J :  
        
       
     1    In these proceedings the applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon her in the District Court on 27 July 2000 following her plea of guilty to a charge of supplying a prohibited drug (heroin) contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (”the Act”). By reason of the quantity of the drug involved the applicant was liable to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for fifteen years and/or a fine of two thousand penalty units ($220,000). She was sentenced to imprisonment for five years with a non-parole period of two and a half years. The sentencing judge ordered that the sentence commence on 1 October 1999, the date of the offence, and the date the applicant was arrested. 
      
       
        
       The Facts 
        
       
     2    At about 10.40 pm on 1 October 1999 the applicant was a passenger in a motor vehicle being driven in Northmead by her brother, Edward Van Oostveen. Because of the manner in which the vehicle was being driven, police stopped the car. Initially they told the applicant’s brother that he had been stopped for a random breath test. This was plainly inaccurate. However, police did administer a roadside breath test which returned a negative result. Police observed that the driver’s eyes were red and made some radio enquiries, as a result of which they searched the vehicle. While police officers searched the driver of the vehicle, others searched inside the vehicle. They located a brown wallet on the dashboard in front of the passenger seat where the applicant had been sitting. Nearby was a small black toiletry bag which, when opened, was discovered to contain a number of unused syringes, wipes, and a small wad of fifty dollar notes. Female police officers then searched the applicant and found a plastic bag concealed in her underwear. When asked what it contained the applicant gave a false reply. She attempted to prevent police officers taking possession of the plastic bag. Further search of the applicant revealed a pink plastic capsule also concealed in her underwear which the applicant said was a plastic toy. Contained in the capsule was a plastic bag and white powder. Subsequent examination showed that the applicant was in possession of a total of 74.9 grams of a substance which contained heroin. The average purity was just under 40 percent. The money amounted to about $500. 
      
       
     3    The applicant declined to participate in an interview with police and maintained a plea of not guilty until the date fixed for trial, 8 June 2000. On that day she entered a plea of guilty.  
      
       
     4    The statutory provision under which the applicant was charged was s25(1) of the Act. That subsection relevantly provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “A person who supplies … a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.” 
         
        
       
     5    “Supply” is defined in s 3 of the Act as, inter alia: 
      
       
        
         
         “Having in possession for supply, or … receiving for supply …” 
         
        
       
     6    By s 29 of the Act a person who is in possession of an amount of a prohibited drug not less than the trafficable quantity is, for relevant purposes, deemed to have possession of the drug for supply unless that person proves that he or she has the drug in possession “otherwise than for supply”.  
      
       
     7    A trafficable quantity of heroin is, by s 3(1) and Schedule 1 of the Act, three grams. The quantity in the applicant’s possession was therefore, even if reduced to its pure form, significantly more than a trafficable quantity - indeed, in its pure form, very nearly ten times a trafficable quantity.  
      
       
     8    By operation of the combined statutory provisions, therefore, the applicant was deemed to have had the drug in her possession for the purpose of supply unless she proved (on the balance of probabilities) that she had it in her possession otherwise than for supply. 
      
       
     9    It was, apparently, the applicant’s intention, up to the date fixed for trial, to attempt to defend her possession on that basis: that is, she proposed to attempt to prove that she had the drug in her possession for her personal use and not otherwise. By her plea of guilty she abandoned this attempt and acknowledged that her possession was for the purpose of supply. It does not, however, necessarily follow that the entire quantity was in her possession for that purpose. The extent to which she intended to supply the drug to others, and the extent (if any) to which she intended it for her own use, was a matter of fact for determination by the sentencing judge. If raised by the applicant as an issue, it was a matter relevant to the objective gravity of the offence. Possession of drugs for the purpose of supply to others is a more heinous offence than possession for personal use, as the legislation makes clear. 
      
       
     10    The applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. She maintained that the principal purpose for her possession of the drug was her own personal use but acknowledged that, if requested to do so, she would have given some to her brother who was, like the applicant, a heroin addict; and that, if called upon to do so, she would in all probability have given or sold some to friends who had previously assisted her. She claimed that it was in recognition of this circumstance that she abandoned her attempt to defend the charge. It will be necessary to look more closely at the evidence given by the applicant in this regard. 
      
       
        
       Subjective Circumstance 
        
       
     11    It is convenient now to deal with the subjective features that were put before the sentencing judge. Evidence was given in the form of a written statement and oral evidence, from the applicant’s brother-in-law, a Melbourne barrister; a psychiatric report dated 15 May 1996 prepared for other litigation; and the applicant’s own evidence. 
      
       
     12    The applicant was born on 11 November 1950. She was, therefore, about five weeks short of her forty-ninth birthday at the time of the offence. She has been a heroin addict, on her own evidence, since “sometime during the 1970’s”. The applicant’s criminal record attests to her long period of drug addiction. Her earliest conviction was in 1973, for possession of drugs, for which she was sentenced to a suspended term of six month’s imprisonment. Thereafter her record is peppered with offences either involving drugs, or those which may reasonably be supposed to have been committed for the purpose of obtaining drugs.  
      
       
     13    In the late 1970’s, in an attempt to overcome her addiction, and having failed to do so without medical help, she became a patient of the now notorious Chelmsford Hospital where she underwent four courses of treatment commonly referred to as deep sleep treatment, and electroconvulsive therapy. Whilst she was in Chelmsford she suffered a physical injury which resulted in some disfigurement to her buttocks. This was of some significance to her as, before her heroin addiction, she had been a model. The psychiatric evidence suggested that, as a consequence, she had sustained some brain damage. Another consequence was that, many years later, the applicant successfully sued the medical practitioners who administered the treatment, and was awarded $275,000 in damages. 
      
       
     14    The applicant is the mother of three daughters, one of whom is an adult. The younger daughters were aged eleven and ten at the time of sentencing, and had, until her arrest, been in the applicant’s custody. They were living on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. Their father was also a heroin addict. She has since ceased her relationship with him. Her brother-in-law attested to the strength of the relationship between the applicant and her daughters and spoke favourably of the applicant’s parenting capacity. 
      
       
     15    After her arrest the applicant was granted bail on terms that included provision of a cash surety in the amount of $50,000. Her brother-in-law was prepared to provide this security but, after discussion with him, the applicant decided to remain in prison in order to overcome her addiction. She had therefore been in custody from the date of arrest to the date of sentence.  
      
       
        
       The Grounds of the Application 
        
       
     16    The principal grounds on which the application is based are that the sentence in itself is manifestly excessive, and that, in arriving at the sentence he imposed, the sentencing judge made findings of fact which were not open to him. The Crown concedes that the sentence is, having regard to the quantity of the drug involved, at the top of the available range, but does not concede that it is outside that range. The concession is, however, significant, because, if the applicant can succeed in establishing that the sentencing judge proceeded on the basis of factual findings which were not open to him, it will be easier to discharge the onus of showing that a less severe sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed (Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 6(3)).  
      
       
     17    A significant part of the case advanced on behalf of the applicant at sentencing concerned her own drug addiction and the proposition that the principal purpose for which she was in possession of the heroin was her own use. 
      
       
     18    While accepting that the applicant was heroin addicted, the sentencing judge expressly rejected the latter contention. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I do not accept her evidence that she would have supplied her drug addicted brother with some of it if he had asked for it, or that she would have supplied other drug using friends who had been good to her if they had asked for it. I think she knows much more about the drug and how to use it than she has told me.” 
         
        
       
     19    Plainly enough, what his Honour intended to convey was a rejection of the applicant’s claim that her contemplated supply was limited in the way that she claimed. His Honour then referred to the concentration of heroin and said: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         It is obvious that the prisoner intended to cut the heroin that she had purchased with another substance, probably Glucodin, in order to produce street quantity heroin 
         , whether for her own use or the use of others. … Nor can I accept her explanation of supplying it by giving it to her brother if he’d asked for it or giving it to some of her friends who had been good to her if they had asked for it.  
         I do not doubt that she had purchased this quantity of admixture and possessed it, intending to cut it to street quantity in order to sell it 
         , partly I suspect to maintain her own addiction to it.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     20    This is one of the findings of fact, perhaps the principal finding of fact, that the applicant challenges. It is therefore necessary to return to the evidence given by the applicant on this subject. She said that she did not have in the car any means for weighing the heroin, nor any wrapping paper, but she had a container full of needles which were for her own use. She explicitly said that her intention in purchasing the heroin was to use it personally. She said that if her brother had asked for heroin she would have given him some, and she expected him to ask for it. She would not have expected any payment for it.  
      
       
     21    She explained her travelling from Queensland to Sydney for the purchase by saying that it was not always easy to obtain heroin in Queensland, that in Queensland she had purchased a substance said to be heroin that was not genuine, that she had heard stories of poisonous additives to heroin in Queensland, and that she did not want to get mixed up with the Queensland criminal element. 
      
       
     22    She said that she believed the heroin she was purchasing in Sydney was cheaper, was better quality, and was purchased without the stress of dealing with people in the streets and risking arrest. She said she believed that if she had her own supply of reasonably pure, good quality heroin without the stress of ensuring a supply, she could take her own time about withdrawing in her own way. 
      
       
     23    This evidence is such, in my opinion as to justify his Honour’s obvious and stated scepticism. Indeed, even without the advantage of observing the way in which the applicant gave her evidence, it is almost impossible, if not impossible, to believe. Had his Honour simply rejected that evidence, there could be no reasonable criticism of his findings of fact. The extent to which the heroin was purchased for supply would have largely been left in a vacuum. However, his Honour went beyond merely rejecting the applicant’s evidence and made a finding of fact (adverse to her), in effect, that she had purchased the heroin substantially for commercial purposes, and possibly for her own use in part.  
      
       
     24    A finding of fact of this nature in sentencing being in aggravation of the bare elements of the offence, may not be used unless it is made beyond reasonable doubt. In my opinion, notwithstanding the lack of credibility of the applicant’s evidence, it was not open to the sentencing judge to make, beyond reasonable doubt, the finding that the purchase was, substantially, if not entirely, for commercial purposes as he did. 
      
       
     25    Associated with this finding of fact was another concerning the applicant’s source of funds for the purchase. She said that she had paid $15,000 for the heroin. She said that this was money that she had withdrawn from a bank account in which she had had a balance of $35,000. She had invested some of the proceeds of her damages claim in the purchase of real estate costing about $100,000. Although it was not clearly stated, the effect of her evidence was that the sum of $15,000 was also part of the proceeds of her award of damages, and withdrawn from the bank account. 
      
       
     26    The sentencing judge also rejected her claim in this respect. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I cannot accept the prisoner’s explanation for accumulating the $15,000 that she paid for the drugs …” 
         
        
       
     27    He made no specific finding of any alternative source of the money. 
      
       
     28    Once again, his Honour’s scepticism may readily be understood. The applicant was in fact cross-examined about documentation evidencing her bank account. She said she had, through her solicitor, provided the Crown with a copy of her bank statement showing a balance of about $35,000. However, she was unable to point to any withdrawal of an individual sum of $15,000, and claimed to have withdrawn that sum in smaller amounts which she accumulated at home. She was, however, unable to point to any series of withdrawals amounting to $15,000. 
      
       
     29    It is a little difficult to see what flowed from the sentencing judge’s rejection to the applicant’s evidence of her accumulation of these funds. He made no express finding. One available interpretation of what he said was that the applicant had already embarked upon a course of dealing in the drug. However, he having made no express finding to that effect, I do not think that such a finding should be attributed to him. He simply rejected the applicant’s evidence, as, particularly in the light of the cross-examination, he was fully entitled to do.  
      
       
     30    A third ground on which the sentence is challenged concerns the value attributed by the judge to her plea of guilty. It was submitted that the judge made no allowance for the plea. That is not apparent. His Honour mentioned the plea and the circumstances in which it was entered. It is clear that he regarded the utilitarian value of the plea as very low. In this respect it is to be noted that the utilitarian value, as explained in R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] 49 NSWCCA; NSWLR 383, was at the very lower end of the scale. In Thomson and Houlton a range of sentence reduction by reason of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty was promulgated as between 10 and 25 percent. The two factors relevant to the utilitarian value of a plea are its timing, and the length and complexity of the trial which has been avoided by the plea. As noted above, the applicant’s plea was entered at the very last minute, on the date fixed for trial; and, in the circumstances, a trial would have been very short and without complexity. The only possible issue would have been the use for which the applicant was in possession of the drug. Accordingly, the most she could expect by way of reduction under this head was 10 percent. There is no reason to suppose that the judge did not allow a discount of something in that order for the utilitarian value of the plea. 
      
       
     31    Some further reduction in sentence, attributable to a plea of guilty, might be given where the plea is seen genuinely to represent contrition. The sentencing judge obviously did not see the applicant’s plea as having been entered by reason of contrition. He saw it as a recognition of the strength of the Crown case, and the inevitability of conviction. That finding was well open to him; he expressly found that contrition was absent. That finding, too, was open. 
      
       
     32    The result is that the applicant has succeeded in showing error in one respect only, but it is a matter of some significance. It is in the finding that the applicant purchased the heroin, substantially, for a commercial operation. Since that finding significantly aggravated the seriousness of the offence, it means that the sentence is vitiated, and must be quashed. The applicant must be re-sentenced. 
      
       
     33    In re-sentencing, I would adopt the sentencing judge’s finding that special circumstances exist justifying a non-parole period less than three quarters of the term of the sentence (s 44(2), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). In the sentence I propose, I have allowed approximately 10 percent by way of reduction from the total term for the plea of guilty. 
      
       
     34    I would make the following orders: 
      
       
        
       1. application for leave to appeal granted; 
        
       2. appeal allowed, sentence quashed; 
        
       3. in lieu thereof, the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for four years, with a non-parole period of two years to commence on 1 October 1999.

     JUDGMENT 
      
      
      
     1     
     HIS HONOUR: On 20 June 2001 there were before the Court two notices of motion which I dealt with in a judgment delivered on 2 July 2001. I treat what was said in that judgment as incorporated in the current remarks. Before proceeding however there are some matters of which, in fairness to Mr Harris in particular, there should be a recording.  
      
       
      
     2     
     The listing today followed a direction which I gave in the judgment of 2 July last. In the Sydney Morning Herald this morning, the matter was listed ""for directions"". Mr Harris claims that he understood from that listing that I would today simply give some further directions for a future hearing. I cannot accept that that misunderstanding was held.  
      
       
      
     3     
     A copy of the judgment of 2 July was despatched to Mr Harris. He has acknowledged that he has received it and, indeed, has made references to it during the course of his argument today. That judgment made it plain that what was to occur today was a consideration of the possible validity manifest in any pleading of a claim in defamation sought to be brought by the plaintiff. 
      
       
      
     4     
     Throughout the proceedings, Mr Harris has appeared for himself as the transcript of his argument will show.  
      
       
      
     5     
     The next matter that I should record is that there was a listing at 9.30 this morning and, very substantially, Mr Harris addressed me from then until 11.30. He resumed his address for about ten or fifteen minutes prior to midday when it was necessary for me to adjourn to attend other matters. The hearing was resumed at 2pm and I record that I placed a time limit upon Mr Harris, requiring him to finish his submissions by 2.30pm. As I say, I record these matters in order to make the situation clear and in Mr Harris' interests, should he wish to have the matter reviewed elsewhere.  
      
       
      
     6     
     The third matter, which I mention purely as a matter of record, relates to the s 218 notices under the  
     Income Tax Assessment Act 
      which were the subject of reference in the earlier judgment.  
      
       
      
     7     
     In the course of the day, it was mentioned by counsel appearing in the interests of the defendants (by which term I incorporate those presently sued and those whom it is desired to join pursuant to Mr Harris' notice of motion) that there were, in fact, no proceedings on foot challenging the validity of those notices.  
      
       
      
     8     
     Mr Harris points out that he has claimed, in these proceedings at least, that in some Federal Court proceedings or, perhaps, in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, he asserts that the notices were invalid, as I understand it, principally for the reason that they preceded the issue of the default assessments upon which they were based. It is not necessary for present purposes for me to make a judgment about this matter.  
      
       
      
     9     
     I should observe that there is, obviously, a dispute in the sense that Mr Harris and counsel for the defendant are at cross-purposes in response to my enquiry. What Mr Lancaster has said is that there is specifically no proceeding on foot seeking to challenge the notices.  
      
       
      
     10     
     What Mr Harris asserts is that in the course of challenges which he makes, he has protested about those notices and has suggested that they are invalid for the reason that I have mentioned and possibly for other reasons as well. As I have indicated, nothing turns upon this dispute in the present proceedings.  
      
       
      
     11     
     I turn to the matter which is strictly before the Court. The principal reason that I placed a time limit on Mr Harris is that, despite my repeated urgings, he rarely focused upon the issue that was to be addressed today.  
      
       
      
     12     
     I should recapitulate what occurred at the previous hearing. The first notice of motion brought by the plaintiff sought leave to join additional defendants. The notice of motion on behalf of the defendants, in the sense that I have used that word, sought, in effect, summary judgment. I am dealing with the matter expressly as a challenge to the sufficiency of pleadings but I recognise that an order striking out pleadings without leave to re-plead would have the same practical effect as summary judgment.  
      
       
      
     13     
     For that reason, I have today and on the previous occasion approached the matter with the restraints which are appropriate to applications for summary judgment.  
      
       
      
     14     
     I confirm that pursuant to the previous judgment, I came to the conclusion that what appeared to be actions for damages based upon negligence and breach of statutory duty were entirely untenable. I reserved until today so that the possibility, and I emphasise ""possibility"", that in some way Mr Harris might have a viable cause of action in defamation against either the defendants whom he had sued or, perhaps, one or other of them could be examined. 
      
       
      
     15     
     The reason why I did not deal with the matter on the last occasion was that within what purported to be his pleading were a series of unreferenced imputations which, if they had been conveyed by published material, were capable of being defamatory.  
      
       
      
     16     
     Accordingly, I gave directions that Mr Harris should, in draft form, present any pleading incorporating the claims which he made and serve this upon the Australian Government Solicitor. Such a document was prepared. It was, apparently, delivered quite recently but no point as to time has been taken.  
      
       
      
     17     
     The document entitled ""Form 5, Proposed Amended Statement of Claim"" has been produced in Court today by Mr Harris. I have signed it for identification and dated it today and it will remain with the papers. I have examined the document for the purpose which I indicated on the last occasion, that is to say, to see whether or not, as a matter of pleading, there is some indication that Mr Harris might have a viable cause of action against one or more of the defendants whom he has sued or whom he is seeking to sue. The document contains a considerable amount of irrelevancy.  
      
       
      
     18     
     Mr Harris has today spent a considerable amount of time addressing matters which are not relevant to the issue, as I have defined it. Nevertheless, I would take the view that I would not make orders effectively terminating these proceedings if I could perceive some realistic indication that an action of the nature he claims might exist.  
      
       
      
     19     
     The document itself, in substance, repeats the imputations which had appeared in the previous document. However, an attempt has also been made to identify what is described as the defamatory matter and its publication. This is to be found in the paragraph within the document numbered 40.  
      
       
      
     20     
     I might mention in passing that the reason that I raised the question of challenge to the s 218 notices is that each of the asserted publications makes reference to that section.  
      
       
      
     21     
     In summary, Mr Harris asserts that there was defamatory matter published of him on 21 February 1994 by the delivery of a notice under the section which I have mentioned to the Customs Staff Credit Union in Canberra and, on the same day, a similar notice to the Commonwealth Public Service Credit Union in Canberra.  
      
       
      
     22     
     At about the same time there was the delivery of a notice by facsimile transmission to a company with which the applicant, Mr Harris, apparently had a contract for work. There is also reference to the delivery to a mailbox of what is described as five or more s 218 notices together with some handwritten income tax assessments.  
      
       
      
     23     
     It is quite impossible to discern from the descriptions of the matter published how it could be that the claimed imputations could arise. Mr Harris has spent a considerable amount of time today making reference to what he asserts people would conclude as a result of learning about the issue of the notices.  
      
       
      
     24     
     I am not insensitive to the law relating to innuendo in relation to publication of alleged defamatory matter, however, nothing that Mr Harris has said gives any indication that that branch of the law or, indeed, the law of defamation generally, is likely to give him a cause of action of the nature which he now seeks.  
      
       
      
     25     
     Mr Harris has pointed out that in my earlier judgment I remarked that his previous pleading, insofar as it set out the imputations, had the problem that there were absences of identification of the matter complained of and particulars of publication: that is, by whom and to whom and when, as well as the basis upon which it is claimed that the defendants, or any of them, were responsible for the publication.  
      
       
      
     26     
     As things stand at the moment, the plaintiff Mr Harris is seeking to bring an action for defamation based upon the publication of statutorily authorised notices. As I mentioned in my earlier judgment, these notices have something of a quality analogous to a garnishee. In effect, they are notices addressed to a debtor asserting that the creditor is himself indebted to the issuer of the notice - in this case the Australian Taxation Office.  
      
       
      
     27     
     In precise terms, in this case they are notices to people or organisations who owe money to Mr Harris, in the sense of bank or credit union/customer relationship claiming that rather than discharge their debt to Mr Harris they should direct the money to the Australian Taxation Office, to which the notice specifies he is indebted. It is quite inconceivable that the regular discharge of that statutory function could give rise to a cause of action in defamation. Although it is not necessary for me to go through the imputations in detail, it is quite inconceivable that such a notice could convey the imputations relied upon by the plaintiff. It suffices for demonstration to refer to argument addressed by Mr Harris in response to my enquiry as to how the content of such a notice could impute that he was “most likely a leading criminal or involved in organised crime”. His response was to refer to a “notorious” fact that a well-known American criminal, Mr Al Capone, was finally imprisoned for taxation offences. Mr Al Capone has not been altogether without mention in some of the documentation tendered by the plaintiff.  
      
       
      
     28     
     Mr Harris has frequently and emphatically complained that he feels that he is not being given an opportunity to vent his grievances. He has, in various expressions, suggested that he will be the subject of a miscarriage of justice if he is not allowed to present his claims in the way that he wishes to present them. One of the many difficulties about that is that the formulation of his claims is in such terms as it would be quite unreasonable to require any defendant, or intended defendant, to have to respond to them.  
      
       
      
     29     
     On the previous occasion, I indicated that leave for the plaintiff to file an amended statement of claim against the defendant, or the proposed substituted defendants, asserting causes of action in negligence or breach of statutory duty was refused.  
      
       
      
     30     
     Further to that, I now make the following orders: 
      
       
       1. Leave for the plaintiff to file an amended statement of claim against the defendant, or the proposed substituted defendants, asserting a cause of action in defamation is refused. 
        
       2. I strike out the current pleading. 
        
       3. I expressly refuse leave to file the pleading in the form of the document signed by me and dated today.  
        
       4. Insofar as the notice of motion by the plaintiff seeking to vary the identity of the defendant is on the Court record, it is now without relevant point and that motion is dismissed.  
        
       5. I do not propose to make any order in relation to the costs before Master Malpass. If anything is required in relation to that, the parties should approach Master Malpass.  
        
       6. I order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs of the hearing before me on 20 June 2001 and the hearing before me today.

     No: 70014/2000 Regina v Michael Pello 
      
       
    Remarks on Sentence1     HIS HONOUR: The offender, Michael Pello, was indicted for the murder of a woman named Loida Smith at Marrickville on 19 May 1999. His plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted by the Crown in discharge of that indictment, on the basis of provocation. A question also arises whether, at the time of the killing, he was suffering from a psychiatric disorder bearing upon his culpability. To understand the circumstances of the offence, it is necessary to sketch his background. 
     
      
       
      
    2     The offender is now forty years of age. He was born and raised in the Indonesian province of West Timor, one of a family of nine children. His father was violent and his childhood was unhappy. His education did not progress beyond primary school. His father died when he was in his early teens, and he had to work as a sewing machinist to help provide for his younger siblings. His mother died in more recent years.  
     
      
       
      
    3     He came to Australia in 1988 on a visitor’s visa and has remained here since that time. Two of his brothers have settled in this country, having married and had children. If he came here in search of a better life, he was to be disappointed. Most of his daily routine was menial work for long hours, he does not appear to have been close to his brothers and he did not develop a relationship of any warmth or affection with anyone else.  
     
      
       
      
    4     The deceased, Loida Smith, was thirty-five years old at the time of her death. A native of the Philippines, she married an Australian and they had two children, but they separated in 1996. Since 1990 she had been renting the house at Marrickville near which she met her death. In that same year she invited Elma Valdehueza, a friend of hers from the Philippines, to move into the house with her.  
     
      
       
      
    5     In about December 1995 the offender also moved into the house. The deceased introduced him to Ms Valdehueza and arranged for their marriage, which was solemnized in January 1996. In fact, the marriage was a pretence designed to enable the offender to remain in Australia, as Ms Valdehueza had been granted permanent residency here. Their relationship was never intimate and they slept in separate rooms.  
     
      
       
      
    6     At the time of her death in May 1999, the deceased was living at the house with her two children, as were the offender and Ms Valdehueza. Also living there were the deceased’s mother, who had moved in in 1995, and Ms Valdehueza’s sister, who had arrived to visit her in March 1999. 
     
      
       
      
    7     Following the marriage, the offender’s life was little more than a bare existence, and a miserable one at that. In the period leading up to the killing he was working around twelve hours a day in two jobs, as a chicken filleter and a sewing machinist. From his weekly wage he would pay a certain amount to the deceased towards the rent and would give most of what was left to his wife, retaining a very small amount to live on himself. The two women often squandered the money on liquor or gambling, and the rent would remain unpaid. They would demand money from the offender, threatening otherwise to report him to the immigration authorities and have him sent back to Indonesia. Although the two women were friends, they constantly argued about money and frequently came to blows. The offender had difficulty sleeping, experienced a loss of appetite and was losing weight.  
     
      
       
      
    8     On the day in question the offender arrived home from work some time after 5pm, having been up since before 5am. It is unnecessary to recite in detail what then occurred. It is sufficient to say that the deceased had been drinking and she began to argue with the Valdehueza sisters. With one or two short breaks, the argument continued over several hours. The deceased assaulted both of the sisters. The offender remonstrated with the deceased, complaining that he was tired, but she abused him and on one occasion struck him. Again, she threatened to have him sent back to Indonesia. On another occasion she threw a fruit bowl onto the floor in front of him, breaking it. He was particularly afraid that she was going to strike him on the head with it because there is an area of his head where bone had been surgically removed following an incident in his early teens, when he fell out of a tree and fractured his skull.  
     
      
       
      
    9     Eventually, the Valdehueza sisters left the house and the deceased pursued them. The offender followed them outside and again remonstrated with the deceased about her fighting. It is at this point that he appears to have lost his self control. In his electronically recorded interview with police he spoke of experiencing “too much pressure”. He went back to the house, seized a knife, returned to where the women were and stabbed the deceased a number of times, causing her death. He remained at the scene, where he surrendered to police. 
     
      
       
      
    10     Clearly, the killing was the result of the deceased’s provocative behaviour that night, the gravity of which must be assessed against the background of the stressful and exploitative environment in which the offender had been living. I accept that violence of that kind is uncharacteristic of him. He has no criminal record in Indonesia and his only criminal history in this country is an entry for what appears to have been a minor offence of shoplifting, which is of no present significance. In the material before me are statements by his wife and the mother of the deceased suggesting that he had inflicted or threatened violence upon members of the household before this incident. Those statements are questionable for reasons which were exposed in the sentence proceedings, and I would not rely upon them. The offender’s sworn denial of any such behaviour was not pursued in cross-examination. 
     
      
       
      
    11     There is no doubt that he is contrite, and always has been. He expressed his remorse in evidence before me, as he had to psychiatrists who examined him and, from the very outset, to the police. Indeed, there is a poignant moment in his electronically recorded interview (observable on the video tape but not recorded in the transcript) from which it appears that he had not until then been aware that his victim had died. It is obvious from his demeanour that the realisation shattered him. 
     
      
       
      
    12     Let me turn, then, to the psychiatric evidence. The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 19 May 1999, and he has been seen on a number of occasions by health professionals in the prison system. Within a few days of his reception into prison he was seen by Dr Lynch, psychiatrist, who diagnosed major depression, with a differential diagnosis of an organic mood disorder (arising, apparently, from the head injury) or an adjustment disorder with depressed mood. The doctor prescribed anti-depressants and reviewed him on a few occasions over the next month or so.  
     
      
       
      
    13     In July 1999 he was referred to Dr Read, a psychiatric registrar, to whom he described symptoms of a hallucinatory and delusional nature. Dr Read diagnosed schizophrenia, with a differential diagnosis of psychotic depression. Dr Read saw him a few more times until the end of August 1999, whereupon he does not appear to have been examined by mental health staff until May 2000. He then came to the attention of Dr Ellis, another psychiatric registrar, who also diagnosed schizophrenia. 
     
      
       
      
    14     This case went to trial last year but the jury was unable to arrive at a verdict. In exploration of an issue of substantial impairment under s23A of the Crimes Act for the purpose of that trial, the offender’s solicitor had him examined by Dr Bruce Westmore. He was later examined by Dr Rod Milton for the Crown. There is no need for me to determine the issue of substantial impairment, as the plea of guilty to manslaughter has been accepted by the Crown on another basis. However, as I have foreshadowed, the question remains whether there is evidence of psychiatric illness bearing upon sentence in accordance with the principles examined by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Engert (1995) 84 ACrim R 67. I received in evidence the reports of Dr Westmore and Dr Milton, both of whom had access to the prison medical material. I also had the benefit of their oral evidence in the sentence proceedings. Their competing views, and my conclusion, can be stated briefly.  
     
      
       
      
    15     Dr Westmore saw the offender in April 2000 and, in the light of that consultation and the material he then had, he could see no evidence of a psychiatric disorder at the time of the killing which might have contributed to it. However, he saw him again in October 2000 while the trial was in progress. He had then been supplied with further material from the prison medical authorities and, more importantly, the offender gave him for the first time a history of auditory hallucinations during a period prior to the killing while he was living at the house at Marrickville. In the light of all the material Dr Westmore concluded that at the time of the consultation the offender was suffering from a major depressive illness which had been characterised by psychotic features in the past, that he was suffering from that illness at the time of the killing and that it may have led to a disturbed mental state contributing to his aggressive behaviour on that occasion. 
     
      
       
      
    16     Dr Milton saw the offender in January of this year. He considered that the evidence of the offender’s lifestyle around the time of the killing, particularly his ability to work long hours at two jobs, was inconsistent with his suffering a major psychiatric illness such as severe depression (or schizophrenia). He questioned the diagnoses of the prison medical staff, noting some inconsistencies in the offender’s account to them of his symptoms and expressing the view that those diagnoses could not be accommodated with some of their clinical observations. Dr Milton saw some of the auditory hallucinations described by the offender as explicable by his cultural background. Other reported symptoms, however, he thought may have been fabricated by the offender, including those which he described to Dr Westmore in the consultation of October 2000. 
     
      
       
      
    17     I am indebted to those two experts, and counsel for the Crown and the offender, for their careful analysis of the evidence bearing on this issue and the conclusions which might fairly be drawn from it. The matter is finely balanced and it has troubled me. Nevertheless, I am persuaded that the view of Dr Westmore is to be preferred and that, while the killing is readily explicable by the provocative effect of the deceased’s conduct on that occasion and in the past, the offender was suffering from a psychiatric illness which had some part to play in this terrible event. I do not see Dr Westmore’s diagnosis as inconsistent with the other evidence in the case. Moreover, while I am mindful of the possibility of a person in remand custody being tendered all sorts of advice by “bush lawyers” in the prison system, I agree with Dr Westmore that it is most unlikely that a man of this offender’s humble and unsophisticated background would be able to fabricate symptoms so as to deceive several health professionals within that system, and Dr Westmore himself.  
     
      
       
      
    18     I consider the risk of this offender re-offending in this way to be very low, and I certainly do not think that he is a continuing danger to society. As Dr Westmore observed, depression is a treatable illness. On the evidence, the offender has no history of serious violence, and I have no doubt that, notwithstanding the contributing factor of his mental illness, he would not have killed the deceased but for the provocative circumstances which I have outlined. Accordingly, his mental condition at the time serves to lessen the importance of the deterrent aspect of sentence, although by no means to eliminate it.  
     
      
       
      
    19     Of course, none of this is to deny the seriousness of this offence or to ignore its tragic consequences. The accused has killed a woman who was in the prime of her life and was the mother of two children. Nothing I have said about her behaviour is intended to pass judgment upon her. That material is relevant only in so far as it bears upon the offender’s culpability.  
     
      
       
      
    20     For the purpose of assessing the leniency to which the offender is entitled as a result of the provocation, I have regard to the three matters set out by Hunt CJ at CL in the familiar decision of R v Alexander (1994) 78 ACrim R 141 at 144. In the circumstances, the degree of provocation was high and I do not consider that there was any significant lapse of time between the provocative conduct and the killing. Nor, in the light of the post-mortem findings, does it appear that the degree of violence displayed by the offender was excessive. A discrete reduction of sentence is warranted by his mental condition, for the reasons which I have outlined. I also take into account his sad background and the fact that imprisonment has been, and will continue to be, particularly burdensome for him because of his relative isolation. His command of English is anything but fluent, and his brothers have visited him on relatively few occasions over the period of roughly two years he has been in custody. 
     
      
       
      
    21     In the light of his background and psychiatric condition, there are clearly special circumstances warranting a departure from the usual proportion between sentence and non-parole period. It may well be that he will be deported at the end of the non-parole period but that is not a matter to which I can have regard for the purpose of sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    22     Michael Pello, you are sentenced to imprisonment for five and a half years, to date from 19 May 1999, with a non-parole period of three years. You will be eligible for release on parole on 19 May 2002.

    - 1 -IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL Simpson JSperling J Friday 13 July 2001 60822/00 & 60128/01 Christopher El Khouri v Regina Judgment 1    SPERLING J: The applicant, having pleaded not guilty, was convicted on 24 November 2000 at a trial before Shillington DCJ on one count of break, enter and steal. The offence involved the theft of a motor vehicle on 29 March 1999. On 2 February 2001, Shillington DCJ sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of two years and six months from 24 November 2000 with a non-parole period of one year and eleven months, expiring on 23 October 2002. 
      
       
        
       
     2    On 23 February 2001, three weeks after receiving that first sentence, the applicant was sentenced by Karpin DCJ following pleas of guilty to three counts of receiving - again, motor vehicles. Two similar offences were taken into account on Form 1. 
      
       
        
       
     3    Karpin DCJ had before her the evidence adduced before Shillington DCJ and his remarks on sentence, together with further evidence adduced before her. She recognised that the principle of totality applied on the basis that all the offences were part of the same course of conduct. In relation to the first of the counts before her and taking into account the two offences on Form 1, she imposed a sentence of imprisonment for four years dating from 24 November 2000 with a non-parole period of two years and six months expiring on 23 May 2003. Her Honour imposed lesser sentences for the offences under the remaining counts before her, these to be served concurrently. 
      
       
        
       
     4    Shillington DCJ's sentence became a concurrent sentence expiring earlier than the sentence imposed by her Honour. His sentence was, in effect, replaced by the sentences imposed by her Honour and it ceased to have any practical significance so far as imprisonment of the appellant was concerned. 
      
       
        
       
     5    The appellant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Shillington DCJ and the sentences imposed by Karpin DCJ. 
      
       
        
       
     6    The sentence by Karpin DCJ under the first count before her was intended to reflect the whole of the applicant's culpability for the course of conduct comprised by all the offences, including the break-enter offence for which the applicant was sentenced by Shillington DCJ. Accordingly, if the sentencing by Karpin DCJ is free of error, that is the end of the matter. Any error by Shillington DCJ will have resulted in no injustice warranting action by this court because it will have had no effect on the ultimate result, unless Karpin DCJ was influenced by any such error. 
      
       
        
         
        Shillington DCJ's sentence 
         
        
       
     7    In his remarks on sentence, Shillington DCJ said: 
      
       
        
         
          
          ""It is common knowledge that the organised theft of expensive late model vehicles for sale is endemic in this country and it is necessary that the courts should do all that is possible to deter these activities. Those are the objective facts."" 
          
         
        
       
     8    The applicant says this finding of fact was not open to his Honour in the absence of evidence and should not have been made in any event without notice to the applicant. As will appear, a sentencing judge is entitled to take judicial notice of the prevalence of crimes of a particular kind. As to whether the evidence before his Honour established that the motive for the crime was resale, that becomes immaterial because again, as will appear, the evidence before Karpin DCJ showed irrefutably the purpose, as she found it to be, of the course of conduct comprised by the offences as a whole, including this offence. Any error by Shillington DCJ in this regard did not, therefore, influence the findings made by Karpin DCJ in that regard. 
      
       
        
       
     9    It is then submitted that Shillington DCJ gave undue weight to the applicant's criminal record, failed to take into account matters said to be relevant to special circumstances and erroneously failed to find special circumstances. 
      
       
        
       
     10    These submissions are without merit. But however that may be, again, as will appear, Karpin DCJ made her own evaluation of the relevant objective factors on the evidence before her, including the evidence before Shillington DCJ and brought that evaluation to bear in determining the sentences which she imposed. 
      
       
        
       
     11    There is no reason to think she was influenced in that regard by Shillington DCJ's evaluation of such factors on the evidence before him or by the sentence he imposed for the break-enter offence in isolation having regard to his evaluation of such factors. 
      
       
        
         
        Karpin DCJ's sentence 
         
        
       
     12    In relation to the sentences imposed by Karpin DCJ, the objective facts included the following. The applicant had his own business as a panel beater. On 4 April 1999, the police attended premises at Lidcombe leased by him. They found a large number of vehicles, few of which appeared to be totally intact, and a substantial quantity of parts and components. The offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty before her Honour related to vehicles found on the premises all of which had been stolen. They included a BMW and a Toyota four-wheel drive. Of the five vehicles mentioned in the three charges and in Form 1, all but one had their registration plates removed. The engine and chassis of the Toyota had been completely removed and replaced with the engine and chassis of another vehicle. Another of the five vehicles, a Subaru Impreza, had been substantially stripped; the engine was missing. 
      
       
        
       
     13    The vehicles which were the subject of the three charges before her Honour had been stolen on various dates between 28 March and 5 September 1998. Precisely when they had come into the applicant's possession - that is, the dates of receiving - was not apparent. Some of them had obviously been worked on over a period of time. It was obvious that the enterprise being carried on by the applicant was what is popularly known as ""rebirthing"" stolen motor vehicles. 
      
       
        
       
     14    The break-enter offence, committed on 29 March 1999, involved an attempt to acquire another Subaru vehicle. The vehicle had been removed by the applicant and others from a garage on private property and was being worked on to neutralise the alarm system when the offenders were disturbed. In the context of what was found on the applicant's premises about a week later, on 4 April 1999, this was obviously an attempt to acquire another vehicle for the rebirthing operation. 
      
       
        
       
     15    Karpin DCJ made the following finding: ""The facts of this matter disclose a process of rebirthing cars..."" That finding was justified. Indeed, it was unavoidable. The applicant says that the finding was influenced by an erroneous finding by Shillington DCJ in that regard. However that may be, Karpin DCJ's finding, if relevant, was compelled by the evidence before her irrespective of what was before Shillington DCJ and irrespective of his finding on the evidence before him. 
      
       
        
       
     16    Karpin DCJ is criticised for the way she used this finding. She went on to say: ""The rebirthing of cars is endemic in the community."" She then made observations about the financial consequences of such crimes for the owners of stolen cars, for the unwitting purchasers of ""rebirthed"" vehicles and for the community, through insurance premiums. 
      
       
        
       
     17    A sentencing judge is entitled to take notice of the incidence of particular kinds of crime and to bring that information to bear in the sentencing process as relevant to the need for general deterrence - that is, in order to deter others from committing the particular type of crime in so far as sentencing practice is capable of achieving that objective: Brenton (NSWCCA, 14 November 1994, unreported); A [1999] NSWCCA 61 at [21] and [26]. 
      
       
        
       
     18    In this instance, the fact that the vehicles involved were either received or stolen for the purpose of such a rebirthing operation was a relevant consideration. It categorised the applicant's conduct as being of a kind which, on an approach open to a sentencing judge, required that due weight be given to general deterrence in the sentencing process because of the prevalence and social implications of crimes of that kind. 
      
       
        
       
     19    The evidence itself was sufficient to put the applicant's legal representatives on notice that it was likely to be used in this way. The applicant had the opportunity, through his legal representatives, to say whatever could be said about that. 
      
       
        
       
     20    Then it is submitted that Karpin DCJ failed to take relevant subjective matters into account. In careful, sensitive and insightful remarks, her Honour referred to all the matters mentioned in argument here. There is no substance in the submission that, having referred to them, she failed to take them into account. 
      
       
        
       
     21    Lastly, it is submitted that Karpin DCJ failed to take special circumstances into account. The non-parole period set by her Honour in relation to count 1, which is the effective sentence for the totality of criminal conduct involved in all the offences, is less than three quarters of the sentence. Three quarters of the sentence is the minimum non-parole period allowed by the legislation absent special circumstances. Under the formula, that would be a non-parole period of not less than three years in this case. Her Honour set a non-parole period of two years and six months which is less than the provisional minimum under the legislation. 
      
       
        
       
     22    Her Honour did not say whether she found special circumstances. However, there are only two possibilities. Either the judge considered the question of special circumstances, found them, and reduced the non-parole period accordingly, omitting to record what she had done in that regard; or she made an arithmetical error in calculating a non-parole period in accordance with the provisional formula in the legislation. A non-parole period of two years six months cannot be an arithmetical error for three quarters of four. That leaves only the first alternative as the explanation of what was done. 
      
       
        
       
     23    Ordinarily, a failure to mention special circumstances may imply a failure to consider them, but that cannot be so in this case. For the reasons I have given, one has to conclude that Her Honour considered whether there were special circumstances, decided that there were and reduced the non-parole period on that account relative to the provisional statutory formula. 
      
       
        
       
     24    The non-parole period of two years and six months left one and a half years potentially available for supervision on parole. Her Honour was not bound to allow longer than that on the facts of this case. I would not do so myself if it were necessary to resentence the applicant. 
      
       
        
       
     25    Lastly, it is submitted that the principle of totality was not observed by Karpin DCJ and that if the applicant had been sentenced for all the offences at one and the same time, the effective sentence would have been less. 
      
       
        
       
     26    There is no substance in this submission. Karpin DCJ recorded that the Crown conceded that all the offences, including that for which the applicant was sentenced by Shillington DCJ, should be treated as part of the same course of offending and that the principle of totality therefore applied. There is no reason to suppose she did not apply that principle or that she did not apply it correctly. The effective sentence she imposed is entirely consistent with the total objective criminality involved and the subjective factors disclosed by the evidence. 
      
       
        
         
        Conclusion 
         
        
       
     27    I propose that leave to appeal be granted in both matters and that the appeal in each case be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       
     28    SIMPSON J: I agree. The orders of the Court will be as proposed by Sperling J.

     Friday, 13 July 2001Simpson JSperling J60798/00 Julian Lo v ReginaJudgment 
      
       
        
       
     1    SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Sperling J. I agree with the orders proposed, and generally, with his Honour’s reasons. I would merely add this, in order to make explicit the nature of the error in sentencing as I perceive it. 
      
       
        
       
     2    The sentencing judge referred to R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383, and then said: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “In all of the circumstances of this case and bearing in mind that the Crown case was a very strong one and that the plea of guilty has, I find as a fact, little utilitarian value I quantify the value of the plea of guilty at 10 percent.” 
          
         
        
       
     3    In my opinion the correct interpretation of this passage is that the sentencing judge considered that the strength of the Crown case bore upon the utilitarian value of the plea. That runs counter to an express conclusion stated in Thomson and Houlton. At para 137 Spigelman CJ, with whom Wood CJ at CL, Foster AJA, Grove and James JJ agreed, wrote: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “In  
          Winchester v The Queen  
          [(1992) 58 A Crim R 345], Hunt CJ at CL related the strength of the Crown case only to the contrition element of the leniency in sentencing which a plea of guilty affords an accused (c/f  
          R v Beavan  
          [unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 22 August 1991]. As his Honour put it (at 350): 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            ‘…the extent to which leniency will be afforded upon this ground will depend to a large degree upon whether or not the plea resulted from a recognition of the inevitable.’ 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          In my opinion his Honour was correct to link the question of the strength of the Crown case only to the issue of contrition or remorse. A ‘recognition of the inevitable’ may qualify the extent of genuine contrition. It does not qualify the utilitarian value of a plea.” 
          
         
        
       
     4    The last sentence makes it clear that the sentencing judge should not have approached the question of the quantification of the discount for the plea of guilty on the basis that its utilitarian value was diminished by reason of the strength of the Crown case. The strength of the Crown case was available to aid the evaluation of the applicant’s asserted contrition. 
      
       
        
       
     5    The applicant was entitled to the maximum benefit of the allowable reduction in sentence attributable to the timing of the entry of the plea; but, by reason of the length of a trial, had it taken place (two or three days) the allowance for that aspect of the utilitarian value of the plea was minimal. However, as promulgated in Thomson and Houlton, the minimum allowance to which an offender would ordinarily expect to receive is 10 percent on the sentence nominated as the starting point. I agree with Sperling J that, by reason of the timing of the applicant’s plea alone, he could legitimately have expected something in excess of that. However, as I have said, the estimated length of a trial meant he could not legitimately have expected that his sentence would be reduced by the 25 percent nominated as the upper end of the range in Thomson and Houlton. In my opinion the appropriate reduction in these circumstances was of the order of 15 percent. 
      
       
        
       
     6    Accordingly, I agree with the orders proposed by Sperling J. 
      
       
        
       
     7    SPERLING J: On 12 February 1999, the applicant turned 18. Over the previous two years, he committed eight robberies in company and other serious property offences. He committed his first serious property crime when he was 15. Mostly, he targeted banks. 
      
       
        
       
     8    Having turned 18, the same pattern of behaviour continued. In February 2000, the applicant was convicted of being on enclosed lands without lawful excuse. In April 2000, he was convicted of stealing. For that last offence, he was placed under a community service order. He defaulted.  
      
       
        
       
     9    On 14 June 2000, the applicant was by then 19 years of age. The community service order was still current. With two companions, he entered the premises of State Government Employees’ Credit Union at Westmead Hospital. He leapt over the counter and demanded money. He and his companions ransacked the premises. In the noise and confusion that followed, the applicant stood over a female employee, terrorising her to such an extent that she became hysterical. Hospital staff intervened, putting their own safety at risk. The offenders fled. The applicant was caught. The offenders had got away with only $4 but that is of little moment. It belies the objective. This was no trifling episode. 
      
       
        
       
     10    The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for five years and 10 months. But for a finding of special circumstances, the non-parole period would have been something over four years. The sentencing judge found special circumstances and fixed a non-parole period of three years. 
      
       
        
       
     11    One of the grounds on which the sentence is impugned is that inadequate allowance was made for an early plea of guilty. The applicant maintained his right to silence when apprehended. He pleaded guilty before he would have been committed for trial in the ordinary course. Whether the public expense of preparing a Crown brief had then been incurred or not at that stage is not clear. The case should, however, be classified as involving an early plea of guilty.  
      
       
        
       
     12    The trial would not have been long, perhaps two or three days. But the cost of that trial was avoided. The trial judge allowed a 10 percent discount for the utilitarian value of the plea in that regard. 
      
       
        
       
     13    In Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, Spigelman CJ said at [152] - [154]: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “In my opinion, the appropriate range for a discount is from 10-25 per cent. 
          
         
         
          
          The determination of where, within such a range, the discount should fall in a particular case is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge. 
          
         
         
          
          There are however two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case: 
          
         
         
          
          (i) The time at which a plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial. 
          
         
         
          
          (ii) The complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea.” 
          
         
        
       
     14    In the present case, the plea was early, although the prospective trial was short. An allowance at the very bottom of the range was erroneous in these circumstances. 
      
       
        
       
     15    This point alone vitiates the sentencing process. The sentence should be set aside and this Court should resentence the applicant.  
      
       
        
       
     16    I did not consider, at the time of writing, that there was a need, in these circumstances, for me to consider other grounds on which the sentence was impugned. However, I have since read Simpson J’s proposed judgment. I agree that the appeal should also be allowed on the ground that the sentencing judge misdirected himself concerning the relevance of the strength of the Crown case for the reasons given by Simpson J in that regard. 
      
       
        
       
     17    As to resentencing, in Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, this Court promulgated a guideline range of sentences for armed robbery of four to five years. The applicability of the guideline range was made subject to certain conditions. Robbery in company carries the same maximum penalty as armed robbery. It is a comparable offence.  
      
       
        
       
     18    The conditions in Henry, set out at [162], included that the offender was young, little or no criminal history, and a late plea of guilty (the latter as explained in Thomson and Houlton at [161]). Thus, Henry contemplated a discount for an early plea on a sentence otherwise fixed under the guidelines promulgated in that case. 
      
       
        
       
     19    The condition relating to little or no criminal history is not satisfied in the present case. On the other hand, a discount for the utilitarian value of an early plea has to be made. 
      
       
        
       
     20    Deterring others is an important factor in sentencing. That consideration is given less weight in the case of young offenders. However, the importance of deterring others does not cease to be a factor altogether when sentencing young offenders. It continues to be a significant factor where the offence is grave and where there is a history of offending, as in the present case. These principles are well recognised. They apply in every case involving a young offender. The authorities need not be cited here. 
      
       
        
       
     21    In the present case, the applicant’s criminal history is so grave that I would give little weight to his youth as a mitigating factor.  
      
       
        
       
     22    Evidence was given at the sentencing hearing by Ms Elizabeth Kusch, psychologist. His Honour accepted her evidence. This Court should do likewise. She recorded that the applicant used heroin from the age of 15 or so. He had been raised in a dysfunctional family. He had suffered damaging experiences throughout his formative years which had impeded healthy personality development. He was of average intelligence. Notwithstanding that heroin addiction was likely to have been a contributing factor in the offence for which he was convicted, the applicant denied that he had any drug problem.  
      
       
        
       
     23    Unfortunately, this is a familiar profile in a prisoner with a history of serious property crimes: personality deficits, drug addiction, raising the money for drugs by criminal behaviour and little insight into the process. There is nothing in Ms Kusch’s report which makes the applicant a special case.  
      
       
        
       
     24    I would make no allowance for contrition. The applicant’s mother gave evidence. She said that the applicant had told her that he was sorry for what he did. He was crying and she believed him. She said she asked him if he was really going to change, and he said, “Yes”. The family is Fijian. She asked him if he would like to go to Fiji when he came out of gaol. He said he would, that he would love to get away from his friends and that he wanted to be changed.  
      
       
        
       
     25    It does not appear that the sentencing judge gave any weight to this evidence. Nor would I. In cross examination of Ms Lo, it became clear that the applicant did not inform his mother of anything like the true extent of his criminal history. Nor did the applicant give evidence at the sentencing hearing. Ms Kusch’s evidence indicated that the applicant had no insight into his own behaviour.  
      
       
        
       
     26    Evidence tendered on the appeal shows that the applicant has co-operated well with the prison authorities. He has worked conscientiously. He has applied for entry into the Violence Prevention Program and to see a welfare officer. There has been no adverse report. This conduct is commendable but it falls short of evidence that the applicant is contrite. 
      
       
        
       
     27    I would attribute no such motivation to the plea of guilty. The strength of the Crown case is sufficient explanation for that. The early plea has a utilitarian value but that is all. 
      
       
        
       
     28    In re-sentencing the applicant I would begin with a head sentence of six years imprisonment. This includes some allowance for the applicant’s youth. I would reduce that by approximately 15 percent to five years for the early plea.  
      
       
        
       
     29    The non-parole period must not be less than three quarters of the sentence, absent special circumstances. That would, provisionally, be a minimum non-parole period of three years and nine months. 
      
       
        
       
     30    The sentencing judge found special circumstances, particularly because of the need for an extensive period of supervised rehabilitation on the applicant’s release from prison. I agree with that approach and would also find special circumstances for that reason. I would not, however, reduce the non-parole period to the same extent as was done by the sentencing judge.  
      
       
        
       
     31    The applicant has been in custody since 14 June 2000.  
      
       
        
       
     32    I would propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
         
        (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
         
         
        (2) Appeal allowed. 
         
         
        (3) Sentence quashed. 
         
         
        (4) In lieu thereof, applicant sentenced to imprisonment for five years commencing on 14 June 2000. 
         
         
        (5) A non-parole period of three years commencing on 14 June 2000, and expiring on 13 June 2003, that being the earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible to be released on parole.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
     1    STEIN JA: 
      
      Introduction 
       
     2    Between 8 November 1999 and 4 January 2000 both appellants were tried on indictment for the murder of Christopher Mark Dorrian on or around 7 June 1997 at Lilyfield, New South Wales. They were also tried on the alternative count of accessory after the fact to murder. 
     3    On 4 January 2000 the jury returned a verdict by which the appellant Yeo was found guilty of murder, and the co-appellant Galea found guilty of being an accessory after the fact to murder. Galea was found not guilty of murder. On 12 April 2000 Grove J sentenced the appellant Yeo to 24 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 years. The appellant Galea was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years. 
     4    The appeals were heard by the court on 4 April 2001. However, the hearing was not able to be completed on that day because of the then pending decisions in the High Court of Azzopardi and Davis. On 3 May 2001 the High Court published these decisions, Azzopardi v The Queen and Davis v The Queen [2001] HCA 25. 
     5    The balance of the hearing of the appeals was agreed to be dealt with by way of written submissions, the last of which was delivered to the court on 15 June 2001. 
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
     6    Both appellants raise a number of grounds of appeal against conviction. Galea also appeals on sentence. For convenience, the grounds may be summarised as follows: 
      
       
      Yeo 
       
       
      (1) The verdict of the jury is unreasonable having regard to the evidence. Two separate contentions are raised with respect to this ground. First, that the verdicts are inconsistent with the presentation of the Crown case as a joint enterprise. Secondly, that there is insufficient evidence against Yeo to establish the charge of murder, either individually, or jointly. 
       
       
      (2) His Honour erred in his directions on the use that the jury might make of the fact that Yeo did not give evidence at the trial. 
       
       
      Galea 
       
       
      The grounds of appeal with respect to conviction are: 
       
       
      (1) His Honour erred in his ruling concerning the permitted scope of cross-examination by the Crown in the event that the appellant sought to raise his good character at trial. 
       
       
      (1A) His Honour erred in admitting the evidence of Mr Glen Wood. 
       
       
      (2) His Honour erred in admitting into evidence the Digital Audio Tape recordings of the product of listening devices, and the transcripts of those tapes. 
       
       
      (3) His Honour erred in his directions to the jury concerning the use which could be made of expert evidence at the trial. 
       
       
      (4) The trial judge failed to direct adequately, and erred in his directions concerning circumstantial evidence. 
       
       
      (5) The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
       
       
      (6) The trial judge failed to adequately direct the jury concerning the separate cases against each accused in that he: 
       
       
       (i) failed to sum up the evidence in the case against each  
       
        
        accused; 
        
       
       
       (ii) failed to identify separately in the case against Galea, the 
       
        
        evidence establishing Yeo’s criminal involvement; 
        
       
       
       (iii) failed to adequately identify the Crown’s case in respect of the  
       
        
        alternative count, and the evidence admissible against the  
         
        appellant Galea in respect of that count; and 
        
       
       
      (iv) failed to identify how the jury might proceed to a finding of  
       
        
        guilt on the alternative count. 
        
       
       
      (7) The trial judge failed to adequately direct the jury concerning the use to which the material in Ex’s GGG 3 and 4 might be put. 
       
       
       
      The grounds of appeal by Galea with respect to sentence are: 
       
       
      (1) That his Honour sentenced Galea on the basis that he had participated in the dismemberment and disposal of the body of the deceased, however, the Crown case was not ultimately put on this basis. The judge should not have sentenced on a more serious basis than the matter was left to the jury. 
       
       
      (2) That both the sentence and non-parole period were excessive. 
       
       
      Summary of trial 
     7    On 21 June 1997 a black sports bag and jacket were found on the banks of the Cooks River in Gough Whitlam Park, Undercliffe. It was found to contain a human head. Documents found with the remains identified the deceased as Christopher Mark Dorrian. Searches of the river did not reveal any further body parts. 
     8    The autopsy revealed that the deceased’s head had been severed at the fifth vertebrate. There were five cuts in the neck caused by a large cutting instrument. Three .22 calibre bullets were found in the head. The estimate of time of death was two to four weeks prior to the remains being found. 
     9    Mrs Desiree Mills, the mother of the deceased, identified his remains. She gave evidence that she had spoken to her son on 30 May 1997, when he informed her that he was coming to collect his belongings as he had met a woman named Kathy and they were going to move in together. That same day he and the appellant Yeo arrived at Mrs Mills’ home to collect his belongings. They were in contact over the next few days. However, the last time Mrs Mills spoke to the deceased was on 4 June 1997. 
     10    Yeo gave a statement to police on 23 June 1997, wherein she provided a background of her relationship with the deceased. She was a nurse at Palm Court, a drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit at Rozelle Hospital. The deceased had admitted himself to the unit on 12 April 1997 and discharged himself on 6 May 1997. Yeo told police that she spoke frequently with the deceased while he was at Palm Court. This was confirmed by staff who had noted that Yeo was having daily contact with the deceased, despite the fact that she was not his assigned carer. The Director of Nursing, Mr Rowley, gave evidence of allegations made by staff concerning the relationship between Yeo and the deceased, and a number of Yeo’s colleagues outlined her contact with the deceased. At all times Yeo denied that there was any improper relationship. 
     11    Once he had discharged himself, the deceased contacted Yeo on 9 May 1997 and they arranged to meet for a coffee, at which time Yeo talked about her relationship with the appellant Galea. She said that she was not happy in the relationship and was looking for another. The deceased asked if she would have a relationship with him. They arranged to meet for dinner on the same day and, over the next few days, met at various locations. 
     12    In her statement to police Yeo said that the deceased telephoned her at work on 20 May 1997 and they discussed moving in together. On 23 May 1997 she moved out of the house at Marrickville, where she lived with the appellant Galea, and moved into the nurses quarters at Rozelle Hospital. On 26 May 1997 she signed a 6 month lease on a unit at Maida Street, Lilyfield, which she and the deceased moved into on 30 May 1997. On 1 June 1997 she went to Galea’s Marrickville house and collected some of her belongings. 
     13    Late on 4 June 1997 (or very early on 5 June) the deceased and Yeo had an argument, which became a physical altercation. According to Yeo the deceased was intoxicated, and left the unit after the argument. Yeo telephoned Galea at 2.30 am on 5 June and asked him to pick her up. Prior to his arrival the deceased returned and another argument between he and Yeo ensued. Yeo then went to Galea’s home and stayed the balance of the night. 
     14    Galea drove Yeo to her music lesson at around 8 am on 5 June 1997. Whilst she was at her lesson Galea went to the Lilyfield unit and confronted the deceased about the argument he had had with Yeo. Galea, in an interview with police on 1 July 1997, described his conversation with the deceased that morning as amicable. He told Yeo that the deceased had discussed the difficulties in his relationship with Yeo and had stated that the relationship was over. 
     15    Later on 5 June 1997 Yeo returned to the Lilyfield unit and had a further argument with the deceased before he left for work. The deceased telephoned her at about 11.20 am and reiterated that their relationship was over. Yeo then went to work, returning at about 11 pm. Shortly thereafter, the deceased returned to the unit in an intoxicated state and told Yeo that she had ruined his life. 
     16    On 6 June 1997 Yeo went to work, however, she could not concentrate and returned to the unit after half an hour. She told the deceased that she was moving out and returning to Galea, who she had telephoned to ask for assistance in moving her belongings. Yeo and the deceased had a disagreement as to the payment of future rent, and she then returned to Galea’s home. Yeo said that she telephoned the deceased at about 5.45 pm that day, and spent the evening with a friend, before returning to Galea’s home. 
     17    Both appellants maintain that they went shopping on the morning of 7 June 1997, first in Marrickville and later in the CBD of Sydney. Upon returning, Yeo said that she repeatedly telephoned the deceased at the Lilyfield unit, without answer. The appellants stated that they went to the unit at around 5 pm that day to collect the remainder of Yeo’s belongings. The deceased was not present at the unit and the appellants told police that the deceased’s belongings had been removed. The appellants left the unit at approximately 8 pm. 
     18    On the morning of Sunday, 8 June 1997 the appellants returned to the unit to finish cleaning it. Yeo told police that they tidied the unit, cleaned the bathroom, toilet and kitchen, and vacuumed the carpet using a Black and Decker Dustbuster. While doing so Yeo claimed to have split a bucket of water and cleaning detergent on the carpet. They left the unit around lunchtime, went into the city and later stopped at Yeo’s parents home, prior to going to Galea’s home for the remainder of the evening. The deceased, who had been working at the Gotham Restaurant in Balmain since 8 May 1997, did not turn up for work on 8 June 1997 and no further contact was had from him.19    The following day, 9 June 1997, Yeo went to work before both appellants returned to the unit to check it. Yeo stated that there were no signs that anyone had been there. On 10 June 1997 Yeo terminated the lease on the unit. The managing agent inspected the unit on 12 June 1997, describing it as being in a clean condition. 
     20    Galea is the holder of a Shooters Licence, as well as of a Pistol Licence. At trial he gave evidence of belonging to the army reserve, of establishing a pistol club in 1993 and being an editor of various magazines which dealt with guns. He was also employed as a consultant by the Shooters Party. Yeo told police that she was the holder of a current Pistol Licence and had joined the Special Forces Pistol Club in December 1994. She ceased attending in December 1996. She normally used Galea’s .22 Calibre High Standard Citation. Galea told police that it was this pistol that Yeo was most proficient in. Galea gave evidence that he used this pistol for target shooting and for training new members of his club. 
     21    On 23 June 1997 police attended Galea’s home where he surrendered the firearms from his safe. Four guns, three rifles and one shot gun were seized. The bullets found in the deceased’s head were shown to have been fired from the appellant Galea’s .22 calibre high standard pistol, which was found by police in the locked safe at Galea’s home. 
     22    Police attended the Lilyfield unit on 25 June 1997 to conduct a forensic examination. Photographs were taken of blood stains found in the bathroom, on the floor and doors, in the bath tub, in the kitchen area and under the stove, and on and underneath the carpet. Hair and tissue were found in the bath. The DNA from swabs taken during the forsenic examination were found to match that of the deceased. 
     23    A listening device warrant for Galea’s home, and three telephone intercepts were applied for by police on 26 June 1997. These were granted on 30 June 1997 and installed from approximately 1 July 1997 until 25 July 1997. A total of 22 tapes were recorded. They were of poor sound quality and there was a need for the voices recorded to be enhanced. The process of reviewing the tapes and preparing transcripts took a number of months. At trial Dr Joanne Tibbetts, an electrical engineer whose thesis was on the use of digital signalling processing technique to improve the intelligibility of speech for the hearing impaired, was satisfied that she was able to come up with a firm view as to precisely what was said in the 29 extracts from the Digital Audio Tape recordings she was asked to look at. 
     24    On 30 June 1997 Galea telephoned Detective Senior Constable Wyllie. He stated that he had returned home to find the spare key to his safe, in which his firearms were kept, in the lock of the safe. Galea indicated that he found this strange as the key was normally hidden. Police attended his Marrickville home on 1 July 1997 and executed a search warrant. They removed a Dustbuster and a bucket during that search. 
     25    Yeo told the police in an electronic recorded interview on 1 July 1997 that on 1 June 1997 she had returned to Galea the keys to his home. She said that she did not have a key to the safe, however there was a spare key to it which was normally kept in Galea’s trophy cupboard. Only she and Galea knew where the spare key was kept. She mentioned the incident where they discovered the spare key in the safe, and said that there had been no signs of forced entry and that nothing had been missing from the home. She also told police that she had mentioned to the deceased that there were guns in Galea’s home. She denied that she had told the deceased the location of the spare key to the safe. 
     26    In his ERISP, also of 1 July 1997, Galea said that as a result of his concerns that someone had been having access to his home, he changed the locks to the house. At trial, Galea gave evidence that Yeo had access to the safe, as she knew where the spare key was kept and that she had had access to the guns on a number of occasions when she had assisted him in preparing to go pistol shooting. He also said that a number of his friends, associates, business associates and members of the Shooters Party would know that he kept guns at home. 
     27    The .22 calibre high standard pistol, the pistol magazine and camouflage pouch were examined for fingerprints. Apart from police prints, it contained no others. The only fingerprints found on the bathroom wall in the Lilyfield unit were identified as those of the deceased. A fingerprint found on the lid of the silver trophy was identified as being Galea’s. 
     28    Ms Janet Roberts, who visited another unit in the Lilyfield block every weekend, gave evidence of being woken at approximately midnight on 6 June 1997 by heavy thumping sounds. She said they lasted for about 10 minutes, during which time she also heard a male voice. She identified the noise as coming from the northern end of the building, the unit on the other side of the neighbouring unit. 
     29    Mr Glen Wood lived at Unit 9 and would park his car in bay 17, which was reserved for his unit. On 1 June 1997 he noticed that his front and rear passenger tyres were flat. The next morning he found his windscreen smashed. The tyres had been slashed. 
     30    Mr Peter Helmerand, a former patient at Palm Court, gave evidence that Yeo had questioned him as to how to make a body disappear. He extracted some documents from the internet on the topic and gave them to her. 
     31    At the trial, Galea gave evidence in which he denied any involvement in the deceased’s death or disposal of his body. He said that he did not know who had removed the .22 calibre high standard pistol, which was identified as having been used to kill the deceased, from his safe. He mentioned that he and Yeo attended a photographic shoot at Gough Whitlam Park on 14 June 1997, but at that time were unaware that Mr Dorrian’s head was in the river. 
      
       
      The appeal of Yeo 
       
       
      Directions on the use the jury might make of the fact that Yeo did not give evidence 
       
     32    During the course of the trial, counsel for Yeo, Mr Ramage QC, raised with his Honour what directions might be given in the event of his client not giving evidence. In particular, he asked whether a direction would be given in accordance with Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217. At the time the submission was made, the High Court had not published its decision in RPS v The Queen (2000) 199 CLR 620. Further, Azzopardi and Davis were then pending before the High Court. On 29 November 1999 his Honour indicated that he would give a conventional direction in terms of the majority judgment in Weissensteiner. Counsel for Yeo complained, seeking inter alia that particular emphasis be put on the explanations made by Yeo in her ERISP tape. 
     33    In summing-up on 23 December 1999, after observing the difference in approach by the two accused, Galea giving evidence and Yeo not, his Honour said: 
      
       
        
        The final observation I should make in this context is this; that where the evidence of Crown witnesses is left undenied or uncontradicted by an accused, any doubts which may otherwise have been cast upon the evidence of the Crown witnesses may be more readily discounted and the evidence of that Crown witness may be more readily accepted if it is left uncontradicted and that is an approach which you are entitled to take. 
        
       
     34    It is submitted by Mr Byrne QC, appearing on behalf of Yeo, that the direction was in error as either misstating the proper use to be made of a failure of an accused to give evidence or as constituting a breach of s20(2) of the Evidence Act 1995. 
     35    After the jury had returned its verdict, the High Court published its decision in RPS on 3 February 2001. A very similar direction to that given by his Honour had been given in RPS (see para 16). The joint judgment of Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ (at para 40) held that the direction should not have been given. 
     36    Their Honours said: 
      
       
        
        To attempt to instruct the jury about how they may reason towards a verdict of guilt (as distinct from warning the jury about impermissible forms of reasoning) leads only to difficulties of the kind that have arisen in the present case. Had the judge’s instructions about the significance of the appellant not giving evidence stopped at pointing out that he was not bound to do so, that there may have been many reasons why he did not do so (and the jury should not speculate about those reasons), that it was for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and that the jury should draw no inference from the appellant not having given evidence, no complaint could be made. … [at 637 - 638] 
        
       
     37    It is submitted by Mr Byrne QC, on behalf of Yeo, that his Honour’s direction went further than the limits set by the majority in RPS. In particular, it is submitted that it was a misdirection to tell the jury that: 
      
       
      (a) any doubts which they may have about the Crown case may be ‘more readily discarded’ because the accused failed to give evidence. 
       
       
      (b) the evidence of any Crown witness ‘may be more readily accepted’ because it is not contradicted by the accused. 
       
       
      (c) (by implication) the failure of an accused to give evidence means that there is no denial or contradiction of the evidence presented against the accused. 
       
     38    It was also submitted that there was a failure to comply with s20(2) of the Evidence Act. Counsel submitted that a further direction given by his Honour on 23 December 1999, making brief reference to Yeo’s ERISP, did not bring to the jury’s attention with sufficient emphasis the importance of the material in the ERISP to her defence, or perhaps to qualify his earlier Weissensteiner direction. 
     39    The Crown submitted that, as the present case was a circumstantial case, it fitted within the narrow field of cases where a Weissensteiner direction was appropriate. It argued that the direction did not contravene any of the five elements identified in RPS which should not have been given. It was a neutral and not adverse comment, doing no more than stating the obvious. 
     40    Since RPS this court has retreated from the position it took in R v OGD (1997) 45 NSWLR 744. For example, in R v Fowler (2000) NSWCCA 142 Wood CJ at CL said that a Weissensteiner type direction must, since RPS, be confined to an exceptional case of the kind there involved. See also R v Dang (2000) NSWCCA 269, R v Mai (2000) NSWCCA 517 and R v Bozzola (2001) NSWCCA 8. 
     41    In Azzopardi the majority judgment (Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) drew attention to the unusual circumstances of Weissensteiner, which were in sharp distinction to the not uncommon case of sexual assault in which the prosecution case largely, if not entirely, relied on the evidence of the victim. In this type of case, there is no basis for concluding that there is any additional fact known only by the accused, and therefore not the subject of evidence at trial if the accused remained silent, which would explain or contradict the victim’s evidence. 
     42    The joint judgment referred to the fact that the plea of not guilty stands as a denial. Their Honours noted that Weissensteiner was decided before s20(2) of the Evidence Act was enacted, which provision enables comment to be made but prohibits suggestions that the accused failed to given evidence because he believed he was guilty. 
     43    Their Honours continued (at para 64): 
      
       
        
        There may be cases involving circumstances such that the reasoning in  
        Weissensteiner  
        will justify some comment. However, that will be so only if there is a basis for concluding that, if there are additional facts which would explain or contradict the inference which the prosecution seeks to have the jury draw, and they are facts which (if they exist) would be peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, that a comment on the accused’s failure to provide evidence of those facts may be made. The facts which it is suggested could have been, but were not, revealed by evidence from the accused must be  
        additional  
        to those already given in evidence by the witnesses who were called. The fact that the accused could have contradicted evidence already given will not suffice. Mere contradiction would not be evidence of any  
        additional  
        fact. [Emphasis in original] 
        
       
     44    The joint judgment makes it plain that a judge may comment but not give directions with respect to evidence. If a comment is permitted with respect to the failure of an accused to offer an explanation, it must be made clear that it is one which the jury is free to ignore. If a comment is made, it must be placed in context. This requires identifying the facts said to call for an explanation, adequate directions being given on the onus of proof, reference to the absence of any obligation to give evidence and a direction that not giving evidence is not an admission, nor does it fill any gaps in the Crown case. (para 67) 
     45    Finally, their Honours said: 
      
       
        
        It is to be emphasised that cases in which a judge may comment on the failure of an accused to offer an explanation will be both rare and exceptional. They will occur only if the evidence is capable of explanation by disclosure of additional facts known only to the accused. A comment will never be warranted merely because the accused has failed to contradict some aspect of the prosecution case. (para 68) 
        
       
     46    In a separate judgment, Callinan J agreed with the conclusion of the majority. 
     47    The Crown relies on two aspects of the trial to justify the direction which was given by his Honour, the trial judge. 
     48    First, the Crown referred to the DNA evidence which established that the deceased’s blood was found in the unit at Lilyfield. The Crown relied on this evidence to infer that the deceased was killed and dismembered there. It was said to be peculiarly within the knowledge of Yeo to provide additional evidence, if it existed at all, to explain the DNA evidence or rebut the inference. 
     49    Secondly, it was submitted to be peculiarly within the knowledge of Yeo to explain what she meant when she said ‘sorry’ to Galea (twice) after their arrest and charge. 
     50    However, it was the Crown case that Yeo and Galea dismembered the body of the deceased together. The knowledge of the blood of the deceased being in the unit was, on the Crown hypothesis, knowledge of more than one person - Yeo and Galea. It cannot be said that it was a matter peculiarly within Yeo’s knowledge. Similarly, it was within the knowledge of Galea, who gave evidence at the trial, as to what was meant by Yeo saying ‘sorry’ to him after arrest and charging. It was not peculiarly within the knowledge of Yeo to provide additional evidence to explain the DNA evidence or what she meant when she said ‘sorry’. In any event, there may be many explanations for saying ‘sorry’ including many non-incriminating ones. For example, sorry for you, for myself, sorry that we are here etc. It is difficult to see that it has much, if any, probative force. 
     51    It is my opinion that what his Honour said in the impugned direction must, with the benefit of the hindsight of RPS and Azzopardi, be seen as erroneous. It cannot survive what must now be acknowledged as the limited ambit for a Weissensteiner direction. It is not one of those rare and exceptional cases left to permit such a comment to be made to the jury. In any event, what was said by his Honour far exceeded what the majority judgment in Azzopardi requires, even if a comment may be permitted to be made, see para 67.52    That leaves only the question of the application of the proviso. The Crown argues that its case against Yeo was a very strong circumstantial one. In the unusual circumstances of the case, it is submitted that the appellant was not deprived of a real chance of acquittal. It is said that his Honour’s comment did no more than state what may have been obvious to the jury anyway. 
     53    On the other hand, the appellant Yeo submits that the jury may have been affected in their assessment of the case against her by considerations deriving from her failure to give evidence.  
     54    In my view, the case against Yeo was not so overwhelming that it could be said that the verdict of the jury against her was inevitable. Moreover, the misdirection was fundamental, see RPS at 630 and Azzopardi at para 58. 
     55    While the prosecution case against Yeo was not by any means a weak one, it is not to be categorised as an overwhelmingly strong one. I am unable to conclude that Yeo has not lost a real chance of acquittal by reason of the defective summing-up, see BRS v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 275. The appellant has simply not been tried according to law. This is accordingly not a case in which the proviso to s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should be applied. 
     56    On this ground the appeal of Yeo should be upheld, the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered. 
     57    Given my conclusion on this ground it is unnecessary to consider the remaining ground in Yeo’s appeal of the jury verdict being unreasonable. Since there will be a retrial, it is preferable to make no further comment. Indeed, the retrial must be different given the acquittal of Galea on the charge of murder and perhaps for other reasons associated with how the Crown may decide to present its case. 
      
       
      The appeal of Galea 
       
     58    As enumerated earlier, the appellant Galea relies on a number of grounds of appeal. Because, as I will shortly explain, I have concluded that the appeal should be upheld on grounds 1, 1A and 7, the remaining grounds have not been addressed. Since a new trial will be required, the way in which the Crown runs its case may change and discussion of these grounds may be of no utility. 
      
       
      Ground 1 - ruling on cross-examination if character raised 
       
     59    Relatively early in the trial counsel for Galea sought a ruling as to whether the Crown would be permitted to cross-examine on certain material should his client raise good character. The material included entries in a diary belonging to Yeo asserting assaults by Galea and the evidence of Mr Wood concerning the vandalising of his car on the night of 31 May - 1 June 1997. 
     60    The diary was not in evidence and the Crown conceded that it could not establish the assaults unless either Galea or Yeo gave evidence of them. That is, if Galea admitted them or if Yeo did the same, or asserted that her diary entries were true. 
     61    In the submission made on behalf of Galea it was said that neither the Crown or the court had any way of knowing what might occur. On 18 November 1999 his Honour ruled that he would allow cross-examination on these topics but not on others. At that time his Honour did not look at the diary entries. No consideration was given to s192 of the Evidence Act. 
     62    Subsequently, and over objection, Mr Wood was permitted to give evidence that his tyres had been slashed and windscreen damaged. This is the subject of ground 1A discussed below, which argues that his evidence should not have been admitted. 
     63    Immediately prior to Galea giving evidence on 8 December 1999, counsel sought a further ruling on whether cross-examination would be allowed on Yeo’s diaries. The trial judge looked at the diaries and confirmed his earlier view that the Crown would be permitted to cross-examine Galea on the material emerging from the entries. Again, no mention was made of s192, although reference was made by his Honour to s137 of the Act. Galea was called to give evidence and his counsel determined not to raise good character. 
     64    Acknowledging that no reference was made by Grove J to s192, the Crown nonetheless submits that there is considerable overlap between it and s137, see for example s192(2)(b) (c) and (d).  
     65    Section 192 provides as follows: 
      
       
        
        (1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account: 
        
       
       
        
          
        (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add  
         
          
           unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
          
        (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or  
         
          
           to a witness, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
          
        (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the  
         
          
           leave, permission or direction is sought, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
          
        (d) the nature of the proceeding, and 
        
       
       
        
          
        (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or  
         
          
           to make another order or to give a direction in relation  
           
           to the evidence. 
          
         
        
       
     66    On 8 February 2001 the High Court published the decision of Stanoevski v R (2001) 177 ALR 285. In this case, the appellant was charged with conspiracy to cheat and defraud an insurance company. Counsel informed the trial judge that he would be leading evidence of good character. The prosecutor foreshadowed that he would rely on a report of an investigation by the Law Society alleging a forgery of a client’s signature by the appellant. The judge ruled that if the defence adduced evidence of good character, cross-examination would be permitted on the report. Section 192(2) of the Evidence Act was not considered in the ruling. Leave was needed to cross-examine under s112 of the Act. The appellant was cross-examined on the report and subsequently convicted. 
     67    The joint judgment of Gaudron, Kirby and Callinan JJ (at para 93) held that the cross-examination raised a very grave possibility of unfairness within the meaning of s192(2)(b). The trial judge fell into error in not taking into account matters of the kind to which s192(2) provided. In separate judgments, McHugh J and Hayne J came to the same conclusion. 
     68    The joint judgment concluded (at para 47): 
      
       
        
        It follows that matters of the kind which s 192(2) provides should be considered were of relevance to this case and to the trial judge’s decision to permit the prosecutor to cross-examine as he did. In not taking properly these, and matters of weight and relevance into account, and in not therefore exercising his discretion in accordance with s 192 of the Act, the trial judge fell into error. 
        
       
     69    McHugh J said (at para 55): 
      
       
        
        Section 192 of the Act directed the judge to have regard to certain matters in determining whether leave to cross-examine should be granted. However, his Honour, over the objection of the appellant’s counsel, gave leave without considering these matters - indeed without being referred to them. Because that is so, the appellant was cross-examined in breach of the Act. Her trial was flawed by a “wrong decision of any question of law” 
          
        within the meaning of s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Her conviction cannot stand unless the prosecution can establish that her conviction has not resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
     70    Reverting to the subject trial, what is plain is that the diary could not be put before the jury. Yeo was not a compellable witness against Galea and it was a matter of speculation as to whether she would give evidence. The Crown had no means of knowing whether the details in Yeo’s diary were true. Indeed, it was the Crown case that she was not to be believed. If the Crown had, pursuant to leave, been able to cross-examine Galea, the likely situation would be that highly prejudicial allegations of assault would be put to and most likely denied by Galea. The jury would hear these allegations (from the prosecutor’s questions) and assume that they came from somewhere. The diary entries, however, could not be put before the jury. 
     71    The application to cross-examine required the leave of the court under s112 of the Act. Stanoevski makes it plain that, on such an application, the relevance of s192(2) must be considered. It is submitted by the Crown that his Honour’s reference to s137 of the Act was a sufficient consideration. 
     72    I am unable to accept this submission, especially in light of Stanoevski. While there will likely be an overlap between considerations arising under s137 and some of the sub-paras of 192(2), it is clear that s192 involves a broader discretion and wider range of issues than arises under s137. 
     73    It appears that his Honour did not consider the fundamental issues raised by the application for leave to cross-examine and the relevance of s192(2) to such an application. Consideration had to be given to the relevant sub-paras of s192(2). Such consideration as was given to s137 did not extend sufficiently to all the relevant criteria in s192(2). The discretion required to be exercised miscarried or was not properly exercised. As a result, Galea could not adduce evidence of good character. This was a miscarriage of justice and one which ought not attract the application of the proviso. It cannot be said that the appellant Galea did not, as a result of the error, lose a real chance of acquittal. 
      
       
      Ground 1A - the evidence of Mr Glen Wood 
       
     74    The evidence of Mr Glen Wood was admitted over objection and against Galea only. It is the submission of Mr Game SC on behalf of the appellant Galea, that it was a matter of speculation only that Galea had damaged Mr Wood’s vehicle. Even if the evidence was relevantly probative, it could only have been admissible as propensity evidence which demonstrated a tendency for Galea to behave in a violent manner towards the deceased. As such, it did not overcome the requirements of ss97 and 101 of the Evidence Act.  
     75    The damage to Mr Wood’s car took place over the night of 31 May to 1 June. There was no direct evidence that Galea was at the block of units during the time when the car was vandalised. Galea denied in evidence that he was there that night. It was the Crown contention that Galea was responsible for the damage to Mr Wood’s car because, and I quote from its written submissions: 
     · his very recent break up with Ms Yeo; 
     · that this break up was in a different category to her previous dallying - she said she was in love, moved out and set up a new home; 
     · his knowledge as to where they were to live; 
     · that he lied about not being present on either the morning of Saturday 31 May or Sunday 1 June - thus his denials re attending at other times were significantly discredited; 
     · if he was present on the morning of 1 June he had opportunity; 
     · the logic of an understandable mistake, by someone not familiar with the parking arrangement, of associating parking bay 17 with Unit 17; 
     · the ease of assuming at night that a late model (as it was in 1997) maroon Toyota Camry could fall within the general category a red Japanese sports car (and perhaps allowing for some exaggeration from the appellant Yeo); 
     · the lack of evidence of any person with a motive to slash Mr. Wood’s tyres - not just vandalism as no other car was damaged; and 
     · that the appellant Galea was inferentially one of the few people who knew that the deceased and Yeo had just moved into Unit 17. 
     76    The Crown submits that once the jury had reached the conclusion that Galea vandalised Wood’s car, they were entitled to use the incident as evidence of Galea’s anger towards the deceased, the man who had effectively stolen his de facto wife. This anger was put forward as relevant to motive and to the charges against Galea. 
     77    According to Mr Ellis, who appeared on behalf of the Crown at the appeal but not at trial, it was put to the jury by the Crown that, on the basis that Galea was responsible for the vandalism, thinking that it was the vehicle of the deceased, it indicated an example of his anger at what had happened between Yeo and the deceased. The Crown address was not transcribed so it is impossible for this court to know precisely how the matter was put to the jury. 
     78    In my opinion, the evidence of Mr Wood should never have been admitted. It never rose above mere speculation. There was no evidence to connect Galea with the vandalising of the vehicle. Wood’s evidence had no probative value against Galea. Even if it did, it could only have been admitted as tendency evidence. In that event, it is extremely difficult to see how it would have been admitted under ss97 and 101 of the Evidence Act. The evidence was not relevant to the motive of the appellant Galea. 
     79    In my view, the receipt of the evidence of Mr Wood and the Crown’s reliance on it in its address, had the capacity to divert the jury and was potentially highly prejudicial to Galea. This ground of appeal should be upheld. 
      
       
      Ground 7 - failure to adequately direct jury concerning use to which certain material might be put 
       
     80    This concerns the use to be made by the jury of Exs GGG3 and 4, being particular tapes of listening devices known as DAT 3 and 4. 
     81    The Crown had alleged that the recordings revealed conniving or coaching by Galea to mislead the police and the jury. 
     82    The Crown cross-examined Galea on the issue of coaching, suggesting in effect that he and Yeo had put their heads together, and that there was conniving and cramming for the purpose of giving a dishonest account to the jury. It was never very clear on what basis the cross-examination proceeded and what use might be made of the material. If it was to go to the credibility of Mr Galea, as is now submitted by the Crown in its written submissions, then Mr Game submits that the jury should have been so directed. 
     83    If on the other hand, it was relied on as evidence of consciousness of guilt, then the jury should have been given appropriate directions. No direction was given to the jury on either of these bases but his Honour did direct the jury as follows: 
      
       
        
        … I don’t propose to repeat the Crown’s submissions to you about what he described as coaching and about what he described as, in effect, pretences for the benefit of those known or suspected to be listening. By the same token, I remind you that the accused bear no onus of proving anything in this trial, and it was submitted to you on their behalf that you will find from the material captured in the listening device tapes that not only is there nothing to inculpate either of them, but in fact it is demonstrative of their innocence. The Crown invites you to look at this material and says it is available to you as part of all the circumstances which, it claims, when added together will bring you to a finding that there is no reasonable conclusion available from the evidence other than the guilt of each accused.  
        
       
     84    However, as mentioned earlier, the Crown address was not recorded and therefore we do not know with any precision what the Crown put to the jury. Was it said that there was a pretence about the listening device because of a consciousness of guilt (not contended for by the Crown on appeal) or was it confined to lies, or even credibility? Judging by what his Honour said in the summing-up, set forth above, it does not seem to be have been on the basis of credit. In either event, lies or consciousness of guilt, the question arises as to whether his Honour should have given a direction in accordance with Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193. 
     85    In the majority judgment of Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ it was said at 211: 
      
       
        
        … And the jury should be instructed that they may take the lie into account only if they are satisfied, having regard to those circumstances and events, that it reveals a knowledge of the offence or some aspect of it and that it was told because the accused knew that the truth of the matter about which he lied would implicate him in the offence, or, as was said in  
        Reg. v. Lucas  
        ( 
        Ruth 
        ) [1981] QB 720, because of “a realization of guilt and a fear of the truth”. 
        
       
       
        
        Moreover, the jury should be instructed that there may be reasons for the telling of a lie apart from the realization of guilt. A lie may be told out of panic, to escape an unjust accusation, to protect some other person or to avoid a consequence extraneous to the offence. The jury should be told that, if they accept that a reason of that kind is the explanation for the lie, they cannot regard it as an admission. It should be recognized that there is a risk that, if the jury are invited to consider a lie told by an accused, they will reason that he lied simply because he is guilty unless they are appropriately instructed with respect to these matters. 
        
       
     86    In my view, since the Crown had identified the ‘coaching’ and ‘pretence’ as a plank in its case against Galea, the jury was required to be properly instructed in terms of Edwards. They were not so instructed. 
     87    If, on the other hand, the basis was confined to credibility, which is by no means clear given what his Honour said in the summing-up referred to earlier, then consideration must be given to Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234. This is yet another High Court authority which post-dated the trial, the reasons for judgment being published on 25 May 2000. 
     88    In Zoneff an Edwards direction had been given. The majority judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ held that since the Crown did not put to the jury that there was any material capable of being regarded as a lie stemming from a consciousness of guilt, the direction should not have been given. (para 21) 
     89    Their Honours continued: 
      
       
        
        22 The trial judge was evidently concerned that, having regard to some of the cross-examination, there was a serious risk that the jury might engage in an impermissible process of reasoning in relation to the matter of lies. Unfortunately, his response was to give a direction which, as Olsson J observed, raised the topic and then left it largely up in the air. 
        
       
       
        
        23 A direction which might have appropriately been given and which would have allayed any concerns which the trial judge may have had, in this unusual case, in which the issues may not have been defined as they might have been had the prosecutor made a speech to the jury, is one in these terms: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            “You have heard a lot of questions, which attribute lies to the accused. You will make up your own mind about whether he was telling lies and if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies have in relation to the issues in the case but I give you this warning: do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something, that is evidence of guilt”. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        24 A direction in such terms may well be adaptable to other cases in which there is a risk of a misunderstanding about the significance of possible lies even though the prosecution has not suggested that the accused told certain lies because he or she knew the truth would implicate him or her in the commission of the offence. 
        
       
     90    No such direction as envisaged by para 23 in Zoneff was given by the learned trial judge. This ground of appeal should, in my opinion, be upheld. 
     91    The success of these grounds in combination, or ground 1 by itself, must lead to a retrial. Accordingly, the conviction of the appellant Galea on the charge of accessory after the fact to murder should be quashed and a new trial ordered. 
     92    WOOD CJ at CL: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Stein JA. I agree with his reasons and the orders he proposes. 
     93    STUDDERT J: I agree with Stein JA.

      Bruce Scott McWILLIAM & 2 Ors v PENTHOUSE PUBLICATIONS LTD & Ors 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
     1 The claims that were litigated in these proceedings arise out of a written Contract made in May 1979 between Penthouse Publications Ltd (PPL) and ADM Franchise Pty Ltd (ADM). Under the Contract PPL licensed to ADM intellectual property and ""know-how"" to enable ADM to publish the Australian Penthouse Magazine in Australia and New Zealand.  
     2 After what were found in the court below to have been prolonged default and continuing repudiation by ADM, PPL purported on 30 August 1982 to terminate the Contract and to exercise contractual rights to demand the handing over of books, records and work in production pursuant to cl 14 (b) of the Contract. The material consisted mainly of copy for the November 1982 issue. 
     3 On Wednesday 1 September 1982 ADM applied ex parte to the Equity Division for leave to serve short notice of a summons seeking to restrain PPL from using or disposing of the material taken on 30 August. Holland J made the summons returnable the following Monday 6 September. On 2 September 1982 PPL countered with proceedings to wind up ADM, including an application for the appointment of a provisional liquidator. On 6 September 1982 a provisional liquidator was appointed and ADM's summons was stood over generally. Some time later ADM was ordered to be wound up. The company was by then hopelessly insolvent: only some priority creditors and one secured creditor received any dividend. 
     4 Three members of the McWilliam family commenced the subject proceedings in 1988 in the Common Law Division. They asserted standing to sue based on their status as directors and shareholders of ADM and as beneficiaries, sub-beneficiaries and representatives of beneficiaries of various family trusts including the Australian Penthouse Trust of which ADM was trustee. Some of them also asserted a relevant financial interest in ADM and related companies because they had given secured guarantees with respect to various loans. These guarantees were called up following the collapse of ADM. 
     5 The parties whom the plaintiffs sued were: 
      
      (1) PPL; 
       
        
        (2) Mr Jackson, a solicitor who was a consultant to Norton Smith and Co, solicitors; 
         
        (3) the partners of Norton Smith and Co; 
         
        (4) Mr Sinclair, an inquiry agent;  
         
        (5) Mr Maitland, his employed process server; and 
         
        (6) Mr Cowell, an ADM employee who edited Australian Penthouse. 
        
       
     6 The partners of Norton Smith & Co were sued on the basis of vicarious liability for the conduct of their consultant, Mr Jackson. 
     7 The proceedings were dismissed at trial. They failed for many reasons, including lack of any evidence on key issues or against particular defendants. 
     8 At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal the appellants abandoned their case against Mr Sinclair and Mr Maitland and they confined their claim to one of conspiracy to do an unlawful act. There had been additional causes of action pleaded and fought at trial. At about 3pm on the first day of the hearing of the appeal senior counsel for the appellants also conceded that there was no case against Mr Cowell. 
     9 By reason of these changes the continuing issues bear little resemblance to the claims as pleaded. Even the substance of the conspiracy and the wrongful motive of the remaining conspirators (PPL and Mr Jackson) have been recast somewhat. Senior counsel for the appellants, who has recently come into the matter, has striven to maintain the claim within the limits of the evidence and that which is properly arguable having regard to his professional responsibilities. 
     10 The only cause of action that is still pressed is conspiracy. It was pleaded in the further amended statement of claim as follows: 
      
       
        
         21. Before and during August 1982 the defendants conspired to and did engage in certain unlawful conduct with the predominant purpose of and with the inevitable consequence of causing injury to the plaintiffs. 
        
       
       
       
      That pleading contains 12 particulars of overt acts.  
       
     11 The alleged conspiracy in the form in which it is still pressed is said to have been an agreement between PPL and Mr Jackson. It was an agreement to commit an unlawful act with intention to injure the plaintiffs where the unlawful act was carried out and the intention was achieved, thereby causing pecuniary loss to the plaintiffs. 
     12 An agreement to do an unlawful act, such as a tort or breach of contract, will be an actionable conspiracy if carried into effect and causative of damage. It is no defence that the agreement was for the primary or predominant purpose of furthering or protecting the defendants' own legitimate interests if the plaintiff proves that each defendant in such a conspiracy acted with intent to injure the plaintiff. These propositions are taken from Lonrho plc v Fayed [1992] 1 AC 448. Legal commentators agree that this brought English law into line with that in Australia (see eg Fleming, The Law of Torts 9th ed p777. See also Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd v Australian Federation of Air Pilots [1991] 1 VR 637). I do not understand anything established in Williams v Hursey (1959) 103 CLR 30 to be to the contrary of these propositions. 
     13 These principles emphasise that a plaintiff in a case such as the present must establish intent to injure the plaintiff. It is not enough to establish that the acts of the conspirators necessarily involved injury to the plaintiff or that the plaintiff was a person reasonably within the contemplation of the conspirators as a person likely to suffer damage (see also Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch [1942] AC 435 at 444-5. McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd (1999) 165 ALR 409 at 437-9). 
     14 The unlawful act said to be the subject of the agreement between PPL and Mr Jackson was the taking of ADM's goods on 30 August 1982 in circumstances constituting conversion. The removal was said to be unauthorised and therefore conversion because the notice pursuant to which it occurred which purported to terminate the Contract was invalid for various reasons based on the law of contract. 
     15 Implicit in this formulation is acceptance by the appellants that it must be shown that the two actors agreed to procure the seizure of ADM's goods knowing that they lacked a contractually based claim of right to do so, or at least reckless as to the same. Anything less would not constitute an agreement to do an unlawful act. Were it otherwise, joint contractors who honestly but wrongfully terminated a contract would be exposed automatically to a claim for conspiracy. 
     16 There was no direct evidence of any conspiracy. Rather, the plaintiffs at trial relied upon various overt acts as particularised in par 21 and the inferences to be drawn from those matters which they proved. The remaining appellants take the same approach against the remaining respondents, although the rolling maul that represents what is left of the conspiracy allegation has fewer participants and lesser content than that contended for at trial.  
     17 None of the defendants gave evidence at trial, so Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 was and is called in aid. Of course, the reasoning process sanctioned in that case will not assist if there is an evidentiary gap. Furthermore, defendants charged with the serious misconduct involved in a conspiracy are entitled to insist upon firm scrutiny of the evidence in light of the gravity of the matters alleged (see Evidence Act 1995, s140(2)(c)). 
     18 The pleader recognised that the interests and rights of the three Messieurs McWilliam and that of ADM were not coincident. As indicated, it was pleaded that the defendants acted with the purpose of damaging the plaintiffs. As now pressed, the case is said to be one where the plaintiffs proved that PPL and Mr Jackson intended, on 30 August 1982, to injure the plaintiffs. In various ways conduct directed against ADM and intention to injure ADM were said to be conduct or intention directed at the three shareholder directors (see Red 17, 116). 
     19 Damage is the gist of the cause of action. At trial the plaintiffs contended that the defendants' conduct was the effective cause of the collapse of ADM and the loss thereby stemming to its shareholders, the beneficiaries and sub-beneficiaries of its family trusts and the guarantors of its loans. At that stage the claims against the defendants extended to claims of abuse of legal process and they included focus on the events of early September 1982 culminating in the appointment of the provisional liquidator. As the claim is now pressed on appeal 30 August 1982 is the critical date, although later events might cast useful light. This shift of focus on appeal is reflected in a shift as regards proof of damages: the appellants now contend for damages based upon loss of a chance to earn profits, have loans repaid etc which chance was in existence prior to the liquidation of ADM and independent of it. 
     20 I have already indicated that the plaintiffs failed comprehensively at trial. ADM was found to be in substantial and longstanding breach of the Contract and to have repudiated its obligations under the same; the Contract was held to have been duly terminated on 30 August 1982, prior to the taking of the goods; the claims of conversion and other unlawful conduct that underpinned the conspiracy allegations were rejected; nothing in the matrix of facts led to the inference of an agreement to do any unlawful act; there was found to be no causal link between the conduct complained of and the demise of ADM. And one of the defendants (PPL) was held entitled to the benefit of a release by deed. 
     21 Many of these conclusions turned in significant part upon the trial judge's unfavourable assessment of the credibility of witnesses called for the plaintiffs. This presents well known difficulties to the appellants, who are the two McWilliam brothers. (The third plaintiff, their father, died between judgment below and the institution of the appeal. He was initially named as an appellant, but the Court was informed that his name was removed by order of the Registrar some time prior to the hearing of the appeal.) 
     22 Some findings adverse to the plaintiffs were based upon lack of evidence. This Court is in as good a position as the trial judge to determine the validity of the appellants' challenge to those findings. 
     23 No notice of contention has been filed in relation to the issue whether the appellants have standing in effect to complain about wrongs which, if they occurred, were primarily suffered by ADM and, if they caused the plaintiffs loss, did so by virtue of their interest as shareholders in ADM or beneficiaries, sub-beneficiaries or actual or contingent creditors of that company (cf Gould v Vaggelas (1984) 157 CLR 215, Johnson v Gore Wood & Co [2001] 2 WLR 72). The point was noted in the judgment below (Red 136) but it was not one of the grounds on which the decision turned. I think that the point presents real difficulties for the appellants, but do not have to grapple with it as events turn out. 
     24 The appellants' challenges to the judgment can be grouped. They focus around the following six questions: 
      
       
      (1) Was the Contract varied in June 1980 or any time thereafter? 
       
      (2) Was ADM in continuous default under the Contract from January 1982 (when a demand was served) until 30 August 1982? 
       
      (3) Was PPL entitled on 30 August 1982 to treat such default as the basis of terminating the contract either by reference to cl 23 of the Contract or the doctrine of repudiation? 
       
      (4) Did the appellants establish against the two identified respondents the elements of agreement to do an unlawful act and intention to injure that are necessary to establish the claim of actionable conspiracy? 
       
      (5) Did the appellants prove damage and causation? 
       
      (6) Was the first respondent released by deed on 28 October 1982? 
       
     25 (1) Was the Contract ever varied? 
      
      The challenges to the findings of breach and repudiation as at 30 August 1982 depend largely on the appellants making good their challenge to the trial judge's rejection of their pleaded claim that the Contract was varied at various times in 1980 (Red 14-15). The alleged variations substantially reduced the licence fees payable by ADM to PPL and/or extended ""30 days terms"" to ""60 days terms"". Without proof of any such variation or some estoppel precluding reliance upon the terms of the original Contract the appellants accept that ADM was hopelessly in breach as at 30 August 1982. 
       
     26 The Contract of May 1979 was a formal document containing 33 clauses. PPL licensed to ADM certain intellectual property and know-how which, by the Contract, was acknowledged to be the property of PPL. The initial term was 5 years. 
     27 Clause 14(b) relevantly provided: 
      
       
        
        If cessation of publication by licensee of Australian Penthouse shall take effect for whatever reason the licensor or its nominees shall have a right to continue publishing and distributing Australian Penthouse and the licensee shall forthwith provide to the licensor all books documents and information necessary for that purpose including (but without limitation to) letters, mailing lists, distribution lists, articles in preparation, completed articles awaiting publication, photographs and all documents of whatever nature the licensee may be by the licensor called upon to provide…. 
         
        
       
     28 Clause 23 provided: 
      
       
        
        If either party shall fail to observe or perform any of the promises agreements or undertakings herein contained and on its part to be observed and performed and fails to remedy any breach within a reasonable time or within sixty (60) days of a notice from the other party so to do (whichever shall last occur) then the party that has given such notice may on the expiry unremedied give further written notice declaring that this agreement is terminated forthwith or on such future date as it may designate. Any termination of this agreement shall be without prejudice to the rights of any party against the other hereunder which may have accrued up to the date of termination. 
         
        
       
     29 Clause 25a set out the formula for calculating the licence fee which was payable to PPL's account with Barclays Bank Ltd in London. Commencing with the fourth issue (which was published in early 1980), the minimum amount payable for each issue was US$150,000. The sum was due to be paid monthly within 10 days of the close of the month in which each issue went on sale (cl 26). 
     30 As recorded in the judgment below, ADM encountered problems almost from the outset. As early as September 1979 it was complaining of unexpected costs and the ""extremely harsh"" nature of the contractual terms of payment. Thereafter followed repeated attempts to negotiate revised terms in favour of ADM, usually conducted by Mr Bruce McWilliam jnr, the managing director. These were accompanied by statements that ADM's revenue stream could not support the minimum licence fee of US$150,000 stipulated as due from the fourth issue onwards. These statements are relevant to both the contract variation and the breach/repudiation issues. 
     31 By April 1980 ADM was in substantial default. No licence fees had been paid in respect of any issue except the first two. Maconachie AJ held that ADM was grossly outside the terms provided by cl 26 of the Contract and that the same position obtained in July 1980 (Red 84). 
     32 A meeting was arranged in London on 14 June 1980. Present were Mr Bruce McWilliam jnr and representatives of PPL, Mr Guccione, Mr Evans and Mr Kreditor. Mr McWilliam said in evidence that a substantial reduction in the licence fee was agreed orally then and there. Maconachie AJ did not accept this evidence in light of Mr McWilliam's poor showing under cross examination and the stream of inconsistent correspondence which followed (see Red 84-91).  
     33 I detect no error in this reasoning or in his Honour's summation at Red 117. Most of the letters from ADM were expressed in the language of proposed revision as distinct from proceeding on the basis of a done deal (see esp the exchanges of 28 July 1980 and 21 August 1980); and the responses from PPL were definitely non-committal or worse (see esp the letters or telexes of 27 March 1981, 1 April, 1981, 12 January 1981, 16 July 1982). The communications also show clearly that whatever was being discussed was subject to the execution of a formal document. No such document was ever finalised, engrossed, executed or exchanged.  
     34 The 1982 communications reveal a clear stand-off in the sense that PPL was holding back from finalising any amendment under discussion until arrears were brought into line; and ADM through Mr Bruce McWilliam jnr was holding back from paying the arrears until PPL confirmed its willingness to accept a substantial reduction in licence fees. At least that was the stance he was professing. 
     35 In January 1981 Mr McWilliam jnr met Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC in Melbourne. Again there were negotiations to vary the Contract which did not culminate in any variation, for the reasons given at Red 91-96 which I find wholly convincing. Again the adverse decision turned in part upon the judge being ""unimpressed"" with Mr McWilliam's ""unconvincing"" oral evidence. On one point the judge held that Mr McWilliam was being untruthful in his evidence (Red 95).  
     36 The submission of senior counsel for the appellants that in January 1981 Mr Robertson and Mr McWilliam were documenting a concluded agreement effected in June 1980 is wholly unconvincing given (a) the fact that Mr McWilliam's letter of 9 January 1981 (Blue 50) on which the appellants rely contains terms clearly inconsistent with what was being discussed in June 1980 and (b) the terms of Mr Kreditor's letter of 12 January 1981 (Blue 102), and (c) the evidence concerning Mr Robertson's lack of authority to conclude a contract variation (Black 136-7). 
     37 Disregarding the pleadings and the way the case was fought at trial (as reflected in the reasons of Maconachie AJ) and unsupported by any ground of appeal, the appellants sought at the hearing of the appeal to recast their case in this regard also. They submit that, if the Contract was not varied, then at least there was conduct that engaged the principles of promissory estoppel sufficient to mean that as at 30 August 1982 PPL was disentitled to treat ADM as owing money as per the original Contract; and (a big additional step) sufficient to fix both PPL and Mr Jackson with knowledge thereof adequate to mean that the two alleged conspirators were privy to an arrangement to seize ADM's goods without claim of right. 
     38 I would decline to permit this issue to be argued having regard to the history of the litigation until yesterday. A promissory estoppel case was not pleaded or raised at trial. Had it been, then the respondents would have had the opportunity to meet it by evidence, cross examination or submissions. I would add that the material before us does not establish that conditions subject to which the alleged estoppel is said to have been based were complied with and it indicates that PPL appears to have made it clear that it wished to stand by its original Contract. 
     39 Question 1 must be answered ""No"". The Contract was not varied in its essential terms relating to payment of licence fees. 
      
       
      (2) Was ADM in continuous default in 1982? 
       
     40 The answer to Question 1 is quite devastating to most of what remains in the appeal, because it leaves unchallenged and unchallengeable the primary judge's conclusion that by April 1980 ""ADM was grossly outside the terms provided by clause 26 of the agreement. The same position obtained in July 1980"" (Red 84). Events of 1981 demonstrated ""continued delinquency in paying licence fees"" (Red 96). 
     41 Picking up the history from that starting point, one observes that on 2 December 1981 Mr McWilliam jnr telexed PPL's Mr Evans in New York (Blue 1495). He told him that cash flow problems would delay the licence fee for the September 1981 issue, which he said would ""normally"" have been sent on 1 December 1981 (in fact it was due in October 1981, according to cl 26). 
     42 On 20 January 1982 Mr Evans sent a cablegram to Peter McWilliam (Blue 974). This is the document upon which the respondents rely as constituting a notice to remedy breaches as required by cl 23 of the Contract. Whatever the effect of that document, it certainly put ADM on notice that PPL was very concerned about the state of affairs and was insistent upon due and timeous performance of the Contract. 
     43 Two days later ADM remitted by telegraphic transfer to PPL $47,367.35 being licence fees for the September and October 1981 issues. This was the last money proved to have been paid by ADM before contract termination by PPL in August of that year, after several more issues had been published. 
     44 The upshot was summarised by the trial judge in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        On 22 January 1982 it seems, a phonogram was sent to Evans referring to the telegraphic transfer that day of a sum of money said to relate to the September and October 1981 issues. There was no demur in that communication to Evans’ assertion that payments were almost 120 days behind nor was there any assertion that the payments telegraphed on 22 January 1982 brought ADM within terms, whatever they might have been. The inference is unavoidable: ADM was grossly in arrears and probably almost 120 days in arrears. 
         
         
        It was submitted by Mr Hodgekiss that,  
        if the agreement as varied in London allowed 60 days terms 
        , the payment on 22 January 1982 put ADM within terms and the demand of 20 January 1982 was satisfied and its contractual effect, if any, was spent. He accepted that if the agreement required payment in accordance with clause 26, or otherwise terms were 30 days, despite the payment on 22 January 1982 ADM remained in default. As will appear, I find that ADM remained in default. 
         
         
        
       
     45 The fees from November 1981 onwards were still outstanding on 4 May 1982 when Mr McWilliam jnr wrote to Mr Evans asking for ""just a little more patience with us"" (Blue 62). Earlier in that missive Mr McWilliam said: ""The current license (sic) fees which began with Feb 81 issue will be up-to-date by June 30th. I can send only the Nov issue fee tomorrow. The Dec and January fee on 28th May and Feb and March fee on 30th June"".  
     46 Mr Evans' response on 11 May 1982 was: 
      
       
        
        I was dismayed to receive your telex of May 4. Once again, you have asked us to, in the midst of a new understanding and agreement, accept late payment. Let me repeat that until you get current, which you should have been by 30th April, we will not enter into a new contract with you. In addition, when the new contract is in effect, payment must be made promptly and if there is any delinquency, the claims against the previous agreement take effect. 
         
         
        Bruce, I cannot believe that we are still in this situation. You must put matters right immediately. It is now reaching the point where nothing you tell us can be taken seriously and I want this to stop. 
         
         
        
       
     47 Further demands and excuses were exchanged as the delinquency in timely payment of licence fees continued through June, July and August 1982. ADM's responses were repudiatory in everything except perhaps expressed motive. ADM through its managing director was saying in effect that it could not honour the existing Contract in its financial terms (see Red 99-101). Its proffered solution was renegotiation of the Contract. For example, Mr McWilliam telexed Mr Evans on 16 July 1982 as follows (Blue 986): 
      
       
        
        You no doubt realise from previous telexes that we are relying on the sale of the printing business and the sale of Palm Beach property to inject funds into the business to cover losses made in January, February, March and April this year and to also bring our license fees up to date so that we can commence with a clear slate with a new contract. However, the tight liquidity problem continues without relief which has not caused concern with out major financial supporter, Australian Guarantee Company, who are owned by the Bank of New South Wales, making the largest financial organisation in Australia. They have checked our financial affairs with regard to the deteriorating economic climate in Australia caused by world situation, high interest rates, 35 hour week, increasing wage push, inflation and much balance of payment problems. They inform us that we need to restructure our affairs if their support is to continue. They can see that it is not viable to pay back old fees via New Zealand and pay current fees as well. They wish to cite a new contract which commences without back liability. New Zealand sales revenue must come to Australia. The taxation retention must be paid with our monthly remittance. They will monitor our affairs each month. John, we must commence a new contract. We have to forget the one million plus launch and establishment losses and you need to totally waive any more license fees, even from New Zealand, up to the July 1982 issue. The new contract would commence with the August issue currently on sale. We must immediately put our house in good order and balance so that we not merely survive the difficult economic future facing this country, but also maintain the standard and success of Australian Penthouse Magazine.

        Regards,  
        
       
       
        
        Bruce. 
        
       
     48 It is convenient at this stage to address the ground of appeal related to the rejection of what became MFI 1 at the trial. It purports to be a record of total remittances by ADM to PPL up to June 1982. When tendered it was rejected (Black 219). Mr Bruce McWilliam gave evidence that it was a document produced by him after examining past telex records. One can therefore understand difficulties with the document being accepted as a business record. 
     49 Some of the figures in the document are supported by evidence in the record of evidence tendered at the trial, and this Court was taken to various documents. However, the key items which purport to show payments via Curtis New Zealand with reference to the period November 1981 to June 1982 are not otherwise established in the trial record. Somewhat at variance with Mr Bruce McWilliam’s evidence at Black 218-19 these items are now said to be based upon a document entitled Schedule of Payments Made on Behalf of ADM Franchise Pty Limited. 
     50 Evidence tendered on the voir dire in the appeal shows that that document was sent under cover of a fax from Blake Dawson Waldron, PPL’s solicitors, to Mr William Hodgekiss the plaintiff’s counsel at trial. The fax was sent on the Friday before the commencement of the trial on Monday 15 May 1998. The fax refers to a telephone conversation between Mr Hodgekiss and Mr Blackburn of counsel and simply attaches a copy of the document I have referred to. 
     51 As I understand the submission of Senior Counsel for the appellants it is only if this enclosure gets into evidence in the appeal that any basis is laid to challenge the rejection of MFI 1 or alternatively and more directly to challenge the trial judge’s findings about absence of any payments from ADM to PPL between February and August 1982.  
     52 I would reject the proffered tender of the fax of 15 May 1998 and accordingly would find no error or basis of questioning the trial judge’s decision to reject the document which was MFI 1 at trial. My reasons are that there has not been adequate explanation sufficient to indicate a miscarriage of justice as to why no forensic use was made of the document sent by PPL’s solicitors to the plaintiff’s barrister on the eve of trial.  
     53 The Court today was given differing versions of recollection by Mr Blackburn and Mr Hodgekiss. I am sure that each barrister was doing his best to remember what did pass between them in May of 1998. Had the fax of 15 May 1998 been produced before this morning then each of them perhaps might have been able to have done even better than they managed to do, but what remained was a conflict of recollection which remains unresolved. What is clear is that the plaintiffs’ barrister had the document on the eve of the trial and did not seek to tender it.  
     54 In any event the relevant information in the Blake Dawson Waldron fax or MFI 1 at trial does not really get the appellants home on the critical issue. The document does not indicate when what it described as “payments via Curtis” were in fact paid. 
     55 We were informed that Curtis is an international distributor of books and magazines and that in some way an arrangement between ADM’s representative in New Zealand concerning release of the proceeds of sale in New Zealand of Australian Penthouse were intended to be channelled back to PPL via Curtis. I am not sure whether any such evidence to that effect was given at trial but I am certainly prepared to accept it for present purposes. But it doesn’t really establish when the money got back. In particular it doesn’t establish whether it got back before 30 August, it doesn’t establish (nor does anything else we have been taken to establish) that those remittances would have put the account in credit even according to what I shall call the alleged Robertson variations. It certainly doesn’t establish that the account was ever remotely in credit according to the contract as I have found it remained. 
     56 In the end this issue concerning rejection of evidence or admission of fresh evidence in the Court of Appeal goes nowhere because of my conclusions about the variation and estoppel issues. But in any event I would refuse the necessary leave to receive fresh evidence on appeal. 
     57 The evidence at trial showed that ADM was on the ropes financially by August 1982 (see Red 102-3). Quite apart from the sorry history of default under the Contract there were judgments, unsatisfied returns of writs of execution and the winding up of companies in the group. In August 1982 an order was made for possession of the Riley Street premises from which ADM operated. The later investigations of the provisional liquidator and liquidator showed that ADM was hopelessly insolvent by September 1982 and, I would infer, for some time before that.  
     58 These matters are relevant to the issue of causation of damage but they are also pertinent to what I think can by now be described as the extraordinary claim persisted in to this day that PPL and Mr Jackson were motivated by intent to harm ADM and through it the plaintiffs. Everything points to their motive being protecting PPL’S legitimate commercial interests. Nothing in the evidence suggests the contrary. 
     59 For the moment it is sufficient to give my answer to the second question I posed: ADM remained in default under its contract throughout 1982.  
      
       
      (3) Was PPL entitled to terminate on 30 August 1982? 
       
     60 The nature and extent of that default and the intimations and the telex of 16 July 1982 justified the trial judge’s conclusion that PPL was entitled to treat ADM as guilty of repudiation of its obligations as at 30 August without the need of recourse to the express contractual remedy under clause 23. As at August 1982 there had been no payment of licence fees since a fee in respect of the October 1981 issue.  
     61 His Honour said this: 
      
       
        
        In my opinion, almost from the inception of the contract, ADM had conducted itself in such a way as to show that it intended to fulfil the contract only in a manner substantially inconsistent with its obligations and not in any other way. 
         
         
        Its chronic tardiness in paying, and as at mid 1982, its failure to have paid any fee beyond the October 1981 issue, particularly in the circumstances of the continuous complaints from PPL, demonstrates to my mind the requisite intention. 
         
         
        If more were needed, and I do not think it was, the telex of 16 July 1982 demonstrates the matter beyond argument. 
         
         
        Indeed, that telex indicates, I think, that ADM could not, and would not, honour its obligations under the 1979 licence agreement. 
         
         
        I think it was shown by the evidence as a whole, and by the telex of 16 July 1982, that, in July 1982, ADM no longer intended to be bound by the 1979 licence agreement or intended to fulfil the contract only in a manner inconsistent with it, and not otherwise. 
         
         
        See  
        Shevill v Builders Licensing Board 
         (1982) 149 CLR 620 at 625,  
        Laurinda Pty Limited v Capalaba Park Shopping Centre Pty Limited  
        (1989) 63 ALJR 372 at 376. 
         
         
        Gross and protracted delay can be such as to demonstrate that a party must have repudiated the contract even when stipulations as to time have not been made of the essence (see Barwick CJ and Jacobs J obiter in  
        Neeta (Epping) Pty Limited v Phillips  
        (1974) 131 CLR 286 at 302). The facts of this case, detailed above, in my view constitute such delay. 
         
         
        In my opinion PPL was entitled to rely on repudiatory conduct by ADM in its 30 August 1982 notice. The submission by the plaintiffs to the effect that clause 23 provided an exclusive mechanism for termination is not made out by the clause itself, other clauses of the contract dealing with termination in other circumstances, nor by the decisions in  
        Laurinda 
         and  
        Neeta. 
        
       
       
        
       
     62 I agree.  
     63 In my view it is unnecessary to resolve the alternative ground for determination based upon a clause 23 notice. At trial the plaintiffs argued that the telex of 20 January 1982 did not satisfy the formal requirements of clause 23 because it did not specify the sum demanded or the consequences of non-compliance. The submission is repeated in ground two of the notice of appeal. No written submissions were offered in support of this ground but the point was developed orally by senior counsel. As presently advised I would be inclined to agree with the trial judge’s reasons for rejecting the point (see Red 118-121). However, my conclusions on the alternative repudiation issue are sufficient to dispose of this point. 
     64 My question (3) should be answered: On 30 August 1982 PPL was entitled to terminate the contract as it purported to do by notice and conduct.  
      
       
      (4) Did the appellants establish agreement to do an unlawful act and intention to injure? 
       
     65 The appellants accept that if this was the case then there was no conversion of goods on 30 August 1982. Having regard to the absence of any direct evidence of conspiratorial intent it must also follow a fortiori that there was no agreement to commit such an unlawful act between the alleged conspirators. 
     66 As the claim was pleaded and fought at trial the issues about the terms of the contract, breach, termination and seizure of goods were all in a sense preludes to the main game. The case was not a claim by ADM for conversion of goods, breach of contract or any other wrong. ADM was in liquidation. For reasons of necessity or convenience the plaintiffs sued for wrongs which they said were done to them personally. 
     67 As to proof of conspiracy referable to the remaining defendants at risk Maconachie AJ said this: 
      
       
        
        I cannot recognise any matrix of facts (even in the circumstances of witnesses not being called that one might expect would have something to offer) which enables me to draw any inferences about an agreement that might have been entered into between any of the defendants, except for the conventional relationship of solicitor and client and, perhaps, an engagement of Mr Sinclair to serve a notice and recover some goods. I think I can also infer that the solicitor/client agreement was successfully carried into effect, to some extent at least, and find that Mr Maitland, on Mr Sinclair’s instructions, served a notice on 30 August 1982 at Alexandria but the evidence does not permit me to go any further than that. 
        
       
       
     68 I agree. 
     69 The appellants maintain their claim of proven conspiracy. They rely on the notice of 30 August 1982, pointing out that it was signed by Mr Jackson. At its highest this infers no more than that Mr Jackson organised for the process servers to serve the notices and take possession of the goods.  
     70 The appellants further submit that the overt acts alleged in paragraph 21 of the further amended statement of claim were established by uncontradicted evidence led at trial. In truth the appellants did not prove all of the alleged overt acts, and such as were proved fell way short of what was necessary to establish the serious tort alleged. It bears repeating that the allegations need to be viewed against the background of matters established in the respondents’ favour by findings already adverted to. In particular ADM was in significant, longstanding and repudiatory breach, the Contract was brought to an end by notice on 30 August 1982, a large amount of money was owing to PPL, and ADM was in fact insolvent and tottering on the brink of liquidation. 
     71 My fourth question asks whether the appellants established against the two identified respondents the elements of agreement to do an unlawful act and intention to injure that are necessary to establish the claim of actionable conspiracy. The answer is clearly no. Here there was simply no evidence of a combination between the solicitor and his client for the purpose of achieving a breach of contract or conversion of ADM’s goods without claim of right. In fact PPL was within its rights as I have indicated. Nothing in the material shown to have been known to PPL and Mr Jackson as at 30 August 1982 suggests any basis for them having any belief other than a belief as to the entitlement of PPL to terminate the contract and to put in train the steps for protecting PPL’s ongoing rights in accordance with clause 14(b). A fortiori, there was not a scrap of evidence of the requisite intention to injure ADM let alone the appellants.  
     72 In my view it is unnecessary to consider the remaining issues of damage, causation or release by deed.  
     73 In my view the appeal should be dismissed with costs. 
     74 HANDLEY JA: I agree. 
     75 HODGSON JA:  I agree with the presiding judge and with his reasons. I would just add a little more on the document MFI 1.  
     76 The primary judge’s rejection of MFI 1 was plainly correct on the material before him. The challenge before us was essentially on the basis that it should not have been objected to, because it was not seriously in dispute; and that in turn depended upon a contention that the communication from Blake Dawson Waldron, referred to by the presiding judge, amounted to an admission. The communication was in such terms that an admission might possibly have been inferred, in the absence of any knowledge of circumstances; but it was common ground before us that this communication was prepared in the course of efforts to reach agreement as to what payments had been made, and that such agreement was not finally reached. In those circumstances, it would not be possible to regard this document as an admission; in the absence of further evidence about it; and no such further evidence was presented to us. 
     77 I also agree with the presiding judge that the admission of this document would make no difference to the result, quite apart from the presiding judge’s view on the questions of variation and estoppel, with which I agree. The document does not establish dates on which the alleged payments from New Zealand were made. There are indications that the payments were in fact made very much later than the months to which they are attributed: in particular, there is in evidence a communication dated 4 May 1982 from Bruce McWilliam, acknowledging that even at that time payment from New Zealand concerning the issues of June to August 1981 had not yet been made. 
     78 So for those reasons, in addition to those given by the presiding judge, I agree with the result. 
     79 MASON P: The appeal is dismissed with costs.

      FAIRFIELD CITY COUNCIL V PAUL DALLAS COUPE, ALLEN RICHARD MAHER t/as A R MAHER SERVICES & MARTINE LOUISE MAHER t/as A R MAHER SERVICES 
     Facts:The first respondent (“the worker”) was injured when repairing a wet deck at an indoor swimming pool owned and operated by the appellant (“the Council”), at the time of the injury the worker was employed by the second and third respondents (“the employer”) as a pool lifeguard. The worker brought an action in negligence against the Council and his employer. The Council cross-claimed against the employer seeking, among other things, an indemnity against the worker’s claim or alternatively contribution to damages under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965. The trial judge found that the Council had breached its duty of care to the worker and was liable for his injuries. He further held that the employer had not breached its non-delegable duty of care to the worker as the work done repairing the wet deck was outside the scope of the worker’s employment. The Council appealed these findings on the grounds that the trial judge erred in finding that the repair of the wet deck was outside the worker’s employment and that the contractual indemnity did not cover the worker’s claim. HELD(i) Per Ipp AJA, Heydon JA and Rolfe AJA agreeingIn relation to the scope of the workers employment the worker was employed as a pool lifeguard to carry out duties such as “pool monitoring and surveillance”, “first aid treatment”, “maintenance of premises”, “lane ropes” “pool covers”, “safety”, etc. These duties included minor cleaning duties. The worker was also under the specific instructions of Mr Shields, the Council’s operations manager for the pool where the injury occurred. It was Mr Shields who instructed the worker to carry out the repair work that resulted in his injury. Despite the fact that repair work was not part of his duties as a lifeguard it still feel within the scope of his employment. This was because he was working under the instruction of Mr Shields, who had an agreement with the employer that required the worker and other employees to carry out extra duties as instructed by Mr Shields. The trial judge thus erred in this regard by finding that the repair work was outside the scope of the worker’s employment. (ii) Per Ipp AJA, Heydon JA and Rolfe AJA agreeingAs the repair work was within the scope of the worker’s employment the employer remained liable for his safety under a non-delegable duty of care in regards to tasks carried out by employees. In the circumstances of the case it was reasonably foreseeable to the employer that Mr Shields may instruct the worker to carry out the repair work in question and steps could have been taken to avoid the risk of injury. Thus the employer was in breach of its duty of care to the worker. As a result of the joint liability for the worker’s injury the employer is liable to contribute to the Council in the payment of the worker’s damages. The apportionment of damages should reflect the degree of fault between the Council and the employer, the Council being liable for the greater part it is to pay 75% of the damages and the employer 25%. (Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 applied,s 5(2) Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 applied, Fennell v Supervision and Engineering Services Holdings Pty Limited  (1988) 47 SASR 6 distinguished)(iii) Per Ipp AJAThe contractual indemnity did not extend to protect the Council against claims arising out of the type of repair work done by the worker as the indemnity only covered tasks that were “reasonable necessary to obviate risk of injury”. Such tasks included those duties normally carried out as part of the worker’s employment as a lifeguard, however there was no evidence to support the view that it was reasonably necessary for the worker to carry out the repairs to the wet deck in order to obviate the risk of injury. Therefore the Council failed to establish the requisite elements to enable it to rely upon the contractual indemnity. (iv) Per Heydon JA with Rolfe AJA agreeingThe Council sought to rely on the contractual indemnity on appeal but did not raise the issue at trial. The argument gave rise to factual issues on appeal which the respondents had not had the opportunity to call evidence in relation to at the trial. Therefore it was not open to the Council to rely on this new argument on appeal.(Suttor v Gundowda Pty Limited (1950) 81 CLR 418 applied)Legislation:Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946Cases Cited:Suttor v Gundowda Pty Limited (1950) 81 CLR 418Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 Fennell v Supervision and Engineering Services Holdings Pty Limited (1988) 47 SASR 6Australian Paper Plantations Pty Limited v J & E M Venturoni [2000] VSCA 71ORDERS(1) Appeal upheld.(2) Orders made by Delaney DCJ as to liability be set aside.(3) Verdict in favour of the 1st respondent against both the appellant and the 2nd and 3rd respondents.(4) Liability for the 1st respondent’s damages be apportioned as between the appellant and the 2nd and 3rd respondents on a 75/25 basis, with the appellant bearing the greater degree of responsibility.(5) The appellant and the 2nd and 3rd respondents to pay the 1st respondent’s costs of the trial.(6) The 2nd and 3rd respondents pay the appellant’s costs of the appeal and the 2nd and 3rd respondents be eligible for a Suitor’s Fund Certificate.(7) The appellant to pay the 1st respondent’s costs of the appeal.(8) Parties to bring in short minutes reflecting all orders to be made.

      JUDGMENT 
     1    HEYDON JA: 2    I agree with the orders proposed by Ipp AJA and with [4]-[49] and [57]-[70] of his reasons. 
      
       
     3    The reliance on clause 15(2) by the Council on appeal but not at trial, discussed by Ipp AJA in [50]-[56], raised factual issues. There was a possibility that the employer could have called evidence at the trial to defeat the Council’s clause 15(2) argument. That means that it is not open to the Council to rely on that argument on appeal: Suttor v Gundowda Pty Ltd (1950) 81 CLR 418.  4    IPP AJA:  
      
       
        
       The worker’s claim against the employer and the Council: the findings of the trial judge 
        
        
       
     5    On 21 June 1997 the first respondent (“the worker”) sustained a severe injury to his right hand when he was repairing a “wet deck” at an indoor swimming pool in Fairfield. The swimming pool was part of a “leisure centre”, owned and operated by the appellant (“the Council”). 
      
       
     6    At the time of his injury, the worker was employed by the second and third respondents (to whom I shall collectively refer as “the employer”). 
      
       
     7    The worker brought an action in the District Court against the Council and the employer, alleging that each was liable in negligence for the damages he had suffered in consequence of the injury to his hand.  
      
       
     8    The Council cross claimed against the employer on various bases. Two are relevant to this appeal. Firstly, the Council asserted that, by a contract entered into on 3 February 1996 between it and the employer, the employer agreed to indemnify it against claims of the kind brought by the worker. Accordingly, the Council contended, the employer was obliged to indemnify it against the worker’s claim. Secondly, and in the alternative, the Council claimed under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965 such contribution from the employer, in respect of damage suffered by the worker, as might be found to be just and equitable. 
      
       
     9    Delaney DCJ found that the Council, as occupier of the Leisure Centre, owed the worker a duty of care which it had breached. His Honour held that the Council was liable to the worker for the damages which he had sustained. He assessed damages in a sum that is not apparent from the papers before this Court and delivered a verdict in favour of the worker against the Council.  
      
       
     10    Delaney DCJ accepted that the employer owed the worker a non-delegable duty of care. His Honour, however, found that the worker’s act in repairing the wet deck was outside the terms of his employment with the employer. Hence, although the employer was obliged to provide the worker with a safe system of work, that duty did not extend to the repairing of the wet deck. Accordingly, he held that the employer had not breached its duty of care and dismissed the worker’s claim against it. 
      
       
     11    Delaney DCJ found that, by its terms, the indemnity did not cover the claim against the Council. Accordingly, the cross claim for an indemnity was dismissed.  
      
       
     12    As his Honour found that the employer had not breached its duty of care to the worker, the claim for a contribution was also dismissed. 
      
       
     13    On appeal, the Council contended that his Honour had erred in deciding that the worker’s act in repairing the wet deck fell outside the scope of his employment with the employer. This question is of fundamental importance as, should it be answered in the negative, the basis of the finding that the employer was not negligent falls away. It is the first question to be determined in the appeal.  
      
       
        
       The scope of the worker’s employment 
        
       
     14    As mentioned, on 3 February 1996 the Council entered into a contract with the employer. By that contract, the employer undertook to perform certain specified functions described as “pool services” at various places including the leisure centre at Fairfield. 
      
       
     15    The functions to be performed by the employer under the contract were referred to in schedule 3 to the contract as “pool services” and were described in greater detail under various headings. These headings were “pool monitoring and surveillance”, “first aid treatment”, “maintenance of premises”, “lane ropes”, “pool covers”, “safety”, “evacuation of premises” and “safe handling of needles and syringes”.  
      
       
     16    Most of the stipulated functions to be performed by the employer were such as would ordinarily be provided by lifeguards. Indeed, cl 34 of schedule 2 to the contract provided that all staff retained by the employer for the purposes of the contract were required to hold, as minimum qualifications, a “bronze medallion”, a “first aid certificate” and “an advanced resuscitation certificate”.  
      
       
     17    By item 4 of schedule 1 to the contract, the employer was required to ensure that not less than two “trained staff” were on duty at each of the three centres (and in particular at the Fairfield Leisure Centre). The inference is that the staff members concerned were to be trained lifeguards. In addition, at least one member of staff to be provided for work at the Fairfield Leisure Centre was to be the holder of a “pool lifeguard’s certificate”.  
      
       
     18    Prior to the entering into of the contract of 3 February 1996, the worker had been employed by the Council as a lifeguard at the Fairfield Leisure Centre. After the contract was entered into, the worker was employed by the employer to carry out similar duties. The worker described his duties as “surveillance and rescue and minor cleaning duties at the end of the day”. He said that the cleaning duties involved “hosing down the concourse and emptying bins at the end of the shift”. The duties so described are consistent with the stipulated functions set out in schedule 3 to the contract.  
      
       
     19    In 1996, after the contract was entered into, Mr Allen Richard Maher, the second respondent, who, in partnership with the third respondent, operated the business of the employer, had a telephone conversation with Mr Peter Alan Shields, the Council’s operations manager for its leisure centres’ branch. Mr Shields asked Mr Maher whether he would agree to the employer’s employees, who were working at the three leisure centres to which the contract applied, performing “some additional duties within the pool complex”. Mr Maher agreed that those employees could carry out such additional duties under the direction of Mr Shields.  
      
       
     20    According to Mr Maher, his consent to the employees performing such additional duties were subject to Mr Shields obtaining his consent beforehand. In essence, this was confirmed by Mr Shields. He said that when he asked Mr Maher whether the employer’s lifeguards could perform duties outside those “that were detailed in the contract”, Mr Maher answered, “that’s all right, as long as you inform me on those duties”. 
      
       
     21    The worker testified that he understood that the work involved in repairing the wet deck (which led to his injury) was not part of his duties as a lifeguard under the contract between the Council and the employer. He said, however, that he carried out that work because he was instructed to do so by Mr Shields. The following exchange during the course of the worker’s cross-examination is pertinent in this respect: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. May we take from what you’ve told us that you didn’t contact Mr Maher and ask him what you should do? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q, You simply followed Mr Shields’ instructions; is that correct? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Because that’s the understanding we were - as Mr Maher wasn’t in there. He was rarely ever at the pool. We were under the direct instructions of Mr Shields and Mr Shields instructed me to do the job and who was to say no? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But Mr Maher never told you that it was part of your functions to carry out repairs at the pool? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No but he’d repeatedly told us that it was our duty to do whatever Peter asked us to do.” 
         
        
        
       Later, the worker said that it was made clear by Mr Maher to the lifeguards that they were to assist the Council “in anything they asked us to do”. 
        
       
     22    Delaney DCJ held that “notwithstanding the fact that the [worker] was employed as a lifeguard, ….he also was under the direction, whether it was in accordance with the contract or not, of Mr Shields”. He found that “Mr Shields would, from time to time, request [the worker] to do various things. Not always were these matters referred back to Mr Maher for approval”. In essence, the worker was instructed by the employer to do whatever work Mr Shields asked him to do. 
      
       
     23    I have pointed out that Mr Shields accepted that, if he required some additional duty to be carried out (that is, outside the terms of the contract), he needed to seek Mr Maher’s permission before he directed the employer’s employees to perform such duties. According to the worker, however, Mr Maher had made it clear to him that he was to comply with any instructions given to him by Mr Shields and he was not informed by Mr Maher or anyone else that he was only to carry out Mr Shields’ instructions to do work outside the contract if Mr Maher had first agreed that he do so. The worker was not cross-examined on this testimony and, for the purposes of the appeal, it must be accepted. Mr Feller, counsel for the employer, did not dispute that this must be the case. 
      
       
     24    In concluding that, when the worker was injured, he was carrying out work outside the terms of the contract of 3 February 1996, Delaney DCJ did not have regard to: 
      
       
     · The employer’s agreement to the worker carrying out work at the direction of Mr Shields, even though such work might be outside the scope of the employer’s functions detailed in the contract. 
      
       
     · The employer’s omission to inform the worker that his obligation to comply with Mr Shields’ directions was subject to Mr Maher’s prior consent.  
      
       
     · The employer’s instruction to the worker to comply with Mr Shields’ directions, whatever they were. 
      
       
     25    The effect of the material so overlooked is that, in repairing the wet deck at the direction of Mr Shields, the worker was carrying out duties as an employee of the employer. With respect to Delaney DCJ, he erred in finding to the contrary.  
      
       
        
        
       The breach of the employer’s duty of care 
        
       
     26    The wet deck that the worker was repairing when he was injured was a cover for a channel constructed along the edge of the length of the indoor pool. The channel was in essence a gutter. The filter for the pool was at one end of the channel or gutter. The deck itself consisted of plastic slats and was at times referred to in the trial as a “grating”, presumably because it had the look of such an object. The deck rested on and was supported by a series of stainless steel bars which lay cross-wise across the channel. The edges of the steel bars were sharp and, hence, dangerous.  
      
       
     27    Clause 3(1)(f) of schedule 3 to the contract required the employer to “clean scum gutters and scum gutter filters daily …”. It is not clear from the evidence whether the channel, which was covered by the wet deck, was a “scum gutter”. Nevertheless, the wet deck was plainly part of the premises which, by the contract, the employer was required to clean. Whether, by the contract, the employer was required to repair the wet deck is an entirely different question with which I shall later deal. 
      
       
     28    At about 6.00 am on 21 June 1997, whilst the worker was patrolling the pool, he noticed large gaps in the plastic slats that made up the wet deck. Pieces of plastic were missing and large gaps had appeared. The worker kept his eye on the wet deck to make sure that nothing untoward happened in consequence of the gaps and, between 8.30 and 9.00 am that morning, showed them to Mr Shields and pointed out that they were dangerous.  
      
       
     29    Mr Shields instructed the worker to follow him into the plant room to get pieces of plastic to repair the pool, which the worker did. The two of them then went to the wet deck and Mr Shields pulled up a section of the plastic slats and started repairing it. The worker assisted Mr Shields in the repair but Mr Shields soon left, saying that he was going over to the other side of the channel to repair the plastic deck there. He left the worker to continue with the work that he, Mr Shields, had commenced.  
      
       
     30    After the worker had completed repairing that particular section of the wet deck, he moved to lift up the next section. As he reached under the lip of the plastic slats, he put his hand on the metal bars underneath and cut his hand, severely. 
      
       
     31    Mr Maher was aware that the wet deck rested on stainless steel cross bars. While he did not know that the steel bars were sharp, he knew that if they were not deburred they would be sharp. He did not know if they were deburred or not. As a partner of the employer, charged with taking reasonable care for the safety of its employees, he should have investigated the position. He also knew that from time to time there were problems with the plastic slats of the wet deck and it was necessary to lift them up to repair them.  
      
       
     32    In the circumstances, as far as Mr Maher was concerned, it was reasonably foreseeable in the sense of Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 that Mr Shields might ask the worker to lift up the plastic grating and thereby would incur the risk of injuring his hand. Mr Feller did not contend otherwise. 
      
       
     33    The employer in effect conceded that it had a non-delegable duty of care to provide a safe system of work as regards the tasks to be performed by the worker. There were several respects in which the employer could have complied with this duty. Gloves were available at the pool and the worker could have been instructed to wear them. The worker could have been warned of the danger constituted by the steel bars. Mr Shields could have been warned not to give the worker instructions to remove the wet deck without taking appropriate steps to guard against the risk of injury. The employer, however, failed to take any such action. In my opinion it thereby breached the duty of care it owed the worker. 
      
       
        
       Section 5(2) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 
        
       
     34    The employer sought to avoid the consequences that would ordinarily follow from its breach of the duty of care by relying on s 5(2) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946. This section provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “5(2) In any proceedings for contribution under this section the amount of the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as may be found by the court to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person’s responsibility for the damage; and the court shall have power to exempt any person from liability to make a contribution, or to direct that the contribution be recovered from any person shall amount to a complete indemnity”. 
         
        
       
     35    It was submitted on the employer’s behalf that it was “just and equitable” having regard to the extent of the Council’s responsibility for the worker’s damage that the employer should be exempted entirely from liability to contribute to the worker’s damages. The employer submitted that Fennell v Supervision and Engineering Services Holdings Pty Limited (1988) 47 SASR 6 supported its argument in this respect. 
      
       
     36    In Fennell, the first defendant had employed a storeman whose services it had hired to the second defendant. The storeman injured his back while working for the second defendant. He sued both defendants for damages for personal injury. On appeal, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia applied the South Australian equivalent of s 5(2) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act and held that it would not be just or equitable to attribute to the first defendant responsibility for the damage suffered by the storeman. On the evidence, the storeman had been hired to the second defendant and he was under its charge, “totally”. Jacobs J said at 14: 
      
       
        
         
         “No representative of [the first defendant] was present on site, and it is not shown to my satisfaction what [the first defendant] could, let alone should, have done that might have prevented the occurrence. If the [storeman] had seen fit to complain, he would have complained to [another worker] who would have complained to [his supervisors in the second defendant], and [the first defendant] is not shown to have had any coercive authority over [the second defendant]. The actual fault in my judgment was entirely the fault of [the second defendant]”. 
         
        
       
     37    In my opinion, the facts of the present case are to be distinguished from those in Fennell. The employer had not hired the services of the worker to the Council. The worker was at all times employed by the employer and not by the Council. The worker was not totally under the charge of the Council. Although no representative of the employer was present on site, Mr Maher usually visited the pool once a week, presumably to ensure that the employer’s employees were doing their work properly and also to monitor their safety. Unlike the position in Fennell, Mr Maher could have insisted that Mr Shields not require the worker to lift the plastic deck without taking appropriate precautions against the risk of injury from the sharp edges of the steel bars. There were other steps that the employer could have taken that might have prevented the occurrence. I have set these out above.  
      
       
     38    In the circumstances I do not regard it to be just and equitable to exempt the employer from liability to make a contribution to the worker’s damages. 
      
       
        
       The contractual indemnity 
        
       
     39    Clause 23 of the contract provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “The [employer] agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified, the Council against all claims for injury, loss or damage suffered to persons or property arising out of the performance by the [employer] of the Contract and against all liability for costs, charges and expenses incurred by the Council in respect of the claim of any person or body”. 
         
        
       
     40    Mr McIlwaine QC, senior counsel for the Council, submitted that by cl 23 the employer was obliged to indemnify the Council against the worker’s claim for damages.  
      
       
     41    Mr Feller, on the other hand, submitted that the worker’s claim did not arise out of the performance of the contract by the employer. He argued that the contract provided no more than the occasion for the claim brought by the worker: Australian Paper Plantations Pty Limited v J & E M Venturoni [2000] VSCA 71. 
      
       
     42    A difficulty with this aspect of the case is the cursory way in which it was treated by the parties in the pleadings. The indemnity was raised only in the Council’s cross claim that was filed shortly before the trial. Apparently, because of the lateness of the cross claim, no defence was filed. The cross claim merely recited the indemnity clause and claimed an indemnity. There was no assertion in the cross claim that the worker’s claim arose out of the performance by the employer of the contract and, as no defence was filed, the employer did not plead the contrary. 
      
       
     43    The Council’s reliance on the contractual indemnity raises the question whether the subsequent arrangement between Mr Maher and Mr Shields, whereby Mr Maher agreed that the employer’s workers could do work for the Council outside the duties specified by the contract, constituted a variation of the contract. This proposition, understandably, was not advanced with any enthusiasm by Mr McIlwaine.  
      
       
     44    There are high obstacles to its acceptance. Firstly, the arrangement between Mr Maher and Mr Shields was of a casual nature and seems to have lacked contractual intent. Secondly, cl 26 of the contract provided that the conditions of the contract “are not to be altered, waived or deleted without the written consent of the General Manager and the [employer]”. The “General Manager” was defined as the general manager of the Council or the person acting in that capacity for the time being. There was no evidence that any written consent as required by cl 26 had been obtained.  
      
       
     45    In the circumstances, there is no basis for holding that the contract was varied by the oral arrangement in question.  
      
       
     46    In any event, both Mr Maher and Mr Shields accepted that Mr Shields would only instruct the employer’s workers to perform additional duties with Mr Maher’s consent, and he did not consent to the wet deck being repaired.  
      
       
     47    Mr McIlwaine submitted further that it was implicit in the contract that the employer would supply services reasonably incidental to the stipulated pool services. He argued that the work done by the worker in repairing the wet deck was reasonably incidental to the provisions of the contract relating to the maintenance of the premises. These provisions were contained in cl 3 of schedule 3 to the contract which was in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “3. Maintenance of Premises 
         
        
        
         
         (1) The [employer] will carry out the following cleaning and maintenance work at the premises:- 
         
        
        
         
         (a) Immediately remove any loose debris or refuse in on or around the swimming pools constructed at the premises so as to maintain a visually clean and publicly acceptable standard. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) Remove any loose debris or refuse in on or around the main entrance to the premises each morning the premises are open to the public and at any other time as deemed necessary by the Director. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) Remove on a regular basis all rubbish and refuse accumulated in bins at the premises and deposit it into the central disposal unit as designated by the Director. 
         
        
        
         
         (d) Maintain the rubbish bins in a neat and tidy condition. 
         
        
        
         
         (e) Remove all grease and dirt from swimming pool tiles on a daily basis and at other times as instructed by the Director. 
         
        
        
         
         (f) Clean scum gutters and scum gutter filters daily and at any other times as instructed by the Director. 
         
        
        
         
         (g) Hose down and clean the pool concourse at the premises on a daily basis or as needed to ensure a clean and clear pool surround PROVIDED THAT this will be subject to review when restrictions are applied to water use. 
         
        
        
         
         (h) Maintain the windows of any pool hall erected at the premises including cleaning of those windows at least once per week or as needed to ensure a clear view an clarity and opening, closing and locking of those windows on a daily basis”. 
         
        
       
     48    It is clear from cl 3 that the maintenance services the employer was required to provide were confined to cleaning and maintaining the premises in a clean condition. Nothing in cl 3 related to repair. This is understandable as the substantial part of the services required to be rendered by the employer concerned lifeguard duties, hence the requirement that the workers to be allocated to the various leisure centres were to hold the lifeguard qualifications to which I have referred. The lifeguards would not ordinarily be qualified or trained to carry out repairs to the premises of the leisure centres.  
      
       
     49    The function of cleaning the premises and maintaining them in the limited sense mentioned, in essence, were adjuncts to the function of rendering lifeguard services. On the other hand, the function of carrying out repairs to the premises would be entirely independent and a significant remove from the lifeguard, cleaning and limited maintenance functions. In my view, repairing parts of the premises cannot be regarded as reasonably incidental to the stipulated functions. Accordingly, I am unable to accept the submissions advanced on behalf of the Council in this respect.  
      
       
     50    Mr McIlwaine then referred to cl 15(2) of schedule 2 to the contract which provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “Before doing any act or thing in carrying out the Contract and during the progress thereof the [employer] shall do everything reasonably necessary to obviate risk of injury and/or damage to persons and property being in, upon or in the vicinity of the premises or any adjoining land of the Council”. 
         
        
       
     51    Mr McIlwaine submitted that in repairing the wet deck the worker was performing an activity that was “reasonably necessary to obviate risk of injury and/or damage to persons … being in, upon or in the vicinity of the premises …” Hence, he argued, the injury suffered by the worker in repairing the wet deck arose out of the performance by the employer of the contract and the indemnity under cl 23 applied. 
      
       
     52    Clause 15(2) was part of schedule 2 to the contract, which was entitled “Terms, Conditions and Provisions of Contract”. Schedule 2 contained provisions of general application. On the other hand, the precise functions which, by the contract, the employer was required to perform were set out in schedule 3. Schedule 3 commenced: 
      
       
        
         
         “The [employer] will be responsible for the following functions: - 
         
        
        
         
         …” 
         
        
        
       Then followed the various functions stipulated under the different headings to which I have referred above such as “pool monitoring and surveillance”, “first aid treatment”, “maintenance of premises”, etc.  
        
       
     53    The inference to be drawn from the use of the two schedules and the wording to which I have referred is that the scope of the work to be performed by the employer was intended to be contained solely in schedule 3, whereas schedule 2 contained provisions that governed the performance of that work.  
      
       
     54    This inference is reinforced by the opening words of cl 15(2). The obligation of the employer to “do everything reasonably necessary to obviate risk of injury” was qualified by the words “before doing any act or thing in carrying out the contract and during the progress thereof”. In my view, the phrase “during the progress thereof” means “during the progress of the act or thing being done in carrying out the contract”. The other possible interpretation is that the phrase means “during the progress of the contract itself”. But if the phrase were to be given that meaning, the entire phrase “before doing any act or thing in carrying out the contract and during the progress thereof” would be otiose. In my view, therefore, the opening words of cl 15(2) limited the employer’s obligation to do everything reasonably necessary to obviate risk of injury to two situations. The first was “before doing any act or thing in carrying out the contract” (that is, preparatory to performing the functions stipulated in schedule 3). The second was “in carrying out the contract” (that is, in performing the stipulated functions). 
      
       
     55    If cl 15(2) is to be construed as I suggest, then the work done by the worker in repairing the wet deck was not work the employer was obliged by that clause to perform. The repair work did not fall within either of the two situations in question. 
      
       
     56    Even if cl 15(2) is to be construed as widening the scope of the work required to be performed by the employer, I do not think that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the Council established that the repair of the wet deck was work that came within cl 15(2). I say this for the following reasons: 
      
       
        
       (a) To make good its contention that the indemnity provided by cl 23 of schedule 2 applied, the Council had to establish that the worker suffered loss or damage arising out of the performance by the employer of the contract.  
        
        
       (b) In contending that the repair of the wet deck constituted performance by the employer of the contract, the Council argued that the repair in question was reasonably necessary to obviate risk of injury to persons in the vicinity. 
        
        
       (c) The evidence established that the gaps in the plastic strips were dangerous to persons in the vicinity and required repair. 
        
        
       (d) The worker warned Mr Shields about the gaps in the plastic strips (and I shall assume that, in so doing, he was acting pursuant to cl 15(2) by performing an act reasonably necessary to obviate risk of injury to persons in the vicinity). 
        
        
       (e) The question that then arises is whether it was reasonably necessary for the worker, himself, thereafter to repair the wet deck so as to obviate risk of injury to persons in the vicinity. 
        
        
       (f) This question has to be addressed on the assumption that, unless it was reasonably necessary to obviate risk of injury to persons in the vicinity for the worker himself to do the repair, the repair work by the worker did not fall within the contract. 
        
        
       (g) Ordinarily, it would be a pool technician’s job to repair the wet deck. The Council employed pool technicians at the Fairfield Leisure Centre, but there was no evidence as to whether, at the relevant time, the pool technicians were absent and, if they were not, whether it was reasonably necessary to use the services of the worker to repair the wet deck, rather than their services.  
        
        
       (h) The repair of the wet deck on the morning in question commenced with Mr Shields himself doing the repair work alone. It was only after a while that he instructed the worker to assist him. Later still, Mr Shields went to “the other side of the pool” to repair the wet deck there, having instructed the worker to carry on completing the repair at the point where they had commenced the work. 
        
        
       (i) There was no evidence to explain why it was reasonably necessary to obviate risk of injury to persons in the vicinity for the worker, himself, to do repair work rather than for Mr Shields, alone, to complete the repair at the one end and then to proceed to the other end. 
        
       
     57    In the circumstances, the Council simply did not establish the requisite elements to enable it to rely upon the cl 23 indemnity. I should say in this regard that it seems that the idea that cl 15(2) could provide a basis for the application of the indemnity emanated from Mr McIlwaine on appeal, he not having appeared for the Council at the trial. No reference whatever to cl 15(2) was made by Delaney DCJ and this issue does not seem to have been canvassed before him. This explains the absence of any necessary findings (and evidence) relating to the reasonable necessity of the work done by the worker.  
      
       
     58    In the circumstances, I would not uphold the Council’s claim for an indemnity. 
      
       
        
       Apportionment of damage 
        
       
     59    The Council did not challenge the finding by Delaney DCJ that it had breached the duty of care it owed the worker. In the light of the findings I have made it remains to determine the apportionment of damage between the Council and the employer.  
      
       
     60    In my opinion, the degree of fault on the part of the Council was far greater than that of the employer.  
      
       
     61    The worker was under the immediate control and direction of the Council, through Mr Shields. Mr Shields’ instruction to the worker to proceed with the repair of the wet deck was the precipitating factor in the worker’s injury. Immediately prior to giving the worker that instruction Mr Shields could have required the worker to obtain protective gloves from the store on the premises, and could have warned the worker specifically about the dangers of the steel bars. Mr Shields had the specific knowledge that the worker was about to undertake a dangerous operation but did nothing.  
      
       
     62    The negligent omission on the part of the employer was far more general and far less immediate. Mr Maher had no means of knowing that on the day in question the worker would be asked to repair and lift the wet deck. There was less reason for Mr Maher to apply his mind to the potential danger than there was for Mr Shields to do so. 
      
       
     63    In the circumstances I consider that the Council should be held to be 75% at fault and the employer 25% at fault and I would order that the damages be apportioned on this basis.  
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
     64    Although the Council initially appealed against the assessment of damages made by Delaney DCJ it did not proceed with that part of the appeal. The assessment made by his Honour therefore stands. 
      
       
     65    I propose that the appeal be upheld and the orders made by Delaney DCJ as to liability be set aside. I would grant a verdict in favour of the worker against both the Council and the employer. I would order that liability for the worker’s damages be apportioned as between the Council and the employer on a 75/25 basis, with the Council bearing the greater degree of responsibility.  
      
       
     66    No submissions were made to us as regards the orders that should be made were the Court to uphold the appeal to the extent that I propose it should. The parties suggested, in this regard, that they bring in short minutes in respect of the orders that would, in consequence follow, and such a course is appropriate. The minutes should reflect all the orders to be made. 
      
       
     67    As regards costs, I propose that the Council and the employer pay the worker’s costs of the trial. I would make no other order in respect of the costs of the trial.  
      
       
     68    I propose that the employer pay the Council’s costs of the appeal and that the employer be eligible for a Suitor’s Fund Certificate.  
      
       
     69    The Council filed substantial written submissions directed to upsetting the trial judge’s conclusion that it had breached its duty of care to the worker, and very brief written submissions attacking the quantum of damages awarded. Had the former category of submissions succeeded and had the employer succeeded in maintaining the trial judge's finding that it was not in breach of duty, the worker would have been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings. Had the latter category succeeded, he would have been partly unsuccessful. He was justified in filing two sets of written submissions and a Notice of Motion seeking leave to file a Notice of Cross Appeal. It was only shortly before the hearing commenced that counsel for the worker was informed by counsel for the Council (who came into the appeal at a late stage) that the challenge to the verdict against the Council, and to the quantum of damages would not be pursued. Counsel for the worker was present when the hearing commenced to inform the court of that fact. Thereafter he participated only briefly in the argument, but appropriately. 
      
       
     70    In the circumstances the Council should be ordered to pay the worker’s costs of the appeal. 
      
       
     71    ROLFE AJA: I agree with Heydon JA.

      REGINA v Tyler Joy WALTERS 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1    McCLELLAN J: On 22 June 2000 the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of by letter demanding money with menaces contrary s 100 of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for a term of ten years. 
      
       
     2    The offence occurred on 23 February 200. Having pleaded guilty the applicant came before his Honour Judge Coleman for sentence on 28 July 2000. On that occasion the applicant asked his Honour to take into account four other offences. The offences comprised two shop lifting matters, interference with a pay telephone and the larceny of a mobile phone. The latter offence allegedly occurred when the applicant was in custody and took a mobile phone from a police pigeon hole in the Transit Police office at Gosford railway station. The maximum penalty for each of the three offences of larceny contrary to s 117 of the Crimes Act 1900 is imprisonment for five years. 
      
       
     3    The offence of by letter demanding money with menaces occurred after the applicant was released from the Cessnock Correctional Centre on 24 January 2000. Whilst in the Correctional Centre the applicant had commenced a methadone reduction program and was still on this program when he was released. However, the program was not successful and he again lapsed into a heroin addiction and, needing money to fuel his habit, committed the offence. 
      
       
     4    His Honour found that the offence occurred with minimal planning and was committed on an impulse. He was with a friend and, after driving around the Gosford area without finding anything to steal, it was determined that they would go into a bank, hand over a note and demand money. The applicant did not reveal the name of his accomplice to the police although it is apparent that the police were aware of his identity. 
      
       
     5    The applicant entered the National Australia Bank in Erina, walked to the counter and passed over a note to a trainee teller. The note was written on a TAB ticket which read: ""Give me all the money in the drawers because you won't like what I have in my bag."" The teller said: ""Sorry?"" The applicant then said: ""All the money"", adding after a pause ""In the bag"". The applicant then took his back pack from his left shoulder, put it on the counter, unzipped it and started to put his hand into the bag. 
      
       
     6    The teller, believing the applicant was armed, realised the matter was serious and activated the safety screen. Security cameras were also activated and the applicant's image was captured on film. 
      
       
     7    Coleman DCJ concluded that the matter was a serious offence committed for the purpose of the applicant obtaining money to feed his heroin addiction. He described the impact of the offence upon the bank teller. The teller involved in the incident became confused and suffered shock. She believed the applicant had a gun and feared for her life. She was left shaking and vomited after the incident, being initially unable to give a statement to the police. 
      
       
     8    When considering matters relevant to the sentence his Honour identified the fact that the applicant cooperated with the police and admitted his guilt. Furthermore, he pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. His Honour also identified the fact that the applicant's contrition entitled him to credit. 
      
       
     9    His Honour also had regard to the fact that the applicant, being born on 21 August 1973 is now almost twenty-eight years old. He has a lengthy criminal history with a long period of poly drug abuse and relapse. There is also some evidence that the applicant has mental health problems, was uncontrollable in childhood and did not cope very well with every day life. The evidence indicates that minor issues can upset him and lead to a violent reaction. He also has some difficulties with his memory. 
      
       
     10    The judge also had regard to the record of the applicant. It is a poor one. He was first before the Children's Court in 1989 when he was sixteen where he was dealt with on several occasions and placed on probation orders. His first court appearance as an adult occurred in September 1992. He has received a full time custodial sentence of three months followed by a further custodial sentence in 1998 for a term of six months. He was again sentenced to a full custodial term of five months on 25 August 1999. It was that sentence from which he had been released shortly before the current offences took place. 
      
       
     11    His Honour had regard to the applicant's drug addiction as relevant to the applicant's background. However, he made plain that the addiction does not entitle the applicant to any leniency. He also had regard to the fact that the applicant, when in prison, was on a methadone reduction program which he had been successfully following. However, upon his release he was referred to a local drug service which was not able to assist him when it became clear that his methadone reduction program was too sudden. The clinic, for proper reason, was unable to refer him to another methadone prescriber and accordingly the methadone program broke down and the applicant returned to a dependence upon heroin. 
      
       
     12    His Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of three years with a non parole period of two years to date from the date of sentence being 28 July 2000. 
      
       
     13    The applicant, being out of time, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. Apparently the delay in the appeal is explained by the fact that he originally intended to appeal but was persuaded by his then solicitor that such a course may not be prudent. 
      
       
     14    He submits that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. It is submitted that the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant's inability to obtain methadone between 13 February 2000 and 23 March 2000 which was the period during which all but one of the offences for which he was dealt with occurred. The last offence, occurring on 5 April 2000, was within two weeks of the recommencement of the methadone program. 
      
       
     15    It is submitted that although his Honour had regard to the fact that it was reported by the Central Coast Health Service that the applicant had, since recommencing methadone maintenance, ""Stabilised to a great extent"" and had made steady progress, his Honour should have given greater weight to these matters. 
      
       
     16    Sentencing in the present circumstances was comprehensively considered by this Court in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. It was stated in that case that although drug addiction is a circumstance relevant to the sentencing exercise it is not of itself a mitigating factor. The relevant principles are contained within the judgment of Wood CJ at CL at p 397 para 273. 
      
       
     17    The submission in the present case is that the full time custodial period is in the middle of the appropriate range and the non parole period at the top. Complaint is particularly made about the non parole period which was imposed. It is submitted that the relevant statistics for armed robbery or robbery in company since the decision in Henry show that for all offences a two year non parole period or less was imposed in 57% of cases. Accordingly, it is submitted that the non parole period imposed upon the applicant would have been in the middle of the range for the more serious charge and accordingly was excessive in the present case. 
      
       
     18    In my opinion the approach which Coleman DCJ took the applicant's sentence was appropriate and no error is revealed. His Honour had regard to the applicant's early plea and cooperation with the authorities and his contrition. Although the applicant's addiction to heroin was obviously a relevant matter his Honour acknowledged that fact when indicating that the offence was committed while the applicant was in an unstable state due to the failure of the methadone program. His Honour carefully considered the circumstances of the applicant's release without access to appropriate methadone treatment and his resort thereafter to heroin. His Honour also took into account that the applicant had shown a willingness to participate in the methadone program and to seek rehabilitation for his drug habits. Indeed, it was for these reasons that his Honour concluded that the applicant will benefit from an extended period of supervision. 
      
       
     19    In my opinion the level of criminality in the present case was significant. It required a sentence which recognised the serious nature of the offence which was committed involving a bank officer who was terrified and placed in fear for her life. Although the attempt to obtain money did not succeed it was only because of the security features in place. To these matters must be added the applicant's long history of offences and failure to abstain from offending during periods of conditional release. 
      
       
     20    Reference was made by counsel for the applicant to the statistics in relation to armed robbery which, it was submitted, showed that the non parole period imposed would have been appropriate for an armed robbery but not the present offence. However, the circumstances of the present offence had an impact upon the teller consistent with an armed robbery and involve a greater degree of criminality than may be present in many offences committed contrary to ss 99 or 100 of the Act. 
      
       
     21    In my opinion the sentence imposed, including the non parole period, was well within the discretion of the sentencing judge and there is no reason for this Court to intervene. I propose that leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal should be refused. 
      
       
     22    STUDDERT J: I agree. The orders of the court therefore will be those proposed by Justice McClellan.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
       SIMPSON J :  
        
       
     1    The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him by Judge Job in the District Court on 10 September 1999, following his pleas of guilty to four charges brought under s 29(4)(b) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth). Each count alleged that the applicant had made a materially false statement capable of causing a cash dealer to make a false report of an international fund transfer instruction. The essence of the offences was that the applicant, in requesting an overseas telegraphic transfer of Advance Bank for $100,000 (in each case), falsely identified the sender of the funds as a film making company, Manifesto Film Limited. All offences were committed in March 1998. Each offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years.  
      
       
     2    On each count Judge Job sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment for fifteen months, specifying that all sentences are to be served concurrently, commencing 10 September 1999. It will be necessary to refer below to the circumstances in which he imposed the sentences in the terms he did. 
      
       
     3    The application for leave to appeal came on for hearing on 14 June 2001. At the conclusion of the argument, the court announced that it was unanimously of the view that an appeal could not succeed, but deferred making formal orders to that effect, or giving reasons for its decision, until Friday 29 June. These are my reasons for coming to that view. 
      
       
     4    There was and is remarkably little detail about the circumstances of the offences. Besides the bare facts stated above, it was known that the applicant had told one bank officer that the purpose of the transfer was to enable Manifesto to make a film in Hong Kong. The applicant had in fact worked for Manifesto for a period ending in October 1997 and had thereafter had some discussions with Manifesto personnel about the prospect of developing a film making business in China, but nothing of significance eventuated. 
      
       
     5    The applicant was arrested on 16 October 1998. Acting on the advice of his then solicitor, he declined to participate in a recorded interview. He did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. He gave a modicum of information to an officer of the Probation and Parole Service who assessed him for the purpose of a pre-sentence report. The applicant acknowledged that the recipient of the funds was his brother, and appears to have attempted to maintain that the transactions were somehow connected with Manifesto’s business.  
      
       
     6    There was an equivalent paucity of subjective material. The applicant had, previously, come in contact with the Probation and Parole Service as a result of a drink driving charge in 1986. He asked the officer not to contact his de facto wife in order to confirm or obtain additional information. What emerged about the applicant was limited to the following. He was raised in Malaysia but studied accountancy in New Zealand. He immigrated to Australia in 1980. He has been previously married, but has been in his current de facto relationship for seventeen years, and by that relationship has a sixteen year old son. He has no convictions other than the 1986 drink driving offence. 
      
       
     7    There was therefore very little information for the sentencing judge to work on. His Honour, correctly in my view, took the view that general deterrence was “of a special importance” in relation to sentencing under the Financial Transactions Reports Act, because that Act states as among its objects the enforcement of taxation and other laws of the Commonwealth of Australia. He concluded, again correctly in my view, that the offences called for a term of full time imprisonment.  
      
       
     8    Four matters were raised on the application. The first emerged initially from correspondence with the office of the Attorney General that followed the applicant’s sentencing. An officer of the Attorney General’s Department drew to the attention of the Director of Public Prosecutions (“DPP”) an anomaly in the sentence imposed. As noted above, each offence carries a maximum term of imprisonment of five years. Judge Job initially stated that the sentence he imposed on each count was a sentence of imprisonment for two years. He then purported to fix a non parole period of fifteen months. 
      
       
     9    S19AC(1) of the Crimes Act 1914  provides as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         19AC. When court must fix a recognizance release order 
          
           
          
         (1) 
          Subject to subsections (3) and (4), where:  
          
          
         (a) a person is convicted of a federal offence, or of 2 or more federal offences at the same sitting; and  
          
         (b) the court imposes on the person a federal sentence that does not exceed, or federal sentences that, in the aggregate, do not exceed, 3 years; and  
          
         (c) at the time the sentence or sentences are imposed the person is not already serving or subject to a federal sentence;  
          
          
         the court must make a recognizance release order in respect of that sentence or those sentences and must not fix a non-parole period. 
          
         
        
       
     10    The three conditions of the sub section having been met, it was not open to the judge to fix a non parole period. He was obliged instead to make a recognizance release order. This was brought to his Honour’s attention by counsel for the DPP. In the course of the discussion that followed his Honour made it plain that what he intended was to impose sentences consisting of a maximum term of two years of which the applicant would serve fifteen months in custody; for the balance of nine months the judge intended that he would be, or would be eligible to be, on conditional liberty. In order to achieve this it was necessary to impose sentences of two years, with a recognizance release order of fifteen months. 
      
       
     11    What his Honour finally did was stated in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “…the prisoner is sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment on each charge concurrent and I direct that he be released after that period on recognizance to be of good behaviour for a period of twelve months from that date.” 
         
        
       
     12    Thus, the sentence imposed - that is, the total sentence - was a sentence of fifteen months. The direction for release on recognizance for a period of twelve months after service of that sentence was not authorised by any statutory provision and is invalid. 
      
       
     13    S 19AC(1) obliged the court to make a recognizance release order. Subs (4), to which subs (1) is subject, permits a court to decline to make a recognizance release order if, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offence or offences concerned and to the antecedents of the offender, it is satisfied that such an order was inappropriate. By sub s (5) a court declining to make a recognizance release order is required to state its reasons for so deciding and to cause the reasons to be entered in the records of the court.  
      
       
     14    It is plain that the sentence imposed did not truly reflect the sentencing judge’s intention. It reflected his intention with respect to the minimum term. As pronounced, however, the term the judge intended to be the minimum term was imposed as the total term, in respect to which, by subs (1) (unless the discretion conferred by subs (4) was exercised) a recognisance release order of a lesser term was obligatory. But the judge did not make such a recognisance release order and did not make a considered decision to decline to do so, nor did he state his reasons for so deciding, nor cause his reasons to be entered in the court records. There was, therefore, as the DPP concedes, an error in the sentencing procedure. 
      
       
     15    S 19AH empowers a court to correct any such error. That power is conferred upon the court in which the sentence was imposed. It does not empower this court to make the correction. The applicant would be entitled to approach the District Court for the purpose of having a recognizance release order made.  
      
       
     16    The second matter raised on behalf of the applicant was put in terms of a parity argument: R v Lowe (1984) 154 CLR 606; R v Postiglione (1997) 189 CLR 295. The substance of this argument is that the applicant is entitled to bear a legitimate sense of grievance by comparison of the sentences imposed upon him with those of a person he identified as a co-offender.  
      
       
     17    The only evidence as to the co-offender and his sentence was contained in an affidavit sworn by the applicant on 16 February 2001. In that affidavit the applicant mentioned an individual, whom he named as the person whom he (the applicant) assisted in transferring funds overseas. The applicant deposed that he was advised and believed that that individual was charged with “goods in custody”, the goods being the sum of $1.3 million in cash, in respect of which he was sentenced to five months’ imprisonment.  
      
       
     18    Although it is not at all clear, if that information is correct, it would appear that that individual was charged under s 527C of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) which carries a maximum term of imprisonment for six months.  
      
       
     19    Apart from the applicant’s assertion, there is nothing before this court to confirm that that offence committed by that individual was in fact related to the four charges to which the applicant pleaded guilty. In any event, the offences with which the two were charged, and the maximum penalties provided by the relevant statutes were so disparate, that questions of parity are irrelevant. I would reject the ground of appeal based on parity considerations. 
      
       
     20    A third matter put in oral argument was that the sentence was, in any event, manifestly excessive, and that the offences warranted no more than a non custodial penalty. I would reject this argument. The amounts of money involved were large, the criminal activity was designed to defeat the objects of the Act under which the offences were charged, they constituted a course of criminal conduct, and the applicant provided no explanation for his involvement. Further, the argument sits very oddly indeed with the final matter raised. 
      
       
     21    The most substantial matter raised in the application was contained in two grounds of appeal framed as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. that ‘special circumstances’ exist that warrant the admission of new evidence in this appeal.  
         
        
        
         
         2. that in the light of this new evidence the sentence given to the appellant by the trial judge is excessive.” 
         
        
       
     22    In support of these grounds of appeal the applicant filed a number of affidavits. It is from these affidavits that the “special circumstances” asserted in the first of these grounds of appeal to exist can be identified. The DPP filed affidavits in reply. This court accepted the affidavits provisionally for the purpose of determining whether they should be admitted. In my view, having considered the evidence, the affidavits should not be admitted. It is convenient to consider the merits of these grounds of appeal in separate reasons in a supplementary judgment, not to be made publicly available. For the reasons there given, I am satisfied that the “new evidence” tendered ought not be admitted. I am further satisfied that, even if it were admitted, it would not affect the outcome of an appeal. The legal principles relevant to the question of the admission of fresh evidence in this case are stated in the following paragraphs of the supplementary judgment which I reproduce below:  
      
       
        
       1 In support of the application to adduce fresh evidence, counsel for the applicant sought to rely upon the decision of this court in  
       R v Goodwin 
        (1990) 51 A Crim R 328. In that case Hunt J (as he then was), with whom Grove J agreed, stated the basic requirements for the admissibility of additional evidence in this court as: 
        
        
         
          
           
           “(i) that it [the proposed evidence] must be of such significance that the sentencing judge may have regarded it as having a real bearing upon his decision; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (ii) that, although its existence may have been known to the applicant, its significance was not realised by him at the time; and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (iii) that its existence was not made known to the applicant’s legal advisers at the time of those sentencing proceedings.” 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Counsel argued that the evidence on which he wished to rely meets all three criteria. 
         
        
        
       5 S 6(3) of the  
       Criminal Appeal Act  
       1912 provides 
       : 
        
        
         
          
           
             
           “(3) On an appeal under s5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of the opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe  
           is warranted in law and should have been passed 
           , shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.” (emphasis added) 
           
          
         
        
        
       6 As the language of the section makes clear, an appeal to this court against sentence lies only to correct error in the sentencing process. Events that occur after sentencing cannot, in the ordinary case, establish such error:  
       R v Munday 
        (1981) 2 NSWLR 177;  
       R v Gallagher, 
        NSWCCA, 27 August 1991, unreported;  
       R v Cartwright 
        (1989) 17 NSWLR 243;  
       R v Scullion, 
        NSWCCA, 15 July 1992, unreported;  
       R v Willard 
        [2001] NSWCCA 6, unreported, 2 February 2001. 
        
        
       11 There is authority for the proposition, that where, as a result of incompetent legal representation at the sentencing proceedings, relevant material as to fundamental facts is not placed before the sentencing judge, this court may admit evidence to establish those facts, even though that evidence does not, strictly, qualify as “fresh evidence”:  
       R v Abbott 
        (1985) 17 A Crim R 355. 
        
        
       12 But the proposition the applicant seeks to advance goes even further. It is that where, by reason of incompetent legal advice, an offender opts for a course of action which is against his better interests, then a sentence imposed in the circumstances that then exist, and appropriate to those circumstances may be set aside on the basis that a less severe sentence “is warranted in law and should have been passed”. This is a far-reaching proposition indeed, and a novel one. I find it difficult to envisage circumstances in which it could be accepted. Certainly they do not here exist. On the basis of the facts (not merely the evidence) as they existed at the time of sentencing, the sentences imposed were well within the discretion of the judge. 
        
        
       14 I am far from satisfied, on the evidence, that the advice given to the applicant was wrong, let alone incompetent. The applicant has been offered a number of opportunities to establish this fundamental fact, and has not availed himself of any of them.  
        
        
       15 The application has been before this court, differently constituted, on two previous occasions. On 18 May 2000 it was before a court constituted by Mason P, Heydon JA and Smart AJ. During the course of that proceeding, Mason P said: 
        
        
         
          
           
           “The other point that is concerning me is that Mr Sutherland’s submission raised an important point of principle and relies on a case called  
           Munday’s  
           case [ 
           R v Munday 
            (1981) 2 NSWLR 177] which is authority for the proposition that, in effect, nothing that happens after sentence of this nature can be taken into account on appellate review. That raises a pretty important issue and perhaps an issue upon which the court would wish to have some assistance about what really does happen when people ‘roll over’ after they have been sentenced.” 
           
          
         
        
        
       16 A little later his Honour, having been told that the applicant had relied on legal advice said: 
        
        
         
          
           
           “We would need to see what advice he sought and what information he laid before his lawyer at that time.” 
           
          
         
        
        
       17 As a consequence of the difficulties then experienced, the court adjourned the application. It next came before the court on 6 April 2001, the bench comprising Meagher JA, Wood CJ at CL and Studdert J. During the course of that hearing Wood CJ at CL observed that it would have been appropriate for the Crown to have called the applicant’s former legal advisers to explain what had taken place. Counsel for the DPP observed that that would have required a waiver of privilege. That resulted in Wood CJ at CL saying: 
        
        
         
          
           
           “I am sure that would be forthcoming. If it wasn’t forthcoming, that might affect the appeal. We are being asked to deal with this matter on an incomplete basis and I would have thought, for myself for that matter, we are not in a position to hear it, in which case it must go over.” 
           
          
         
        
        
       18 On 30 April 2001 Mr Moorhouse, the solicitor in the office of the DPP handling the matter, wrote to the applicant’s present solicitor, Mr Storie, enclosing a draft “waiver of privilege” which he invited the solicitor to have the applicant sign. What Mr Moorhouse proposed was that the applicant consent to his former counsel and solicitor communicating with the office of the DPP and giving evidence in relation to the application. The applicant’s solicitor did not reply. On 16 May Mr Moorhouse wrote again to Mr Storie. In this letter he referred to the earlier letter, and also asserted that he had telephoned Mr Storie’s office on 14 May and twice on 16 May, leaving messages and requesting that Mr Storie return the calls. Contact had not been made. He again asked Mr Storie to telephone. 
        
        
       19 On 17 May Mr Storie telephoned Mr Moorhouse. Consent to the waiver was not forthcoming. Further correspondence ensued. By the commencement of the hearing of this application, on 14 June 2001, the applicant had still not waived privilege. During the course of the hearing of the application counsel for the applicant offered to provide to counsel for the DPP the file obtained from the former solicitors. This, of course, did not give counsel for the DPP any opportunity to confer with or obtain information from the applicant’s previous legal representatives. 
        
        
       20 In my opinion, in these circumstances, it would be unfair to the DPP to allow the applicant to rely upon the affidavit material he tendered. 
        
        
       21 Further, even if that material were admitted, it would not have the effect for which the applicant contends. That is, it would not establish that he had been so incompetently represented as to warrant a conclusion that a miscarriage of justice had occurred. 
        
        
       22 I would reject this ground of appeal.  
        
       
     23    I would, accordingly, grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. The confidential reasons will remain in a sealed envelope with the file. The envelope will be marked “Not to be opened except on the authority of the Court of Criminal Appeal”.

        JUDGMENT  
        
        
        
       HEYDON JA 
       :  
       
     1    On Tuesday 12 June 2001 the court delivered judgment in this matter.  
      
       
     2    On Friday 15 June 2001 the following document was filed on behalf of the appellant: 
      
       
        
         
         “It has been brought to our attention that the judgment of the court in this matter was delivered on Tuesday 12 June 2001. At the time we were not aware that judgment was about to be delivered and we had proposed that a short additional written submission should be filed on behalf of the appellant in reply to the supplementary submissions filed by the Crown. That submission was in the course of preparation at the time that judgment was delivered. 
         
        
        
         
         We also note that in dealing with this matter the court has considered the application of the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It is respectfully submitted that the appellant should have been given notice of the fact that consideration was being given to the application of the proviso and the opportunity to be heard in relation to this issue. There are matters of substance which in our respectful submission should be considered on the question of whether it is appropriate to apply the proviso in this case. The appellant would wish to draw the attention of the court to relevant authority on this question apart from the authorities referred to in the brief reference made to the proviso in the Crown’s supplementary submission. 
         
        
        
         
         The further submissions on the proviso could, subject to the court’s preference, be addressed in written submissions. 
         
        
        
         
         For the purpose of hearing the appellant on the issues referred to above, it is respectfully submitted that the court should refrain from perfecting the order of the court as contemplated in the judgment of 12 June 2001.” 
         
        
        
       That document appeared over the typed names of Paul Byrne SC and Gabrielle Bashir, though only the latter signed it. It is not clear whether the document was served on the Crown at about the same time that it was filed.  
        
       
     3    On Monday 18 June 2001, the appellant was advised to file and serve the written submissions he wished to file on or before 4pm on Wednesday 20 June 2001. This he did. They appeared over the typed names and signatures of Paul Byrne SC and Gabrielle Bashir. The Crown has not been asked to respond to them.  
      
       
        
       Notice of delivery of judgment 
       
     4    The first proposition which calls for examination is the proposition that on 12 June 2001 “we” were not aware that judgment was about to be delivered. The Registry gave advance notice to the office of the solicitor for the appellant, Ross Hill & Associates, Solicitors of Dee Why, of the fact that judgment was to be delivered on 12 June 2001. The record of appearances made at the time when judgment was delivered reveals that Mr Ross Hill was in attendance on that occasion. What the Registry did was appropriate. It is not necessary for counsel for a party, as distinct from the solicitors for that party, to be advised of the time when judgment is given.  
      
       
        
       Forestalling of appellant’s written submissions 
       
     5    The second proposition which calls for examination is the suggestion that the delivery of judgment on 12 June 2001 deprived the appellant of an opportunity to respond to the Crown’s Supplementary Submissions. The following chronology is relevant.  
      
       
        
       - On 26 February 2001 the appeal was called on for oral hearing and argument, recorded in 23 pages of transcript, proceeded for some time. It was agreed that judgment should be reserved until after the High Court delivered judgment in  
       Azzopardi v R 
       . 
        
        
       - On 3 May 2001 the High Court delivered judgment in  
       Azzopardi v R 
        [2001] HCA 25. 
        
        
       - On 9 May 2001 the appellant filed “Supplementary Submissions”. 
        
        
       - On 14 May 2001 the Crown filed “Supplementary Submissions” in answer to those of the appellant. 
        
        
       - On 12 June 2001 the judgment complained of was delivered. 
        
       
     6    Neither set of Supplementary Submissions was filed with the leave of the court. Strictly speaking that should have been sought. The failure to do so was in the circumstances venial, because it was sensible to put in further written submissions about Azzopardi v R speedily so that the court could consider the impact of that case on the arguments already presented and deliver judgment within a reasonable period. However, if leave had been sought, an opportunity would have been afforded for the appellant to make plain his desire to put in written submissions in reply to the Crown’s Supplementary Submissions, which desire it is now said has been thwarted. Given that leave was not sought, if the appellant had wanted to reply to the Crown’s Supplementary Submissions it had more than four weeks to do so before judgment was delivered. In view of the appropriate and considerable speed with which the two sets of Supplementary Submissions were generated, that gave very much more than ample time. The court was given no notice of the appellant’s intention of filing written submissions in reply. 
      
       
        
       Denial of natural justice 
       
     7    The third matter which must be examined relates to the complaint that the appellant “should have been given notice of the fact that consideration was being given to the application of the proviso and the opportunity to be heard in relation to this issue.” This is a complaint that the appellant has been denied natural justice. If it is soundly based, it is a complaint of the utmost seriousness. By way of background, it must be noted that on the face of it the 15 June 2001 document adopts a tone of very considerable surprise that the court should have taken the step of considering the application of the proviso. Several observations are called for.  
      
       
     8    The first observation is that all four grounds of appeal relied on s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and it is not logically possible to consider the application of the totality of that section without considering the proviso to it. 
      
       
     9    The second observation is that the written submissions of the Crown filed on 21 February 2001, before the oral hearing on 26 February 2001, contain material, including the citation of four cases, directed to the proposition that even if Ground 2 was made out, that being the ground on which the appellant’s arguments were eventually found to be valid, there had been no miscarriage of justice and the proviso should be applied (paragraphs 24-25). These paragraphs were quoted in the minority judgment delivered on 12 June 2001.  
      
       
     10    The third observation is that those paragraphs were amplified, with detailed evidence references, in the Crown’s oral argument on 26 February 2001 (transcript pages 15-19).  
      
       
     11    The fourth observation is that counsel for the appellant in oral argument in reply on that day took issue with the contention that the proviso should be applied (transcript pages 21-22).  
      
       
     12    The fifth observation is that in the appellant’s Supplementary Submissions filed on 9 May 2001 the last paragraph dealt with the proviso and denied that it should be applied. 
      
       
     13    The sixth observation is that in the Crown’s Supplementary Submissions filed on 14 May 2001, a short paragraph was devoted to the proviso in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Alternatively, contrary to the appellant’s submission, this is a case where the proviso to the Criminal Appeal Act should be applied: See  
         Davis 
         , supra,  
         R v Bozzola 
          [2001] NSWCCA 8.” 
         
        
        
       Davis v R 
        was a special leave application decided at the same time as  
       Azzopardi v R 
        in which the High Court applied the proviso. Evidently if the appellant had neglected to contend that the proviso should not be applied, that was a state of affairs which had escaped the attention of the Crown.  
        
       
     14    In all the circumstances it is necessary emphatically to reject the astonishing suggestion that the appellant should have been given specific notice that consideration was being given to the application of the proviso and that the appellant was not given any opportunity to be heard on that question. He could have advanced written submissions on the proviso as part of his written submissions dated 15 January 2001, in anticipation of the unsurprising contingency that the Crown would rely on it. He could have advanced written submissions on the proviso in reply to what the Crown said in its written submissions of 21 February 2001. He could have advanced, and indeed he did advance, oral argument about the proviso on 26 February 2001. He had a self-conferred opportunity to make a further submission in the Supplementary Submissions of 9 May 2001. And in the period from 14 May 2001 to 12 June 2001 he had ample time, if so advised, to respond to the Crown’s brief written submission on the proviso in its Supplementary Submissions dated 14 May 2001.  
      
       
        
       The appellant’s desire to advance further argument on points on which he succeeded  
        
       
     15    The fourth proposition to be dealt with is the suggestion that the argument should be reopened in order to allow the appellant to reply to the Crown’s Supplementary Submissions in relation to Azzopardi v R. At the time of the filing of the 15 June 2001 document and at the time of the filing of the 20 June 2001 Further Supplementary Submissions, it would have been apparent to a reader of the reasons for judgment delivered on 12 June 2001 that the court was unanimous in upholding the appellant’s submissions on Azzopardi v R. It follows that paragraphs 2-5 of the Further Supplementary Submissions were completely unnecessary, and no reason is advanced in them for why they were put forward.  
      
       
        
       The appellant’s desire to advance further argument on points on which he failed 
        
       
     16    The fifth proposition to be considered is that the argument should be reopened to permit the appellant to advance further argument about the proviso.  
      
       
     17    It is clear that an appellate court may reopen a case which has already been decided if it was decided on a point on which the losing party has, without personal fault, not been heard: Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) (1993) 176 CLR 300 at 302, 308, 312, 317 and 322. It is also the case that an appellate court may reopen a case which has already been decided on other grounds: Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) (1993) 176 CLR 300 at 302 and 322. But, according to Mason ACJ, Wilson and Brennan JJ in Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal Council (1982) 149 CLR 672 at 684, in practice the circumstances: 
      
       
        
         
         “are extremely rare. The public interest in maintaining the finality of litigation necessarily means that the power to reopen to enable a rehearing must be exercised with great caution”.  
         
        
        
       In  
       State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd 
        (1982) 150 CLR 29 at 38 Mason and Wilson JJ said: “The circumstances that will justify a rehearing must be quite exceptional.” In  
       Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) 
        (1993) 176 CLR 300 at 302-3 Mason CJ said: 
        
         
         “the public interest in the finality of litigation will not preclude the exceptional step of reviewing or rehearing an issue when a court has good reason to consider that, in its earlier judgment, it has proceeded on a misapprehension as to the facts or the law. As this Court is a final court of appeal, there is no reason for it to confine the exercise of its jurisdiction in a way that would inhibit its capacity to rectify what it perceives to be an apparent error arising from some miscarriage in its judgment. However, it must be emphasized that the jurisdiction is not to be exercised for the purpose of re-agitating arguments already considered by the Court; nor is it to be exercised simply because the party seeking a rehearing has failed to present the argument in all its aspects or as well as it might have been put. What must emerge, in order to enliven the exercise of the jurisdiction, is that the Court has apparently proceeded according to some misapprehension of the facts or the relevant law and that this misapprehension cannot be attributed solely to the neglect or default of the party seeking the rehearing. The purpose of the jurisdiction is not to provide a backdoor method by which unsuccessful litigants can seek to re-argue their cases.” 
         
        
       
     18    Can it be said in this case that the appellant has shown that by accident without fault on his part he has not been heard on the proviso? No. He has been heard on it. If he wanted to say more about it he should have said it on the appropriate occasions on which he had a right to say it up to and including 26 February 2001, or on any day thereafter up to 12 June 2001 with leave (or indeed, since the appellant evidently felt that the absence of leave was no inhibition, without leave).  
      
       
     19    Can it be said that the appellant has demonstrated an error in the majority reasoning in the 12 June 2001 judgment in that it proceeded on “some misapprehension of the facts”? No. The Further Supplementary Submissions, paragraphs 6-8, do not point to any “misapprehension of the facts”. They do not even refer to the detail of the facts, beyond pointing out that the appellant was not armed. 
      
       
     20    Can it be said that the appellant has demonstrated an error in the majority reasoning in the 12 June 2001 judgment in that it proceeded on “some misapprehension of … the relevant law”? 
      
       
        
       (a) The three High Court appellate decisions relied on by the Crown in the written submissions of 21 February 2001 were not controverted by the appellant on 26 February 2001. The appellant did not say they were wrong, or that they stated the relevant law incompletely. He did not cite any other authorities of his own. The three High Court authorities were quoted in the minority judgment delivered on 12 June 2001. Barr J agreed with the reasons advanced by Smart AJ for applying the proviso, and Smart AJ prefaced those reasons by stating that he did not disagree with the statement appearing in the minority judgment of the principles applicable. The Further Supplementary Submissions do not seek to demonstrate what error there was in the statement of principles. Indeed, paragraph 7(ii) contains quotations from  
       Wilde v R 
        (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 372 which appear in the minority judgment at [39]. 
        
        
       (b) The Further Supplementary Submissions refer to three other High Court cases predating the last of those quoted in the minority judgment (namely,  
       Glennon v R 
        (1994) 119 ALR 706 at 710-712). The Further Supplementary Submissions do not explain in what way those cases invalidate either the statements of principle in the minority judgment or the application of them in Smart AJ’s judgment.  
        
        
       (c) The further written submissions contend that  
       R v Bozzola 
        [2001] NSWCCA 8 was distinguishable. That case was referred to in the minority judgment at [41] for the proposition that while the right to silence of an accused person is a fundamental right, not every misdirection about the right to silence will be such a fundamental irregularity that no proper trial should be regarded as having taken place. That truism is not a proposition which the Further Supplementary Submissions controvert. Rather, the Further Supplementary Submissions are directed to the proposition that if the correct direction had been given, it was not inevitable that the appellant would have been convicted.  
        
        
       (d) The further written submissions rely on  
       R v Whittaker 
        (1993) 68 A Crim R 476 at 482-484 in support of the contention that “the proviso should not be applied where there has been a misdirection on an important ingredient of the law applicable to the trial”. First, the case does not support that proposition. Such a misdirection makes it harder for the proviso to be applied, but not impossible. The court said: “We think it fair to say that there is a diminished inclination in recent times to invoke the proviso (even in otherwise very strong Crown cases) where misdirection has been shown upon an important ingredient of the law applicable to the trial ….” The court did not say that the relevant inclination had diminished to the point of non-existence. Secondly, the Court of Criminal Appeal in that case quoted statements in  
       Quartermaine v R 
        (1980) 143 CLR 595 at 600-601 and  
       Wilde v R 
        (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 372-372. The former case was one where the jury was “not instructed as to the essential elements of the charge in fact laid”. Gibbs J said: 
        
         
          
           
           “When a jury has returned a verdict of guilty of a particular crime without having considered whether that crime was committed, the verdict cannot … be sustained by holding that the jury would or should have returned the same verdict if it had considered the proper questions.” 
           
          
         
        
        
         
       R v Whittaker 
        was a case of that character, since there was a misdirection about what in law constituted the crime of manslaughter. So was  
       Quartermaine v R 
       , there having been a misdirection as to the elements of the crime constituted by s 283 of the  
       Criminal Code 
        (WA). That type of case is wholly different from the present, where the jury ex hypothesi was correctly directed about the elements of the relevant crimes (Ground 1 having been rejected). The present case rather concerns a misdirection about the jury’s approach to silence - an evidentiary matter. Thirdly,  
       Wilde v R 
        was a case involving another evidentiary matter - an error in admitting similar fact evidence by reason of a refusal to order separate trials in relation to the different items of conduct. In that case the Court of Criminal Appeal applied the proviso and the High Court majority held it was not in error of doing so. In passages which the present appellant did not refer to, directly or by reference, the majority in  
       Wilde v R  
       concluded both that the relevant errors were not of so fundamental a kind as to mean that no proper trial had taken place, and that a reasonable jury would inevitably have convicted if the errors had not been made. That reveals that evidentiary errors do not necessarily mean that no proper trial has taken place and do not necessarily prevent application of the proviso.  
        
        
       (e) The Further Supplementary Submissions refer to  
       R v Frawley 
        (1993) 69 A Crim R 208 at 223-224. Gleeson CJ there said that the proviso should not be applied in that case because though the appellant’s chances of an acquittal but for the error that occurred were not to be rated highly, they were not non-existent. That view has no determinative significance in this case: Gleeson CJ’s view was correct on the facts of  
       R v Frawley 
        and the view of the majority is, as they perceive the facts of this case, correct in this case.  
        
       
     21    The appellant has completely failed to demonstrate any valid basis for permitting him to reopen the argument. For that reason the order favoured by the majority that the appeal be dismissed should not be disturbed. As an independent ground for the decision that that order should not be disturbed, I hold that even when the Further Supplementary Submissions are taken into consideration as fully as they would have been if they had been advanced at the right time, they do not damage the majority reasoning which has, with respect, considerable strength.  
      
       
     22    I would propose that the Court merely note that the order made on 12 June 2001 is not to be changed.

       JUDGMENT 
       
       
      
    1    HIS HONOUR:  
     
      
       
      INTRODUCTION 
       
       
      This is an application by Malcolm Huntley Potier (the plaintiff) to review a decision by a Magistrate (the second defendant) in the Local Court at Burwood, Sydney, given on 2 November 2000 by which the Magistrate refused to allow the plaintiff to cross-examine witnesses pursuant to section 48 E of the Justices Act in a committal proceeding involving the plaintiff. 
       
      
    2    The application was filed on 16 April 2001 and sought orders in the nature of mandamus and certiorari pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 quashing the decision of the Magistrate and ordering him to allow the plaintiff to call witnesses to the committal hearing and cross-examine them. The plaintiff also sought a declaration to the effect that no bill of indictment had yet been found by the Director of Public Prosecutions against him. 
     
      
    3    The last mentioned ground can be disposed of quickly. The fact is that on 17 November 2001 the Crown Prosecutor appointed pursuant to the provisions of the Crown Prosecutors Act 1987 found bills of indictment against the plaintiff under section 26 of the Crimes Act 1900 in respect of two offences namely that:  
     
      
       
      (i) between 2 May 2000 and 8 May 2000 (the plaintiff) at Villawood in the state of New South Wales (the plaintiff) did solicit an undercover police operative with the name ""Mal Gibson"" to murder Myra Linda Oswald; and, 
       
       
      (ii) between 2 May 2000 and 8 May 2000 at Villawood in the state of New South Wales did solicit an undercover police operative with the name of ""Mal Gibson"" to murder Glenn Stuart Wakeham. 
       
      
    4    The Director of Public Prosecutions has confirmed his intention to prosecute the indictments and the plaintiff's trial has been fixed to commence on 30 July 2001. 
     
      
    5    As a consequence of the operation of ss 5 of the Crown Prosecutors Act 1987 and Part 3 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 there is no factual basis on which the declaration sought by the plaintiff in relation to a bill of indictment could be made, even if it were otherwise appropriate to do so. A decision of the Crown Prosecutor has the effect of being a decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
     
      
    6    It should be noted that two earlier dates for trial have been vacated. The first was for 7 May 2001, a date which had been fixed on 22 January 2001. The second was for 12 June 2001, a date which had been fixed on 11 April 2001. 
     
      
       
      BACKGROUND:  
       
      
    7    The background of the matter is that the plaintiff appeared before the second defendant (the Magistrate) who heard the committal proceedings. This occurred at the Local Court at Burwood on 2 November 2001. On that occasion the plaintiff through his legal representative made application for a direction from the Magistrate to call and cross-examine eight of the prosecution witnesses.  
     
      
    8    This application was opposed by the Crown and as a consequence was argued before the Magistrate at some length, who gave his decision after a short break in the proceedings. He addressed the different requirements of section 48E in relation to different categories of witnesses; namely victims on the one hand and other witnesses on the other.  
     
      
    9    These tests required either ""special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence"" (victim) or ""substantial reason why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence"" (other than a victim). 
     
      
    10    The Magistrate then adopted the authorities referred to in the written submissions proffered by counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the plaintiff and determined:  
     
      
       
        
        ""This Court is not of the view that the reasons advanced are special so far as the alleged victims are concerned and the Court would decline to make such a direction for their attendances"". 
        
       
       
      And: 
       
       
        
        ""This Court ... is not satisfied that substantial reasons in the interests of justice exist for requiring for cross-examination the attendance of the nominated witnesses"".) 
        
       
      
    11    As soon as the Magistrate had reached his decision and declined to give the directions sought by the plaintiff, his legal representative said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It's our intention to appeal your Worship's decision"".  
        
       
       
      and advised the Court that he wished to: 
       
       
        
        ""Explore the avenue of appeal to your Worship's decision in regard to 48 E"".  
        
       
      
    12    The Magistrate committed the plaintiff for trial on two counts of solicit, encourage and persuade to murder and two counts of incite to solicit murder.  
     
      
    13    At the hearing before this court the plaintiff informed the court that the application which was being heard was the appeal referred to before the Magistrate. 
     
      
    14    Since the giving of assent to the Justice Legislation Amendment (Appeals) Act 1998 in December 1998 the mode of appeal to the Supreme Court in respect of decisions of Magistrates has been regulated by Pt 5 of the Justices Act.  
     
      
    15    Section 104 provides for an appeal on a ground of law in respect of any conviction or order in summary proceedings. It does not provide for any appeal in respect of committal proceedings for an indictable offence.  
     
      
    16    As a consequence any testing of the decision of the Magistrate needs to be by way of order in the nature of a prerogative writ or declaration. 
     
      
    17    At the outset of the proceedings the representative of the Director of Public Prosecutions raised a number of preliminary points. The first was that the Court should not intervene at this late stage of the criminal law process which could culminate in the trial of the plaintiff, scheduled to commence on 30 July 2001, being aborted.  
     
      
    18    The second ground was that the decision of the Magistrate to commit the plaintiff for trial saw an end to the committal proceedings and has in any event been overtaken by the finding of relevant bills of indictment.  
     
      
    19    The third ground was that any order remitting the matter to the Magistrate would be fruitless in view of the finding of the bills and finally it was argued that in any event the plaintiff could, before the empanelling of the jury at the trial seek a Basha enquiry from the trial Judge. 
     
      
    20    There is a traditional disinclination, well-founded in the highest authority, to review the decision of a Magistrate to commit a person for trial (see for example Yates v. Wilson (1989) 168 CLR 338. 
     
      
    21    This disinclination was referred to in Sergi v. The Director of Public Prosecutions (CA 40518/91, 10 September 1981, unreported)) in which the Court of Appeal said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Courts of high authority have repeatedly stressed the great circumspection which should be exercised in the provision of relief which would have the effect of disturbing the conduct of a criminal trial. There is no doubt that this Court, as a supervisory Court, has a wide jurisdiction to grant such relief where justice requires it. See  
        Barton v The Queen 
         (1980) 147 CLR 75, 96. However it is a jurisdiction to be sparingly exercised.  
        Lamb v Moss  
        (1983) 49 ALR 533, 545;  
        Bacon v Rose 
         (1972) 2 NSWLR 793, 797;  
        Caine v Glass (Number 2) 
         (1985) 3 NSWLR 230, CA. In part, this restraint arises out of an historical respect for the jury which takes charge of the accused once the trial commences. In part, it derives from a recognition by Appellate Courts of the difficulties attending the conduct of complex criminal trials. In part, it follows from the large provisions to challenge a conviction on appeal if at the end of the trial the accused is convicted and still complains about an interlocutory ruling. In part, it is based upon the recognition of the dangers of the 'fragmentation in the criminal process'"".  
        
       
       
      And: 
       
        
        ""Courts have also taken pains, of late, to stress the authority of the Director of Public Prosecutions to find a bill of indictment and the discretion which is there involved separate from the (usually anterior) exercise of discretion to commit an accused person for trial. See  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kolalich  
        (1990) 19 NSWLR 520, 527 (CCA). In the present case, the Director of Public Prosecutions has now found a bill. The order of the Magistrate, although historically anterior, was not a necessary pre-condition or a legal foundation for the Director of Public Prosecutions action. See  
        R v Leslie Robert Butler 
        , CCA, unreported, 16 August 1991 (per Gleeson CJ, page 4). That action stands on its own footing. The decision of the Magistrate committing the claimant for trial has, thus, now been overtaken by the Director of Public Prosecutions' decision. Any order directed to the Magistrate to re-open the committal proceedings could not, of itself, affect the Director of Public Prosecutions' exercise of discretion to find a bill. To the contrary, the Magistrate would be entitled, unless the Director of Public Prosecutions elected to withdraw and revoke the bill so found, to regard the re-opened committal as entirely futile. A later finding by the Magistrate, on a reconsideration of section 6 properly construed, that there was no evidence to warrant committing the claimant for trial, would leave the Director of Public Prosecutions' bill of indictment completely unaffected. The Director of Public Prosecutions has made it clear to this Court that he intends to present and prosecute his bill when the trial opens."" 
        
       
      
    22    In Ex parte Cousens; Re Blacket (1947) 47 SR 145 it was held that a decision by an examining Magistrate as to whether the evidence against the person charged is such as to warrant such a person being admitted to prison or admitted to bail to await trial is a function which:  
     
      
       
        
        ""… is essentially an executive and not a judicial function; and although magistrates have been exercising this authority for nearly four hundred years, no instance can be found of a superior Court having interfered with a magistrate by certiorari or prohibitions in the exercise of this function"" (supra at 146).  
        
       
       
      And:  
       
       
        
        ""… the absence from the books of any case in which a Superior Court has assumed to exercise a supervisory jurisdiction over magistrates whilst acting in the exercise of this authority - an authority which has been vested in them for hundreds of years - is a strong indication that their power to examine and commit is in contemplation of the law, purely executive in its nature. 
        
       
      
    23    In substance, a committing magistrate determines nothing, except that in his opinion a prima facie case has been made out for committing the accused for trial"" (supra at 147 per Jordan CJ).  
     
      
    24    The reasoning involved in Ex parte Cousens; Re Blacket (supra) applies a fortiori to a decision of a magistrate antecedent to and subsumed in the decision to commit an accused person for trial on an indictable offence. 
     
      
    25    In my opinion this reasoning is sufficient to deny the plaintiff an order in the nature of certiorari. 
     
      
    26    The question of mandamus remains outstanding. The principles applicable to orders in the nature of mandamus have been definitively stated in The King v. War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal; ex parte Bott (1933) 50 CLR 228. Rich, Dixon and McTiernan JJ said:  
     
      
       
        
        A writ of mandamus does not issue except to command the fulfilment of some duty of a public nature which remains unperformed. If the person under the duty professes to perform it, but what he actually does amounts in law to no performance because he has misconceived his duty, or in the course of attempting to discharge it, has failed to comply with some requirement essential to its valid or effectual performance, he may be commanded by the writ to exercise his function according to law de novo at any rate if a sufficient demand or request to do so has been made upon him. In the case of a tribunal, whether of a judicial or an administrative nature, charged by law with the duty of ascertaining or determining facts upon which rights depend, if it has undertaken the enquiry and announced a conclusion, the prosecutor who seeks a writ of mandamus must show that the ostensible determination is not a real performance of the duty imposed by law upon the tribunal. It may be shown that the members of the tribunal have not applied themselves to the question which the law prescribes, or that in purporting to decide it they have in truth been actuated by extraneous considerations, or that in some other respect they have so proceeded that the determination is nugatory and void. But the prosecutor who undertakes to establish that a tribunal has so acted ought not to be permitted under the colour of doing so to enter upon an examination of the correctness of the tribunal's decision, or of the sufficiency of the evidence supporting it, or of the weight of the evidence against it, or of the regularity or irregularity of the manner in which the tribunal has proceeded. The correctness or incorrectness of the conclusion reached by the tribunal is entirely beside the question whether a writ of mandamus lies. "" (at 242 - 243).  
        
       
      
    27    The legal principles set out in the above passage are applicable in New South Wales. For example in Ex parte Hebburn Ltd; Re Kearsley Shire Council (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 416, Jordan CJ in dealing with an application for mandamus to require a Magistrate to hear and determine an appeal by the applicant against the assessment of certain land for a local lighting rate under the Local Government act 1919, said:  
     
      
       
        
        “ ... the mere fact that a tribunal has made a mistake of law, even as to the proper construction of a statute does not necessarily constitute a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction:  
        The King v. Minister of Health 
         (1939) 1 KB 232 at 245-6. But there are mistakes and mistakes; and if a mistake of law as to the proper construction of a statute investing a tribunal with jurisdiction leads it to misunderstand the nature of the jurisdiction which it is to exercise, and to apply 'a wrong and inadmissible test':  
        Estate and Trust Agencies (1927) Ltd v. Singapore Improvement Trust 
         (1937) AC 898 at 917; or to 'misconceive its duty' or 'not to apply itself to the question which the law prescribes':  
        The King v. War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal  
        (supra); or 'to misunderstand the nature of the opinion which it is to form':  
        The King v. Connell 
         (1944) 69 CLR 407 at 432, in giving a decision in exercise of its jurisdiction or authority, a decision so given will be regarded as being in purported and not in real exercise of jurisdiction, leaving the jurisdiction in law constructively unexercised, and the tribunal liable to the issue of a prerogative writ of mandamus to hear and determine the matter according to law:  
        The King v. Board of Education  
        (1910) 2 KB 165 (supra at 420).""  
        
       
      
    28    In Saffron v. The Director of Public Prosecutions (1989) 16 NSWLR 397 Priestley JA (with whom Samuels JA agreed) summarised the approach of Jordan CJ in Ex parte Hebburn (supra) into two principal points as follows:  
     
      
       
        
         ""1. A magistrate may make a mistake of law, even as to the proper construction of a statute without constructively failing to exercise jurisdiction. 
        
       
       
        
        2. A mistake of law as to the proper construction of the statute investing a Magistrate with jurisdiction which leads the Magistrate to misunderstand the nature of the jurisdiction so that (i) he applies a wrong and inadmissible test or (ii) misconceives his duty or (iii) does not apply himself to the question which the law prescribes or (iv) misunderstands the nature of the opinion he must form, will make the magistrates decision one given in a purported and not a real exercise of jurisdiction"". (supra at 418) 
        
       
       
      and described this second point above as ""fully authoritative and very useful"" (supra at 419). See also  
      Barton v. Berman 
       (1980) 1 NSWLR 63 at 71 per Hope JA;  
      Grenvill Homes Pty Ltd v. Builders Licencing Board 
       (1981) 2 NSWLR 608 at 614 per Glass JA;  
      Wentworth v. Rogers 
       (1984) 2 NSWLR 422 at 433 per Glass JA. 
       
      
    29    The summary of the law set out in the judgment of Priestley JA is consonant with the recent expression by the High Court of the rule concerning jurisdictional error. In Craig v. South Australia (1994-95) 184 CLR 163 Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said:  
     
      
       
        
        "" ... an inferior court will exceed its authority and fall into jurisdictional error if it misconstrues (the relevant) statute ... and thereby misconceives the nature of the function which it is performing or the extent of its powers in the circumstances of the particular case. "" (supra at 177-178).) 
        
       
      
    30    The determination by the Magistrate did not in my opinion fall within the ambit of a decision which amounted to a non- performance, actual or constructive, of the duty to consider and determine which is inherent in section 48 E. He applied the words of the statute to the facts before him, adopted the test in the authorities apparently agreed by the parties and came to his conclusion. 
     
      
    31    Moreover, the remedy of mandamus is discretionary. So, too, is the remedy of an order in the nature of mandamus. One reason for not granting relief in the nature of mandamus is delay, especially where that delay is unexplained. In the present case there has been a delay of more than five months between the date of the Magistrate's decision and the date of institution of the present proceedings. That delay is unexplained.  
     
      
    32    Furthermore, the application was made after the finding of the bill and on the eve of a date that had been fixed for the trial. In my opinion even if the remedy of an order in the nature of mandamus were open it should not go in the present case. To do so would intervene in the criminal justice process contrary to the traditional disinclination of superior courts so to do.  
     
      
    33    Second, it would be likely to result in yet another trial date being aborted. Third, remitting the matter to the Magistrate would not serve any real function in the criminal law process since he has already determined to commit the plaintiff for trial and even if he were to determine to the contrary hereafter it would be to no point because of the finding of a bill against the plaintiff. Fourth, the committal proceeding is at an end. It ended with the executive act of committal by the Magistrate. Fifth, any claim that there has been prejudice can be dealt with by the trial Judge on a Basha enquiry. 
     
      
    34    After the decision on this matter had been reserved the plaintiff forwarded an additional written submission which he requested the court to take into account before delivering judgment. This has been done. 
     
      
    35    The written submission sought a variation of the application ""to ask that the Court make orders 1 and 2 against the second defendant only"". The basis of this request was that the second defendant had neither been present nor been represented and that as a consequence the second defendant should be taken as accepting orders of the kind sought. The second defendant has filed a submitting appearance. 
     
      
    36    The alternative argument by the plaintiff is misconceived. The orders that are made are made in the present proceedings and relate to the proceedings before the Magistrate. The fact of his non-appearance and absence of representation does not mean that orders should be made, as it were, by default against him. 
     
      
    37    The additional submission advanced by the plaintiff is without substance and must fail. 
     
      
    38    For the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion that the plaintiff's application should be dismissed. 
     
      
    39    The order of the Court will be:  
     
      
      Application dismissed with costs.

        REGINA V DAMIR HERCEG 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon the applicant by his Honour Judge Moore following the applicant pleading guilty to an indictment containing four counts: two offences of detaining a person to advantage contrary to s 90A of the Crimes Act and two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 59 of the Crimes Act. In relation to the two offences of detaining the applicant was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and the sentence was to date from 14 December 2000. In respect of each of the assault offences the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 2 years to commence from the date of sentence 14 December 2000. The applicant will be eligible for release to parole on 13 December 2002. 
      
       
     2    The principal ground of appeal is that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by reason of the sentences imposed upon persons who were co-offenders in the offences for which the applicant was sentenced. There is a second ground that Judge Moore failed to determine what was the maximum penalty to which the applicant was liable in respect of the two detaining offences under s 90A because his Honour failed to make a finding in respect of the injuries suffered by the victims of those two offences. 
      
       
     3    Because of the nature of the grounds of appeal it is unnecessary to detail the facts. There was no dispute as to the factual basis upon which the sentencing judge was to determine the appropriate sentences to be imposed upon the applicant. The incident upon which the four charges against the applicant took place in the afternoon of 28 January 1998. The offences arose from a belief on the part of the applicant and others that two persons, one a 15-year-old girl named Belinda Burgess and the other a young man named Paul Gallina, had stolen money from premises in Wollongong known as the Cripps World Street Club. This was a place where young persons would congregate to socialise. The applicant was the President of this Club, his co-offender Shaw the Vice-President and the third co-offender, Boardman, was described by his Honour as the Sergeant at Arms. There was a fourth offender but he was dealt with in the Children’s Court and no reliance is placed upon the sentence imposed upon him in support of this application. 
      
       
     4    Ms Burgess went to the club premises on the day in question because she had heard rumours that she had stolen money from the Club and she wished to sort the matter out. Shortly after she arrived at the premises, Shaw put the allegation to her and when she denied it he slapped her. Boardman also questioned her and, in the course of doing so, struck her to the face with the back of his hand cutting the inside of her mouth. When she tried to leave the premises, Shaw threw her to the ground and punched her causing her nose to bleed. She was put in such fear that she wet herself. She was taken into a bedroom in the premises and tied to a chair. She was left alone in that room secured by her hands and ankles. At one stage Boardman carried her into another room where the applicant threatened her. 
      
       
     5    In the meantime Paul Gallina was found by Boardman and another person in the streets of Wollongong and taken back to the Club. When he entered the premises, he was struck to the forehead and knocked to the ground. It is not clear who it was that assaulted Mr Gallina on this occasion. As a result of that attack, he received a wound to the forehead that bled profusely. While he was on the ground, a person, who Judge Moore found to be the applicant, kicked him. 
      
       
     6    The applicant then began interrogating Mr Gallina about the theft and when an answer was deemed to be unsatisfactory by the applicant, Gallina was struck with a hammer to the left forearm. He was also on one occasion hit in the mouth with the handle of the hammer. The applicant and Shaw then told Mr Gallina to take a shower and clean himself up. The applicant then turned his attention once more to Ms Burgess. He made threats to her and punched her to the head causing bruising. 
      
       
     7    After Mr Gallina was forced to clean the blood off the floor and walls of the room where he and Ms Burgess had been assaulted, the two were allowed to leave the premises after being threatened that they had to return the missing money on pain of further punishment. After they had obtained treatment for their injuries, Mr Gallina and Ms Burgess took their complaints to the police who then attended the Club premises with a search warrant and obtained evidence in support of the allegations. 
      
       
     8    The indictment to which the applicant pleaded guilty contained a count of detaining and a count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in respect of each of Ms Burgess and Mr Gallina. 
      
       
     9    Boardman pleaded guilty to one count of detaining under s 90A and one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm both of which related to Ms Burgess. He was not indicted for an offence against Mr Gallina. In addition Boardman faced sentence for two unrelated matters; one a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm that arose while Boardman was on bail for the offences against Ms Burgess. He was also sentenced for another charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm following his failure to comply with a Community Service Order that had been earlier imposed upon him. 
      
       
     10    On the same day as the applicant was sentenced, Boardman was sentenced by Judge Moore to 3½ years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months in respect of the offence under s 90A and a fixed term of 1 year 3 months in relation to the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence against Ms Burgess. He was also sentenced to a concurrent fixed term of 1 year 3 months for the offence of break enter and steal that occurred after the offence against Ms Burgess and a similar sentence for the offence arising from the breach of the Community Service order. 
      
       
     11    The co-offender Shaw was sentenced in the Wollongong District Court on 14 May 1999 by Judge Phelan on the same charges as those for which the applicant was sentenced. In respect of the two charges under s 90A he was sentenced to a minimum term of 9 months and an additional term of 2 years. In addition his Honour took into account when sentencing Shaw an offence of possession of 0.1 gram of amphetamine on a Form 1 under the provisions of s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In respect of the two assault occasioning actual bodily harm charges Shaw was sentenced to a fixed term of 9 months concurrent with the other offences. 
      
       
     12    On behalf of the applicant it is submitted that having regard to the sentences imposed upon both Boardman and Shaw the applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance as a result of the undue disparity between their sentences and those imposed upon him. It is not suggested that otherwise the sentences imposed upon the applicant were in any way excessive. 
      
       
     13    When sentencing the applicant Judge Moore had before him the sentencing remarks of Judge Phelan in respect of the co-offender Shaw. In sentencing Shaw, Judge Phelan gave him a discount on the basis that Shaw had undertaken to give evidence against the applicant and Boardman. Judge Phelan indicated that, by reason of his cooperation, his Honour had “gone close to giving him the full Cartwright concession”. By that remark it is assumed that his Honour must have meant a discount of about 50 per cent. 
      
       
     14    It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that, in light of the fact that Shaw was to be sentenced for the very same offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced and the additional matter on the Form 1, the sentences imposed upon Shaw could not have been justified by the discount given for the assistance to the authorities. It was submitted that, even if Judge Phelan had given a discount in the order of 50 per cent, which it is said was unwarranted by the assistance offered by Shaw, the disparity between the overall sentence imposed on Shaw and that imposed on the applicant exceeded such a discount. 
      
       
     15    In my view there is no merit in this argument. Mr Hamill, on behalf of the applicant, relied upon the fact that Shaw had an additional matter in respect of which he was to be sentenced that being the matter on the Form 1. In my opinion that matter was of such little consequence as compared with the offences upon which Shaw had been indicted that it would not have sufficiently affected the totality of the criminality before Judge Phelan to have required a longer sentence to be imposed than that which was otherwise required by the offences to which Shaw had pleaded guilty. 
      
       
     16    Judge Phelan made a finding that Shaw was less criminally involved in the attacks upon Ms Burgess and Mr Gallina than was the applicant. In particular his Honour was satisfied that Shaw was not responsible for the injuries inflicted upon Mr Gallina by the hammer. Although it has been suggested on behalf of the applicant that it was in error for Judge Phelan to determine that Shaw was, as a result, seriously involved in what was in effect a common enterprise. In my view he was entitled to come to that view and sentence Shaw accordingly. There is, I believe, a difference in culpability, although it may be only slight, between the person who actually inflicts the injuries and the person who simply stands by watching even in a joint enterprise case. 
      
       
     17    There are other matters which in my view both in respect of the objective seriousness of the offences for which Shaw and the applicant were to be sentenced and in respect of the subjective matters applicable to Shaw, which permitted a less severe sentence to be imposed on him than on the applicant even disregarding the assistance offered by Shaw. These include the fact that, although Shaw initially denied involvement in the offences, he later, after pleading guilty, admitted his involvement in an interview with the police. The only acknowledgment of his responsibility made by the applicant was the pleas of guilty. In the applicant’s pre-sentence report he maintained that he was not guilty of either of the offences under s 90A or of assaulting Mr Gallina. 
      
       
     18    In any event, without coming to a final view on the matter, it is very likely that the sentence imposed by Judge Phelan, particularly so far as the non-parole period is concerned, was inadequate. This is a further reason why this Court should not reduce the sentence of the applicant because of the sentence imposed upon Shaw:  R v Diamond (NSWCCA, 18 February 1993); R v Hopper (NSWCCA, 19 November 1998). 
      
       
     19    In relation to Boardman the most significant matter distinguishing him from the applicant, is that Boardman was to be sentenced by Judge Moore for offences only against Ms Burgess and not against Mr Gallina. There was clearly a very marked difference in the criminality for which the applicant was to be sentenced from that in relation to Boardman arising from the offences committed on 28 January 1999. In particular the injuries inflicted upon Mr Gallina were significant and Judge Moore was entitled to form the view that the applicant was responsible for those injuries either directly or on the basis of the joint criminal enterprise in which he was involved with Shaw. Judge Moore had to sentence Boardman on the basis that he was not involved in any offence against Mr Gallina. 
      
       
     20    True it is that Judge Moore had to sentence Boardman in respect of two other matters unrelated to the offences occurring at the Club premises. But if there is any error in Judge Moore’s sentencing of Boardman, it is that the sentences for those offences were made concurrent with the offences committed against Ms Burgess. Normally it would be expected that an unrelated serious offence would result in a cumulative sentence. But that practice is not immutable. In my view, even if such an error existed, it could not avail the applicant. 
      
       
     21    In any event, it was open to Judge Moore to determine, as he did, that the offences committed by Boardman against Ms Burgess were so serious that the other two offences, having regard to the circumstances in which they occurred, were such that no additional punishment should be inflicted on the applicant by reason of those offences. 
      
       
     22    In my view there is no basis upon which the applicant can justifiably feel aggrieved by the sentence that Boardman received for the kidnapping and assault against Ms Burgess. Whether or not he is aggrieved by the fact that Boardman received no further punishment for the other offences is irrelevant in the circumstances of this case. In my view this ground of appeal fails. 
      
       
     23    I turn now to the second ground of appeal, which, in my opinion, is also without merit. Section 90A provides that the maximum penalty for an offence under that section is 20 years imprisonment or, if it is proved that the person detained was “thereafter liberated without having sustained any substantial injury” imprisonment for 14 years. A “substantial injury” is one which is “more than minor or slight but need not be of a serious kind which would constitute it being grievous bodily harm”: Rowe (1996) 89 A Crim R 467. 
      
       
     24    The applicant is correct in his contention that Judge Moore did not, in expressed terms, determine the question as to whether the lower sentence specified under s 90A applied in light of the injuries suffered by Ms Burgess and Mr Gallina as he should have done. The applicant’s submission is to the effect that, as his Honour failed to determine the question of whether the victims were liberated without having suffered substantial injuries and, therefore, having failed to indicate what maximum sentence applied, the sentencing exercise miscarried. 
      
       
     25    In my view the short answer to that submission, in relation to whether this Court should interfere in the sentencing exercise carried out by Judge Moore, is that even if this Court upheld the ground, no lesser sentence than that imposed by Judge Moore would be warranted and ought to have been imposed. Even if it were accepted, for the sake of argument, that the applicable maximum penalty was 14 years in respect of each of the s 90A offences, the applicant had to be sentenced for two offences under that section and two offences under s 59 which both carried a maximum penalty of 5 years. Although the offences inflicted upon the two victims were part of the same course of criminal conduct, they were quite separate and distinct. As I have already indicated Ms Burgess went to the club on her own volition, but Mr Gallina was brought to the Club so that he could be detained, threatened and assaulted. 
      
       
     26    There was little in mitigation of the objective circumstances of the offences committed by the applicant. He was aged 43 years and had a criminal record which included his being sentenced to imprisonment for offences of dishonesty in 1976. True it was that he was entitled to the benefit of the fact that he had committed no offences of any significant seriousness since his release from that sentence. However, he had shown no remorse for the offences despite his plea of guilty. He was extremely fortunate in my view to have a finding made that there were special circumstances. His Honour found that the applicant had been fully reformed and the probation report indicated that no assistance could be provided by supervision from that service. This finding is confirmed by the material placed before this Court as to the applicant’s progress in custody. There was in my view no need at all for a longer period of parole than that which would follow from the application of s 44 of the Act and no other special circumstance justifying any reduction in the non-parole period let alone a reduction as great as one year. 
      
       
     27    In my view, having regard to the totality of the criminality arising from the offences committed on 28 January, a total sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years was lenient if the maximum penalty for the offences under s 90A was 14 years imprisonment and was verging on the inadequate if the maximum penalty is considered to be 20 years. This is particularly so in respect of the non-parole period which in my view was unjustifiably and overly reduced from that which was otherwise appropriate. If I were to re-sentence the applicant on the basis that the maximum penalty should be 14 years, I would impose a total term as lengthy as that imposed by Judge Moore but I would not find that special circumstances existed and, therefore, a longer non-parole period would be specified. 
      
       
     28    However, even if it were accepted that the sentencing exercise before Judge Moore miscarried by his Honour’s failure to indicate the maximum penalty prescribed, if I were to re-sentence the applicant I would not be satisfied that the victims were not liberated without having suffered substantial injuries. In Rowe at 472, when considering the meaning of “substantial injury” for the purposes of s 90A, Hunt CJ at CL said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The physical injuries which the complainant suffered were minor, but an injury caused to a woman by violence inflicted during or associated with sexual intercourse without consent, and particularly when the woman is being detained against her will, is capable of amounting to serious injury within the meaning of s 90A. It was submitted that ‘injury’, in the context of the Crimes Act, must be physical injury. Be that as it may, an assault which produces minor physical consequences may well become substantial where the circumstances in which it was inflicted (as here) greatly affect its seriousness.” 
         
        
       
     29    The fact that the medical practitioner was of the view that the injuries were “not of a serious nature” does not require the sentencing court to find that the injuries were not substantial. Judge Moore found that although the injuries were not serious, that each of the two victims was submitted to a terrifying experience. The injuries to Ms Burgess were inflicted in circumstances that so terrified her that she was unable to control her bladder. I am not persuaded that there would have been no residual psychiatric condition resulting from the infliction of the injuries notwithstanding some suggestion to the contrary in the remarks of sentence of Shaw by Judge Phelan. There was no doubt that the applicant intended as part of the criminal enterprise in which he was engaged to secure the return of the money, that the victims be terrorised. In my view having regard to the nature of the injuries and the manner in which they were inflicted, I would not be satisfied that either of the victims were released without substantial injuries having been inflicted and, therefore, in my view the appropriate maximum penalty was 20 years imprisonment in each case. 
      
       
     30    I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     31    BARR J: I agree. The orders of the court are those proposed by Justice Howie.

     1    CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree with Badgery-Parker AJ. 
      
       
     2    BADGERY-PARKER AJ: On 16 June 2000 in the District Court, Kitiona Lelei adhered to of pleas of guilty entered in the Local Court on 11 April 2000 to five counts of receiving. The charges were laid under s 189 of the Crimes Act , which relates to receiving, in circumstances where the stealing was “a minor indictable offence”, that is , an offence for which the prescribed maximum penalty is less than five years imprisonment. Under s 189 each charge carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for three years. 
      
       
     3    On each charge his Honour Judge Stewart imposed a sentence of sixteen months imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months. The sentences were to date from 16 June 2000 and to be served concurrently. On 6 September 2000 an application was lodged for leave to appeal against the sentence, together with an application for an extension of time. The Crown did not oppose an extension of time.  
      
       
     4    At the conclusion of the hearing of the application on Monday 7 May, this Court granted an extension of time and leave to appeal, upheld the appeal, and quashed the sentences imposed in the District Court. In lieu thereof, the applicant was sentenced to five concurrent terms of imprisonment for sixteen months, commencing 16 June 2000 and to expire on 15 October 2001, with a non-parole period to expire on 23 March 2001. The Court formally ordered that he be released to parole on 23 March. That date having passed, the effect was that he is no longer on bail and subject to the conditions thereof, but at liberty on parole until 15 October 2001. 
      
       
     5    This judgment states reasons for that decision. 
      
       
     6    The sole ground of appeal stated in the notice of application for leave to appeal was that the sentence was manifestly excessive; but at the hearing, that ground, though not abandoned, was not strongly pressed. We are of the opinion that the sentence was well within the range. 
      
       
     7     Additionally counsel for the applicant relied on a parity argument, submitting that there was inappropriate disparity between the applicant’s sentence and those imposed on a number of co-offenders; it was also argued that the sentencing judge erred in failing to find special circumstances and to make an appropriate adjustment of the relationship between the non-parole period and the parole period. The orders made by the court reflect the rejection of the former submissions and acceptance of the latter. 
      
       
     8    The transactions out of which the charges against the applicant arose involved a large number of offenders who were dealt with at different times and in some instances by different courts. Eight offenders, including the applicant, were sentenced on various dates by Judge Stewart. Of those eight, four appealed their sentences and their appeals were heard by this Court (differently constituted) on 4 December 2000. A ninth offender was initially dealt with in the Local Court, and appealed to the District Court where he was sentenced by Judge O’Reilly.  
      
       
     9     Briefly the facts are these : Sonia Prasad was employed in the workers’ compensation division of AMP General Insurance Limited as a claims officer. She fraudulently initiated payments on claims made against the company. Her computer was used to generate or verify ninety-nine fraudulent cheques. Those cheques were forwarded to twelve receivers of whom the applicant was one. 
      
       
     10    The applicant received five cheques with a total value of $48910. He negotiated them through accounts in his name at two different banks. He banked them and subsequently withdrew the proceeds, part of which he used to pay for an overseas trip; the balance was dissipated in gambling. He claimed (falsely, as the judge found and as was indeed obvious) that he received each of the cheques through an unknown source. He was not a client of AMP; nor did he provide his services to that company; yet he made no inquiry about the cheques. He was sentenced on the basis that he had pleaded guilty at an early stage. At the time of sentencing he had not repaid any money. The judge, in my view rightly, attached little weight to his offer to repay the total sum at the rate of $200 per month.  
      
       
     11    The judge noted a number of subjective factors. In his written submissions in support of this application, counsel summarised them thus- 
      
       
        
         
         “The applicant was described as having ‘ a couple of unrelated minor offences on his criminal records’. His Honour indicated that he did not intend to take those matters into account on sentence. The applicant was born in West Samoa in 1966, migrating to Australia in 1996 from New Zealand. He had been working for the preceding three and a half years as a sheet metal worker and was well regarded by his employer. He wasted the money he took by gambling. The probation officer described him as naive and gullible and as a person who was ‘being overwhelmed by the pace of life in Sydney’. He had the support of his girlfriend, who was expecting their first child in September 2000, as well as the support of his family. The pre-sentence report spoke of him as acknowledging ‘in retrospect the foolishness of his actions’ and that all inquiries pointed to “an out of character set of circumstances”. 
         
        
        
         
        He expressed regret and contrition for his actions. The judge however entertained some doubt as to the genuineness of his claimed contrition 
       . 
        
       
     12    The judge gave express attention to the question of parity in sentencing the applicant. The parity principle recognises that as between co-offenders there should not be such marked disparity as may give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the offender who receives the heavier sentence (Lowe v The Queen 1984 154 CLR 606, especially per Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ at page 608-610). In Ilbay (NSWCCA, unreported 21 June 2000) Grove J said that, in summary, the issue is whether the particular sense of grievance is a legitimate one when the matter is viewed objectively. The courts have from time to time warned against the use of the parity principle to reduce a sentence, because of an apparent disparity with another imposed on a co-offender, to a level which would make it an insufficient sentence, thereby replacing a proper sentence with an inadequate and erroneous one. See for example Regina v Tisalandis (1982) 2 NSWLR 430. 
      
       
     13    Other offenders sentenced by the same judge included-· Laloaoa Milford (three counts of receiving cheques totalling $28860) -18 months imprisonment suspended. 
      
       
     · Bill Isaia ( two counts of receiving cheques totalling $19575) - 18 months imprisonment suspended. 
      
       
     · Luke Mcfarlane (seven counts of receiving cheques totalling $89447) - 2 years imprisonment, suspended. 
      
       
     · Arvind Prakash (five counts of receiving cheques totalling $49521) - 2 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 18 months. 
      
       
     · Anand Krishnan (fourteen counts of receiving cheques totalling $137866) - effected sentence 3 ½ years, with a non-parole period of 18 months. 
      
       
        
       Each of those offenders had pleaded guilty to the charges against him. 
        
        
       
     14    Prakash and Krishnan appealed to this Court. Krishnan’s culpability was obviously very much greater than the others and the sentence imposed upon him offers no assistance in the present case. The appeal by Prakash was successful. He was re-sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen months, suspended. Thus, his sentence was made equal with those imposed on Milford and Isaia. Krishnan’s appeal was also successful and he was re-sentenced, to imprisonment to two and a half years, non-parole period eighteen months.  
      
       
     15    The applicant’s counsel submitted that “there would be a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant if he did not receive a suspended sentence in similar terms to that of his co-offender Prakash and Macfarlane”. The difference between the various sentences must be seen in context. As regards the length of the term of imprisonment imposed, that imposed on the applicant was (both before and after the judgment of Court of Criminal Appeal) the shortest.

       In giving his reasons for upholding Prakash’s appeal, Howie J (with whom Simpson J agreed) said: 
        
        
         
          “…but it seems to me to be disparate with other sentences imposed, particularly as some of those sentences were suspended. For example, I am unable to see why there should be such a discrepancy between the sentences imposed upon this applicant and those imposed upon Mr Lelei. Their criminality and subjective circumstances are not significantly different except that Mr Lelei had some minor record and the applicant was of prior good with character. Further Mr Macfarlane received the same sentence for seven cheques totalling $89447 yet the sentence in his case was suspended. Even taking into account the difference in their ages, I can understand that the applicant would have a justifiable sense of grievance that he was required to serve the substantial part of his sentence in full time custody”.  
         
        
       
     16    That passage reveals that to some extent the shorter term of sixteen months imposed on Lelei was used as a benchmark to determine that the sentence imposed on Prakash was excessive. After that, to use Prakash’s sentence as a benchmark according to which Lelei’s sentence should be reduced creates a somewhat ridiculous cycle. If this applicant should succeed, would it then be open to Prakash to come back to the court and argue that the term of his (suspended) sentence should be reduced? The absurdity is obvious. 
      
       
     17    If regard were had only to the term of the sentences imposed, then there was nothing which could be said to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance such as would justify intervention by this Court in respect of Lelei. The complaint which was made derived such substance as it may be thought to have only from the fact in the cases of Macfarlane and Prakash (after appeal) the sentences initially imposed were suspended (so too, although the point was not made in the course of this appeal, the sentences on Milford and Isaia). 
      
       
     18    It appeared to us that the submission paid insufficient attention to the real punitive nature of a suspended sentence. This Court recently discussed that question in Regina v Michael Foster (NSWCCA (unreported) 28 May 2001 Giles JA James J and Badgery-Parker AJ). It is convenient to repeat what was stated there: 
      
       
        
         
         “Obviously, the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment which is then suspended for the whole of its term is a significantly more lenient sentencing order than the imposition of the like sentence not so suspended. Nevertheless, Australian courts have rejected the idea that a suspended sentence is really no punishment at all. In  
         Elliot v Harris 
          (1976) 13 SASR 516 at 527, Bray CJ commented upon that view- 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘It reveals an entirely mistaken and wrong headed approach to the question of suspended sentences. So far from being no punishment at all, a suspended sentence is a sentence to imprisonment with all the consequences such as sentence involved on the defendant’s record and his future, and it is one which can be called dramatically into effect on the slightest breach of the terms of the bond during its currency.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Those remarks were cited with approval by a full bench of the Federal Court in  
         Regina v P 
          (1992) 64 A Crim R 381; by Winneke P in 
          Regina v Carter 
          (1997) 91 A Crim R 222 at 229; and again by a full bench of the Federal Court in  
         Regina v Gillan 
          (1991) 54 A Crim R 475 at 480.” 
         
        
       
     19    In Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 175 ALR 351, Kirby J stressed that the exercise of the discretion to suspend a sentence of imprisonment was not to be limited “by reference wholly, mainly or specially, to the effect which suspension would have on the offender”. The same considerations as are relevant for the imposition of the term of imprisonment “must be revisited in determining whether to suspend that term. This means that it is necessary to think again about the matters relevant to the circumstances of the offence as well as those personal to the offender”. 
      
       
     20    Nevertheless, in most cases it is the circumstances individual to the offender which will carry the most weight in determining whether a sentence should be suspended. Particularly where similar sentences are imposed upon a series of co-offenders, the subjective circumstances of one may dictate that his sentence should be suspended, whereas in the case of another the subjective circumstances do not necessarily lead to the same outcome.  
      
       
     21     It was appropriate for this Court to look more closely at the circumstances of the applicant Lelei than was perhaps necessary for the court in the earlier appeal. There are some significant differences between the situation of Prakash and the situation of Lelei which the sentencing judge might reasonably have regarded as justifying a different approach. 
      
       
     22     Prakash was described by the judge as having at the time of the offences “unfortunate family and personal circumstances” relating to the premature birth of his son, and the associated $19000 medical bill, received by him at a time when he was on compensation because of an injury which he had himself sustained. His offending was at least in part prompted by what was thought to be necessity whereas, on the other hand, the applicant dissipated the money which he received on personal pleasure.  
      
       
     23    Praskash gave evidence in court as to the involvement of Krishnan and Iese Milford in the fraudulent scheme, whereas, in contrast, the appellant stated in his police interview that he received each of the AMP cheques through an unknown source, an assertion which, as noted above, his Honour found to be false. Not only did he lie about his involvement, but he offered no assistance at all to the authorities. 
      
       
     24    Finally, Prakash had made immediate restitution of a substantial sum which he retained out of the money which he received and had by the time of sentencing entered into a deed to repay $15000 to the insurer. I have noted earlier the position in that regard in relation to this applicant.  
      
       
     25    In the circumstances we were not persuaded that the parity argument is made good and were that the only ground of appeal, we would have dismissed the appeal. 
      
       
     26    The judge at no time referred to the question whether there were special circumstances which would justify a departure from the prima facie rule that the non-parole period should be not less than three quarters of the total term. We accepted the applicant’s submission that there was in this case material requiring consideration of the question of special circumstances in particular that the applicant had not previously served a prison sentence, and his Honour’s express finding that “ this young man has …good prospects of rehabilitation”. The absence of any reference whatsoever to special circumstances, in the light of the existence of those matters to which we have just referred, strongly suggested that the judge erred in not turning his mind to the question of whether the proportion should be varied (Regina v Boo Too NSWCCA, unreported 16 July 1992). In our view, in that regard alone, error was shown, such that this Court should intervene, but only to the extent of making an appropriate adjustment to the length of the non-parole period.  
      
       
     27    We were informed at the hearing of the application for leave to appeal that the applicant had been released on bail pending the appeal on 23 March 2001, by which date he had served few days over nine months of the sentence. In the circumstances, we were of the opinion that it was appropriate to deal with the matter as follows: 
      
       
        
        1. Appeal granted 
        
        
         
         2. Appeal upheld and the sentence imposed in the District Court quashed 
         
        
        
       3. In lieu thereof the applicant should be sentenced in respect of  
        
         
         each count to imprisonment for a term of 16 months commencing 16 June 2000 and to expire on 15 October 2001 with a non-parole period which, having commenced on 16 June 2000 would expire on 23 March 2001 upon which date he would, by order of this court, be released on parole. 
         
        
       
     28    Those were the orders which the court made 7 May 2001 for the reasons set out above.

        REGINA V GEORGE ADRIAN SIMPSON 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    HOWIE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him by Judge Nield at Parramatta District Court on 16 September 1999 following his plea of guilty to an indictment containing three counts being; an offence of break enter and steal contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act; an offence of entering a dwelling house with intent to steal contrary to s 111(1) of that Act and an offence of assault with intent to avoid lawful apprehension contrary to s 58 of the Act. All offences were alleged to have been committed on 8 April 1999. 
      
       
     2    The applicant had originally pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a number of offences and was committed for sentence to the District Court under s 51A of the Justices Act. However, an indictment was presented to the District Court containing the three charges to which I have referred and the applicant pleaded guilty on his arraignment on 24 August 1999. In addition, the applicant asked the sentencing judge to take into account one offence of steal from a dwelling contrary to s 148 of the Crimes Act on a Form 1 pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That offence was committed on 13 April 1999. 
      
       
     3    The maximum penalty in respect of the first offence was imprisonment for 14 years, in respect of the second 10 years, and in respect of the third 5 years. The maximum penalty applicable to the offence on the Form 1 was 7 years imprisonment. All of the offences could have been dealt with summarily before the Local Court. 
      
       
     4    Judge Nield sentenced the applicant on the first count taking into account the Form 1 offence to imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. The sentence and the non-parole period commenced on 13 April 1999, the date upon which the applicant was taken into custody, and the non-parole period was to expire on 12 April 2001. In respect of the other two counts on the indictment, his Honour imposed concurrent sentences on the applicant of fixed terms of 2 years, also commencing on 13 April 1999 and to expire on 12 April 2001. His Honour indicated that the applicant was to be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service whilst on parole. The applicant has been released to parole and the only complaint now made is with the total term specified. 
      
       
     5    The first offence on the indictment occurred in the afternoon of 8 April 1999 at Strathfield. The applicant entered residential premises through a closed but unlocked front door and proceeded into two bedrooms, taking $50 cash from a wallet and $500 worth of retail vouchers. Upon encountering the occupant of the house, the applicant fled through the front door. 
      
       
     6    The applicant then walked to Burwood where the other two offences were committed. He entered a house through the front doorway that had been left tied open with a piece of rope. The applicant proceeded to the front bedroom, but was confronted there by the owner of the premises. The owner’s son came to assist and a struggle ensued. The applicant broke free and ran out of the house with the owner’s son following behind. The applicant threatened the owner’s son saying, “I am not mucking around I mean business”. The pursuer retreated and the applicant made good his escape. 
      
       
     7    Police located the applicant shortly thereafter and, following a pursuit of about five minutes, he was arrested. He was taken to Burwood Police Station where he participated in an electronically recorded interview, during which he told police that he mistook the homes for boarding houses, and denied being in bedrooms in either of the premises. He said that he was attacked in the second house and brandished a knife in order to escape in his own self-defence. 
      
       
     8    The applicant was granted bail later that day. On 13 April 1999, while on bail, the applicant committed the offence of stealing from a dwelling house which was contained on the Form 1. The facts of that matter were that he entered a home in Paddington and took possession of cash in the amount of almost $18,000 and jewellery to the value of $12,000. However, police arrested him in the premises and the property was recovered. In a recorded interview the applicant made full admissions to this offence. He was thereafter refused bail and has remained in continuous custody since then. 
      
       
     9    The applicant is aged 49 and of the Aboriginal race. He has a lengthy record for criminal offences due to his long-standing abuse of alcohol and drugs. In sentencing the applicant, Judge Nield noted that the applicant had up until 1992, spent longer in custody than he had in the community. From 1992 to 1998 the applicant was not before the courts. However, he slid back into criminality in 1998, when in April of that year he broke into a dwelling house with intent to steal and in September he stole property from a dwelling house. It was in respect of each of those two matters the applicant was given the benefit of a deferred sentence upon him entering into a bond to be of good behaviour. He breached those bonds by the commission of the present offences. Judge Nield accepted that his return to crime was attributable to the applicant’s estrangement from his de facto partner of many years. 
      
       
     10    In sentencing the applicant, Judge Nield took into account, as he was obliged to do, that it was an aggravating feature of the criminality before the court that the Form 1 offence was committed by the applicant while on bail for the three offences on the indictment, and that all of the offences were committed in breach of the good behaviour bonds to which I have referred. Although all offences could have been dealt with summarily, this does not necessarily detract from their seriousness in view of these aggravating features. 
      
       
     11    However, because of the applicant’s unfortunate background that was set out in various reports that were in evidence before him and because the applicant had been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia, Judge Nield determined that there were special circumstances because the applicant would require a longer parole period for supervision and treatment. His Honour also recommended that the Department of Corrective Services classify the applicant as on strict protection and that he be provided with appropriate psychiatric and drug and alcohol counselling. 
      
       
     12    The applicant’s first, second and fourth grounds of appeal can be dealt with together. In effect it is contended that the sentence was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances and that this may have been the result of a failure of his Honour to give sufficient weight both to the applicant’s aboriginality and his mental illness. I will deal with these matters after considering the third ground of appeal which contends that the sentencing judge breached the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 by taking into account a matter of aggravation which would have rendered the applicant liable to a greater sentence than that for the offences to which he pleaded guilty. 
      
       
     13    As I have already indicated, the applicant was to be sentenced for three offences including an offence contrary to s 58 of the Crimes Act being an offence of assault with intent to avoid his lawful apprehension. That offence as his Honour expressly stated, carried a maximum penalty of 5 years. However, the facts before his Honour alleged that, when threatening the son of the owner of the second premises who was pursuing him, the applicant pointed a knife or leatherman tool at him and warned that he meant business. Such an allegation would give rise to an offence under s 33B of the Crimes Act of threatening a person with an offensive weapon with intent to avoid lawful apprehension. An offence under that section carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. It is clear from the different maximum penalties prescribed by s 33B and s 58, that the use of an offensive weapon is a substantially aggravating feature of an offence concerned with assaulting a person in order to avoid lawful apprehension. 
      
       
     14    His Honour indicated at the outset of his remarks that the applicant was to be sentenced for an offence of assault with intent to avoid lawful apprehension. But during the course of reciting the facts of the matters before him, his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “However he did threaten Mr Sam Filipo and his son Antonio, and it was his threatening of Messrs Sam and Antonio Filipo with the knife, and I accept that it was the knife and not the pliers of the leatherman tool that he had with him; I know what is a leatherman tool, I have one myself and I have described it to the Crown Prosecutor and the prisoner’s solicitor – that resulted in his arrest.” 
         
        
        
       Immediately thereafter his Honour referred to the maximum penalties for each of the offences and indicated that what he then described as the “assault offence” carried a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. 
        
       
     15    Because the use of an offensive weapon was an aggravating feature which would have made the applicant liable to a more severe sentence, that fact should not have been referred to by his Honour when imposing sentence upon the applicant. Further, there was no evidence that the applicant had threatened the owner of the house at all. His Honour can be forgiven for making the error in relation to the use of the weapon. The facts placed before him by consent included such an allegation, as did the statement of the witness who was threatened, and the recorded interview. Further, the solicitor for the applicant actually raised the matter with his client during the course of the applicant’s evidence by asking why he had pulled a knife out when he ran away. The applicant said that he was scared because the pursuer was too big for him. 
      
       
     16    It is clear, from what his Honour said in the passage of his remarks which I have quoted, that there had been some discussion between the bench and the bar-table about the nature of the weapon used by the applicant. It seems that both the representatives for the Crown and the applicant failed to realise that it was inappropriate for there to be any reference to the allegation of the use of a weapon during the sentencing proceedings. To some extent the facts of the matter and the charge under s 58 did not sit well together because it was clear that it was the threat of the weapon which caused the son to stop his pursuit of the applicant and it was the threat which allowed the applicant to avoid his apprehension. This is no doubt why the applicant was originally, and appropriately, charged by the police with an offence under s 33B. 
      
       
     17    However, for some reason, which is not apparent in the material before this Court, the Crown determined to proceed in the District Court on the less serious offence under s 58. In a case such as this, where the prosecution are prepared to proceed to sentence for an offence of a less serious nature than that for which the accused was originally charged, the prosecution has the onus of ensuring that the facts and evidence placed before the court both support, and are appropriate to, the offence to which the accused pleaded guilty. In this case, if an error occurred, as I believe it did, it was a direct result of the material placed before the sentencing judge and the conduct of those appearing before him. 
      
       
     18    In my view his Honour erred in taking into account the fact that the applicant threatened his pursuer with a knife. True it is that it will not always be the case that the principle in Di Simoni will be infringed simply because the sentencing judge makes some reference to a fact which should not have been taken into account, particularly where the offence and the maximum penalty which applies are properly stated by the judge: R v Adorjany [1999] NSWCCA 37. But in this case much attention appears to have been given to the nature of the weapon used by the applicant and there is more than a passing reference to the matter in his Honour’s remarks. Further, it was such a significantly aggravating matter that I am not confident that the use of a knife by the applicant did not figure in the sentence his Honour imposed. There seems to be no other reason for his Honour to make the finding of fact that it was a knife rather than the more harmless leatherman tool. Although the applicant was given a concurrent sentence for this offence, I am not persuaded that the use of a knife would not have been reflected in the overall-sentence imposed. 
      
       
     19    In my view this ground of appeal should be upheld. This Court must then resentence the applicant. He is now aged fifty years. He is of aboriginal descent and from a deprived background and upbringing. Before the applicant’s father left the family, when the applicant was at a young age, there were instances of violence and sexual abuse upon him. His mother was an alcoholic and he was on occasions abused by her partners after his father left the family. He spent some years in a boys’ home before returning to live with his mother. He left her home in his early teenage years. It was around this time that he was first arrested for stealing. 
      
       
     20    The applicant started drinking alcohol at the age of eight while in a welfare institution and first used heroin at twelve. He was addicted to this drug within about two years and continued to use it and other drugs intermittently, while he continued to abuse alcohol, until he met his defacto partner at the age of forty. He again began to use a range of drugs in the latter half of 1998 after the breakdown of this relationship, and this led to the commission of the offences for which he was sentenced by Judge Nield. 
      
       
     21    In her report of 20 August 1999, Dr Wilcox diagnosed the applicant as suffering from depression after the break up of his relationship. She also noted that he had not developed adequate coping skills due to his years of institutionalisation, and that the distress that resulted had contributed to his drug use. She also concluded that the applicant suffered from schizophrenia. 
      
       
     22    In my view there is little relevance in the fact that the applicant suffers from a psychiatric illness. The psychologist did not believe it contributed the offences committed and I have difficulty in seeing what role it has to play in the sentencing process. Although general deterrence may not be appropriate in a case of a person suffering from a psychiatric illness for humanitarian reasons, I believe that it should be a significant factor in the present case. Nor is specific deterrence irrelevant in light of the fact that the applicant committed the offences while on conditional liberty: Engert (1996) 84 A Crim R 67. 
      
       
     23    The simple fact is that the applicant was a person, who, like so many other offenders in the community, committed property crimes because he was using drugs and needed to support his habit. There is nothing to link his drug and alcohol abuse, which have been so much part of his life since his youth, to the effects of schizophrenia. He was able to avoid drugs and alcohol while in the relationship with his de facto. She gave no evidence to suggest that mental illness caused any significant problems during the relationship. The applicant’s repeated claims to the psychologist, the probation officer and in evidence before his Honour that he committed these offences in order to return to gaol is, in my view, pure humbug, especially in light of his attempts to avoid being apprehended by both the owner’s son and the police, and his denial of the offences when arrested. The applicant in his record of interview appears to be an intelligent and articulate man despite his difficult upbringing. He also showed a degree of cunning in the answers he gave to the police and the defence he set up to the charges.  
      
       
     24    There is little relevance in his case of the matters referred to in Fernando. It has been made clear by both the Chief Judge and other members of this Court that the remarks of his Honour in that case are not authority for the fact that persons of aboriginal abstraction should always receive more lenient sentences or treated in some way different to other members of the community: R v Pitt [2001] NSWCCA 156. The applicant was brought up for some of his youth in an institution and considers himself to be one of the stolen generation. 
      
       
     25    However, the applicant is entitled to the fact that he was able to live a drug and crime free existence for a lengthy period until the spate of offences of which these are a part. But the applicant must receive a significant sentence because of the criminality involved in the matters and his breaches of condition liberty. 
      
       
     26    The applicant is entitled to a discount of 25 per cent of the otherwise appropriate sentence by reason of the plea of guilty and its consequences. 
      
       
     27    I propose that the application for leave be granted, the appeal allowed and the sentences imposed by his Honour be quashed. In lieu on the first count and taking into account the matter on the Form 1 the applicant should be sentenced to 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years. The sentence is to date from 13 April 1999. The applicant has been released to parole. In respect of the second and third counts the applicant should be sentenced to a fixed term of 18 months from 13 April 1999 and which expired on 12 October 2000. A fixed term should be imposed because of the sentence imposed on the first count. 
      
       
     28    BARR J: I agree with Howie J. The order of the court will be as proposed.

      Curnuck v Nitschke 
     1   Meagher JA: I agree both with Fitzgerald AJA and with Davies AJA. In my opinion the orders suggested by Fitzgerald AJA should be made. 
     2   DAVIES AJA: In Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd [1995] 2 AC 145, in which the principal judgment was given by Lord Goff, with whom Lord Keith, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Mustill and Lord Nolan agreed, it was held that duties of care arising under both contract and tort may be owed concurrently and may be sued concurrently. At p 191, Lord Goff cited Le Dain J in Central Trust Co v Rafuse (1986) 31 DLR (4th) 481, where his Honour said, at p 522:- 
      
       
        
        "" 
        A concurrent or alternative liability in tort will not be admitted if its effect would be to permit the plaintiff to circumvent or escape a contractual exclusion or limitation of liability for the act or omission that would constitute the tort. Subject to this qualification, where concurrent liability in tort and contract exists the plaintiff has the right to assert the cause of action that appears to be the most advantageous to him in respect of any particular legal consequence 
        ."" 
        
       
     3   At p 193, Lord Goff rejected the view, expressed by Deane J in Hawkins v Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539 at 585, that there was no justification or need to imply a contractual obligation of care in a contract between a solicitor and his or her client which is coextensive in content and concurrent in operation with the duty of care which exists under the negligence. 
     4   This view was approved and followed by Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ, Callinan J dissenting, in Astley v Austrust Ltd (1999) 197 CLR 1. Their Honours concluded at p 23 that:- 
      
       
        
        ""The theoretical foundations for actions in tort and contract are quite separate. Long before the imperial march of modern negligence law began, contracts of service carried an implied term that they would be performed with reasonable care and skill. Persons who give consideration for the provision of services expect that those services will be provided with due care and skill. Reliance on an implied term giving effect to that expectation should not be defeated by the recognition of a parallel and concurrent obligation under the law of negligence. The evolution of the law of negligence has broadened the responsibility of professional persons and requires them to take reasonable care and skill even in situations where a contractual relationship cannot be established."" 
        
       
     5   The rejection of the view expressed by Deane J in Hawkins v Clayton led McPherson AJA to say, in Heydon v NRMA Ltd (2000) 36 ACSR 462 at 567-568, that the decision in Waimond Pty Ltd v Byrne (1989) 18 NSWLR 642 of Kirby P and Hope AJA, Mahoney JA dissenting, was no longer good law. 
     6   However, I do not read the decisions in Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd and Astley v Austrust Ltd as leading to that conclusion. The fact that the causes of action in tort and contract may be concurrent does not mean that their incidents are necessarily the same. Under contract law, duty turns upon the terms, scope and context of the contract. Under torts law, issues of proximity and foreseeability are crucial to liability. Public policy may play a part. And there are many other differences. The respective laws on damages are different. The principles of contributory negligence and contribution differ as between the causes of action. The limitation periods may be different. A plaintiff is entitled to sue in both contract and in tort or in either, and may choose the best result. 
     7   Waimond Pty Ltd v Byrne seems to me to be well based upon the principle enunciated in Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd and Astley v Austrust Ltd. In that case, the duty of a solicitor to speak with his client with respect to a certain transaction did not arise from his contractual retainer. It arose out of the relationship of proximity which existed between the solicitor and his client. The solicitor knew that a transaction, which he had been instructed to carry out for another client, affected the interests of his client. The majority of the Court considered that the circumstances were such that the solicitor had a duty to check with his client or to advise him to seek independent advice. 
     8   It is one thing to say, where a solicitor has a contractual relationship with a client and where the matter in issue arises within the scope of the retainer, that there will be no difference between the duty of care imposed by the contract and that imposed by the law of negligence. It is another thing to say that, in respect of a matter which is beyond the scope of the contract, a tortious duty of care may not arise from the relationship between the parties. 
     9   In Australia, there have been several cases where a duty of care has been imposed upon solicitors notwithstanding that the solicitor's retainer did not impose that duty. (See Hawkins v Clayton; Hill v Van Erp (1997) 188 CLR 159; and Waimond Pty Ltd v Byrne.) 
     10   In the present case, I am content to assume that the respondents (""the solicitors"") had no contractual obligation to take any further action to pursue the appellants' cause of action. The appellants had not contacted them after the reassignment of the cause of action and had not undertaken financial responsibility for the institution of proceedings. However, that is not to say that the solicitors had no duties in relation to the appellants. The solicitors were aware that the cause of action had been reassigned to the appellants. They were the bailees of the appellants' cause of action, insofar as that cause of action consisted of legal papers. They were aware that the documents remained with them because they were the solicitors who had handled the matter. They were aware, moreover, that the cause of action which their file represented would become valueless with the passing of the six year limitation period. 
     11   In the circumstances, there was a sufficient relationship of proximity between the appellants and the solicitors and a sufficient foreseeability of loss to the appellants should the solicitors fail to act to cast upon them a duty of care to warn the appellants that, if they did not institute proceedings prior to the expiry of the limitation period, their cause of action would be lost. A significant factor is the vulnerability of the appellants. The limitation period was not a matter of general knowledge but of legal knowledge. The solicitors must have been well aware that, if they did not bring the limitation period to the appellants' notice, the appellants could suffer harm through ignorance. The solicitors, who had handled the case on the appellants' behalf and who still held the file, were in a position to guard the appellants against the loss to which they were vulnerable. 
     12   I need not discuss the theoretical basis for the imposition of a duty of care in such a case. The principles upon which a court should act in imposing a duty of care in a case where a negligent act or omission may cause economic harm to another were discussed in detail in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd (1999) 73 ALJR 1190. I have been guided by the judgments of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ in that case.  
     13   It is not in dispute that, if the solicitors had held an active retainer from the appellants, they would have been obliged to institute proceedings on behalf of the appellants within the limitation period or to warn the appellants of the consequences of allowing the limitation period to pass. It is not in dispute that, in considering duties of care arising under tort and contract, courts have imposed upon professional practitioners a duty to give an appropriate warning in respect of matters of which the client should be informed (see Rogers v Whitaker (1992) 175 CLR 479; and Chappel v Hart (1998) 72 ALJR 1344). 
     14   In the circumstances of the present case, I am satisfied that the solicitors had a duty to warn the appellants that, if they did not institute proceedings within the limitation period, their cause of action would become unenforceable. The judgment below should be set aside and there should be a declaration accordingly. 
     15   Fitzgerald AJA: On 4 July 1984 the appellants (the clients) purchased a truck from Mercedes Benz (Australia) Pty Limited. The clients were dissatisfied with the operation of the truck. On or about 23April 1986, they consulted the respondents (the solicitors). All discussions and communications took place between one of the clients, Alan Harold Curnuck, and one of the solicitors, John Hayden Williams.  
     16   On 23 April 1986, Mr Williams wrote to Mr Curnuck providing preliminary legal advice and requesting further information. It is common ground that, as pleaded by the clients, an oral agreement was made at about that time between the clients and the solicitors whereby the clients retained the solicitors to advise in relation to a possible claim for damages for breach of contract against the vendor of the truck. Indeed, the solicitors’ written submissions assert that their “retainer to advise [was] expanded so that [they] were retained to institute and maintain proceedings against Mercedes upon the [clients] providing the [solicitors] with sufficient instructions, as to the proposed Defendants’ breaches, and as to the losses suffered by the [clients] as a result thereof, to permit proceedings to be commenced and maintained.” 
     17   The solicitors did not commence proceedings on behalf of the clients against the vendor of the truck within the period permitted by the Limitation Act 1969. Further, they did not advise the clients that the cause of action against the vendor of the truck would become statute-barred if proceedings were not commenced prior to the expiration of that period.  
     18   The clients sued the solicitors for damages for breach of contract and negligence in the District Court at Parramatta. Their action was dismissed with costs on 12 May 2000. This appeal is brought by the clients from that judgment.  
     19   Mr Williams died prior to trial, and Mr Alan Curnuck was the only witness. His evidence was rejected by the trial judge. However, there is a considerable body of reliable documentary evidence. 
     20   By letter dated 18 July 1986, Mr I Harrison, the barrister retained by the solicitors on behalf of the clients, forwarded the solicitors a draft Statement of Claim which was complete except for “Particulars of the faults and defects complained of… set forth in the Schedule annexed hereto and marked ‘A’” and “Particulars of the Plaintiff’s loss and damage… set forth in the Schedule annexed hereto and marked with the letter ‘B’.” In his letter, counsel said: - 
      
       
        
        “Y 
        ou will.. have observed that I have not completed the Schedules to which the document refers. First, I should prefer to have the Plaintiffs or one of them prepare a document which sets out in detail the faults and defects with the truck which the Plaintiffs have experienced. Some of the defects and the faults referred to in the handwritten statement with which I am briefed are expressed colloquially and in any event I do not pretend to be sufficiently familiar with the mechanical specifications of the truck concerned to be confident in the compiling of a list of the subject particulars… 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, I am not briefed with any details of loss and damage upon the basis of which I could settle particulars for inclusion in the Schedule “B”. The preparation of these particulars will no doubt prove to be a long and difficult task but one which is crucial to the success of the proceedings should they be instituted.  
        
       
     21   Mr Harrison’s letter also referred to the possibility raised by the solicitors that the clients might seek to sue the vendor of the truck for damages for misrepresentation and said: - 
      
       
        
        “ 
        Whether or not such a cause of action is available to the Plaintiffs will depend upon obtaining further information from them. If the only representation of which the Plaintiffs complain is that the truck was to be sold with a new truck warranty when in fact the Defendant has complied with obligations imposed upon it only in accordance with the terms of its used truck warranty, then a claim in deceit would not appear to be appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        It may be the position that the Plaintiffs have a cause of action under certain Sections of the Trade Practices Act, 1974. In order to institute proceedings for relief under that Act the Plaintiffs will have to commence in the Federal Court of Australia. I should be pleased in due course to have your comments upon the commencement of proceedings in that jurisdiction. Obviously the litigation would take a different course if that procedure were adopted…” 
        
       
     22   On 29 July 1986, the solicitors wrote to the clients in the following terms: - 
      
       
        
        “ 
        Re:  
        Mercedes Benz 
        
       
       
        
        In order that we might have the Statement of Claim issued in this matter we would appreciate if, as soon as possible, you would commit to writing the following:- 
        
       
       
        
        1. Full details and particulars of all defects complained of in relation to the relevant vehicle; 
        
       
       
        
        2 The total schedule of all your actual losses to date. 
        
       
       
        
        We look forward to your early submission of the document.  
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
       
     23   The position which had been reached by 1 April 1987 appears from Mr Harrison’s letter of that date to the solicitors, which provided: - 
      
       
        
        “ 
        CURNUCK & ORS v MERCEDES BENZ (AUSTRALIA) PTY LIMITED. 
        
       
       
        
        I enclose Schedule “A” for annexure to the draft Ordinary Statement of Claim originally prepared by me. 
        
       
       
        
        I have not been furnished with any information upon the basis of which the proposed schedule ‘B’ could be prepared and accordingly I have deleted reference to that Schedule where it appears under the heading ‘Particulars’ in paragraph 9 to the draft Statement of Claim. This, of course, only postpones the problem and at some time an expert (preferably the Plaintiff’s accountant) will have in detail to turn some attention to the question of quantification of the loss. I note in passing that this issue will no doubt to some extent be complicated by the fact that the truck was involved in a motor vehicle accident causing substantial damage on 27 March, 1986.” 
        
       
       
     24   After the alteration made by counsel, the draft statement of claim included the following “particulars” in relation to damages: - 
      
       
        
        “ 
        Particulars of the Plaintiffs’’ loss and damage exceed three folios and full details of such loss and damage will be furnished under cover of letter in due course.” 
        
       
     25   On 3 April 1987, the solicitors wrote the following letter to the clients: - 
      
       
        
        “ 
        Re:  
        Mercedes Benz Australia Pty Limited 
        
       
       
        
        We enclose herewith a photostat copy of the Statement of Claim which  
        we intend to issue 
         in this matter and a photostat copy of the faults and defects which we would appreciate if you check together with the Statement of Claim to make certain that the same is in line with your instructions given to us.  
        [Underlining added]. 
        
       
       
        
        As you will see by perusal of the Statement of Claim it is necessary for us to provide the defendant with the loss and damage which has flowed to you as a result of the vehicle being unable to carry out its commitments to you. 
        
       
       
        
        We would suggest that as there is a considerable amount of money involved you should immediately make an appointment with your accountants and get down to the nitty gritties of formulating what the actual loss is. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        We look forward in your own interests to having the relevant particulars as soon as is possible.” 
        
       
       
     26   On 1 July 1987, Mr Harrison again wrote to the solicitors in the following terms: - 
      
       
        
        “RE: CURNUCK V. MERCEDES BENZ (NSW) PTY LIMITED 
        
       
       
        
        I refer to your recent correspondence seeking advice in this matter. I am not certain I understand what it is that there remains to be provided by me.  
         I note that the statement of claim and further particulars prepared by me would enable you to commence the proceedings.  
        . 
        
       
       
        
        In the circumstances, whilst my brief contains certain original material, I have taken the liberty of returning the brief to you. Should there be any outstanding matters which require attention you might care to contact me by telephone in order that no delays might be occasioned.” 
        
       
       
     27   On 7 July 1987 the solicitors wrote the following letter to the clients: - 
      
       
        
        “ 
        Re: Mercedes Benz. 
        
       
       
        
        We enclose herewith photostat copies of all handwritten matter held by Mr. Harrison of Counsel. 
        
       
       
        
        We would appreciate having your instructions as soon as possible.” 
        
       
       
     28   The clients experienced financial difficulties. On 29 July 1987, the solicitors wrote to a firm of accountants, Messrs Gagie and Jones. The solicitors’ letter, which referred to a number of disputes involving the clients, provided as follows: - 
      
       
        
        “Re: Curnuck and Curnuck Bros. 
        
       
       
        
        We understand that a meeting pursuant to part 10 is to be held in relation to the abovenamed at the Riverine Club Wagga Wagga on the 24th August next. 
        
       
       
        
        We would advise that we presently hold instructions to endeavour to recover a considerable sum of money from Mercedes Benz (Australia) Pty. Ltd. 
        
       
       
        
        The proposed action arises out of a sale by that company to our clients of an expensive Mercedes Benz Commercial Vehicle which was according to our instructions, sold with a “new vehicle” warranty. 
        
       
       
        
        We have had considerable difficulty in obtaining the appropriate evidence as to exact loss but recently have been supplied with information which makes the task in that regard somewhat easier. 
        
       
       
        
        There can be no certainty whatsoever that the action would be successful and we believe that this is a matter which should be canvassed with the Creditors.  
        
       
       
        
        Mr A. Curnuck has had a conference with Mr. Ian Harrison of Counsel who has a brief in the matter. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Having regard to the now circumstances of the matter we will take no further steps in any of these matters until such time as we have your advice.” 
        
       
       
     29   On 10 August 1987, the clients agreed at a meeting of the creditors under Part X of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Commonwealth) to enter into a Deed of Arrangement appointing Mr Gagie as Trustee. 
     30   On 27 August, the solicitors wrote to Messrs Gagie and Jones in relation to the clients’ complaint against the vendor of the truck and another matter. That letter provided: - 
      
       
        
        “ 
        Re: Curnuck Bros re: ..2. Mercedes Benz Aust Pty. Ltd. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The other matter relating to Mercedes Benz is one with some more merit. 
        
       
       
        
        We would suggest that a firm opinion should be taken from Mr. Ian Harrison of Counsel with whom we previously discussed this matter and who is currently considering certain aspects of it. 
        
       
       
        
        For a cost of $150.00 to $200.00 we believe an opinion should be obtained from him in relation to the merits of the matter and to consider whether he believes that it is in the interests of the creditors for the matter to pursue. 
        
       
       
        
        If you would wish us to obtain that opinion, we would appreciate having your instructions.” 
        
       
     31   On 31 August 1987 Messrs Gagie and Jones instructed the solicitors to obtain an opinion from counsel “regarding the merits of pursuing the matter relating to Mercedes Benz”. 
     32   On 3 September 1987 Mr Harrison wrote to the solicitors in the following terms: - 
      
       
        
        “KURNUCK and MERCEDES BENZ. 
        
       
       
        
        I refer to the above matter. I note that I have previously prepared and forwarded to you a draft Statement of Claim for commencement of proceedings in the District Court of New South Wales. 
        
       
       
        
        Having considered the material upon the basis of which that document was prepared I am of the view that the Plaintiff has reasonable prospects of succeeding in the matter. I am unable with any accuracy to determine what is the likely or probable quantum of the Plaintiff’s loss, however, and you will recall that that portion of the Statement of Claim referring to or containing particulars of loss remains yet to be completed following instructions from your clients.” 
        
       
       
        
       
     33   The clients executed the Deed of Arrangement of 10 September 1987. Clause 5(b) of the deed provided: - 
      
       
        
        “ 
        5. The [clients] convey and assign to the Trustee all their interest in the following contingent assets: - 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Claim against Mercedes Benz (in the sum of $184,000.00);

         X of [ 
        The Bankruptcy] Act for the benefit of the creditors of the [clients] and as to any surplus after paying in full the several debts and liabilities of the [clients] proved under this Deed together with the costs, charges and expenses of and incidental to the execution of the trusts of this Deed (including the remuneration and expenses of the trust Deed) UPON TRUST for the [clients]…” 
        
       
     34   On 15 September 1987, the solicitors wrote to Messrs Gagie and Jones as follows: - 
      
       
        
        “RE: Curnuck and re Mercedes Benz. 
        
       
       
        
        We enclose herewith a photostat copy of Mr. Harrison’s letter of the 3rd inst which is self explanatory. 
        
       
       
        
        We would appreciate having your advice as to whether we are to proceed with the matter.  
        
       
       
        
        We are seeking the further particulars from Mr. Allan Curnuck.” 
        
       
       
     35   On the same day, the solicitors wrote to the clients in the following terms: - 
      
       
        
        “ 
        Re: Mercedes Benz. 
        
       
       
        
        Because of the insolvency we require the written instruction of the Trustee before this matter can be proceeded further with. 
        
       
       
        
        Herewith we enclose a copy of schedule “A” which sets out all the defects of the vehicle as previously instructed by you. 
        
       
       
        
        We also enclose other documents which may be of assistance to you. 
        
       
       
        
        What is now required, as in the ultimate it will be necessary for you to give evidence as to the same, is for the exact cost of the various repairs to be set out and to have the names and addresses of the persons to whom such repair costs were paid. 
        
       
       
        
        We would also appreciate if for the same purpose, you would commit to writing exactly what you believe your loss to be upon the basis of say two trips per week or whatever, less running costs, labour and fuel and depreciation and any other damage whatsoever that you can quantify. 
        
       
       
        
        We would appreciate if you would let us have this as soon as possible. 
        
       
       
     36   On 7 October 1987, Messrs Gagie and Jones wrote to the solicitors requesting a copy of the draft statement of claim and stating that the Trustee was “..considering the appropriate line of action to follow” and that the solicitors would be advised in due course. 
     37   The solicitors forwarded a copy of the statement of claim to Messrs Gagie and Jones on 12 October 1987. 
     38   On 5 November 1987, Messrs Gagie and Jones wrote to the solicitors requesting Mr Williams to attend a proposed meeting of the Committee of Inspection to be held on 20 November 1987 to “..offer.. advice as to the merits of proceeding ..in the clients’ claim against the vendor of the truck…, to outline to the committee the steps involved in continuing with legal action” and to provide “a summary of the costs, time and procedure involved in pursuing legal action…” 
     39   On the same date, Messrs Gagie and Jones wrote another letter to Mr Williams “as a member of the Committee of Inspection” informing him of developments. 
     40   On 6 November 1987, the solicitors wrote to Messrs Gagie and Jones as follows: - 
      
       
        
        “ 
        Re: Curnuck Bros re Mercedes Benz Australia. 
        
       
       
        
        If this action were to be maintained we believe that it could be commenced in the District Court where the present delay in Wagga is in the order of 18 months from the date of commencement of the action. 
        
       
       
        
        As you are aware Mr. Harrison of Counsel has indicated that subject to the Plaintiff’s evidence being accepted by the tribunal an action is maintainable. 
        
       
       
        
        The key to the matter is whether the court would be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that in fact as a condition of the purchase the proposed defendant company gave ‘a new vehicle warranty’. 
        
       
       
        
        Here again the evidence in relation to the transaction is almost entirely that of Mr. Allan Curnuck in relation to whose status as a witness we have previously averted. 
        
       
       
        
        Unlike the Barclay Mowlem matter, one could be excused for thinking that this company may be prone to settle the matter rather than to have the publicity of an action of that nature contemplated by the Messrs. Curnuck. 
        
       
       
        
        Again because of virtual total lack of records and inability to pinpoint contractual losses, proving the quantum of the claim may present serious difficulties. 
        
       
       
        
        Again your Committee should consider the question of costs. 
        
       
       
        
        We believe that it is a matter which to be properly prepared would take 1 1/2 to 2 days. 
        
       
       
        
        If the action was so far as the Plaintiff is concerned, unsuccessful, costs involved could be $12,000.00 to $15,000.00. 
        
       
       
        
        We would appreciate if following our meeting with the Committee we could have your further instructions.” 
        
       
       
     41   At a meeting of the committee of inspection on 20 November 1987, at which Mr Williams was not present according to the minutes, correspondence from him relating to the clients’ claims was tabled. It was resolved:  
      
       
        
        “That the Trustee assign to Messrs A., I. & M. Curnuck all his rights and interests in relation to the subject legal action against Mercedes Benz Australia…on the basis that the assignees agree that in the event of a successful action, one-half (1/2) of the proceeds, after deducting relevant legal costs, be paid to the Trustee for the benefit of creditors.” 
         
        
       
     42   On 23 November 1987 Messrs Gagie and Jones wrote to the solicitors requesting them to “draw up an appropriate Deed of Conditional Assignment in order to effect the wishes of the Committee of Inspection.” 
     43   The solicitors forwarded a draft document by letter dated 26 November 1987 to Messrs Gagie and Jones.  
     44   By a Deed which was dated 23 February 1988 in the form of the draft prepared by the solicitors, the Trustee assigned “..all .. his rights in the choses in action” referred to in the deed, including that against the vendor of the truck, to the clients, who agreed that in the event of their action being successful and monies being recovered by them they would repay to the trustee “one half of all monies received by judgment or settlement, less any costs and disbursements incurred in the maintenance and prosecution of the said action”. 
     45   Subsequently, the solicitors received the following letter dated 23 March 1988 from Messrs Gagie and Jones (then Gagie, Jones and Sistrom): 
      
       
        
        “Re: Insolvent Estate of M., A. H. & I. J. Curnuck - Debtors 
        
       
       
        
        I refer to the draft Deed of Assignment document prepared by yourself in relation to the above matter and advise that this has now been completed.  
        
       
       
        
        I take this opportunity to thank you for your assistance in this matter and look forward to receiving your Fee Account.” 
         
        
       
       
     46   Neither the clients or the solicitors took any further steps before the limitation period expired more than two years later. 
     47   Mr Alan Curnuck finally contacted Mr Williams on 20 September 1990. Later that day, Mr Williams wrote to him in the following terms: - 
      
       
        
        “ 
        Re: Mercedes Benz Australia Pty Ltd 
        
       
       
        
        We refer to our conversation of even date. 
        
       
       
        
        As you would appreciate a lengthy period of time has expired but it is the writer’s hazy recollection that he was advised verbally by Messrs. Gagie and Jones that the committee was not mindful to fund the action. 
        
       
       
        
        As a result, we have had no further instructions in relation to the matter and of course, have had no contact whatsoever with you until this day.” 
        
       
     48   Mr Williams wrote another letter to the clients on 26 September 1990 in which he stated: - 
      
       
        
        “ 
        RE: YOU & OTHERS RE MERCEDES BENZ 
        
       
       
        
        We refer to our two conversations in relation to this matter. 
        
       
       
        
        It is, in the first instance, noted that the figures and calculations required to complete Schedule B of the proposed Statement of Claim, as sought in our letters of the 29th July, 1986, the 3rd April, 1987, 7th July, 1987 and the 15th September, 1987 have not been provided by you or your accountants. 
        
       
       
        
        As pointed out to you, both by Counsel and the writer on more than one occasion, the matter cannot properly be brought before the Court until those figures are prepared and verified in as much details as is possible.  
        
       
       
        
        Bearing in mind the fact that you are so far away and time is of the essence, we are of the opinion that it probably would be in your interests to have the matter prepared by Solicitors closer to you. 
        
       
       
        
        There are, of course, as you are well aware, some problems in relation to the question of whether the action is statute barred. 
        
       
       
        
        The Hire Purchase Agreement, through which you acquired the vehicle bears date the 24th July, 1984. 
        
       
       
        
        If that were the be all and end all date then, quite clearly, you would be statute barred. 
        
       
       
        
        The situation however is, as we see it, that it was not until sometime about the 4th July, 1985 that the real problem became apparent and it became apparent to you that the vehicle was not ever going to be right. 
        
       
       
        
        We would look to having your confirmation that at about that time, you took up the question of the company’s liability with it and, that when you gave us instructions on the 23rd April, 1986, the matter was still the question of negotiation between you and the company. 
        
       
       
        
        If that be the situation, then we believe that the starting point might well be the date upon which the negotiation were entered into. 
        
       
       
        
        If you could ascertain that and advise us, we could finally give you our opinion. 
        
       
       
        
        Again, we point out that speed on your part is necessary, and again we point out that the mathematical calculation either by you or your accountants must be in order before the appropriate Statement of Claim can issue. 
        
       
       
        
        We would appreciate if you could consider all matters and we look forward to having your advice as soon as possible.” 
        
       
     49   It is common ground that the limitation period applicable to an action by the clients against the vendor of the truck had expired prior to September 1990. 
     50   Apart from his rejection of Mr Alan Curnuck’s evidence, the principal findings made by the trial judge were: - 
      
       
        
        (a) “. 
        .even if, as was alleged by Mr Kurnuck, one accepted that he never told Mr Kurnuck about the time limit and what it was, and to be able to commence proceedings, the fact that the time limit was not explained, was not, in my view, any cause of the loss that the [clients] suffered because this was a loss which [they] brought upon himself by the total failure to take the necessary action to ensure that proceedings could be commenced on [their] behalf.” 
        
       
       
        
        (b) “ 
        … There is no doubt that [Mr Curnuck] went back to see Mr Williams. The question is what in fact occurred at that stage? Some indication of this may be gleaned from the documents which were tendered by the [solicitors] setting out the correspondence of the parties at that time. I have reached the conclusion that there was no resurrection of instructions after the Trustee in Bankrupt (sic) relinquished his entitlement to take the proceedings again (sic) Mr Williams. But Mr Williams may at some stage have been quite prepared to have a look at the case again, provided he got some information. It is possible, but I find that he received no further instructions, and that he had no continuing obligations after the Trustee in Bankruptcy took over, and at the time when the [clients] had [their] rights restored to [them]. I find that [Mr Curnuck] never instructed Mr Williams to commence proceedings or provided him with any information which would enable him to do so after the Trustee in Bankruptcy’s action, just as he had not provided that information to Mr Williams before the Trustee in Bankruptcy took over.” 
         
        
       
       
        
        (c) (i) “[Mr Alan Curnuck]  
        knew from his own knowledge that there was such a limitation period 
        ”, and 
        
       
       
       
        
         (ii) 
          
        “ 
        [Mr Alan Curnuck] well knew about this time limit, and a failure to advise him about the time limit was not in any way a cause of any loss that the [clients] suffered.” 
         
        
       
     51   The trial judge did not expressly find whether or not the clients were aware that proceedings had not been issued at the time when the limitation period expired. However, it seems implicit in his judgment, including his rejection of Mr Alan Curnuck’s evidence that Mr Williams incorrectly informed him that he had issued a statement of claim, that the clients failed to establish to his Honour’s satisfaction that they were unaware that proceedings had not been issued until after the limitation period expired. 
     52   Despite the disadvantages commonly associated with such a course and over the solicitors' objection, the trial judge ordered that “liability be decided before damages”. One difficulty created by that decision, which does not seem to have been formalised, is that it leaves uncertain what issues were intended to be tried. In Morgan v Tame (2000) 49 NSWLR 21, Spigelman CJ, with whom Handley JA agreed, identified five “analytically distinct elements of the tort of negligence - forseeability, ‘proximity’, breach, causation and damage”. Although the tort of negligence is not complete until a breach has caused loss, causation is generally considered to be an aspect of “damages”, not “liability”, in both tort and contract claims. It is therefore reasonable to assume that, as a result of the ruling that “liability be decided before damages”, issues relating to damages, including the issue of causation, were not fully investigated. Nonetheless, his Honour made findings concerning the clients’ knowledge in dealing with causation. While some of those findings might also have been material to the issue of the clients’ contributory negligence which had been pleaded by the solicitors, contributory negligence is not discussed in the judgment. In the circumstances the only issue which can be satisfactorily resolved in this Court is whether the solicitors breached their duty to the clients. That issue must be decided on the basis that, if the clients had potentially material knowledge, there is no evidence or finding that the solicitors were aware of what the clients knew. 
     53   The solicitors were advised by counsel by his letter of 1 July 1987 that they were in a position to institute proceedings against the vendor of the truck by using the statement of claim and particulars which he had prepared. There is nothing to indicate that the solicitors disagreed with that advice or that it was incorrect. Earlier, on 3 April 1987, the solicitors had provided the clients with a copy of the statement of claim, which, they informed the clients, they intended to issue. 
     54   Shortly after they received counsel’s letter of 1 July 1987 (at the latest), the solicitors became aware that the clients proposed to sign a Deed of Arrangement. Some months later, in March 1998, the solicitors became aware that the cause of action against the vendor of the truck which the clients had assigned to their Trustee by the Deed of Arrangement had been reassigned to them by the Trustee. There is nothing to indicate that the solicitors did not then still have the clients’ file, that they had rendered their account or that their costs had been paid. 
     55   There was no material breach of duty by the solicitors up to that time. More than 2 years remained within which the clients’ proceeding against the vendor of the truck could be commenced.  
     56   Conversely, subject to an argument by the solicitors which is discussed below, when the clients’ claim against the vendor of the truck was reassigned to the clients to the knowledge of the solicitors, they had a duty either to commence proceedings on behalf of the clients against the vendor of the truck within the limitation period or, if they were unwilling to act for the clients, to inform the clients of their decision and to advise them of the limitation period. 
     57   However, the solicitors submitted that their duty to the clients under the law of tort was co-extensive with their contractual obligation to the clients under their retainer from the clients and that they had no duty to the clients, in contract or under the law of tort, to give advice other than that which they were retained to give: Heydon v NRMA (2000) 36 ACSR 462, [147], [148], [309], [364], [365] and [678]. While the solicitors did not submit that advice in relation to the Limitation Act was outside the scope of their retainer while it subsisted, they argued that their retainer was terminated and their contractual obligations to the clients (including their contractual obligation to give advice) ceased when the clients executed the Deed of Arrangement. Because their duty to the clients under the law of tort was no more extensive than their contractual obligations to the clients and their contractual obligations had terminated when the clients signed the Deed of Arrangement, the solicitors had no duty to the clients under the law of tort after the clients’ claim against the vendor of the truck was reassigned to them.  
     58   Even if the solicitors' duty to the clients under the law of tort was no broader than their contractual obligations while their retainer subsisted, it would not follow that the solicitors had no duty to the clients under the law of tort after their contract terminated. As Hill v Van Erp (1997) 188 CLR 159 exemplifies, a solicitor can have a duty under the law of tort to a person who is not a client. The applicable legal principle is succinctly stated in the following passage in the majority judgment in Astley Ltd v Austrust Ltd (1999) 197 CLR 1 at [48]: -  
      
       
        
        “ 
        The evolution of the law of negligence has broadened the responsibility of professional persons and requires them to take reasonable care and skill even in situations where a contractual relationship cannot be established.” 
        
       
     59   Not surprisingly, it was not submitted by the solicitors that the clients were disentitled to any protection which the law of tort would have otherwise provided because they had previously been clients of the solicitors. On the contrary, the relationship of solicitor and client which had existed and, on the solicitors' argument, had terminated, was one of the circumstances to be considered in determining whether the solicitors owed a duty to the clients after their claim against the vendor of the truck was reassigned to them. These circumstances, including the forseeability of damages to the clients if the limitation period expired without the institution of proceedings against the vendor of the truck, require a conclusion that, after the cause of action against the vendor of the truck was reassigned to the clients, the solicitors had a duty to the clients under the law of tort notwithstanding the clients’ earlier signature of the Deed of Arrangement. The solicitors breached that duty by their failure to notify the clients of their decision not to act on the clients’ behalf in relation to their cause of action against the vendor of the truck (if the solicitors ever made such a decision) or to warn the clients of the limitation period. 
     60   Since contributory negligence by the clients would be material if the solicitors breached only their duty to the clients under the law of tort and not a contractual obligation which they owed to the clients (Astley Ltd v Austrust Ltd (1999) 197 CLR 1), it is necessary to consider whether the solicitors also breached a contractual obligation to the client. 
     61   The clients’ signature of the Deed of Arrangement to the knowledge and with the cooperation of the solicitors withdrew the clients’ instructions to the solicitors to issue proceedings against the vendor of the truck on behalf of the clients and ended the solicitors’ authority to do so. However, even if the solicitors' instructions to commence proceedings on behalf of the clients were not reinstated when the solicitors were informed that the clients’ cause of action against the vendor of the truck had been reassigned to them, the Deed of Arrangement had not terminated the relationship of solicitor and client between the solicitors and the clients, ended their contract, disentitled the solicitors to payment under the contract for services which they had rendered or released them from all further contractual obligations to the clients.  
     62   The solicitors' letters in September 1990 tend to confirm that their relationship with the clients continued after the clients signed the Deed of Arrangement. Mr Williams’ “hazy recollection” in his first letter, dated 20 September 1980, was plainly incorrect. That is not surprising. There had been no contact with the clients from more than 2 years. His other letter, about a week later after he had time to reflect, did not suggest that he thought that the solicitors had ceased to act for the clients. On the contrary, although the statement of claim which counsel had prepared for the solicitors to institute proceedings on behalf of the clients against the owner of the truck no longer proposed that particulars be inserted in Schedule B, Mr Williams’ letter of 26 September reverted to the clients’ omission to provide details for inclusion in Schedule B as an explanation for the solicitors' inactivity. That letter also contained a suggestion that it might be prudent for the clients to engage another solicitor whose practice was located more conveniently to the clients, gave advice about the limitation period and offered a more considered opinion on that subject if additional information was provided.  
     63   The solicitors' submission that they had no contractual obligation to the clients after they executed the Deed of Arrangement should be rejected. The solicitors were obliged by their retainer to provide the clients with information and advice which was appropriate for a prudent finalisation of their relationship if that was to occur. The solicitors breached their contractual obligation to the clients by failing either to institute proceedings against the vendor of the truck or to give the clients appropriate advice before the limitation period expired. 
     64   The appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment below should be set aside. It should be declared that the solicitors breached their contractual duty and their duty under the law of tort to the clients. The action should be remitted to the District Court for it to be determined whether the solicitors' breach caused the clients any loss. The costs of the District Court proceedings should be reserved to the judge who determines the issue of damages. In the circumstances, especially having regard to the trial judge’s strongly critical findings made with respect to Mr Alan Curnuck’s credit and his Honour’s findings on issues which he should not have decided, the action should be continued before a different judge.

        REGINA V ROBERT ANDREASSEN 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    HOWIE J: The applicant, who appears before this Court in person, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by Judge Kinchington QC. On 11 April 2000 his Honour sentenced the applicant on two counts of break enter and steal to imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months with a non parole period of 21 months. The sentence was to commence on 30 January 2000 and the applicant is eligible for release to parole on 29 October 2001. The maximum penalty for each of the offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty was 14 years. 
      
       
     2    The facts can be briefly stated. Late in the evening of 20 January 2000 the applicant was seen walking through a caravan park carrying a television set. He also attempted to detach a lock from a bicycle. The owner of the bike witnessed this act and yelled out at the applicant who then walked away. 
      
       
     3    Police were summoned but they were unable to find the applicant. However, they located a television set and a caravan stove near one of the cabins. They also noticed that the side window of one of the cabins was open and the flyscreen had been removed. On inspection of the cabin it was found that the internal cupboard doors were open. The applicant was then seen leaving the caravan park and he was stopped by police. When it was put to him that he had stolen a television set and a stove, the applicant denied it. He was then arrested and declined to participate in an interview. The applicant was well-affected by intoxicating liquor at the time of his arrest. The television set had been removed from the cabin that had been inspected by police and the stove had been taken from a caravan. 
      
       
     4    As his Honour the sentencing judge remarked, the offences were not of the most serious nature. They could have been dealt with in the Local Court. However, the applicant, who is aged 33 years, has a record for offences of dishonesty dating from 1978 and, apparently, it was for this reason that he was committed for sentence to the District Court. However, at the time he committed these offences the applicant was in breach of bail in that he had failed to appear at the Local Court to answer charges of stealing. It also seems that he was subject to a good behaviour bond, although the applicant did not believe that the bond was still current, but that was for a driving matter and had been breached on a number of occasions without action being taken by the Local Court. The applicant had been released from custody about 3 months before his arrest for these offences. 
      
       
     5    The first ground of appeal relied upon by the applicant is that the sentencing judge did not give sufficient recognition to his plea of guilty. His Honour did mention the fact that the applicant had pleaded guilty but said no more. In particular, his Honour did not mention the fact that he was taking the plea into account or to what extent. The applicant had pleaded guilty before the Local Court and, therefore, would be entitled to a discount of about 25 per cent on the utilitarian basis recognised in the decision of this Court in R v Thompson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. The total sentence imposed by his Honour was 3 years and 9 months, which if a discount of 25 per cent had been allowed on initial sentence, that would indicate a starting sentence of 5 years. In order to determine whether that starting sentence was too severe, regard must be had to the other features of the case and other complaints made by the applicant. 
      
       
     6    The sentencing judge described the applicant’s record as being “dreadful” and indicated that he agreed with the decision of the prosecution not to allow the applicant to be dealt with in the Local Court. In his submission before us, the applicant himself described his record as “appalling”. 
      
       
     7    The applicant’s criminal record comprises 33 appearances in the Children’s, Local and District Courts for offences of dishonesty, violence, traffic matters and the possession of prohibited drugs. He was sentenced to imprisonment for offences of larceny of motor vehicles and a break and enter with intent in 1987. Thereafter, he has received a number of short gaol sentences chiefly for offences of larceny and traffic matters until 1993. From that year until 1997 the applicant committed only two offences both of a very minor nature. In 1997 he was sentenced to imprisonment for stealing a motor vehicle and traffic matters. Between 1997 and 2000, there are numerous convictions mainly for traffic matters and on two occasions he received a short gaol sentence. 
      
       
     8    Although the applicant’s record does him little credit, there are very few offences of any great seriousness. Many of the offences of dishonesty are for stealing motor vehicles. The applicant has only once before been charged with a break, enter and steal offence and that was in 1978. Those were his first offences and were dealt with in the Children’s Court by way of a good behaviour bond. The applicant might be described as a thief rather than a house-breaker. The applicant has only once before appeared in the District Court for sentence. Most of the offences for which the applicant has been convicted were dealt with by way of fine or short gaol sentences of a few months. Since 1988 he has never served more than six months in custody. The longest period he has ever served was 12 months in 1987. 
      
       
     9    The applicant appears to live an itinerant life-style and has had a significant alcohol and drug abuse problem for many years. He has had the benefit of supervision from the probation service on a number of occasions but always falls back into his criminal way of life notwithstanding the continued support of his mother. In the proceedings before Judge Kinchington it was indicated that his mother would not be able to provide him with accommodation. However, in a letter placed before us, his mother indicated that on the release of the applicant from custody she may be able to accommodate him for a short period until he finds alternative premises in which to live. 
      
       
     10    The applicant explained his offending on this occasion as a result of his being heavily intoxicated. When asked about contrition, he told the probation officer who prepared the pre-sentence report, “Its not me at all. I am not proud of it at all. Its quite foolish”. In light of the absence of offences of this nature in his criminal record, there may be some truth in what he said. 
      
       
     11    There is some reference in the pre-sentence report to the fact that his mother was concerned about his mental health, and the probation officer thought that a mental health assessment was warranted. One of the applicant’s grounds of appeal that he raised both in material that he forwarded to this Court and before the appeal was listed today, and material which was placed before the court today, concerned the fact there was no mental health assessment made before he was sentenced by Kinchington QC DCJ. This appears to have been chiefly because of difficulties in the gaol system which caused delays both in the pre-sentence report being prepared and ultimately in the failure to have his mental health assessed. However, the applicant was represented by experienced counsel and clearly it was decided not to obtain such an assessment before sentence was imposed. Judge Kinchington was aware of the possibility of some psychiatric condition that needed to be investigated, he expressly referred to it and it was one of the factors that led him to find that special circumstances existed in the present case, which enabled him to impose a lesser non-parole period than he might have otherwise have done. In my view there was no miscarriage of justice occasioned by the absence of any psychiatric or psychological assessment prior to sentence. 
      
       
     12    The applicant complains that the sentencing judge imposed a heavier sentence than was otherwise appropriate because his Honour indicated that the applicant was institutionalised. The applicant, in material placed before us, seeks to indicate, by reference to the periods he was in custody and the periods at large, that any reference by his Honour to the applicant being institutionalised was wrong. However, what his Honour said was: 
      
       
        
         
          “You are well on the way to becoming institutionalised in the sense that if you do not do something for yourself you will be before the court within a very short time of your release from any term of imprisonment that I subject you to. 
         
        
        
       His Honour was merely by those remarks attempting to make it clear to the applicant that he had to take responsibility for his conduct and seek to alter his life-style or he would find himself committing further offences and being returned to custody as a consequence. 
        
       
     13    There are other statements made by his Honour during the course of his sentencing remarks about which the applicant complains on the basis that in some way the sentencing Judge had pre-judged him. The applicant has unfortunately misunderstood what his Honour was endeavouring to convey by these remarks. His Honour was trying to bring home to the applicant that he had been given the advantage of a finding of special circumstances notwithstanding his criminal record and his breaches of conditional liberty in the past and that he should make good use of the opportunity being presented to him. Judge Kinchington was simply stressing to the applicant that he had to use the benefit of the longer period on parole which the sentence provided to him in order to address his problems or he would find himself serving longer periods in custody. 
      
       
     14    Although the total sentence is in my view at the very top of the range for offences of the nature committed by the applicant, in light of the fact that both offences arose from the same course of criminal conduct, I do not believe it was excessive having regard to the aggravating feature of the applicant being on bail. 
      
       
     15    The applicant was fortunate in all the circumstances that he received the benefit of a non-parole period set as low as 21 months. There had to be a significant element of specific deterrence in the sentence imposed upon the applicant and any lesser period in custody would not in my view have adequately reflected that matter. Certainly I would not impose any lesser non-parole period if it had been necessary to re-sentence the applicant. 
      
       
     16    Although the applicant has raised matters in relation to what has occurred since he was sentenced by Judge Kinchington, and in particular the misfortune that his father died while the applicant was in custody, unfortunately I can see no error in what his Honour did or said in his remarks on sentence. In my view the sentence is not manifestly excessive, particularly in light of the lenient non-parole period that was fixed. Therefore, there is no occasion for this Court to consider the material placed before it by the applicant on the basis that it may have been necessary to resentence him. 
      
       
     17    In those circumstances, there being no error, the application for appeal should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     18    BARR J: I agree. The orders of the Court are as proposed by Howie J.

        REGINA v JOHN EDWARD PARKINSON 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    HOWIE J: The applicant John Edward Parkinson seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed by Judge Bellear DCJ on 2 February 2001 for a number of drug and firearm offences. The applicant had pleaded guilty to these charges before a magistrate and was committed for sentence to the District Court under s 51A of the Justices Act. However, by reason of some defect in the committal document, an indictment was presented before the District Court containing the same charges to which the applicant had pleaded guilty before the magistrate and on being arraigned on that indictment the applicant again pleaded guilty. 
      
       
     2    The indictment contained six counts, five of them were offences concerning the supply and manufacture of amphetamine contrary to the provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The counts on the indictment and the amount of drugs to which they relate are as follows: 
      
       
        
       1. 28 October 1999 - Supply 54.8 grams of methylamphetamine. 
        
        
       2. 7 February 2000 - Supply 53.2 grams of methylamphetamine. 
        
        
       3. 17 March 2000 - Supply 44 grams of methylamphetamine in that he had that drug in his possession for the purposes of supply. 
        
        
       4. 17 March 2000 - Supply 988.2 grams of methylamphetamine being not less than the commercial quantity of that drug. 
        
        
       5. 17 March 2000 - Knowingly take part in the manufacture of amphetamine. 
        
       
     3    The first three counts on the indictment were all contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. The fourth count was contrary to s 25(2) of the Act by reason of the amount of drug involved and carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The fifth count was contrary to s 24 of the Act and carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     4    The sixth count on the indictment alleged that on 7 December 1999 the applicant sold an unregistered firearm, being a .45 calibre semi-automatic pistol, contrary to s 36(1) of the Firearms Act 1996. The maximum penalty prescribed is 5 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     5    In addition to these offences the applicant asked his Honour to take into account a further seven matters on a Form 1 under the provisions of s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. These matters were: three offences of supply amphetamine; one count of supply a .45 calibre semi-automatic pistol; goods in custody of $2,000 in cash; possession of 2 grams of cannabis and possession of a .45 calibre semi-automatic pistol. The dates of these matters all fell within the period covered by the offences on the indictment. 
      
       
     6    Judge Bellear sentenced the applicant as follows: in respect of count 4 and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 imprisonment for 6 years and 2 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 7 months to date from 17 March 2000 with the non-parole period to expire on 16 October 2004; in respect of each of the first three counts and count 5,imprisonment for 3 years and 2 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 4 months, all to date from 17 March 2000 and the non-parole periods to expire on 16 July 2002; in respect of count 6 imprisonment for 17 months with a non-parole period of 12 months to commence at the expiration of the non-parole period imposed in respect of count 4. 
      
       
     7    As a consequence of these individual sentences, the applicant was sentenced to a total sentence of 6 years and 2 months with an effective non-parole period of 5 years and 7 months from 17 March 2000. The applicant is eligible to be considered for release to parole on 16 October 2005. The total sentence is to expire on 16 May 2006. 
      
       
     8    There are four grounds of appeal as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “1. The applicant submits that the discount of 5 % for the plea of guilty was inadequate in the circumstances of an early plea. 
          
          
         2. The applicant submits that the learned sentencing judge erred in not considering the issue of circumstances, particularly in the light of the accumulation of the sentence in respect of count 6. 
          
          
         3. The applicant submits that the learned sentencing judge erred in not properly assessing the issue of totality as it arose from a multiplicity of sentences which are in part accumulated. 
          
          
         4. Both the head sentence and non-parole period are manifestly excessive.” 
         
        
       
     9    The facts of the matter can be briefly stated. The police suspected that the applicant and another man, who were both members of the Life and Death Motor Cycle Club, were engaged in the supply of amphetamine. In a controlled investigation undercover operatives were used to target the applicant and the other man by acting as purchasers of the drug. The operation resulted in the arrest and charging of the applicant with the offences for which he was sentenced by Judge Bellear. Both the drug offences and the firearms offences arose in the course of the contact between the undercover operatives and the applicant, and from what was found in the possession of the applicant when his premises were searched by police after his arrest. 
      
       
     10    The first count of supply related to the exchange of 54.8 grams of amphetamine for two compliance plates from a motor vehicle which is said to be valued at $2,000. Although the normal street purity of amphetamine is said to be 3-4%, the purity of the drug the subject of this charge was 7% and, therefore, the drug could be cut down by some other substance to produce 118 grams of amphetamine which could be resold at street level. 
      
       
     11    The second count related to the sale of 53.2 grams of amphetamine for the price of $6,400. The increased price paid for the drug on this occasion was because of its increased purity. The drug was 38% pure which meant that it could be cut seven times to give 371 grams of amphetamine which could be sold at street level. 
      
       
     12    The third count concerned the discovery of amphetamine in the possession of the applicant after his arrest. That drug was 44% pure resulting in 396 grams of normal grade amphetamine. 
      
       
     13    The fourth count related to the supply of 988.2 grams of amphetamine for $24,000. This drug was 8% pure and could have been converted into 1976 grams of street level amphetamine. In total the applicant had supplied to police or had in his possession what amounted to 2,851 grams of street level amphetamine. 
      
       
     14    The fifth count in the indictment related to the fact that on 17 March 2000, following his arrest after the supply which was the subject of the fourth count, the applicant’s house was searched and in the laundry a container was found in which was 400 grams of liquid with a white sediment. This finding revealed that the applicant was in the course of extracting pseudoephedrine as part of the manufacture of amphetamine. 
      
       
     15    The sixth count on the indictment related to the sale by the applicant of a semi automatic pistol to an undercover police officer for the sum of $2,500. 
      
       
     16    The supply offences on the Form 1 involved three separate supplies of about 26 grams of amphetamine each at a cost of $3,500. The sale of the automatic pistol netted the applicant $2,500. Another pistol was found in the applicant’s kitchen wrapped in cloth. The $2,000 found by police in the applicant’s home was believed to be the proceeds of previous drug supplies. 
      
       
     17    A submission was made to his Honour that the sentence ought to be discounted by reason of the fact that during the course of negotiations between the applicant and the undercover police officer, the applicant had been “talked up” to the large amount supplied on 17 March. Judge Bellear determined that no such discount was appropriate on that basis and that finding has not been challenged in this Court. 
      
       
     18    The applicant is aged 37 years. He has no prior convictions. He is in a good relationship with members of his own family and receives strong support from his mother. The applicant has two sons from a previous relationship, one of whom is aged 10 years and has severe developmental and behavioural problems. He is under the care of a psychiatrist and schizophrenia is suspected as the cause of his problems. The applicant has regular contact with his former partner and the children. 
      
       
     19    The applicant had an unremarkable upbringing, except that after his father left them, the family became itinerant. The applicant left school at the age of 14 years. He was until August 1999 working as a crane driver, often up to seven days a week. Unfortunately the applicant was involved in a motor vehicle accident from which he suffered serious injuries which precluded him from continuing with his former occupation. The applicant, thereafter has been unemployed. He told a psychologist, who prepared a report for the sentencing proceedings, that he was in constant pain as a result of the accident. He has never used illegal drugs. 
      
       
     20    In the pre-sentence report the following paragraph is found under the heading “Attitude to the Offence”: 
      
       
        
         
         “The offender appears to see the offence as a business transaction, a means of obtaining money following his accident when he was not able to return to his employment as a crane driver. He describes his part in the offences as ‘the courier’. He claims his partner who was drug addicted and needing money, encouraged him to engage in these illegal activities and was instrumental in introducing him to the people who provided the goods. Mr Parkinson was very matter of fact when discussing the offences and did not seem to appreciate the illegality or anti-social nature of his actions.” 
         
        
       
     21    The first ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in relation to the discount granted to the applicant for his pleas of guilty. In sentencing the applicant, Judge Bellear noted that he had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to these offences and referred to a submission made by counsel appearing for the applicant that he was entitled to the benefit of his early pleas in accordance with the guideline judgment of this Court in R v Thompson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. In his remarks on sentence His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am satisfied that the prisoner’s pleas of guilty were entered at the earliest available opportunity. I am satisfied that those pleas were entered in the face of an extremely strong case. I do accept however that the enormous money and time saved by this state that would have been spent had this prisoner stood his trial in each matter that must warrant some leniency.” 
         
        
       
     22    Judge Bellear determined that the appropriate discount was 5 per cent for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas on the basis that the Crown case was a strong one and that there was an inevitability about the conviction of the applicant which could not be avoided. His Honour found that the applicant was not entitled to any benefit on the basis of remorse. He noted that the applicant had failed to assist the authorities regarding other members of the motor cycle club and the seriousness of the offences. 
      
       
     23    In my respectful opinion his Honour was clearly in error in the way he approached the determination of the discount for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty. The range of the discount appropriate for this factor was held in Thompson and Houlton to fall between 10-25 per cent, the primary consideration for determining the extent of the discount being the timing of the plea. After referring to the fact that the actual discount to be given will be a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge, the Chief Justice said this about the factors to be taken into account when determining the discount at 428 para 154-155: 
      
       
        
         
         “There are however two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case: 
          
           
           (i) The time at which a plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial. 
            
           (ii) The complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea. 
           
          
         The top of the range would be expected to be restricted to pleas at the earliest possible opportunity and should not be given, save in an exceptional case, after a matter has been set down for trial. A discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for late pleas, e.g. on the date fixed for trial, unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial. 
          
          
         Rare cases involving exceptional complexity and trial duration may justify a higher discount. In some cases no discount is appropriate at all. In some cases the ""discount"" will be reflected in a step down in the hierarchy of sentencing options.” 
         
        
       
     24    Judge Bellear seems to have determined that a discount of 5 per cent should apply notwithstanding that the pleas were entered at the first opportunity and resulted in a real saving in time and money to the state, because of the overwhelming strength of the Crown case resulting from the taped conversations between the applicant and the undercover officers. But that was not a relevant consideration in determining the extent of the discount on a purely utilitarian basis. In Thompson and Houlton, the Chief Justice said at 416 para 137-138: 
      
       
        
         
         “Separation of the elements of contrition and utilitarian value in the plea of guilty requires a consideration of whether or not the element of strength of the Crown case, to which reference is frequently made as limiting the value of a plea, should be attributed to both of the elements. The Attorney General submitted that the strength of the Crown case should not have any bearing upon the weight to be attributed to that aspect of the discount which is attributed to purely utilitarian considerations. The authorities support this submission. (See  
         R v Slater 
          supra at 525-526;  
         R v Bond 
          supra at 7;  
         R v Winchester 
          supra at 350;  
         R v Bishop 
          (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 23 September 1996, unreported);  
         R v Bulger 
          [1990] 2 Qd R 559 at 564. 
         
        
        
         
         In  
         Winchester v The Queen 
         , Hunt CJ at CL related the strength of the Crown case only to the contrition element of the leniency in sentencing which a plea of guilty affords an accused: cf  
         R v Beavan 
          (at 12). As his Honour put it (at 350): 
          
         “… The extent to which leniency will be afforded upon this ground will depend to a large degree upon whether or not the plea resulted from a recognition of the inevitable.” In my opinion his Honour was correct to link the question of the strength of the Crown case only to the issue of contrition or remorse. A “recognition of the inevitable” may qualify the extent of genuine contrition. It does not qualify the utilitarian value of a plea. 
         
        
       
     25    In my opinion there was no ground upon which the applicant should have been deprived of the full measure of the discount for his early pleas. This ground of appeal has been made out. 
      
       
     26    The other grounds of appeal have been argued together and in effect contend that by accumulating the sentence for the fourth and sixth counts his Honour imposed a sentence which was more severe than was appropriate to reflect the totality of the criminality and, further, by taking that course his Honour failed to set an appropriate ratio between the full term of the sentences and the period to be served by the applicant before being eligible for release to parole. It is submitted on behalf of the applicant that an overall non-parole period of 5 years 7 months in a total sentence of 6 years 2 months is manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     27    In my opinion there are errors in the way his Honour determined and structured the sentences. There were three separate, though related, acts of criminality arising from the facts before his Honour: the course of supplying amphetamine, the applicant’s involvement in the manufacture of that drug, and the sale of the firearm. His Honour perceived that the first and third of those matters needed to be dealt with separately but not the second. The manufacturing of amphetamine was quite separate from the supply offences because it related to amphetamine for future distribution whether by the applicant or some other person. Each of those three areas of criminality required separate and distinct punishment which should have resulted in cumulative sentences for each of the fourth, fifth and sixth counts. The offence of taking part in the manufacture of amphetamine was dealt with by a sentence of 3 years and 2 months made concurrent with the offences of supply amphetamine. This was in my opinion an inappropriate way of dealing with that matter. 
      
       
     28    Further, the starting sentence chosen by his Honour to reflect the commercial supply of amphetamine and the matters on the Form 1 was 6½ years which his Honour discounted by 5 percent. The sentence of 6 years and 2 months thereby obtained was in my view barely appropriate to reflect the objective seriousness of the totality of the supplies of amphetamine and the manufacture of the amphetamine but it was so only because his Honour discounted it by such a small amount. If a 25 per cent discount were now applied to the sentence which his Honour initially chose for the offences in the first five counts before discount, a sentence of 4 years and 10 months would result. Having regard to the criminality involved, such a sentence needs only to be stated for it to be seen as inadequate. 
      
       
     29    The sentence chosen by his Honour to reflect the firearm offence was 17 months after the application for the 5 per cent discount, so that the obvious starting sentence was 18 months. If a 25 per cent discount were given off that sentence the result would be just over 13 months. Such a sentence would in my view be inadequate to deal with a case of a person selling a firearm to another who the seller believed to be a drug supplier. 
      
       
     30    Further, it seems clear to me that his Honour did not achieve the result he intended by the accumulation of that sentence. I believe that, with respect, His Honour must have overlooked the fact that the total term as well as the non-parole period would commence at the expiration of the non-parole period on the fourth count. Otherwise there seems to have been no point of going through the exercise of creating parole periods in accordance with the Act for each of the sentences and then imposing a cumulative sentence which all but obliterated the parole period earlier specified. 
      
       
     31    If his Honour intended, as I believe he did, to lengthen both the total term of the sentence and the period the applicant was to serve in custody before being eligible to release to parole by accumulating a sentence for the firearm offence in the sixth count, the only way he could achieve that result was to impose that sentence before the sentence for the fourth count and accumulate that count on the sentence for the sixth. 
      
       
     32    The Crown has argued that his Honour was entitled to fix sentences and non-parole periods giving the result achieved by the sentences he imposed. There is no doubt that submission is correct, see R v GDR (1994) 35 NSWLR 376. Further, s 44 of the Act refers only to the relationship between the non-parole period and the term of a particular sentence: it says nothing about the result of the cumulation of sentences. But the general policy relating to the specification of parole periods is that there should be a due relationship between the non-parole period and the total term and that this relationship will generally be in accordance with that specified in s 44. 
      
       
     33    It is difficult to see what is to be achieved by a 7 month parole period after the prisoner, who has no prior convictions, has served a sentence of 5 years and 7 months. Although there may be no need for supervision or assistance at the present time, it could not confidently be predicted that the same situation would apply after so long in custody. Such a short parole period after such a lengthy period in gaol gives the applicant little incentive to earn parole or little time for the parole service to provide him with assistance to re-establish himself once released. 
      
       
     34    Although there was no requirement for his Honour to give reasons for fixing such a proportion between the non-parole period and the total term, it is so exceptional, particularly in the case of a person with no prior convictions and who would not be considered a danger to society, that I would have thought some explanation or justification for such a sentence would be found in his Honour’s reasons if he intended that result. This is particularly so in light of the fact that his Honour set non-parole periods bearing the usual relationship to the term of the sentence in respect of each sentence imposed. 
      
       
     35    Unfortunately the sentencing exercise seems to have miscarried by reason of the failure to give an appropriate discount and in the way the sentences were structured. But to rectify the situation would require a re-sentencing of the applicant which would require longer sentences to be imposed in order that the proper sentencing principles could be applied and an appropriate sentence achieved. That cannot be done on the applicant’s appeal. The sentence I propose is not the sentence that should have been imposed but seems to me to do some justice to the applicant and the community. 
      
       
     36    I propose that the sentence for the sixth count be quashed and in lieu the applicant be sentenced to a fixed term of 18 months to commence on 17 March 2000 and to expire 16 September 2001. The sentence is to be a fixed term because of the sentence to be imposed on the fourth count. The sentence for the fourth count should be quashed and in lieu the applicant be sentenced to 5 years and 8 months to commence on 16 September 2000 with a non-parole of 4 years and 2 months which is to expire on 15 November 2004 the date upon which the applicant is to be eligible for release to parole. 
      
       
     37    I wish to make it clear that the total sentence which I have proposed is unduly lenient and verging on the inadequate, but has been brought about in order to permit the applicant to see that he has received some benefit for his pleas and to encourage him to work for parole and to assist him when he is released. He has not received the full measure of the benefit he should have received in terms of the percentage discount because to do so would result in a grossly inadequate sentence if this Court did not substantially increase the sentences imposed by Judge Bellear. But in effect he has received the full benefit of the pleas before the magistrate because the sentence now imposed is the very least that could have been imposed even giving him the fullest measure of discount for his pleas of guilty. 
      
       
     38    BARR J: I agree. The orders of the Court are therefore as proposed by Justice Howie.

The appellant was convicted on 14 May 2000.In brief, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime were as follows. The appellant and the complainant met at a rugby club and made only limited contact after their first meeting. On a Saturday afternoon, approximately one month later, the complainant returned from a rugby match to the club where she joined a group of persons including the appellant. At closing time (about 12.30am) the complainant travelled with the appellant in a car to the Albion Hotel. The complainant drank heavily throughout the afternoon and evening testifying to having consumed approximately 25 alcoholic drinks between 4pm and 5.30am. At about 5.30am the complainant was driven by the appellant to his home. During the journey she fell asleep in the back seat of the car. The events immediately following their arrival at the appellant’s home were controversial. The complainant gave evidence that after she woke up in his room he made unwelcome sexual advances towards her, physically attacked her and then had sexual intercourse with her without her consent. The appellant testified that the complainant walked to his room and had consensual sexual intercourse with him, after which he refused to drive her home. On his evidence she then insulted him and his family and he punched and kicked her. It was uncontested that the appellant then drove the complainant to the rugby club and left her there. Witnesses at the club assisted her and she complained of batteries and later of sexual assault. During a subsequent examination in hospital, the complainant told a doctor that she had had consensual intercourse with a man other than the appellant approximately two days prior to the examination. Held by Heydon JA (Wood CJ at CL and Sully J concurring), dismissing the appeal:1. The conviction was not “unreasonable”. Therefore there is no  
      
       
       ground for allowing the appeal under s 6(1) of the  
       Criminal Appeal Act  
       1912 (NSW). 
        
        
       a. Since the enactment of s 164 of the  
       Evidence Act  
       1995  
        
         
         (NSW), common law corroboration requirements have in general been abolished. The real issue here was whether the complainant’s injuries, distress and complaints tend to support a sexual assault following a physical assault, or a physical assault after consensual intercourse. There existed independent evidence of the complainant’s injuries, which demonstrated injuries greater than those that would be consistent with the appellant’s version of his physical attack upon her. The evidence of the complainant’s distress was compelling and she had little opportunity to fabricate her version of events. 
         
        
       
      b. It was open to the jury to accept the complaint’s version of  
      
       
        
         
         events despite some inconsistencies between her testimony and other evidence. The inconsistencies might be explained by her intoxication and fatigue on the night of the attack and during the following day.  
          
         
        
       
      c. The complainant’s drunkenness was inconclusive as it was  
       
        
         
         capable of supporting both the complainant’s version of events and the appellant’s version. The lack of damage to the complainant’s clothing was explicable, as was her acceptance of a cigarette, sunglasses and a lift after the attack.  
         
        
       
      d. The delay in complaint of sexual assault was explicable  
       
        
         
         since the first two persons the complainant encountered were men and were of a different ethnic background to herself. The complainant also slept for a number of hours before encountering a female with whom to discuss the attack. The reluctance to contact relatives was understandable. 
         
        
       
     2. The trial judge did not err by excluding under s 105 of the  
      
       
       Criminal Procedure Act  
       1986 (NSW) evidence relating to the complainant’s sexual activities with a man other than the appellant approximately thirty-four hours prior to the appellant’s attack upon her. The exclusion did not render the conviction unsafe nor cause a miscarriage of justice. 
        
        
       a. In relation to s 105(4)(c), the tailpiece of the s 105(4)  
        
         
         inclusion test was not satisfied. That is, the probative value of the evidence was not shown to outweigh the distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer from its admission. Therefore, it was not necessary to decide whether the trial judge erred in holding that s 105(4)(c)(i) was not satisfied.  
         
        
       
       
        
       b. In relation to s 105(6), s 105(6)(b) was not satisfied. That is,  
        
         
         the appellant did not demonstrate that he was unfairly prejudiced by any implied suggestion that the complainant had not engaged in recent sexual activity with another man which might have caused her vaginal tenderness. Therefore, it was not necessary to decide whether s 105(6)(a) was satisfied.  
          
           
             
           
          
         
        
       c. Section 105(4)(a) was not satisfied because the  
        
         
         complainant’s sexual activity about thirty-four hours before the sexual assault was not part of the “connected set of circumstances” in which the sexual assault occurred. In addition, the tailpiece to s 105(4) was not satisfied.  
         
        
        
       d. The lack of probative value of the evidence, and the  
        
         
         fact that its exclusion did not unfairly prejudice the appellant mean that its exclusion did not prevent the appellant from receiving a fair trial. 
         
        
       
     3. The trial judge did not fail to properly direct the jury in relation to the delay in complaint regarding sexual assault. No miscarriage of justice resulted from the direction. 
      
       
       a. There was no relevant delay in relation to the complaint  
        
         
         regarding sexual assault, which was made at the earliest reasonable opportunity. 
         
        
       
       b. There is no evidentiary foundation for the theory that the  
      
       
        
         
         complainant concocted the allegation of sexual assault after realising that consensual intercourse would be revealed as a result of her complaints of physical assault. 
         
        
       
      c. The direction to the jury adequately dealt with the issues of  
      
       
        
         
         the complainant’s credit and the significance of any “delay” in complaint. 
         
        
       
       d. Since no objection was made to the direction at trial, leave  
      
       
        
         
         was required under rule 4 of the  
         Criminal Appeal Rules 
          for this ground of appeal. Such leave should be refused since any error in the direction was minor and caused no miscarriage of justice.

        JUDGMENT 
        
        
        
       
     1    HEYDON JA:  
      
       
       This is an appeal against the appellant’s conviction after a trial before Phegan DCJ and a jury of having had sexual intercourse without consent on 14 May 2000 in circumstances of aggravation, namely the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm immediately before the commencement of the offence, contrary to s 61J(1) of the  
       Crimes Act 
        1900.  
        
        
       THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
       
     2    The complainant was an Australian of Fijian background. The appellant was a Fijian national and resident. At the time of the events in issue, she was 19 and he was 30. The appellant, a married man, arrived alone in Australia on 5 April 2000 for the purpose of a three month visit to his grandmother. He came to a training session conducted by the Drummoyne Rugby Club one evening in early April 2000 and was introduced to the complainant, who played for one of the women’s teams run by that Club. She knew Alfred Batimala, a man who played for the Club, and she found out that the appellant was Mr Batimala’s cousin. She had some limited contacts with the appellant thereafter, though their precise extent was controversial.  
      
       
     3    On Saturday 13 May 2000 her team played an away game and enjoyed its largest ever win. Her team returned on the bus and during the journey she drank three types of alcohol - beer, a mixture of vodka and lemon, and another mixture of spirits and soft drink. She then celebrated at a clubhouse at Drummoyne used by the Drummoyne Rugby Club from 5.30pm. After some time she joined a group of men including the appellant. She drank a substantial amount of beer and some bourbon and coke. At closing time, about 12.30am, she accompanied Mr Batimala and the appellant in a car to the Albion Hotel, Parramatta. There she consumed more bourbon and coke. She accepted in cross-examination that she consumed between 4pm and 5.30am twenty-five drinks which she could remember and describe. The precise figure may be questioned, but she ended up very drunk. The complainant left the Albion at about 5.30am and fell asleep in the back seat of a car which the appellant was driving and which for a time had another passenger. The complainant and the appellant ended up in a room at his house.  
      
       
     4    On her evidence, the complainant woke up in the room. The appellant made repeated and persistent sexual advances to her over her objections, slapped her, punched her twice in both the right and left eye, punched her again, threw her against the wall, caused her to become frightened, made her cry and had sexual intercourse without her consent. On his evidence, she walked from the car to the room. They kissed repeatedly. Consensual sexual intercourse took place, but after he refused to drive her home, she insulted him, his mother and his family in an extremely hurtful way, and he punched and kicked her.  
      
       
     5    It was common ground that after the events at the appellant’s house had concluded, he drove her to the clubhouse where he left her.  
      
       
     6    Her battered condition was observed by several witnesses, including witnesses connected with the Drummoyne Rugby Club. Initially she complained of batteries and later of rape as well.  
      
       
     7    The Drummoyne Rugby Club witnesses assisted her in a humane and decent way which reflects credit on them. For example, two of them took her to hospital and stayed there with her for over eight hours until after midnight. It is, however, a matter for regret that the officials of the Drummoyne Rugby Club or of the organisation which ran the clubhouse either did not have a system in place to prevent a person as young as the complainant consuming as much alcohol as she did, or did not ensure that it worked effectively on that particular night.  
      
       
        
       GROUND 1: UNREASONABLE CONVICTION? 
       
     8    The first ground of appeal was: “The conviction is unreasonable”. The Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(1), provides that this Court must allow an appeal if of opinion that the jury verdict should be set aside as “unreasonable”, unless it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
      
       
     9    The appellant referred to the following passage in the reasons for judgment of Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494-5: 
      
       
        
         
         “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by a court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.” 
         
        
        
       The last four sentences were said at 495 to have been motivated by the purpose of providing authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal. 
        
       
     10    The appellant submitted that though the complainant’s evidence could not be said to lack credibility by reason of the manner in which it was given, on the record itself it could be seen that it contained discrepancies, inadequacies, taints and a lack of probative force to a degree sufficient to conclude that there was a significant possibility that the appellant was innocent.  
      
       
     11    The appellant relied on nine matters. It was said that none by itself made the verdict unreasonable. But it was submitted that a combination of all or some of them did.  
      
       
        
       Lack of corroboration 
       
     12    The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “The fact that the complainant was assaulted has little or no corroborative force in the circumstances of this case, where the appellant at no stage denied assaulting the complainant and has offered an explanation for it which cannot be dismissed as implausible. It is a matter of common experience that non-sexual violence is more prevalent in relationships than sexual violence. It follows that the allegations of sexual assault were not corroborated. In these circumstances, it was necessary for the jury, and it is necessary on appeal, to carefully scrutinise the complainant’s account(s)”. 
         
        
       
     13    The Crown said that there was corroboration, in the form of “injury, distress and fresh complaint”. It went into the evidence on these topics in considerable detail. It dealt with the contention that the injuries could not corroborate the complainant because the appellant had admitted assaulting the complainant and had offered a not “implausible” explanation by submitting that the fact that the evidence might be “consistent with the appellant’s case does not render it incapable of amounting to corroboration”: it referred to such cases as R v Kalajzich (1989) 39 A Crim R 415 at 429-433 and R v Zorad (1990) 47 A Crim R 211 at 223.  
      
       
     14    Before going to the details of the evidence, it is convenient to deal with a point which the appellant took in reply: 
      
       
        
         
         “The respondent’s contention … that the complainant’s distress and ‘fresh complaint’ corroborated her account should be rejected. Of course, the matter should not be approached technically but the basic point is that her distress and complaint was hardly independent evidence tending to prove the sexual assault. 
         
        
        
         
         The respondent’s reliance on pre-Evidence Act cases … is misconceived. The issue is not whether the evidence was capable of being left as possible corroboration at common law but rather whether the evidence of injuries tends in any significant way to confirm a sexual assault, bearing in mind the appellant’s version of events.” 
         
        
       
     15    At common law, a complaint could not “corroborate” a complainant’s testimony because it did not come from a source independent of her. On the other hand, the physical condition of the complainant could corroborate her. So could distress, though whether it did in a particular case was a matter calling for the exercise of caution: R v Flannery [1969] VR 586 at 591; R v Waye (1984) 14 A Crim R 391 at 393. Section 164 of the Evidence Act 1995 has, in general, abolished requirements for corroboration or corroboration warnings, and has hence made obsolete the technicalities of the former law on corroboration. It follows that even though it was the appellant who in chief couched his submissions in the language of corroboration, it was strictly speaking correct for him in reply to rebuke the Crown for using that language. The real issue is whether the complainant’s injuries, distress and complaints tend to support a sexual assault after a physical assault, or a physical assault after consensual intercourse. This they can admissibly do under the Evidence Act even though they could not all do this before 1995.  
      
       
     16    The complainant’s evidence in chief was that though she went into the game on 13 May 2000 with a right shoulder injury and though she had some bruises to her legs, she received no injuries during the game. In particular, she had no facial injuries. She said, first, that the appellant slapped the right side of her face with an open palm, and this hurt her. Secondly, she said he punched her “a couple of times”: both the right eye and the left eye were punched. Thirdly, while he was attempting to undress her, he “punched me again a couple of times” on the face: she could not remember how many times she was punched. Fourthly, at one point during her struggle with the appellant, “he chucked me onto the wall”; the right hand rear corner of her head hit the wall, causing a lump. 
      
       
     17    There was independent evidence of the complainant’s injuries from seven witnesses who saw the complainant on 14 May and a witness who saw her on 17 May. There was also evidence from police photographs, taken on 18 May, of the complainant’s injuries. That evidence tended to indicate that the appellant had given, if anything, an incomplete and underplayed account of the injuries to her head, however they were inflicted.  
      
       
     18    Mr Neil McDonald, one of the Drummoyne Rugby Club coaches, ran into the complainant at about 8am at the clubhouse. He noticed “a bit of blood on her left cheek”. He lifted up her sunglasses and noticed that “her left eye was closed up a fair bit” and “it looked like there was a slight cut on her cheekbone”.  
      
       
     19    Mr Mark O’Brien, who lived in a flat opposite the clubhouse, was then awakened by the complainant banging on his door in order to collect some of her possessions left there the previous day after she had returned from the game. He observed: “She’d been badly beaten, she had bruising around the face and one of her eyes was closed and the other very badly swollen”. He gave her ice and told her to lie down and take a rest: she slept.  
      
       
     20    Ms Marnie Hobbs, who played in the complainant’s team the previous day, then rang Mr O’Brien at about 2.15pm, came to his flat, and went into the room where the complainant was asleep. She woke her. “[When] she woke up and looked at me she had two very black eyes. … I think it was her right eye was closed up and I was very shocked by her appearance. It took her a while to kind of come round and recognise who I was …”. The following further evidence in chief was given: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did you do anything to assist her in any way? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, she was touching the back of her head and rubbing her jaw and she said she was - like she was just touching the back of her head and had her head down and she was rubbing her jaw so I took her to the kitchen of the flat and I gave her some aspro and Mark got some ice for head and jaw. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you touch any part of her head? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah, but not until I got into the lounge room. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And when you were in the lounge room what did you do? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was in the lounge room with her and she was still wearing the clothing from the night before when I’d seen her at the rugby club and she was very cold, she was shivering, she continued to touch her jaw and the back of her head. I went and got her a jumper of Mark’s and she put this on and when I put it on she had the ice on the back of her head and I felt the back of her head and she had two very large lumps, one on the lower right side and one further up here. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Further up? 
         
        
        
         
         A. In the left hand side of the back of her head. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. One down the right hand back of the head and one up the top? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah, they were quite large.”  
         
        
        
       The complainant said her head was very sore. Ms Hobbs said the complainant had not had her facial injuries on 13 May 2000. In cross-examination she said the two bumps on the complainant’s head were distinct and quite large.  
        
       
     21    Ms Hobbs, while at Mr O’Brien’s flat, made a phone call which caused Ms Karol Blackley to come to Mr O’Brien’s flat with Mr Peter Swanson. Ms Blackley was the captain of the complainant’s team. She was a police officer. She arrived at about 3.40pm. She noticed that the complainant’s right eye and lip area were very swollen and purple. She was holding a tea towel to her head. At 4.20pm she and Mr Swanson accompanied the complainant to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. 
      
       
     22    Mr Swanson was coach of the women’s team. He saw the complainant, and “noticed her face, her eyes, the swollen black eyes she had”. She was holding an ice pack to her eye; she had difficulty in speaking and was speaking “really softly”; “her face seemed swollen”.  
      
       
     23    Dr Simon Chapman examined the complainant at about 6pm in the Emergency Department of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. His notes stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “Evidence of bruising and swelling around the right orbit, tender right temporal region of head, orbital x-rays normal. Sexual assault counsellor review, head injury advice given.” 
         
        
       
     24    Dr Ann Sneddon examined the complainant at about 11pm. She noticed bruising around the right and left eyes. The bruising was consistent with being struck by a closed fist, but not a slap. She said separate blows would have been necessary to produce the bruising.  
      
       
     25    The photographs of the complainant, taken at a time when the complainant’s condition had improved, show both eyes to be clearly blackened. They show the right eye to be badly bloodshot. The photographs were taken by Constable Smith on Thursday 18 May. She first met the complainant on Wednesday 17 May. She then observed that the complainant had bruising to both of her eyes. The right eye was bloodshot and slightly closed. 
      
       
     26    A detailed explanation for the physical condition of the complainant was first offered by the appellant when the police conducted an electronically recorded interview with him on 22 May 2000. He said that after consensual intercourse, a quarrel broke out. He said the complainant told him she wanted to go home and told him to drop her there, while he wanted to sleep for a while. He said she swore at him and used obscene language about his mother. He said he “slapped” her once on the face, punched her once on the face, and kicked her twice. The “slap” was aimed at her mouth, but she ducked and he hit her in the eye. He was not wearing shoes. When he left her she had just one black eye; it was swollen, but she could open it. He said he did not hurt his hand when he “slapped” her. 
      
       
     27    In evidence in chief the appellant said that after the complainant began swearing about his mother he “slapped” the complainant and “touched” her. He denied any violence before intercourse. He denied ever throwing the complainant against the wall. (This was a detail to which the complainant referred in the first complaint she made of rape to Ms Hobbs.) In cross-examination the appellant said he administered one slap, one punch and two kicks. He said he wanted to slap her mouth, but hit her eye. He then punched her once, but he did not remember whether the punch hit her hands or her face. He then kicked her twice in the hands.  
      
       
     28    One difficulty with the appellant’s explanation is that the extent of the complainant’s injuries was too great to be accounted for by one slap with the open hand directed to the complainant while ducking and one punch which may have hit her hands and not her face. Dr Sneddon said that two punches with a closed fist would be needed to cause the two black eyes. The appellant’s oral argument suggested that the appellant’s lack of proficiency in English had to be remembered, and that by “slap” he may have meant “punch”. However, he used the two words in contrast to each other several times, and the assessment of what a witness who is not proficient in English means is a matter in respect of which a jury has a peculiar advantage over an appellate court, because it depends in part on an assessment of demeanour and body language. The appellant’s oral argument also said that the appellant may have been in so emotional a state as not to have a good memory of what he did, or may consciously or unconsciously have minimised the extent of the beating he administered because of the natural human reaction to play down a vicious assault on a relatively defenceless young girl. These are possibilities, but the actual evidence does not support the appellant’s version sufficiently to raise a reasonable doubt.  
      
       
     29    A second difficulty with the appellant’s explanation is that according to him, when he left the complainant she had only one black eye, which was not closed; yet there were unquestionably two, and one was very nearly closed or completely closed.  
      
       
     30    A third difficulty relates to the injuries to the back of the complainant’s head. The appellant submitted that in the ERISP the appellant said after he had hit her on the face she fell to the ground, and submitted that she could have hit her head in that process even though the appellant did not notice it. However, she said she was thrown against a wall, and this was confirmed by the terms of her complaints: he denied this. Thus the complainant’s version accounts for the injuries to the back of her head better than the appellant’s version does. 
      
       
     31    The Crown submitted, in relation to the appellant’s argument that the evidence of a physical assault had little or no corroborative force on the issue of whether a sexual assault occurred, that there was further corroboration in the form of the complainant’s distress and the complainant’s complaints. It is convenient to examine this evidence in relation to a later head of the appellant’s argument. However, as will be seen, it will be concluded that the evidence of the witnesses who observed the complainant’s distress and heard her complaints is compelling. She had virtually no opportunity to contrive a story.  
      
       
        
       Contradictions between the evidence of the complainant and other evidence in relation to pre-crime events 
        
       
     32    The next group of arguments advanced by the appellant point to various respects in which the complainant’s evidence about events before the alleged crime was contradicted by other witnesses or by her own prior statements. 
      
       
     33    (a) Pre 13 May contacts with appellant. The complainant said she did not speak to the appellant until the night of 13-14 May, and denied dancing with the appellant at the Albion Hotel. However, Alfred Batimala, who knew some members of her family and was a cousin of the appellant, said she had spoken to the appellant on earlier occasions. He also saw her dancing with the appellant, thereby confirming the appellant’s evidence to that effect.  
      
       
     34    The Crown pointed out that on no view were the pre 13 May contacts extensive. The complainant said that he had once bought her a beer without being asked to. Their only contacts were at or after training sessions. On his version, they talked on these occasions, but he did not claim they talked much, or in private. The evidence of Alfred Batimala that the appellant and the complainant were dancing at the Albion Hotel depended on an identification at some distance, and proceeded from a witness whose evidence in other respects caused confusion at the trial. Even if Mr Batimala was right about the dancing, the appellant’s evidence about it was strange: he whispered into her ear that he wished to take her to his house; she replied “You’re the one who is delaying”; he did not immediately ask her to leave; they finished the dance and went their separate ways; he did not look for her inside and encountered her outside. Further, the Crown submitted that the lack of familiarity between the appellant and the complainant which the complainant asserted was supported by the appellant’s answers during the ERISP: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Can you describe this person ... to me, please? 
         
        
        
         
         A. … I can’t describe her to you because I just met her and we just playing together and I just met here, I don’t know … . 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What does she look like? 
         
        
        
         
         INTERPRETER: Physical? 
         
        
        
         
         DETECTIVE SENIOR CONSTABLE HEYSMAND 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Mmm. 
         
        
        
         
         A. She was just sex for me, like, not very big lady, small. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How old is she? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I didn’t ask her, I don’t, I say she maybe around 20. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. About 20? 
         
        
        
         
         A. … around 20, something like that.” 
         
        
        
       The failure to describe her and the statement “She was just sex for me” suggest that the appellant had virtually no contact with the complainant before the night of 13-14 May.  
        
       
     35    (b) Mr Batimala’s presence in the car. The complainant said that when she left the Albion Hotel by car, both the appellant and Mr Batimala were in it, and she accompanied them after Mr Batimala told her they would drop her at home. Mr Batimala said he had no such conversation and went home by taxi. If the complainant was wrong about this, it is explicable by the effects of her intoxication on her memory. Further, she may have confused the journey from the Albion Hotel with the journey to the Albion Hotel, during which she, Mr Batimala and the appellant agreed that both Mr Batimala and the appellant were present. This confusion was the more explicable in that according to the appellant there was a third person in the car during the journey from the Albion Hotel who was dropped at a railway station. That circumstance suggests that it is a matter of little importance whether Mr Batimala or someone else was in the car.  
      
       
     36    (c) The purpose of the journey. The appellant pointed out that the complainant testified that when she got into the appellant’s car, she believed she would be dropped at home. The Crown submits that she denied that she told Dr Sneddon that she got into the car “to go to assailant’s house”. (In fact what the complainant actually denied was that she did so “to go to the accused’s house”.) Yet Dr Sneddon’s notes said: 
      
       
        
         
         “At the Albion Hotel during Saturday night, left at approximately 5.30am with alleged assailant and his cousin to go to assailant’s house in Campsie via a car driven by the assailant.” 
         
        
        
       However, the Crown points out that Dr Sneddon said that when actual words uttered by the complainant were recorded by her, she placed quotation marks around them, and where she did not she was employing “shorthand” of what was said. The Crown submitted that the words “to go to the assailant’s house” were not the actual words used by the complainant. The information could equally well be a summary of what turned out to be the case. The complainant was not a sophisticated or articulate person. It is highly questionable whether she has ever used the word “assailant” in her life. Indeed, Dr Sneddon agreed with the proposition that the use of the word “assailant” was her word. Dr Sneddon’s language is ambiguous, and could easily, as the Crown said, be intended to state the result of the journey rather than its purpose.  
        
       
     37    (d) Inconsistencies with Dr Sneddon’s notes. The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “The complainant asserted at trial a complete lack of memory between getting into the appellant’s car at the Albion Hotel and then finding herself in his bed with the appellant standing beside the bed …. She denied telling Dr Sneddon that she had arrived at the appellant’s house at 6am …. She denied telling Dr Sneddon that the appellant asked her to sleep with him …. She did not remember telling Dr Sneddon that it was about an hour between arrival at the appellant’s house and the beginning of the assaults …. She denied telling Dr Sneddon that the appellant [pushed] her into the bedroom …. She denied telling Dr Sneddon that the appellant asked her to lie on the bed next to him …. However, Dr Sneddon’s notes were as follows …: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Arrived [at assailant’s house] at approximately 6am. Alleged assailant asks [the complainant] to sleep with him. Cousin in the house but asleep. Approximately an hour between arrival and beginning of events leading to alleged assault. The assault took place in assailant’s bedroom. The assailant called victim to bedroom. Assailant on bed and requested victim to lie next to him …’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Dr Sneddon states that this was ‘shorthand’ of what she was told … but she was careful in taking the account ….” 
         
        
       
     38    It was open to the jury to accept the complainant’s account of the physical and sexual assaults despite these inconsistencies, and to conclude that the differences between what she said on 14 May and what she said at the trial were due to the effects of her alcohol consumption on her memory. A further matter which they could bear in mind was that at the time she spoke to Dr Sneddon from 11pm on 14 May, she must have been extremely tired as a result of playing a rugby game the day before, staying up all night, getting very little sleep, being beaten up, and getting only about five hours of sleep in the middle of 14 May before going through the stress of telling her story several times. She gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Now when you spoke to the doctor straight after, how were you feeling? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Tired and my face was hurting.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. How were you feeling emotional?  
         
        
        
         
         (No verbal reply) 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you understand what I mean by the word ‘emotionally’? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah, just. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you remember how you felt? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was feeling everything, I was just.” 
         
        
       
     39    The appellant then submitted in relation to the four categories of evidence just discussed: 
      
       
        
         
         “This evidence suggests that the complainant at trial was deliberately and untruthfully attempting to minimise her involvement with the appellant in the days and hours leading up to the sexual assault. The evidence of Batimala strongly suggests that she was more interested in the appellant than she was prepared to concede. The account which she gave to Dr Sneddon tends to establish that she agreed to go to the appellant’s home late at night, spent an hour socialising with him before the alleged sexual assault and voluntarily went into the appellant’s bedroom. Of course, even on that account a sexual assault could have occurred. However, the different account is very significant because of its implications for the credibility, and particularly the truthfulness, of the complainant. The asserted absence of memory (apparently based on sleeping in the car and intoxication thereafter), does not ring true, given her account to Dr Sneddon. Rather, a more plausible explanation is that, at some time after speaking to Dr Sneddon, the complainant realised that her conduct up to the point of entry to the bedroom appeared to be more consistent with consensual than non-consensual sexual activity. In order to support her account of ‘rape’ she asserted a convenient loss of memory and, more importantly, thereby implicitly asserted that the journey from the Albion Hotel to the appellant’s bed was entirely involuntary.” 
         
        
       
     40    The Crown submitted that these arguments: 
      
       
        
         
         “are rather undermined by the appellant’s own account of events. Even the appellant does not claim that he spent an hour ‘socialising’ with the complainant at his home. The complainant did not assert ‘a convenient loss of memory’, rather her account of sleeping in the car for the entire journey is consistent with the appellant’s own account.” 
         
        
        
       His account was that on arrival at his grandmother’s house he woke the complainant up. They went inside, went straight to his room, kissed for some time, and then had intercourse. The Crown also submitted: 
        
         
         “Even if the complainant had agreed at some time earlier in the night to go to the appellant’s house it does not mean that she was not physically and sexually assaulted in the manner described.” 
         
        
        
       However, the basic difficulty in the appellant’s submission quoted above is that the “more plausible explanation” advanced wholly lacks evidentiary support. It is dealt with in detail below: paragraphs [44] and [49]-[50].  
        
        
       The complainant’s drunkenness 
       
     41    The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “There was no dispute at the trial that the complainant consumed a considerable amount of alcohol in the period leading up to the alleged sexual assault … and she was ‘drunk’ …. Of course, on the prosecution case, this made her more vulnerable and provided an explanation for how she ended up in the appellant’s bed without her consent. However, it also created the possibility that she would be more willing to engage in sexual activity with an acquaintance, which she might thereafter come quickly to regret.”  
         
        
        
       The Crown submitted: 
        
         
         “The possibility postulated by the appellant that she would have been more likely to engage in sexual intercourse with him and thereafter regret it does not mean that the complainant must have fabricated the allegation of sexual assault.” 
         
        
        
       The Crown also submitted that the role of alcohol in the case was pre-eminently an issue with which the jury were peculiarly well-equipped to deal. The submissions of both parties are sound; by itself the complainant’s drunkenness points in no particular direction.  
        
        
       The condition of the complainant’s clothing 
       
     42    The appellant submitted that there was a contradiction between the complainant’s account of the struggle between her and the appellant and the fact that her clothes were not damaged in any way. The absence of the damage was said to be “curious”. However, though the struggle lasted five or ten minutes, there is no reason to suppose that the appellant was trying to tear her clothing off as distinct from pulling it off. The jury saw the actual clothes. The photographs of them tendered to the jury and shown to this Court do not suggest that they were fragile, but rather were made of sturdy fabric capable of being stretched. The absence of damage is thus wholly explicable.  
      
       
        
       The complainant’s acceptance of a cigarette, sunglasses and a lift 
       
     43    The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “The complainant agreed that, after the alleged physical and sexual assault, she accepted a cigarette from the appellant …. She asked him to take her to the Rugby Club …. She also accepted an offer of sunglasses from him to hide the injuries to her eyes …. This behaviour was somewhat surprising if her account of violent rape was true (although this point has less force given the fact that she was undoubtedly physically assaulted).” 
         
        
        
       The Crown submitted that the behaviour was not “surprising”: rather, the complainant might “be commended for getting herself out of what must be conceded as a dangerous situation”. The appellant’s concession and the Crown’s point are both sound.  
        
        
       Running or walking away from the appellant 
       
     44    The appellant submitted that the complainant asserted that she “ran” towards the clubhouse after she got out of the appellant’s car and “ran into” Mr McDonald, which, if correct, would have added credibility to the claim of sexual assault. However, the appellant submitted that Mr McDonald said she was walking not running. The Crown, on the other hand, pointed out that Mr McDonald’s evidence was that when he saw the complainant she was in a laneway, not the car park. That is one fair point. Another is that to some degree distinguishing between fast walking and running is a matter of opinion. A third is that whether or not there was a sexual assault, the appellant’s physical assault on the complainant would be enough to cause her to want to leave his presence quickly. A fourth is that to “run into” someone does not imply that one is running as opposed to walking.  
      
       
        
       Delay in complaint? 
       
     45    A very important part of the appellant’s argument was put in writing in the following way: 
      
       
        
         
         “The complainant delayed in making a complaint of sexual assault. The evidence is as follows: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) The complainant testified that, when she arrived at the Drummoyne Rugby Club, she spoke to a man named Neil McDonald (who she knew as ‘ET’). He asked her ‘what happened to your face’ and she ‘told him I ran into a door’ …. Then she said that, in effect, the appellant ‘did it to me’ …. McDonald testified that, when he spoke to her, he asked her where she’d been and she said she’d ‘been to a party’ …. He asked her about her injuries and she said ‘she’d been bashed’ … by the appellant …. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) The complainant testified that, after speaking to Mr McDonald, she walked over to the house of Mark O’Brien (to obtain her football gear). He asked her ‘what happened to your face’ and she said ‘I ran into a door’ … He said ‘tell me the truth’ and she said that the appellant ‘did it’ …. She then lay down on a bed in Mr O’Brien’s home and went to sleep. O’Brien testified that she knocked on his door at about 9am. When he asked her what had happened, she ‘didn’t want to talk about it’ …. She went to sleep …. Later Marnie Hobbs telephoned and he asked her to come over …. She arrived at about 1.30pm …. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) The complainant testified that she was woken up by Marnie Hobbs and she told her she was ‘bashed and raped’ …. Marnie Hobbs testified that the telephone conversation with O’Brien was around 2pm … She went into the bedroom where the complainant was sleeping. She asked ‘what’s happened to you’ and the complainant said that the appellant ‘tried to sleep with me and I said no. He beat me up’ …. 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant was cross-examined by defence counsel regarding her failure to tell McDonald and O’Brien about the sexual assault …. In re-examination she stated that she did not tell them ‘because I didn’t feel comfortable telling them’ …. They were ‘close friends’ but she ‘wanted to tell a female about what happened’ …. It may be conceded that the explanation given by the complainant could be regarded as plausible. On the other hand, if she was able to say to Marnie Hobbs in the afternoon of 14 May that she had been ‘bashed and raped’, it might be regarded as significant that she had only said to McDonald that she had been ‘bashed’. The explanation advanced by her does not convincingly explain why she did not add the two words she later added. It is submitted that an alternative explanation is, at least, equally plausible. That explanation is that the complainant's interaction with McDonald and O’Brien made it obvious to her that the circumstances leading up to the assault by the appellant would inevitably emerge. Her initial action had been to deny any assault. However, her injuries made that impossible and, in any event, she would have had a legitimate grudge against the appellant for the physical assault. Once she nominated the appellant as the basher, though, she would have known (on the defence case) that he would say that the assault occurred during an argument after consensual sexual intercourse. That may well have been a source of considerable embarrassment to her. It may be postulated that, once she had had an opportunity to think about the situation and decide what to do, she determined to make a false allegation of rape.” 
         
        
       
     46    As far as it goes, the appellant’s summary of the complaint evidence is accurate. But it does not go nearly far enough. It omits very convincing evidence of complaints made at very early stages. And it overlooks difficulties in the theory advanced to support the view that the complaints were lies.  
      
       
     47    First, it gives a somewhat misleading account of the first complaint of sexual assault, that made to Ms Hobbs. After waking the complainant up and being shocked by her appearance as described in [19] above, Ms Hobbs asked the complainant what happened to her: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. What did you say? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I said, ‘What’s happened to you?’ And she said to me, ‘Alfred’s cousin he tried to sleep with me and I said no. He beat me up, threw me against the wall’. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did she say all of that in one go, or was it -- 
         
        
        
         
         A. Her first part of the conversation was she said to me, ‘Alfred’s cousin tried to sleep with me and I said no.’ That was the first part of the conversation. And then she took a moment and she was pretty upset and then she said to me, ‘He beat me up and he threw me against the wall.’ 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you say she was pretty upset, how did she appear to you to be? What were the signs that led you to believe she was upset? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Led me to believe she was upset? At that stage she was - she couldn’t really look me in the eye and she began to cry when she started talking about it. I didn’t really want to push her because she was visually upset and after about - I’d say about ten minutes of just being with her, I asked her if anything else happened. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did you say, what were the words you used? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I asked - I said, ‘Did anything else happen?’ 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And did she say anything? 
         
        
        
         
         A. She said, ‘He fuckin raped me’. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did she do after that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. She began crying and so I just comforted her and we stayed in the room for a while. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you were in the room having that conversation was there anyone else present? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No.” 
         
        
        
       Ms Hobbs was not cross-examined on this evidence. 
        
       
     48    Secondly, the appellant’s summary completely omits Ms Blackley’s evidence of the complaint to her, made not long after the complaint to Ms Hobbs. After relating her observations of the complainant’s condition referred to in paragraph [20] above, Ms Blackley gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did you speak to [the complainant] about what had happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Just briefly in the lounge room we just sort of - you know, briefly, and then I spoke to her further in a bedroom area. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did you ask her? 
         
        
        
         
         A. In the bedroom area? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, first out in the lounge room? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I just - if she knew who it was that had assaulted her in relation to the eye injury and things like that, and she said yes, she did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did she tell you anything? 
         
        
        
         
         A. She said it was Alfred’s friend, Georgie. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You said you then went into the bedroom? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who was with you when you went in there? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Just me and Miss Delana. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you went in there did you speak to her? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did you say? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I said, ‘Why did - why did he hit - why did he bash you’, or something like that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did she reply? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, she did, 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did she say? 
         
        
        
         
         A. She said, ‘He wanted to sleep with me and I told him that I wouldn’t, so he did it anyway’. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How did she appear to you when she said that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. She was very upset, she started to cry after she said that.” 
         
        
        
       Ms Blackley was not cross-examined on this evidence.  
        
       
     49    Thirdly, the complainant’s summary omits Dr Sneddon’s contemporaneous record of the complaint to her: 
      
       
        
         
         “Slapped in the face a couple of times and then got angry and ‘pushed me onto the bed’. Pinned to the bed by weight of assailant. Repeatedly said ‘no’. Said ‘I want to go to the toilet’ in an attempt to get away and then was punched in the right eye and again a couple of times in the face. Nil loss of consciousness. Thrown against the wall and hit head. Again no loss of consciousness. Started to cry. Assailant said ‘sorry, sorry’ and then victim sat on bed. Attempt to take the clothes off by the assailant. Victim said ‘no’. Attempt to unzip pants. Victim kicked assailant in the stomach by 2. Punched in chest two to three times and screamed. Clothing taken completely off but not damaged. One act of intercourse … . Forcible vaginal penetration with penis by one act of intercourse.” 
         
        
        
       Dr Sneddon was not cross-examined to suggest that her record was wrong.  
        
       
     50    Fourthly, a basic problem about the appellant’s contention that there was delay in complaint is that there was in truth no realistic opportunity to complain until the first complaint was made. It is totally understandable that a 19 year old woman of Fijian background would, very soon after the stress of the events complained of, not be completely frank with the first two people she met, namely men of non-Fijian background. She then fell asleep in Mr O’Brien’s flat. It is quite probable that, after having played a rugby game, after having had twenty-five drinks, after having had no sleep apart from sleep in the car in the short journey from the Albion Hotel to the appellant’s house and during whatever period immediately followed the journey, and after having had a heavy beating, she fell asleep at once and did not wake up until Ms Hobbs’ arrival. She then complained immediately on waking to the first female she encountered. 
      
       
     51    Fifthly, a related difficulty in the appellant’s position is that one of the key contentions advanced on appeal is quite different from the corresponding contention put to the complainant at trial. At trial it was put to the complainant that the reason she did not complain to Messrs O’Donnell and O’Brien of rape was that she “couldn’t really remember the details of what had happened” - she could “only remember bits and pieces, [she] could remember the accused hitting [her] around the face but [she] could not remember the details of what had happened.” She said she could remember being raped, but did not tell the men because “I didn’t want them to know what had happened to me”. In re-examination she said that she “didn’t feel comfortable telling them”. They were “close friends but [she] wanted to tell a female about what had happened”. But she was not cross-examined to suggest that she only alleged rape because her injuries made it impossible to deny physical assault, she had revealed the identity of the person who assaulted her, she realised there would be an official investigation which would reveal consensual sexual intercourse of which she was ashamed (perhaps because of her family’s likely reaction, perhaps because of the likely reaction of the person with whom she had sexual intercourse on 12 May), and she thereupon determined to make a false allegation of rape. This may be a non-compliance with the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67. Any non-compliance in itself is not a fatal obstacle to the contention that conviction was unreasonable. But the failure of the experienced counsel who represented the appellant at trial to put the new theory of the case to the complainant is a sign either that the theory was so far-fetched that it did not occur to him, or that he regarded it as so unlikely to succeed as not to be worth propounding. In any event, the consequence of the failure is that the theory advanced by the appellant on the appeal lacks evidentiary support: it has not been shown that the complainant was conscious that there would inevitably be an investigation or that the suggested consequences might follow. The defence case at trial, in its positive aspect, rested on an appeal to the appellant’s credibility, and, in its negative aspect, in the complainant’s drunkenness. That line may well have appealed to defence counsel as the likeliest to succeed. But the stress on drunkenness contradicts the line now being advanced. The drunker she was, the less able she was to engage in speedy fabrications on 14 May. Further, she had no time to do so, for, as has been noticed, immediately she parted from the appellant, she met Mr McDonald; then she met Mr O’Brien; then she fell asleep; and then, as soon as she awoke, in a disorientated condition, she complained of rape in strong and direct terms, and complained of being thrown against the wall, which is a detail absent from, and denied in, the appellant’s version. She was so drunk, fatigued and distressed that there was no opportunity to resolve to fabricate a story along the lines suggested.  
      
       
        
       Motives for false allegation 
       
     52    The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “The motives for a false allegation of ‘rape’ were obvious: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) The complainant would no doubt have regretted a decision, presumably very much influenced by her intoxication, to have sex with the appellant. She would have believed, not without some cause, that he had taken advantage of her. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) On the appellant’s account, it is apparent that, after sex, she had been angered by his refusal to drive her home. His refusal would have confirmed a view that, once he had obtained what he wanted, he had little interest in what she wanted. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) The complainant would have harboured considerable animosity to the appellant over the physical assault. 
         
        
        
         
         (d) The complainant would have wished to avoid the embarrassment of admitting that she had got drunk and agreed to have sex with a man she did not know well.” 
         
        
       
     53    These were all possibilities which might raise a doubt. Whether that doubt was reasonable was a matter which the jury had to consider, and which this Court must now consider. But those possibilities must be examined in the light of all the evidence. So considered, they do not raise a reasonable doubt.  
      
       
        
       Reluctance to consult relatives 
       
     54    The appellant submitted that the reluctance to contact her family or her friends has as a possible explanation that she harboured some embarrassment and guilt over what she had done. Another possibility is that which Ms Blackley embraced: “She was obviously very upset and was looking pretty bashed up”. It was Mother’s Day. To delay the delivery of bad news past that day could have been seen by the complainant as an act of kindness. There was nothing of a practical kind to be done which the complainant’s relatives could do which Ms Blackley and Ms Hobbs were not doing.  
      
       
        
       The Ground 1 arguments considered 
       
     55    In addition to the nine points made by the appellant, it might be said that a reading of the transcript reveals numerous differences between witnesses and various curiosities in the complainant’s evidence. The decision of the appellant’s counsel not to highlight these on the appeal was sound: they were no more than what was to be expected and they had no significance equalling the points he did take.  
      
       
     56    There is also a question, which counsel on both sides evidently canvassed at the trial, about whether the evidence of the appellant and the complainant fully explained the sequence of events between 5.30am and 8am on 14 May. If the appellant and the complainant left the Albion Hotel when it closed at 5.30am, and if Mr McDonald saw them at 8am at the clubhouse, a period of two and a half hours must be accounted for. Some of that time would have been taken up by the drive from the Albion Hotel to the appellant’s house and the drive from the appellant’s house to the clubhouse. Some may well have been taken up while the complainant and the appellant stood around inside or outside the Albion Hotel at 5.30am: the fact that an hotel is supposed to close at a particular hour does not mean that its patrons instantly leave either it or its neighbourhood, especially if they have been drinking for over twelve hours. This leaves a substantial period of time - about two hours. The complainant in fact estimated that the period she was with the appellant was about three hours: this seems quite unlikely, though on her version of events her ordeal may well have seemed to last that long. The problem is that on neither the appellant’s version nor the complainant’s version is a period of about two hours accounted for. Her version is that she woke up in the appellant’s bed: if that happened soon after arrival, her narrative of events would be likely to fill a lot less than two hours. His version, too, would not take as long as two hours to unfold. This time difficulty probably favours acceptance of the complainant’s story, since on her version she may have slept for some time at the appellant’s house before waking up.  
      
       
     57    The appellant rightly submitted that it was necessary for the jury, and is necessary for this Court, to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence carefully. The same is true of the appellant’s evidence. Proof of the complainant’s physical condition does not depend on her evidence or on his. How it arose does depend on their evidence. The jury was directed in plain language not to presume sexual assault from the fact of physical assault, and to scrutinise the evidence of complaint with particular care. The evidence of complaint and of distress related to it was strong, and the essential elements of the case against the appellant were powerful. Some of the points now made by the appellant are without force. Those which have more force relate to defects of detail, but these defects are explicable by the drunkenness of the appellant. There is nothing in this case corresponding, for example, with the combination of factors which caused the High Court to find the verdict unreasonable in M v R (1994) 184 CLR 487 - contrary medical evidence, an absence of speedy complaint, an absence of distress, a history of damaging allegations, key testimonial contradictions, and the improbability of the noisy conduct alleged having occurred within hearing of the appellant’s wife.  
      
       
     58    The arguments advanced for the appellant in relation to this ground of appeal are arguments which in varying degrees had a chance of causing the jury to experience a reasonable doubt. But they did not in fact cause the jury to do so. They fail in this Court as well. 
      
       
     59    GROUNDS 2 AND 3: CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT S 105 
      
       
       These grounds are as follows: 
        
         
         “2. The trial Judge erred in excluding evidence of sexual activity involving the complainant on 12 May 2000. 
         
        
        
         
         3. Exclusion of the evidence of sexual activity involving the complainant on 12 May 2000 rendered the conviction unsafe and thereby caused a miscarriage of justice.” 
         
        
       
     60    The appellant’s complaint was that he was not permitted to cross-examine the complainant or otherwise adduce evidence to the effect that: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. The complainant engaged in sexual intercourse on or about the evening of Friday 12 May 2000. 
         
        
        
         
         2. That intercourse included vigorous sexual activity. 
         
        
        
         
         3. Such activity caused or may have caused tenderness in the area of the complainant’s genitalia.” 
         
        
       
     61    When Dr Sneddon examined the complainant at about 11pm on 14 May 2000, the complainant told her that she had had consensual intercourse on 12 May at 8.30pm: about thirty-four hours before the intercourse with the appellant, and more than forty-eight hours before Dr Sneddon’s examination. Dr Sneddon found signs indicating generalised vaginal tenderness and pain indicating recent intercourse, but no visible trauma. In reaching these conclusions, she relied on what the complainant told her, but also relied on the fact that taking swabs from the complainant caused her obvious discomfort, which is not normally the case. For tenderness to have been caused there would have had to have been some aggression or vigour in the intercourse.  
      
       
     62    At the trial the appellant contended that the evidence was admissible in two ways. On appeal the appellant contended for these two avenues of admissibility, and for a third as well. Each of these avenues goes to Ground 2. The appellant also contended that even if the evidence were inadmissible its inadmissibility rendered the verdict unreasonable: that contention goes to Ground 3.  
      
       
     63    The relevant provisions are subsections (1)-(6) of s 105 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. They provide as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) This section applies to prescribed sexual offence proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) Evidence relating to the sexual reputation of the complainant is inadmissible. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) Evidence that discloses or implies: 
         
        
        
         
          (a) that the complainant has or may have had sexual 
         
        
        experience or a lack of sexual experience, or 
        
        
        (b) has or may have taken part or not taken part in any 
        
        sexual activity, 
        
        
        is inadmissible. 
        
        
        (4) Subsection (3) does not apply: 
        
        
        (a) if the evidence: 
        
        
        (i) is of the complainant’s sexual experience or lack 
        
        of sexual experience, or of sexual activity or lack 
        
        of sexual activity taken part in by the complainant, 
        
        at or about the time of the commission of the  
        
        alleged prescribed sexual offence, and 
        
        
        (ii) is of events that are alleged to form part of a  
        
        connected set of circumstances in which the 
        
        alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed, 
        
        
        (b) if the evidence relates to a relationship that was existing 
        
        or recent at the time of the commission of the alleged 
        
         
          prescribed sexual offence, being a relationship between the accused person and the complainant, 
         
        
        
        (c) if: 
        
        
        (i) the accused person is alleged to have had sexual 
        
        intercourse (as defined in section 61H (1) of the  
        
         
       Crimes Act 1900 
       ) with the complainant, and the 
        
        accused person does not concede the sexual 
        
        intercourse so alleged, and 
        
        
        (ii) the evidence is relevant to whether the presence  
        
        of semen, pregnancy, disease or injury is  
        
        attributable to the sexual intercourse alleged to  
        
        have been had by the accused person, 
        
        
        (d) if the evidence is relevant to: 
        
        
        (i) whether at the time of the commission of the 
        
        alleged prescribed sexual offence there was 
        
        present in the complainant a disease that, at 
        
        any relevant time, was absent in the accused 
        
        person, or 
        
        
        (ii) whether at any relevant time there was absent in 
        
        the complainant a disease that, at the time of the 
        
        commission of the alleged prescribed sexual 
        
        offence, was present in the accused person, 
        
        
        (e) if the evidence is relevant to whether the allegation that  
        
        the prescribed sexual offence was committed by the  
        
        accused person was first made following a realisation or 
        
        discovery of the presence of pregnancy or disease in the 
        
        complainant (being a realisation or discovery that took 
        
        place after the commission of the alleged prescribed 
        
        sexual offence), 
        
        
        (f) if the evidence has been given by the complainant in 
        
        cross-examination by or on behalf of the accused person, 
        
        being evidence given in answer to a question that may, 
        
        pursuant to subsection (6), be asked, 
        
        
        and if the probative value of the evidence outweighs any  
        
        distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant 
        
        might suffer as a result of its admission. 
        
        
        (5) A witness must not be asked: 
        
        
        (a) to give evidence that is inadmissible under subsection 
        
        (2) or (3), or 
        
        
        (b) by or on behalf of the accused person, to give  
        
        evidence that is or may be admissible under subsection 
        
        (4) unless the court has previously decided that the 
        
        evidence would, if given, be admissible. 
        
        
        (6) If the court is satisfied: 
        
        
        (a) that it has been disclosed or implied in the case for the 
        
        prosecution against the accused person that the 
        
        complainant has or may have, during a specified 
        
        period or without reference to any period: 
        
        
        (i) had sexual experience, or a lack of sexual 
        
        experience, of a general or specified nature, or 
        
        
        (ii) had taken part in, or not taken part in, sexual 
        
        activity of a general or specified nature, and 
        
        
        (b) the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the 
        
        complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf 
        
        of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or 
        
        implication, 
        
        
        the complainant may be so cross-examined, but only in relation 
        
        to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified 
        
        during the period (if any) so specified.” 
        
        
       Section 105(4)(c)  
        
       
     64    The appellant’s argument to this Court was: 
      
       
        
         
         “On the voir dire, the prosecution adduced evidence from Dr Sneddon that the complainant had asserted ‘tenderness’ when she was vaginally examined…. It also adduced evidence from Dr Sneddon that such tenderness indicated that the sexual intercourse involved ‘aggression’ … although that may have been ‘vigorous’ consensual intercourse … rather than non-consensual intercourse. 
         
        
        
         
         The defence argument was that the ‘tenderness’ fell within the category of ‘injury’ in s 105(4)(c)(ii) and that the provision permitted the defence to adduce evidence of the sexual intercourse on 12 May, 36 hours earlier, in order to provide an alternative explanation for the ‘injury’. 
         
        
        
         
         However, the trial judge accepted a Crown argument that the s 105(4)(c)(i) condition had not been satisfied. He held that the appellant did, in fact, ‘concede the sexual intercourse so alleged’ because he admitted that sexual intercourse had occurred. It is submitted that the trial judge fell into error. The words ‘so alleged’ permitted a distinction between sexual intercourse per se and the non-consensual intercourse alleged by the prosecution. The provision should be given a liberal interpretation in this regard.” 
         
        
       
     65    Whatever the correct interpretation of s 105(4)(c)(i), the proposition that Ground 2 should be upheld by reason of it must be rejected.  
      
       
     66    Even if the appellant’s construction of s 105(4)(c)(i) were correct, no reason has been advanced for doubting the correctness of the trial judge’s conclusion under the tailpiece to s 105(4), namely that the appellant had not shown that the probative value of the evidence outweighed any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission. Dr Sneddon gave firm evidence to the effect that in the absence of trauma it would be “extremely unlikely” - “very unlikely” - that the tenderness was caused by the intercourse on 12 May. In short, the evidence which was excluded was of no, or, at best, hardly any, probative value. This is particularly so since intercourse on 14 May was admitted, and since tenderness was not incompatible with consent on 14 May. The real issue was consent, and tenderness did not negate it. The fact of consent to intercourse on 12 May was of no value in proving consent to intercourse on 14 May. The distress, humiliation or embarrassment likely to have been caused to the complainant by a cross-examination devoted to a comparative assessment of the particular characteristics of the 12 May and the 14 May acts of intercourse was considerable for reasons which the Crown developed in detail but which need not be repeated. The trial judge’s conclusion on the tailpiece was expressed as an alternative basis for his decision, but even if it had not been so expressed, the reasoning capable of being deployed in its support prevents the present argument from succeeding. In written submissions the appellant did not attack this part of the trial judge’s reasoning, and orally counsel for the appellant said it was very difficult to do so.  
      
       
     67    Since the argument fails because of the tailpiece to s 105(4), it is not necessary to decide whether, even if s 105(4)(c)(ii) is satisfied, the construction advanced by the appellant of s 105(4)(c)(i) is wrong. If it were correct, then any divergence between the account offered by a complainant and the account offered by an accused person would mean that the exception created by s 105(4)(c) to the rule of exclusion created by s 105(3) would cease to exist in all cases in which s 105(4)(c)(ii) was satisfied. Section 105 is not a provision the policy or drafting of which excites universal applause, but it is unlikely that its correct construction would cause it to have virtually no application over significant areas. A person accused of sexual intercourse without consent has three choices: to plead guilty; to plead not guilty and contend that intercourse carried out by the accused was not proved; or to plead not guilty and contend that lack of consent is not proved. The appellant’s construction would mean that in all contested cases where s 105(4)(c)(ii) was satisfied, the s 105(4) exception would apply because s 105(4)(c)(i) was satisfied by reason of either a denial of intercourse or a denial of consent. However, in the circumstances it is not necessary, and therefore it is undesirable, to reach a final view on the construction of s 105(4)(c)(i).  
      
       
        
       Section 105(6) 
       
     68    The second argument advanced by the appellant at the trial rested on s 105(6). The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “… that the mere adducing of the evidence of tenderness along with the opinion of Dr Sneddon implied that the complainant had ‘not taken part in sexual activity’ which might otherwise explain the tenderness …. The jury would have inevitably understood from the way the trial proceeded that the prosecution case was that the ‘tenderness’ was caused by the sexual intercourse with the appellant. It was implicit that no alternative explanation for the intercourse existed. The trial judge erred in ruling … that this exception was not satisfied.” 
         
        
       
     69    The appellant had to demonstrate that the appellant would be unfairly prejudiced. The tenderness experienced by the complainant was neutral on the issue of consent. Had the complainant been asked about the 12 May act of intercourse, Dr Sneddon would have said that it would be extremely unlikely to have caused the tenderness. It could have been caused by vigorous consensual intercourse, or by non-consensual intercourse. The 12 May intercourse had little probative value on the issue of how the tenderness was caused. The appellant submitted orally: 
      
       
        
         
         “I appreciate the argument against the appellant on this ground is, given the doctor’s evidence, the evidence of sexual activity would have low probative value. Nevertheless, one has to be very careful in applying that approach to evidence led by the defence for the purpose of creating a reasonable doubt. The jury may have regarded the tenderness as significant evidence. It may have been assumed it tended strongly to point to sexual assault. Conversely, if they had been aware of the sexual activity 36 hours before they may have been prepared to say, ‘We cannot place much weight on the tenderness in those circumstances.’ I cannot put the argument more strongly than that.” 
         
        
        
       However, in the light of Dr Sneddon’s evidence, a doubt based on the explanation for the tenderness being found in the 12 May intercourse would not have been a reasonable doubt.  
        
       
     70    Further, though in the circumstances it is not necessary, and therefore not desirable, to reach a conclusion on the point, it seems strongly arguable that s 105(6)(a) was not satisfied. The argument that it was not satisfied is to the following effect. The Crown did not “disclose” that the complainant had a lack of sexual experience, or had not taken part in sexual activity. “Disclosure” means intentional expressed revelation. The word “implied” in the expression “disclosed or implied” means intentional suggestion. It cannot be said that the silence of the Crown about the complainant’s sexual experience before 14 May “implied” a lack of sexual experience or a failure to take part in sexual activity. The calling of evidence from which the jury might have been likely to infer that the tenderness was caused by the appellant does not imply that there was no alternative explanation. If the provision were construed otherwise, any allegation of sexual intercourse as an ingredient of a crime might be said to have “implied” a lack of any other sexual experience. That would considerably restrict the function of s 105 as a means of protecting complainants.  
      
       
        
       Section 105(4)(a) 
       
     71    On appeal the appellant advanced a third s 105 argument. It was based on s 105(4)(a). The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “Evidence which tends to reveal that the complainant was in some kind of consensual sexual relationship only shortly before the alleged sexual assault would provide a reason for her denying that the intercourse with the appellant was consensual (other than those motives to make a false allegation of ‘rape’ discussed above). She would presumably not want the man she had had sex with on 12 May to know that, the following night, she had got drunk and had sex with a man she barely knew.” 
         
        
       
     72    This avenue of admissibility must fail because of the tailpiece to s 105(4), as discussed above in relation to the appellant’s first argument. In any event, even if the theory advanced in the appellant’s submission is plausible, the sexual intercourse on 12 May was not an event which formed part of a connected set of circumstances in which the crime of sexual intercourse on 14 May without consent and with aggravation was committed. The two events were entirely unconnected. Each respectively related to two entirely separate sets of circumstances. The making of a false allegation of rape on 14 May might be loosely connected with the 12 May intercourse, but the actual alleged offence was not connected with the 12 May intercourse.  
      
       
        
       Unreasonable verdict 
       
     73    The appellant’s fourth argument - which goes to Ground 3 - was that if, contrary to the three arguments just considered, the trial judge was correct in holding the evidence to be inadmissible, that fact “provides an additional basis for holding the conviction” to be unreasonable. The appellant cited R v Morgan (1993) 63 A Crim R 526 at 537, where Mahoney JA said: 
      
       
        
         
         “If the result of the application of s 409B is that the accused has not had a fair trial, then the verdict will not stand.” 
         
        
        
       Section 409B of the  
       Crimes Act 
        1900 was the precursor of s 105. Gleeson CJ and Sully J agreed with Mahoney JA’s reasons for judgment.  
        
       
     74    In refusing special leave to appeal in Berrigan v R (unreported, 23 November 1995, High Court of Australia) Dawson J (speaking for himself, Toohey and McHugh JJ) said: “The correct application of the provision [s 409B] cannot of itself found an argument that the trial was unfair or that the verdict was unsafe or unsatisfactory.” It is not necessary to consider whether Mahoney JA’s statement requires re-examination. It depends on establishing that the trial was not fair. In view of the lack of probative value of the evidence and the fact that its exclusion did not unfairly prejudice the appellant, its exclusion cannot be said to have led to the result that the appellant has not had a fair trial.  
      
       
        
       GROUND 4: DELAY DIRECTION 
       
     75    Ground 4 was: 
      
       
        
         
         “The trial judge failed properly to direct the jury regarding the delay in complaint regarding sexual assault.” 
         
        
        
       The appellant submitted: 
        
         
         “It is submitted that the way in which the trial judge directed the jury was inadequate. He reminded them of a defence argument that the complaint of sexual assault to Hobbs and others was less significant in supporting her credibility/consistency because of the fact that no comparable complaint was made to McDonald and O’Brien. However, he did not invite the jury to consider whether that delay positively tended to discredit the complainant, notwithstanding the reason she gave for not telling them. 
         
        
        
         
         The present is a case where a miscarriage of justice resulted from the failure of the trial judge to point out to the jury that the delay might be used to discredit the complainant:  
         Crofts v R 
          (1996) 186 CLR 427. The trial judge had a duty to provide the warning suggested by  
         Kilby v R 
          (1973) 129 CLR 460 at 465,  
         Crofts 
          at 451. The peculiar facts of this case …, and particularly the fact that, after she made the first complaint of ‘bashing’, she would have realised that the fact of sexual intercourse would have emerged, suggest the need for a warning to restore the balance ( 
         Crofts 
          at 451.8).” 
         
        
        
       The appellant referred orally to the following observation of Hunt CJ at CL in  
       R v DJK 
        (1997) 96 A Crim R 443 at 448: 
        
         
         “The judge did not direct the jury that, in evaluating the evidence of the complainant and in determining whether to believe her, they could take into account her failure to make a complaint at the earliest reasonable opportunity as reducing her credibility.” 
         
        
       
     76    The first difficulty with this submission is that it postulates that there was delay which might have been to the discredit of the complainant. Yet in truth there was no relevant delay. The first two complaints to Ms Hobbs and Ms Blackley were, to use the words of Hunt CJ at CL, made at the earliest reasonable opportunity. 
      
       
     77    The second difficulty with the submission is that it rests on the theory advanced on appeal but not at trial that by the time she had spoken to Mr McDonald and Mr O’Brien she would have known the matter would be officially investigated, and to protect herself from the revelation of consensual intercourse she concocted a false charge of rape. That theory, which supposedly explains the “delay”, has been shown to lack any evidentiary foundation or reality. 
      
       
     78    The third difficulty is that the argument depends on a distinction between a direction that delay could cause the jury to give the complaints less importance and a direction that delay could cause the jury not to believe the complainant. This distinction was described by counsel for the appellant as “a fine distinction”. In truth it is a non-existent one. The reason why delay might have caused the jury to give the complaints less importance is that delay might have caused the jury to believe the complainant less than they otherwise might have.  
      
       
     79    The fourth difficulty is that since counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial (who did not appear on the appeal) did not ask the trial judge to direct the jury in the manner which it is now said should have been employed, leave is needed under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules if this ground is to succeed. That leave should be refused. The direction which was criticised was given on 31 October 2000 before lunch. No relevant redirection was requested by counsel for the appellant when the jury left the court just before lunch, though the Crown asked for some directions at that point. Nor was any redirection requested later that day when the jury retired. Even if, contrary to what has been said above, there was an error in not giving the direction, it was a very minor error. It was not an error capable of creating a miscarriage of justice. The trial judge gave numerous directions about factors which might cause the jury to reject or question the complainant’s credibility or reliability. The omitted direction would not have caused the jury to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence any more critically than other directions invited them to.  
      
       
        
       ORDERS  
       
     80    Despite the arguments advanced by the appellant’s counsel, and the ability with which they were put, the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     81    WOOD CJ at CL: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Heydon JA. I agree with his reasons and the orders he proposes. 
      
       
     82    SULLY J: I agree with Heydon JA.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JThursday, 14 June 200170076/00 - REGINA v Steven John CLARKSENTENCE1   HIS HONOUR: On 23 April 2001 a jury found the offender, Steven John Clark, guilty of the murder at Mathoura on 7 February 1999 of Lynette Kay Lock. 
     
      
    2   The offender was invalided out of the Royal Australian Navy because of serious disabilities resulting from injuries he received in a motor vehicle accident that occurred during his naval service. He received a substantial amount of money by way of compensation and used part of it to purchase the franchise of the post office at Mathoura in about 1993. He began to manage and operate the post office. He also purchased dwelling houses in Mathoura and elsewhere. One such house, in the village of Mathoura, was occupied by the offender’s mother, Mrs Heil. She suffered from multiple sclerosis. 
     
      
    3   The deceased, Lynette Kay Lock, also lived in the village. She successfully applied for the franchise to deliver mail from Mathoura to residents of the village and certain of the outlying districts. She and the offender seem at first to have had a reasonable working relationship. Their responsibilities were independent. The offender was not responsible to see that the deceased carried out her duties properly and had no authority over her. 
     
      
    4   The offender was always concerned about his mother’s state of health and there came a time when he thought it might be in his mother’s best interests to have someone such as the deceased living with her in the house. He suggested to the deceased that she board with his mother, in effect paying a portion of her rent in money and a portion in caring for Mrs Heil and doing help around the house. 
     
      
    5   As time went on the offender’s attitude towards the deceased changed. It is necessary in order to explain that change to say something about his perceptions of her, her conduct and her intentions. It is not generally necessary, however, to consider whether his perceptions were accurate. 
     
      
    6   Unfortunately tension arose between Mrs Heil and the deceased. It was suggested to the offender that the deceased was interfering in the friendship of Mrs Heil and other residents of the village and behaving in a domineering and possessive manner. There were other problems too. Complaints were made that the deceased was not delivering the mail satisfactorily. Members of the public did not understand that the offender was not responsible for the manner in which she did her work and brought their complaints to him. That also caused the relations between the offender and the deceased to deteriorate. 
     
      
    7   The offender and his family received advice, including medical advice, that it would be better for Mrs Heil if the deceased were to move out of her house. The deceased was given a month to find other accommodation. By that time she no longer had the postal delivery franchise. It appeared to the offender as though she were making no effort to find anywhere else to live. He knew, for example, that there were vacancies at the caravan park, yet she said that she had been unable to find accommodation. I think that the offender must have suspected that the deceased would not move out of Mrs Heil’s house unless substantial pressure were brought to bear. 
     
      
    8   On the morning of 7 February 1999 the offender and Mrs Heil were due to leave Mathoura to attend a barbecue at a village in Victoria about sixty-eight kilometres from Mathoura. The journey between the two villages would have taken about forty-five minutes. The barbecue was being held by a sister of the offender and the plan was that he should take Mrs Heil there. The barbecue was due to commence at about 11.30 am. Two witnesses remembered seeing the deceased alive on the morning of 7 February. One, Miss Bright, was serving in a shop and attended to her some time between 9 and 10.30 am. Mr Colin Robertson, a particular friend of the deceased, said that she left his house at about 9.30 am. Witnesses who attended the barbecue estimated the time of arrival of the offender and Mrs Heil as between midday and 1 pm. The evidence of the offender was that they arrived at about 11.30 am, having stopped off on the way in Echuca to purchase sausages and for him to inspect his investment properties there. 
     
      
    9   The pine forest where the remains of the deceased were found several months later was rather more than twenty kilometres out of Mathoura in the opposite direction. The jury were obviously satisfied that the offender had time to collect the deceased from Mrs Heil’s house, take her to the pine forest, kill her and dispose of her body and return to Mathoura in time to collect Mrs Heil and take her to the barbecue. 
     
      
    10   DNA evidence satisfactorily identified the few remains found months later as those of the deceased. 
     
      
    11   The most important witness in the Crown case was Mr Scott Dennis Brown, an old friend of the offender from their Navy days and one of the few who had kept in touch with him since his medical discharge. They saw each other a number of times each year and were in a sideline business together. Mr Brown, who lived in Canberra, used to purchase second hand computers and prepare them for resale. Some of them were sold through the offender at Mathoura. On one of the visits of Mr Brown to Mathoura the offender told him that he had driven the deceased from Mathoura to the pine forest and had shot her three times before dragging her body some way into the forest and leaving it. He left with Mr Brown some written instructions for the use of a 9 mm Browning pistol. 
     
      
    12   Mr Brown kept these things to himself for a long time but eventually told the police and when a search was carried out later on three fired cartridge cases were found, appropriate for use with 9 mm bullets. 
     
      
    13   The jury were instructed that they must not find the offender guilty unless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Brown’s account of the manner in which the accused told him he killed the deceased was reliable. I conclude that the offender killed the deceased in the manner which he described to Mr Brown. His intent was to kill. I think that his motive for doing so must have been his frustration over the difficulties he was having in getting her to leave his mother’s house, coupled with his anxiety for his mother’s health and his resentment over troubles he had had because of the deceased’s failure to carry out her delivery duties properly and which were no fault of his. 
     
      
    14   The offender was born on 16 April 1965 and entered the Navy as an apprentice during his teens. He was a fit young man and apparently good at his job. He began as an aircraft technician and changed to the electrician’s trade because he wanted to get a ticket and do well in his chosen service. He was a good sportsman, too, and had prospects of representative appointment in Australian football. These things all came to an end in the motor vehicle accident. The disabilities he was left with were substantial. He suffered a head injury and resulting permanent brain damage. He has left-sided weakness. He cannot remember the detail of things as well as he could before. In order to operate a computer at the post office, for example, it was necessary for him to write down the sequences of keystrokes that were necessary in routine operations because he could not remember them. The evidence also establishes that his mood was altered in that he became more prone to making spontaneous foolish and occasionally offensive remarks. Whereas he had no difficulty making friends whilst he was in the Navy, he became a man who was not liked by many people. He married and he and his wife settled in Mathoura, but the marriage did not last long and broke up with the offender accusing his wife of taking financial advantage of him. 
     
      
    15   He was assessed by Dr Wayne Reid, clinical neuropsychologist, on 22 May 2000. In tests the offender achieved a verbal IQ of 93, a performance IQ of 85 and a full scale IQ of 89, which Dr Reid said placed the offender’s level of functioning in the low average range. He thought that before the accident his range of intellectual ability would have been average. Dr Reid puts down the difference to the effects of residual brain damage from the 1987 head injury. The offender’s other symptoms are inability to think quickly and speak fluently and behaviour which is distractible and inappropriate at times. 
     
      
    16   The offender has been held in custody ever since his arrest on 17 March 2000 and those who have the care of him have been impressed with his behaviour and co-operation. He is obviously responding well within the confines of the Corrective Services system. 
     
      
    17   He has a conviction for assault, but the Court was told that it resulted from over-vigorous correction of the child of his former wife and was an offence committed during the heat of that bitter relationship. I think that it is of no relevance for present purposes and I think that I should regard the offender as equivalent to a first offender. 
     
      
    18   Although there was abundant evidence to demonstrate the tendency of the offender to behave impulsively, it was not submitted on sentence that what happened on 7 February 1999 was done in any way on the spur of the moment, and I do not think that it was. As I have said, I think that the offender was motivated by the pressures which bore upon him. I think that he must have considered his actions and his choices and I do not think that there was anything impulsive about the way in which he took the deceased to the forest and killed her. 
     
      
    19   It was submitted on behalf of the offender, relying upon the evidence of Dr Reid as to the level of the offender’s intellectual functioning, that general and personal deterrence ought to be given much less weight than might normally have been the case. It was submitted that there was no need to protect society against any further violent behaviour of the offender. Reference was made to R v Letteri, Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 18 March 1992 unreported, Regina v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 and other cases. 
     
      
    20   I do not accept that the principles referred to in those cases ought to apply here. This is not a case where the offender is suffering from some mental illness or disability the existence of which would make it inappropriate to impose a salutary sentence. Neither does the offender suffer from any severe intellectual handicap. He simply functions in the low average range. There is no impairment of his planning skills or his ability to choose between courses of action. He must have premeditated and planned the death of the deceased. He had to persuade her to go for a drive with him, he had to obtain the firearm and the ammunition and he had to ensure that he could travel to the forest and back and do all that he had to do, covering his tracks as necessary, within a limited period of time. 
     
      
    21   The offender’s physical disability will make it more difficult for him than for most to serve the custodial period of his sentence and he may be denied the full range of activities available to most within the Corrective Services system. I take that into account. I do not consider that he will be a danger to others when he is released back into the community, because I think that this offence resulted from a peculiar coincidence of circumstances which is not likely to be repeated. 
     
      
    22   I have considered whether the circumstances warrant a period on parole which would require the imposition of a non-parole period less than three-quarters of the sentence I intend to impose, but I do not think that any extended period will be necessary. 
     
      
    23   Steven John Clark, I sentence you to imprisonment for a period of sixteen years commencing on 17 March 2000 and expiring on 16 March 2016. I fix a non-parole period of twelve years which will expire on 16 March 2012. You will become eligible for release on parole on that day.

      REGINA v. BEATRIZ GONZALEZ-BETES 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   DOWD, J: The court is in a position to give judgment in relation to the first appellant and Greg James, J. will give the first judgment. 
     2   GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence and an appeal against conviction by Beatriz Gonzalez-Betes Suarez, who was found guilty after a trial in the District Court of New South Wales on one count of having been knowingly concerned with Gregory Paul Meggett and Jose Manuel Campillo Vaquere in the importation into Australia of a prohibited import to which s.233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) applied, to wit, narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of cocaine being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to cocaine. 
     3   The quantity in this case was some 224.84 kilograms impure, 172.2 kilograms pure of the prohibited drug. 
     4   The appellant in respect of that offence was sentenced to a head sentence of life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 22 years. The co-accused, Robert Scott Flavel, who was tried with this appellant, also appeals against conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him, which was a sentence of life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 25 years. 
     5   The person Meggett referred to in the charge had pleaded guilty and agreed to assist the authorities. He gave evidence in the relevant trial. Having regard to his role and to his assistance a sentence had been passed upon him of 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years. 
     6   The grounds of appeal as to the conviction of this appellant include an initial four grounds which may be considered together. Those grounds are expressed in the grounds of appeal and the written submissions as follows:- 
      
       
        
        ""(1) Her Honour erred in not ordering a separate trial of the appellants. This caused a miscarriage of justice."" 
        
       
     7   (That ground was expressed in the written submissions as follows, ""The failure of trial counsel for the appellant to make a separate trial application and caused the miscarriage of justice"".) 
      
       
        
        ""(2) Her Honour erred in admitting inadmissible material of previous importations by Gregory Meggett, Robert Flavel and Julian Del Prado, be led against the appellant. This caused a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Her Honour erred in not directing the jury, before the evidence of Gregory Meggett was given of previous drug importations, that this evidence was only admissible and to be considered in the case alleged against Robert Flavel and not the appellant. This caused a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) Her Honour erred in not directing the jury that the evidence of Gregory Meggett of previous drug importations was only admissible and to be considered in their deliberations in the case alleged against Robert Flavel and not the appellant. This caused a miscarriage of justice."" 
        
       
     8   These grounds all refer, as they have been argued, to evidence that had been admitted at the joint trial of some seven previous transatlantic journeys in which, as occurred on this occasion, a yacht was used to transport a Boston Whaler internationally. 
     9   A short summary of facts of what was alleged against the appellant makes it clear that it was contended that she had been party to an importation of the drugs into Australia by the use of a yacht, the Maeva, she had previously provided to one Del Prado. That yacht was used to carry a Boston Whaler, in which the drug was concealed, to the north coast of New South Wales to where she had come to meet the others involved in the importation and where she took steps to take possession of the Whaler. 
     10   Importantly, there was evidence from Meggett that at Varadero Beach in Cuba he had a conversation with the appellant in which she revealed knowledge of the use of a yacht for the purpose of carrying Boston Whalers as a technique for importing contraband into foreign countries. 
     11   That conversation included references to her saying to Meggett that she ""knew of Robert [Flavel] and my involvement with Julian [Del Prado] and moving the dinghies to Europe"". She said ""that it was a good idea to put drugs in the dinghy"", and that ""it was difficult to have knowledge of Julian was doing and Rob and myself and then to pretend in front of [her husband] that she knew nothing, that everything was normal"". 
     12   This conversation it was said occurred with Meggett at a time at which the appellant and her husband were the owners of the yacht, Maeva. 
     13   Following the conversation Meggett sailed the vessel with the appellant and her husband to the Netherlands Antilles. The appellant and her husband there left the vessel, having apparently sold it to Del Prado or a person or entity associated with him.  
     14   Meggett remained with the yacht, thereafter flew to Florida and met with Flavel. The two of them returned to the Netherlands Antilles where they met Del Prado, who instructed them to sail the yacht to the northern terminus of the Panama Canal.  
     15   Flavel was instructed to remain with the yacht on its passage through the Canal and they met again at Colon with Del Prado. Thereafter the yacht was sailed by Flavel and subsequently returned to the Canal. It was sailed with Meggett through the Canal. Meggett recruited two further crew members and in due course sailed to the east coast of Australia stopping at locations where Flavel met him. 
     16   On arrival on the east coast of New South Wales various activities associated with the arrival of the yacht took place by those then present in New South Wales including Flavel, Meggett, Campillo, who had rented certain premises at Taree, and the appellant. 
     17   Intercepted conversations and the observations of those activities provided a strong circumstantial case against the appellant, even setting aside the proof of her provision of the yacht to the conspirators, and the conversation to which I have referred. Objection was not taken to that conversation as being irrelevant or otherwise inadmissible at the trial. 
     18   However, when evidence was led at a prior trial concerning the previous yacht journeys with Boston Whalers, to which I have referred, an objection was taken by counsel then appearing. That counsel at that time submitted that the evidence of the prior yacht journeys would be highly prejudicial to the appellant and that it was:- 
      
       
        
        ""Irrespective of what your Honour says to the jury, the jury will by association link in Gonzalez with those so called Spanish excursions, yet she was not aware, she was not part of, so I am attacking it from the point of ... the prejudicial effect is something that simply is so great."" 
        
       
     19   Consistently, counsel for the appellant asserted before that trial judge the prejudicial effect of that evidence on the appellant's case should she go to trial with her co-accused. 
     20   In response to that application the Crown in a passage in the transcript conceded that the evidence was not led against the appellant. However, that passage needs to be examined. 
     21   In what was said the Crown was plainly conceding that there would be no Crown case put that the appellant was in any way involved in those yacht journeys. It was clear that the Crown put that she was not party to nor could she be considered in any way involved in the journeys themselves and, as I understand it, it was not put against her that it could be found that those journeys in any way could be relied on to link her with drugs. 
     22   In the light of that concession by the Crown and following the discharge of the jury in that trial for an unrelated reason, the matter went forward before her Honour Judge Ainslie-Wallace in the present trial and the evidence of the journeys was led without objection. 
     23   No direction under s.165 of the Evidence Act 1995 as to unreliability of any evidence nor application for exclusion on the basis of any of the sections of the Evidence Act 1995 was in fact made before her Honour as applicable to the present trial. 
     24   No objection was made to the evidence of the conversation at Varadero Beach, to which I have referred, which plainly evidenced a knowledge on the part of the appellant of the technique of importing Boston Whalers by yacht as having previously been employed and which bore such a striking resemblance to the technique used on this occasion. 
     25   The matter went forward on the basis the conversation was to be used as evidence of the knowledge of the appellant of a technique which was used on this occasion for importing the Boston Whaler and as thereby relevant to the question of her involvement in and knowledge of the importation of drugs by this means into Australia. 
     26   It is notable that the intercepted conversation evidence showed clearly her concern, not with the yacht she had once owned, but with the importation into Australia of the Boston Whaler in which the drugs were concealed. 
     27   The argument that has been put in respect of these four grounds turns on a central theme that the Crown had undertaken that evidence of these importations was not to be used against the appellant in any way at all; that the trial judge failed adequately to quarantine that evidence from use in the case against the appellant by appropriate directions to the jury at all relevant times that they were not to consider it as in any way applicable to the case involving this appellant; that trial counsel failed to make an application for a separate trial, failed to make an application for appropriate directions, and thereby left the material before the jury in so far as it was before the jury, as evidence against the appellant. It was submitted that his Honour had not directed the jury they were not to use it at all and that therefore she had left it to them as evidence they might use. Further, it was said that, absent an appropriate direction, they might misuse the evidence as tendency evidence. 
     28   In her directions her Honour approached the summing-up by way of directing the jury as to what evidence was available to be considered in the individual cases of each accused and gave to the jury the customary direction that each case had to be considered separately. Rather than direct the jury as to what was not available in any particular case, her Honour directed the jury specifically as to what was available. 
     29   There was little dispute at the trial except as to the matter of knowledge. Her Honour in her summing-up reflected this when she said:- 
      
       
        
        ""Now in this case there is no dispute that there was an importation of a considerable quantity of cocaine which was concealed in a Boston Whaler dinghy and which was carried on the 'Maeva' which had been sailed from Varadero Beach in Cuba to Coffs Harbour by Mr. Meggett, nor is there any dispute that on 7 December Mr. Meggett lowered the dinghy from the 'Maeva' and motored across the harbour to a boat ramp where it was put on a boat trailer which was towed by a four wheel drive which was driven there by Campillo and accompanied by Mrs. Gonzalez. That dinghy was hooked on to the trailer and Meggett, Mrs. Gonzalez and Campillo got into the car and they were arrested"". 
        
       
     30   Her Honour continued to point out that there was no dispute that between the two skins of the dinghy was found the cocaine in blocks amounting to some 187 kilograms of pure cocaine. Her Honour pointed out that the real issue in the trial is whether each of the accused was knowingly concerned in the importation. 
     31   Her Honour directed the jury that mere involvement or participation in the importation was not enough to make out the charge. Her Honour directed the jury that what the jury needed to be satisfied of beyond reasonable doubt was whether the Crown had proved the particular accused, when they participated in the importation, knew that what was being imported was the relevant narcotic goods, and then set out those categories of evidence on which the Crown relied from which the jury might, if they accepted that evidence, conclude that the case was made out. 
     32   Her directions concerning Mr. Meggett in particular gave emphasis to disputes as to the conversations of which he gave evidence, to his status as an accomplice, and how that might affect the jury's regard for his evidence. She said:- 
      
       
        
        ""… and in the case of Mrs. Gonzalez there is a dispute concerning the conversation which Mr. Meggett said he had with her in Varadero Beach in which he said she said to him 'it was a good idea to hide - conceal drugs in the dinghies' and in which she said to him she knew of his involvement with Julian and the movement of the dinghies."" 
        
       
     33   At that point her Honour turned to direct the jury as to the care and caution which had to be taken when considering this evidence as a result of the accumulated experience of the courts concerning the reliability of such persons.  
     34   There was discussion by her Honour in the summing-up as to various matters to which the jury could have regard concerning the reliability of Mr. Meggett's testimony. At no point was it suggested that the jury could have regard to those prior yacht journeys as in any way assisting, as far as their acceptability of Meggett's evidence against this appellant on the question of the conversation was concerned, the reliability and acceptability of Meggett's evidence. 
     35   Indeed the trial judge turned to the alternative submission made by the Crown of its circumstantial evidence case and at that point again gave no direction to suggest that the prior yacht journey evidence might be relied upon in the case against the appellant as a circumstance pointing to guilt or even as context. 
     36   At the close of the summing-up no application for redirection was made to suggest any deficiency in her Honour approaching the case in this way.  
     37   At the trial there was no relevant application for any redirection in respect of the summing-up to suggest that the case for and against each individual accused was not put to the jury in a way that fairly reflected the trial and fairly enabled the jury to consider the appropriate questions for each accused.  
     38   In my view, her Honour did leave to the jury the evidence of the prior journeys but only in the context of it being evidence against Mr. Flavel. 
     39   Before us it has been contended in respect of the four grounds to which I have referred that the evidence was completely prejudicial to the appellant. When counsel for her was questioned as to how that prejudice arose, it was put that the jury might well have concluded or suspected that she had some involvement in previous drug importations carried out by that technique. 
     40   On a careful examination of the summing-up I can see no basis to conclude that the jury might have misused that evidence in that way, put to them as it was. I do not for myself consider that the prior importations or prior yacht journeys, as perhaps they should be better described, would have occasioned any disadvantage to the appellant in making the case that she sought to make, which was that Meggett had invented the conversation attributing to her knowledge of those importations and a willingness to involve herself in a further importation. 
     41   Rule 4, in the absence of the prospect of a substantial miscarriage of justice, would lead to a rejection of leave to argue this matter. However, it has been necessary to deal with it fully. Having done so, I do not see that the prejudice, which it is contended underlies the four grounds, could arise. Counsel were not even able to suggest to me how the trial might differently have been conducted if the trial defence counsel considered that the importations might have had availability for the Crown to use in evidence against her. 
     42   In my view there is no substance in any of the first four grounds of appeal and it is not necessary to turn to such issues as to whether counsel was flagrantly incompetent. I am of the view that the trial judge adequately summed up to the jury on the differing cases and adequately explained to the jury what evidence was available for them to consider. I would reject those grounds of appeal. 
     43   There are further grounds of appeal asserted. Firstly, ground 5, that her Honour erred in allowing the Crown to lead evidence from its principal witness which only went to that witness' credibility. This caused a miscarriage of justice. 
     44   It is submitted that evidence that was led of Meggett having pleaded guilty, being sentenced, serving the sentence, and having given and signed an undertaking to co-operate to give evidence, having also received a 50% sentence discount because of that undertaking, was evidence which should not have been led since all it went to show were matters to his credit. 
     45   The credibility rule is expressed in s.102 of the Evidence Act 1995. That section provides that evidence that is relevant only to a witness' credibility is not admissible. Credibility is defined in the dictionary to the Evidence Act 1995. It includes:-  
      
       
        
        ""Credibility of any part or all of evidence of a witness and the witness' ability to observe all broad facts or events."" 
        
       
     46   The objection appears to be that the Crown was seeking to increase the credit of its own witness improperly. 
     47   Since well prior to the Evidence Act 1995, indeed since Regina v. Booth (1983) 8 A. Crim. R. at 81, it has been incumbent on the Crown when utilising the evidence of an indemnified accomplice, or a person to whom some benefit has or might be extended by dint of that witness' testimony, to reveal that fact in evidence and the true status of the witness, not for the purpose of increasing the witness' credibility but to enable the jury properly to consider those matters on the question of whether the witness' credibility is thereby diminished. 
     48   I do not understand there to be any provision of the Evidence Act 1995 the effect of which might be that that practice or rule of law should be changed. It would be most unfair to an accused not to put those matters into evidence. It is not suggested here that those matters should have been reserved to the cross-examiner to expose. If that were the suggestion then no harm could be said now to have been occasioned by the jury being informed of those matters. I do not see there being any substance in ground 5 and would reject it. 
     49   Ground 6 relates to one of those unfortunate occasions in which, at a trial, a matter which is better not referred to, was inadvertently referred to. Almost at the end of the Crown's cross-examination of the appellant questions were asked by the learned Crown Prosecutor about matters to which the appellant's brother-in-law had referred also in evidence, but the brother-in-law's evidence had been given in the absence of the jury on a voir dire. 
     50   The Crown asked the following questions and received the following answers:- 
      
       
        
        ""Q. Yes, the one that was listened to by your brother-in-law, and about which he gave evidence? 
         
        A. The one that he could only understand a few words? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I am sorry, I may be wrong in saying he gave evidence about it. It was one to which your brother-in-law listened, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes, I think we all listened to it."" 
        
       
     51   The appellant's submissions point out there was an immediate reaction from the jury and there was reference to that in what her Honour then said. The Crown Prosecutor at that point conceded that what he had done had been to overlook that the brother-in-law had given evidence in the absence of the jury and suggested that he had made a mistake but it was probably best left exactly where it was. 
     52   It is contended that what has thereby occurred has caused the trial to miscarry. It was put that s.189 of the Evidence Act 1995 which deals with the determination of preliminary questions, provides that preliminary questions are not to be heard and determined in the presence of the jury.  
     53   Section 189(2) provides that such questions are to be heard and determined in the jury's absence. Further, s.189(4) provides if there is a jury, the jury is not to be present at the hearing to decide any other preliminary question, ie., other than as to admissibility, unless the court so orders. 
     54   In addition, evidence given by the witness on the voir dire is not to be adduced in the proceedings - s.189(8) - except in certain limited circumstances, which did not operate here. 
     55   It is submitted that thereby there is a total statutory prohibition applicable to what occurred here and the conduct of the Crown was totally impermissible. However, that submission is made on the basis that the Crown introduced material in breach of the section. When one examines what has occurred, all that was said in the question was, that it was a conversation about which the brother-in-law had given evidence. The content of that evidence was nowhere described any more particularly. 
     56   I see no basis on which it might be concluded that there was any substantial effect on the trial or indeed that any possibility of a miscarriage of justice might have occurred. 
     57   Ground 7 is couched in very broad terms. Ground 7 contends that the Crown infringed the appellant's right to silence. This caused a miscarriage of justice. There were no oral submissions on this ground.  
     58   In the written submissions of the appellant it is contended that the Crown Prosecutor, when he cross-examined the appellant, acted impermissibly and in breach of a fundamental right when he asked the appellant why she did not tell the police certain matters when she was questioned by them after her arrest. 
     59   She said in answer to a question as to why she had not told the police about a matter:- 
      
       
        
        ""Because it was the advice I had from my solicitor. He said to me that not to mention anything in relation to the boat."" 
        
       
     60   Not surprisingly, that answer having been given, she was asked whether she had been told by her solicitor to mislead the police by concealing her activities in Coffs Harbour. There was an objection followed by some examination of the proposition of what was being put and the cross-examination continued as to whether she had lied to the police or not. She contended she had not lied to the police but was trying to hide the fact that she was waiting for the yacht because that is what her solicitor had advised her to do. 
     61   Her contention was that her answers to the police, which might well otherwise have been considered inadequate and reflecting on her credit at trial, were explained since she was relying on what she had been told by her solicitor when she answered as she did, not attempting to deceive the police. 
     62   It is submitted in that regard that the effect of s.89 of the Evidence Act 1995 which provides that an inference unfavourable to a party must not be drawn from that party's failure or refusal to answer questions or to respond to a representation reflecting, as it is submitted it does, a common law principle, was such that there should not have been cross-examination of this kind. 
     63   That submission appears to go so far as submitting that if lies are told to the police, either actively or by omission, such a matter cannot be used in aid of a Crown case or a later account tested in cross-examination by reference to the police interview. It is submitted that in effect the appellant could not be cross-examined on what she said to the police and even more importantly what she omitted saying to the police. 
     64   The section simply does not go so far. I see no substance in this ground of appeal. I would reject it. 
     65   It follows that in my view the appeal on conviction should be dismissed. 
     66   I turn to the appeal on sentence. In that regard it has been submitted that the appellant was wrongly treated by her Honour as though she were a ""mid-level executive"" in an organisation, which treatment by her Honour exaggerated the role played by the appellant. 
     67   It was, however, conceded in argument by her counsel, that the appellant performed important and essential tasks in this importation. However, to suggest her culpability had been overrated, there was an attempt to draw an analogy with the courier role referred to by the court in Regina v. Pang (1999) 105 A Crim R 474. 
     68   In this case in a careful and detailed judgment her Honour found that the role of the present appellant was much more important than that considered by the court in Pang (supra). Although it was submitted it was not open to her Honour to conclude that the appellant was a ""mid-level executive"" in the written submissions, in oral submissions it was conceded that there was evidence and whether it had been conceded or not, that evidence plainly was there, such as to support her Honour's findings of the actions and involvement of the applicant. 
     69   The amount of drug involved in this case was enormous. This was a carefully planned sophisticated importation in which the appellant was not the ring leader, chief operative or chairman of the board. She was, however, a person who involved herself early and whose activities seem to be such as to be essential to the operation of this small group of criminals bringing into Australia a very large quantity of the pernicious drug for a challenge to distribution. The precise terminology describing by analogy that role, misses the point. 
     70   I am unable to see that her Honour's conclusion as to the appropriate sentence was in error. I am unable to see that it was not open to her to find as she did on the evidence which was before her. 
     71   This court sits as a court to consider whether error in the sentencing discretion of the trial judge has been shown or whether the sentence is on its face manifestly excessive. I see no error either in the way in which her Honour came to her conclusion or in the result. 
     72   I would propose that leave to appeal against sentence be granted and the appeal dismissed. Thus the orders I would propose are:- 
     73   As to the appeal on conviction, the appeal be dismissed. As to the appeal on sentence, leave to appeal be granted and the appeal dismissed. 
     74   DOWD, J: I agree with the orders proposed by Greg James, J. and his reasons therefore. 
     75   BARR, J: I also agree. 
     76   DOWD, J: The orders of this court will therefore be as proposed by Greg James, J.

The death of the deceased resulted from a physical attack upon him, which occurred outside a nightclub on 22 June 1996.Neither the appellant nor the co-accused gave any evidence at trial. The trial judge’s instructions to the jury included the direction that the jury could not impute guilt directly from the accused’s failure to give evidence at trial and the statement that the accused was not obliged to give evidence. However, the trial judge also made the following comments to the jury: 
      
       
       “…you may when judging the value, or the weight of the evidence which has been put forward by the Crown, in seeking to prove its case against the accused, take into account the election by the accused, not to deny or contradict matters in the evidence at this trial, about which the accused could have given direct evidence. … The relevance of the fact that the accused has not given evidence can only go the value, or the weight, which you give the evidence which the Crown witnesses have given.” 
       
     The appellant and the co-accused were found guilty of murder, and the appellant appealed to this Court. Held by Smart AJ (Barr J concurring and Heydon JA disagreeing in part), dismissing the appeal:1. (Per curiam): The trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury in  
      
       
       relation to the use the jury could make of the appellant’s failure to give evidence at trial.  
        
         
         a. There were no “rare and exceptional” circumstances in  
          
           
           which comment by the judge to the jury on the accused’s silence was permitted. The evidence of the appellant’s involvement in the attack upon the deceased was not “capable of explanation by disclosure of  
           additional 
            facts known  
           only 
            to the accused” [Heydon JA at [29]].

         b. The relevant part of the summing-up was on all fours with  
          
           
           those considered to be misdirections by reason of contravention of s 20(2) of the  
           Evidence Act  
           by the High Court in  
           Azzopardi v R  
            and  
           Davies v R 
           . The contradiction that the High Court found in those cases between the “comment” to the jury - that the accused’s failure to give evidence might be used to assess the weight of the Crown evidence - and the “direction” - that the accused’s failure to give evidence cannot be used to infer guilt -, also exists in this summing-up 
           .  
           
          
         
        
       
     2. (Per Smart AJ and Barr J, Heydon JA disagreeing):  
      
       
       The proviso in s 6(1) of the  
       Criminal Appeal Act  
       1912, which allows an appeal to be dismissed on the ground that “no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred”, should be applied to this appeal.  
        
       a. There was no “fundamental error” that caused the  
        
         
          
           
           proceedings to miscarry so as “hardly to be a trial at all”.

           Glennon v R  
           (1994) 119 ALR 706 followed. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         b. Therefore, the relevant question is whether conviction was “inevitable”.  
         Wilde v R  
         (1988) 164 CLR 365 and  
         Glennon v R  
         (1994) 119 ALR 706 followed.  
          
           
          
         
        
       c. In this case conviction was inevitable.  
        
         
          
           
           (i) The focus must be “upon the evidence  
            
             
              
               
               proving the elements of the offence and the strength of that evidence” (Smart AJ at [8]). As this was a joint criminal enterprise case it was not an essential element of the offence that the appellant kicked the deceased, but only that he struck him. The evidence of such striking and involvement in the criminal enterprise was strong. 
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           (ii) Even if the evidence of the appellant  
            
             
              
               
               kicking the deceased was critical, such evidence was strong. Also, the trial judge was satisfied that the appellant kicked the deceased. 
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (iii) The evidence of the Crown witnesses was  
              
               
               sufficiently strong that it needed no prop from the judge in relation to comments on the appellant’s silence. 
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     3. (Per curiam): The trial judge’s directions on manslaughter were not erroneous nor inadequate. 
      
       
       (a) “The purpose of the summing up was to present the nature of the parties’ cases and to explain the substantive law” (Heydon JA at [55]). It was not necessary for the jury to be taken to the whole of the evidence.  
       R v Zorad  
       (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 and  
       Criminal Procedure Act  
       1986 (NSW) applied. The evidence was completed in the trial in under four sitting days and the jury was familiar with the conflicts within the evidence. 
       
      (b) No objection to the detail of the directions complained of on  
      
       
        
         
         appeal was made on behalf of the appellant at trial. Hence, leave was required under rule 4 of the  
         Criminal Appeal Rules 
          for this ground of appeal. Such leave should be refused.  
         
        
       
     4. (Per curiam): The trial judge’s directions on self-defence were not erroneous. (a) The directions on self-defence were not erroneous.  (b) However, even if the directions on self-defence were  
      
       
        
         
         misdirections they were not likely to produce a miscarriage of justice. The alleged flaws are so precise that they ought to have been raised with the trial judge, yet they were not. 
         
        
       
     5. (Per curiam): The trial judge’s warnings on the unreliability of three witnesses (Mr Bahbubur, Ms Taria and Mr Diolosa) were not inadequate.(a) The substantive requirements of s 165 of the Evidence Act  1995 (NSW) were complied with.(b) The conduct of the trial suggests that counsel for the appellant at trial perceived the warnings given to be satisfactory.

        REGINA v Nitin GIRI 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
        
       
     1    HEYDON JA: 
      
       
       Background 
        
        
       The appellant was charged with the murder of Shajedul Haque on 22 June 1996. He was tried before Studdert J and a jury jointly with Ivesh Karki. Both the appellant and the co-accused were convicted on 5 September 1999.  
        
       
     2    The events leading to the death of the deceased arose out of an argument at about 2.25am on the dance floor of a nightclub in King’s Cross, which led to a fight outside it. The Crown alleged that in that fight the appellant punched the victim and kicked him after he had fallen to the ground.  
      
       
     3    The events underlying the Crown case as accepted by the trial judge were described with characteristic lucidity by the trial judge in his remarks on sentence: 
      
       
        
         
         “The deceased, Sajedul Haque, was subjected to a violent assault after he left a nightclub in Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross early on the morning of 22 June 1996. He was knocked to the ground and thereafter he was kicked. According to one witness he was also stomped upon. 
         
        
        
         
         The deceased sustained severe head injuries and was admitted to St Vincent’s Hospital where he was found to be deeply unconscious, a condition from which he never recovered. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         In the opinion of Dr Cala all the injuries found were consistent with the deceased having been assaulted, and the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that the injuries were so caused. The verdict of the jury inculpates both prisoners in their infliction. However Dr Cala was unable to determine what impact or impacts caused the brain damage that led to the death of the deceased. 
         
        
        
         
         The deceased was a young man twenty-seven years of age who came from Bangladesh. He visited Kings Cross with friends from Bangladesh on the night of 21 June 1996. The party visited the ‘Illusions’ nightclub and it was here that there was an altercation that involved the deceased and the prisoner Ivesh Karki. It seems that the deceased laughed at the way the prisoner’s brother was dancing and exception was taken to this reaction. 
         
        
        
         
         Later there was a confrontation between the deceased and his friends and the prisoner Ivesh Karki and his companions outside the Kings Cross Hotel where Ivesh Karki and the deceased held on to each other. 
         
        
        
         
         Later still there was a further confrontation outside the nightclub Illusions and the deceased and his friends were followed into Illusions by both the prisoners and their Nepalese companions. It was when the deceased left Illusions for the second time that the fatal assault occurred. The deceased was followed from Illusions by the prisoners and a number of their companions. There were a number of eye-witness accounts of what then occurred and, not unexpectedly, there were differences in the various accounts of these eye-witnesses. However, it is clear from the jury’s verdict that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that both prisoners were inculpated in the assault upon the deceased who, as the evidence establishes, was affected by intoxicating liquor at the time. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         When interviewed by the police, Ivesh Karki admitted he struck and kicked the deceased, kicking him ‘once’. When interviewed by the police, Nitin Giri admitted that he struck the deceased causing him to fall to the ground. He conceded he may have kicked the deceased ‘if somebody else has seen me’. Neither prisoner gave evidence at the trial. 
         
        
        
         
         The eye-witness evidence, as I assess it, proved that both prisoners kicked the deceased after he fell. Rahman Mahbubur said that after the deceased fell down both prisoners kicked him. Darren Diolosa also said that there were two men kicking the deceased on the ground, that each kicked the deceased four times and, from the way they were moving, these men were putting a lot of weight into their kicks. Jim Diamond said that two men kicked the deceased on the ground, one man kicking him once and the other kicking him two or three times. Sheikh Islam said that he saw both prisoners kick the deceased. Daniel Thompson described a frenzied kicking attack and he specifically recalled that ‘Ponytail’ (that is, Nitin Giri) kicked the deceased. He said that the assault on the deceased ended when the deceased was stomped on the head three times. Simon Page, who had been at an automatic teller machine at a bank, arrived later than his companion Daniel Thompson, but he remembered one, maybe two, men kicking the deceased on the ground. Orapai Taria saw two men kicking the deceased on the ground and each kicked him more than once. Anthony Bayes only saw one man kick the deceased on the ground. 
         
        
        
         
         Allowing for the discrepancies in the eye-witness versions, I am nevertheless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence given at the trial that both prisoners kicked the deceased as he lay upon the ground.” 
         
        
       
     4    The findings of the trial judge were entirely open to him, but there were aspects of the evidence of some of the witnesses which were favourable to the appellant’s case. This evidence will be examined below.  
      
       
     5    The Notice of Appeal contained an application for leave to appeal against the sentence of 17 years’ penal servitude. No argument was advanced in support of it, and that application should be dismissed. 
      
       
     6    The Amended Grounds of Appeal were as follows: 
      
       
        
       1. The directions of the learned trial judge regarding the availability of a verdict of manslaughter in the appellant’s case were erroneous and inadequate. 
        
        
       2. His Honour the learned trial judge erred in his directions to the jury on the use they could make of the fact that the appellant did not give evidence in the trial proceedings. 
        
        
       3. The directions given by the learned trial judge on the issue of self-defence were erroneous. 
        
        
       4. The learned trial judge failed to give the jury an adequate warning regarding the unreliability of the witnesses Mahbubur, Taria and Diolosa. 
        
       
     7    It is convenient to take these grounds out of order and commence, as the appellant’s counsel did in oral argument, with Ground 2. It was Ground 2 to which the bulk of attention was directed in argument.  
      
       
        
       Ground 2: direction on failure of accused to give evidence 
        
       The forensic problem 
        
       
     8    The appeal was initially argued on 26 February 2001, but counsel for the appellant pointed out that, after argument on 20 and 21 November 2000, judgment stood reserved in the High Court in an appeal in Azzopardi v R and in a special leave application in Davis v R. He said that it was possible that the High Court might throw light on the correctness of the trial judge’s directions contained in ground 2. The appellant’s counsel accepted that in all the circumstances it was appropriate for this Court not to deliver judgment until the High Court had delivered judgment. He said that all of the arguments which the appellant would be putting on all grounds of appeal were new trial points. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I think it is realistic to concede, on the appellant’s behalf, that this is a case where, perhaps realistically, the most favourable verdict that might be expected in all the circumstances is a verdict of guilty of manslaughter …. [His] position at the moment … should be, perhaps, considered in that light. He has been and he was on bail for that period of three years or certainly all but a couple of months of it from the time of the trial to the time of his arrest. So that his sentence goes around from September 1999. I simply point that out, that it is not one of those cases where his continued detention is greater than otherwise.” 
         
        
        
       The last words have not been correctly transcribed. Counsel’s point was that the case was not one where success for the appellant would automatically result in his release without any risk of being imprisoned in relation to this charge in future. Accordingly, counsel was indicating that there was no hardship likely to flow to the appellant from awaiting the judgments of the High Court.  
        
       
     9    The High Court delivered judgment on 3 May 2001: Azzopardi v R [2001] HCA 25. The appellant’s counsel supplied some written submissions about the decision on 9 May 2001. The Crown did the same on 14 May 2001. Both of these sets of submissions were helpful.  
      
       
     10    The trial judge directed the jury as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “An accused person may always give evidence at his trial, but he is not obliged to do so. It is of fundamental importance that the Crown has to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused is guilty of the offence with which he has been charged and the accused does not bear any onus. He is, as I have already told you, presumed to be innocent unless and until the Crown has proved that he is guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         The accused is entitled to elect to say nothing and to make the Crown prove his guilt. You will remember the evidence that the police have given, as to the caution conveyed to each accused at the time when he was being questioned. The accused was informed that he was not obliged to answer the questions asked by the police officer. That is the law. A person who is questioned by police, has the right to remain silent. That is a right that exists, even when he is on trial. That is a right he brings with him into the Courtroom. You will remember earlier directions I gave you in the course of this trial, about this right of silence. That right is retained at trial and it is a right which the accused has exercised. 
         
        
        
         
         Just because the accused has exercised the right that belongs to every citizen, you must not conclude that he has elected not to give evidence because he is guilty of the offence charged. Such a conclusion, from the exercise of the right to remain silent, would be altogether wrong. His silence must not be viewed, by you, as an admission of guilt. 
         
        
        
         
         He may fear, for instance, that he would not be able to follow cross examination adequately, in the strange circumstances of a courtroom, or he may fear he may be confused by it. The accused may be content to rely upon what he perceives to be weaknesses in the case for the prosecution. There may be other good reasons for an accused person to decide not to give evidence and you must not speculate, in the case of either accused, as to why he has decided not to give evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         However, you may when judging the value, or the weight of the evidence which has been put forward by the Crown, in seeking to prove its case against the accused, take into account the election by the accused, not to deny or contradict matters in the evidence at this trial, about which the accused could have given direct evidence. … The relevance of the fact that the accused has not given evidence can only go to the value, or the weight, which you give to the evidence which the Crown witnesses have given.”  
         
        
       
     11    The appellant complains of the third last and last sentences in particular.  
      
       
     12    The Evidence Act 1995, s 20(2), provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “The judge or any party (other than the prosecutor) may comment on a failure of the defendant to give evidence. However, unless the comment is made by another defendant in the proceeding, the comment must not suggest that the defendant failed to give evidence because the defendant was, or believed that he or she was, guilty of the offence concerned.” 
         
        
       
     13    The appellant pointed out that the last sentence quoted from the summing up was to the same effect as two parts of the summing up held by the High Court (Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) in  RPS v R (2000) 74 ALJR 449 at [36] and [40] to be defective. The relevant parts in the summing up in that case were: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the present, case, however, the Crown asks you when judging the value of, the weight of, the evidence which has been put forward by the Crown as establishing its case against the accused, to take into account the accused’s election not to deny or to contradict the matters about which he could have given direct evidence from his own personal knowledge. That is indeed a circumstance which you are entitled to consider in this case. That is, the fact that the accused has elected not to contradict the evidence given by [the complainant’s mother] as to his alleged admission - if you construe it as such - and he has been content to rely upon that very brief statement in answer to the detailed allegations made by the complainant.” 
         
        
       
     14    The trial judge in this case summed up in a manner which was common before the decision in RPS v R. In fairness to the trial judge, it must be borne in mind that his summing up was delivered on 13 and 14 September 1999, before RPS v R was decided on 3 February 2000. Counsel for the appellant did not submit that the summing up complained of failed to comply with principles stated in High Court decisions earlier than RPS v R on the appropriate direction to be given when an accused person did not testify.  
      
       
     15    In Azzopardi v R [2001] HCA 25 the impugned passage in the summing up was as follows ([71]): 
      
       
        
         
         “However, members of the jury, when assessing the value of the evidence presented by the Crown, you are entitled to take into account the fact that the accused did not deny or contradict evidence about matters which were within his personal knowledge and of which he could have given direct evidence from his personal knowledge. This is because, members of the jury, you may think that it is logic and common-sense that, where only two persons are involved in some particular thing - the complainant and/or a witness and the accused - so that there are only two persons able to give evidence about the particular thing, and where the complainant’s evidence or the witness’ evidence is left undenied or uncontradicted by the accused, any doubt which may have been cast upon that witness’s evidence may be more readily discounted and that witness’s evidence may be more readily accepted as the truth.” 
         
        
       
     16    In Davis v R the impugned part of the summing up was ([80]): 
      
       
        
         
         “Now the only effect that his failure to give evidence may have on you is this. His failure to give evidence here may affect the value or weight that you give to the evidence of some or all of the witnesses who have testified in the trial if you think the accused was in a position to himself give evidence about the matter. His failure cannot be treated as an admission. His failure go give evidence. But it may enable you to give, to help you to evaluate the weight of other evidence in the case, that he has not given evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         I do not want to be more specific than that, because it is a matter for you, but let me give you an example that is not related to this case to show you what I mean. If the case was one of speeding, and a police officer got in the witness box and said he was doing 100 kilometres an hour in a 60 kilometre area, and the accused, although the defendant, although he pleaded not guilty, did not testify, the judge hearing the case might say, well he has not gone into the box and contradicted that. He could have. But to put it another way, to give you the converse situation, if the defendant had gone into the witness box and said, no that’s not true, I’ve got a very good speedometer in my car and I was only doing 60, it would make it - those two different situations would make the magistrate’s evaluation of the policeman’s evidence either more difficult or easier. It is not an easy concept I know that. The accused has remained in the dock as is his right. You cannot treat that as an admission of guilt. But the fact that he has not given testimony may assist you when you come to evaluating the other evidence in the case.” 
         
        
       
     17    The majority of the High Court (Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ - the same judges as those who formed the majority in RPS v R) held that each of these passages constituted a misdirection. As to the first, they said ([74]-[76]): 
      
       
        
         
         “If the impugned passage had stood alone, there could be no doubt that it was a comment on the failure of the appellant to give evidence which contravened the prohibition in s 20(2). Standing alone, it can be seen only as suggesting to the jury that the fact that the accused did not give evidence was a reason to accept the prosecution’s contention that he was guilty. That is, standing alone, it suggested to the jury that the accused did not give evidence because he was, or believed he was, guilty of the offence charged. 
         
        
        
         
         The impugned passage, however, did not stand alone. It was given in the context of the earlier directions given by the trial judge, which explicitly warned the jury against thinking that the accused decided not to give evidence because he was or believed himself to be guilty of the offence In that context, the passage was, at best, confusing and contradictory of the earlier directions. And given that the prohibition in s 20(2) is not to be given a narrow construction [ 
         RPS 
          (2000) 199 CLR 620 at 629-630 [20] per Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ], it must be concluded that the passage contravened s 20(2) by suggesting that the accused did not give evidence because he was guilty of the offence charged. 
         
        
        
         
         It cannot be said in the circumstances of this case that the misdirection did not deprive the appellant of a chance of acquittal. The jury may have been affected in their assessment of the case against the appellant, which depended so much on the evidence given by the man whom he was alleged to have solicited to murder the victim. That being so this is not a case in which the proviso can be applied.” 
         
        
       
     18    As to the second, the High Court majority said ([81]-[83]): 
      
       
        
         
         “The evidence adduced by the prosecution consisted not only of the direct evidence of the complainant but also other evidence, from her mother and from the doctor, of facts and circumstances which supported the account the complainant gave. If the complainant was unable to give evidence and the prosecution case had been founded only upon evidence of the otherwise unexplained departure of the complainant from the applicant’s house and return to her own house, coupled with clinical observations of the complainant’s physical condition consistent with her having been sexually assaulted, it might be said that the case was one in which a  
         Weissensteiner 
          comment could have been made. That would be so because facts which would explain or contradict the inference otherwise to be drawn from the facts we have described would be peculiarly within the knowledge of the applicant in whose care the complainant had been left before this otherwise unexplained journey occurred and these otherwise unexplained clinical signs were observed. But that was not the way in which the prosecution put its case at the trial of the applicant. That case included direct evidence, from the complainant, of what the applicant was alleged to have done. That is reason enough to conclude that no  
         Weissensteiner 
          direction should have been given. If the complainant were accepted as a credible witness, the accused could not have given evidence of any  
         additional 
          fact that might have explained or contradicted her account. 
         
        
        
         
         In any event, however, not only was there no occasion to make a  
         Weissensteiner 
          comment, the use which the trial judge said that the jury might make of the accused not having given evidence went well beyond the limited use which  
         Weissensteiner 
          permits. And it went beyond that which s 20(2) would permit if a comment were appropriate. The instruction which the trial judge gave about the failure of the accused to give evidence was, therefore, a misdirection. Standing alone, we would find that the impugned direction contravened s 20(2). Again, as in the case of  
         Azzopardi 
         , the comment has to be understood in the context of other directions given by the trial judge. Even so, for the reasons given in the case of  
         Azzopardi 
         , the comment infringed s 20(2) of the  
         Evidence Act 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         The case against the appellant was overwhelming. That a nine year old child should, late at night, walk seven kilometres along a gravel road to return to her own home suggests very strongly that something untoward has occurred to her. The doctor’s evidence of his observations, and the complainant’s mother’s evidence of her own observations, were such that the verdicts which the jury returned against the applicant were inevitable. The misdirection identified was one which, in the end, was in the unusual circumstances of this case not such as to deprive the applicant of a real chance of acquittal. In the circumstances, being not persuaded that there has been a miscarriage of justice, we would refuse special leave to appeal.” 
         
        
        
        
       The conflicting evidence about the fight 
       
     19    It is relevant to the arguments of the parties, both on the satisfactoriness of the trial judge’s directions about the appellant’s failure to testify, and on the question of whether the proviso can be applied, to consider certain aspects of the evidence against the appellant. 
      
       
     20    The appellant pointed to evidence in a statement of Mr Diolosa given to the police on 23 June 1996, which was read through and then agreed to be correct, that the appellant did not kick the deceased on the ground, that the other co-accused did, and that the appellant tried to stop him doing so. In oral evidence in chief he said both the appellant and the co-accused kicked the deceased. In cross-examination he could not explain why he told the police that only one person was kicking the deceased. He also suggested it was the co-accused who pushed the appellant, not the other way around. He said: “I am not 100 percent sure of what happened that time ago”. He agreed it was far more difficult for him to recall at the trial, on 2 September 1999, what he saw on 22 June 1996, than it was while he was speaking to the police on 23 June 1996. He then said he was confident that what he said on 23 June 1996 was more accurate than what he would say on 2 September 1999. He accepted that what he said to the police was what in fact happened. He said that while he was trying to recall things in the witness box it was possible that he could have got them muddled up. His cross-examination concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You have confused some of the things you can recall with some people? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And this was a very short incident? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And at the time you were employed as a security guard? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I take it from the distance you were standing, these things weren’t exactly clear to you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But you can remember the distinctive actions, if I could put it that way? Do you understand what I mean by that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You remember the actions that stood out that these people were doing? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I could see what was happening. I just couldn’t see their faces. I couldn’t give a description of their faces, so -- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But the distinctive things you saw happening were: You saw kicking? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You saw someone trying to push that person away? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Then you saw them run off? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. At different times? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you saw somebody fall to the ground? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Before, yes.” 
         
        
        
       In re-examination he changed his evidence again by identifying the appellant as the person who kicked the deceased on the ground and stomped on him.  
        
       
     21    Mr Page was another witness who in his statement to the police, given in 1997, said he had seen one man give the deceased one kick while he was on the ground. He said that kick “did not appear to be very hard”. In chief he said he remembered one man, “possibly two”, kicking the deceased on the ground.  
      
       
     22    Ms Taria agreed that in her statement to the police and in the committal proceedings she said that only one person kicked the deceased on the ground and that others were trying to stop the fight. However, at the trial she said she saw two people kicking, each more than once, and one person stomping once or twice. She failed to come up to proof in identifying the co-accused as doing various things. However, her final answer in cross-examination amounted to a withdrawal of her evidence about two people doing the kicking. This was almost immediately changed back again in the last question in re-examination. 
      
       
     23    Mr Bayes saw the deceased being kicked by one man while another tried to stop him. He was not able to offer a clear description of either of them.  
      
       
     24    The Crown referred to those parts of the evidence of Mr Diolosa, Mr Page and Ms Taria which favoured its case, but also referred to other witnesses as well.  
      
       
     25    Mr Mahbubur gave evidence in large measure through an interpreter, and what appears on the transcript is hard to understand. His oral evidence was that two men were kicking the deceased, or “two or three people”. His police statement said “a group of about ten males” kicked the deceased. He said he did not give to the police the number “ten”. He said: “I mention for the three or four, a couple, like this, that come for the Jewel [i.e. the deceased]”. He had been struck himself, and the cross-examination established differences between his evidence as recorded at the committal hearing and at the trial on whether he had lost consciousness. 
      
       
     26    Mr Islam said both the co-accused and the appellant kicked the deceased. In cross-examination he said he could only see their backs.  
      
       
     27    Mr Thompson said “six or so” - “a whole group” - “just really started a really frenzied kicking attack on the guy”. All but two moved away, and one of them stomped on the deceased. He expressed some difficulty in recollection. He agreed that it could “possibly” be very difficult to “realise whose feet were doing what”.  
      
       
        
       The appellant’s contentions 
       
     28    Counsel for the appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “The trial directions considered by the High Court in  
         Azzopardi 
          and  
         Davis 
          were not, it is submitted, relevantly distinguishable from those given in the trial of the appellant. The directions given in the appellant’s trial were, impermissibly, in terms which invited the jury to conclude that the Crown case was stronger by reason of the failure of the appellant to give evidence. In those circumstances it is submitted that the conclusions should be reached that the jury were misdirected in the appellant’s case. 
         
        
        
         
         In the particular circumstances of the appellant’s case, the jury may have been affected in their assessment of the case against the appellant by considerations deriving from the failure of the appellant to give evidence in the trial proceedings. The case against the appellant was not so overwhelming that it could be said that the verdict which the jury returned against the appellant was inevitable. The appellant has not had a trial according to law and it cannot be said that the proviso to the  
         Criminal Appeal Act 
          should be applied. In those circumstances it is submitted that the appeal should be upheld and that there should be a retrial of the appellant.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       “Weissensteiner comment”? 
        
       
     29    One matter can be cleared out of the way at the outset. The present appeal is not a case where what the High Court called a “Weissensteiner comment” could have been made. The majority in Azzopardi v R said that a “Weissensteiner comment” could only be made where facts additional to those proved by witnesses who were called explaining or contradicting the inferences otherwise to be drawn from the Crown case were peculiarly within the accused’s knowledge. The High Court said in Azzopardi v R ([68]): 
      
       
        
         
         “It is to be emphasised that cases in which a judge may comment on the failure of an accused to offer an explanation will be both rare and exceptional. They will occur only if the evidence is capable of explanation by disclosure of additional facts known only to the accused. A comment will never be warranted merely because the accused has failed to contradict some aspect of the prosecution case. Once that is appreciated, the supposed tension between  
         Weissensteiner 
          and  
         RPS 
          disappears. In  
         Weissensteiner 
         , the comment related to the absence of evidence of additional facts peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused; in  
         RPS 
         , there was no question of any additional fact known only to the accused merely the failure to contradict aspects of the prosecution case.” 
         
        
        
       The justices were using the word “comment” in contradistinction to “direction”. They explained the distinction as follows (at [49]-[50]). A “direction” warns a jury against drawing impermissible conclusions; it tells the jury how they may not reason towards a conclusion of guilt; the jury is obliged to follow it. A “comment” tells the jury how they may reason towards guilt; it may be ignored; the jury may be told that they should ignore it. The impugned passages are all “comments” in the sense in which the High Court majority was using that expression. The question is whether the “rare and exceptional” circumstances in which comment is permitted exist. That is, can it be said the evidence of the appellant’s involvement in the fight is “capable of explanation by disclosure of  
       additional 
        facts known  
       only 
        to the accused”? The Crown submitted: 
        
         
         “it was reasonable for the jury to expect the appellant to give evidence, as although he admitted to police in his ERISP he hit the deceased on the jaw in self defence, a claim not supported by the eye-witnesses, he also made a partial admission that he had kicked the deceased on the ground. He also claimed that he had withdrawn from the fight as soon as he punched the deceased. In these circumstances, a  
         Weissensteiner 
          direction may be appropriate.” 
         
        
        
       A reference was then made to the observations of Gaudron J in delivering the court’s ruling rejecting an application for special leave to appeal in  
       Fernando v R 
        (20 February 2000). That citation does not offer support for the submission.  
        
       
     30    The Crown’s reference to a “partial admission” is a reference to the following part of the ERISP: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Nitin, I suggest to you that you were seen by other people present near Hungry Jack’s, that you kicked the Bangladeshi man on the ground as well. What do you have to say about that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Me, I kicked? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         A. I don’t remember I kick him, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You don’t remember. 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I don’t remember, because the thing is, as I hit, struck a blow to him --- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         A. --- I feel that is too much for him because he was over drunk, but if I have kicked him I’m sure I’m not kicked him in his face; if I have kicked him, because I felt pity on him when he fell down, you know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You felt pretty --- 
         
        
        
         
         A. Pity on him, like, I felt so much --- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You pitied him? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So it, it, would it be fair to say that you may have kicked him but you don’t remember kicking him? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. Maybe I have kicked him because if somebody else has seen me it means I actually have been kicked.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     31    The Crown’s submission was advanced before the majority in Azzopardi v R explained the narrow circumstances in which a Weissensteiner comment could be made, but it was also repeated afterwards. Any evidence from the appellant in this case that he withdrew as soon as he punched the deceased would not have been evidence of an additional fact explaining or contradicting inferences to be drawn from the evidence of others, but a direct denial of the primary evidence of some of the Crown witnesses (namely those mentioned in the testimony, summarised, above, of the witnesses to whom the Crown made particular reference), and a piece of evidence corroborating the primary evidence of some of the others (namely those mentioned in the testimony, summarised above, of the witnesses to whom the appellant made particular reference). And any evidence from the appellant denying that he kicked the deceased on the ground would have been in the same category. In general, it will be remembered, the appellant’s counsel contended that the evidence, or at least some of it, showed that after punching the deceased, the appellant withdrew from the fight, did not kick the deceased on the ground, and attempted to stop the fight.  
      
       
     32    In its most recent submission the Crown said that the circumstances of the appellant’s withdrawal were “matters ‘peculiarly within the mind’ of the appellant”. This is not so. Whether he withdrew was a matter on which all observers at the scene who gave evidence could speak: some supported the conclusion that he did not, some supported the conclusion that he did. And what his mental state was in withdrawing (if he withdrew) was not a matter peculiarly within his mind but could be inferred from the evidence of those witnesses supportive of the view that he withdrew.  
      
       
     33    The Crown also submitted that the appellant’s contention in his ERISP that he had tried to stop the co-accused was not supported by any other evidence, and accordingly “any support for his contention of withdrawal must come from him and it would be additional to the evidence already given”. That submission overlooks parts of the evidence of Mr Diolosa, Ms Taria and Mr Bayes, each of whom offered some support for the proposition that the appellant did not kick the deceased, but tried to stop the co-accused kicking the deceased, and parts of the evidence of Mr Page, to the effect that only one man was kicking the deceased. This case is thus outside the Weissensteiner boundaries as marked out in Azzopardi v R.  
      
       
        
       Is the appellant’s challenge sound? 
       
     34    The field of law to which this ground of appeal relates has been notoriously difficult ever since statutory changes in the late 19th Century made it possible for the accused to testify. The High Court in Azzopardi v R has in a sense made a fresh start by explaining what some have thought to be contradictions between Weissensteiner v R and RPS v R. It is only desirable for an intermediate appellate court to seek to explain, gloss or amplify a High Court decision of that kind where it is strictly necessary to do so in order to decide an appeal. It is not necessary to do so here because the challenge advanced by the appellant is made out for two reasons.  
      
       
     35    First, the parts of the summing up criticised in this case are very similar to the offending parts of the summings up in RPS v R, Azzopardi v R and Davis v R. This is not surprising, in view of the use before RPS v R by trial judges of standard form directions to be modified to suit the needs of particular cases. There are differences between the background and context of the respective summings up, but they are not such as to alter the essential similarity of the passages impugned in those three cases and in this. Further, the contradiction which, according to the High Court majority in Azzopardi v R, existed between the impugned parts of each summing up in the two cases it was considering and earlier parts stressing that the accused had a right not to testify is paralleled by the summing up delivered by the trial judge in this case. 
      
       
     36    Secondly, it is necessary to consider a Crown submission that while, in the light of RPS v R at [40] and [43] the third last of the sentences quoted from the trial judge’s summing up “may be erroneous”, he “immediately balanced the [third last] sentence and the whole direction with the [second last] sentence which were words contained in the sixth para of the trial judge’s direction in RPS, which the majority expressly approved at para 40.” However, the High Court in RPS v R did not consider that the summing up in that case was cured by the words in the “sixth para” to which the Crown points, and the same conclusion must follow here in relation to the second last sentence.  
      
       
        
       The proviso 
       
     37    The Crown contended to this Court that even if this Court considered that the point raised by ground 2 should be decided in favour of the appellant, the appeal should nonetheless be dismissed on the ground that “no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred”: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) s 6(1). The Crown submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “Even if it is considered that his Honour’s directions were erroneous, it is submitted that they do not cause a miscarriage of justice and the proviso should be applied. Gaudron J’s ruling on the Special Leave Application in  
         Fernando 
          supports this submission. This is a case where the jury would have reached the same verdict, even if the error had not occurred:  
         Wilde v The Queen 
          (1988) 164 CLR 365;  
         Glennon v The Queen 
          (1994) 68 ALJR 209;  
         Saad v The Queen 
          (1987) 70 ALR 667 at 668, 670. 
         
        
        
         
         The appellant admitted that he had punched the deceased in the jaw and that he had fallen to the ground. A number of eyewitnesses testified that after the deceased fell to the ground, two men, clearly the appellant and his co-accused, Karki, both kicked him as he lay on the ground. These witnesses were: Rahman Mahbubur; Darren Diolosa; Jack Diamond; Sheikh Islam; Daniel Thompson; and Orepai Taria. In addition, Simon Page remembered one, maybe two men kicking the deceased on the ground. In addition, the medical evidence supported the Crown case that the deceased died as a result of blunt trauma caused to him. In addition, the appellant submitted that he may have kicked the deceased: ERISP QA 336-340; and that he may have got the blood spots on his pants when he kicked the deceased.”  
         
        
        
         
        
       
     38    In Wilde v R (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 371-2 Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “As the prosecution case was so strong and the defence was so weak, the authorities which are customarily cited when it is sought to challenge the application of the proviso were insufficient to found an attack upon the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal. Those authorities establish that where there has been a departure from the requirements of a properly conducted trial, it cannot be said that there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice if the applicant has thereby lost ‘a chance which was fairly open to him of being acquitted’ to use the phrase of Fullagar J in  
         Mraz v The Queen 
          [(1955) 93 CLR 493 at 514] or “a real chance of acquittal’ to use the phrase of Barwick CJ in  
         Reg v Storey 
          [(1978) 140 CLR 364 at 376]. Unless it can be said that, had there been no blemish in the trial, an appropriately instructed jury, acting reasonably on the evidence properly before them and applying the correct onus and standard of proof, would inevitably have convicted the accused, the conviction must be set aside: see  
         Driscoll v The Queen 
          [(1977) 137 CLR 517 at 524];  
         Reg v Storey 
          [(1978) 140 CLR at 376];  
         Gallagher v The Queen 
          [(1986) 160 CLR 392 at 412-413]. Unless that can be said, the accused may have lost a fair chance of acquittal by the failure to afford him the trial to which he was entitled, that is to say, a trial in which the relevant law was correctly explained to the jury and the rules of procedure and evidence were strictly followed: see  
         Mraz v The Queen 
          [(1955) 93 CLR 493 at 414]. The loss of such a chance of acquittal cannot be anything but a substantial miscarriage of justice. The question whether the jury would inevitably have convicted falls to be determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal. It is a question which the Court of Criminal Appeal must answer according to its assessment of the facts of the case.” 
         
        
       
     39    In Saad v R (1987) 78 ALR 667 at 668 Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said the question was whether a misdirection on onus of proof “deprived the applicant of any real chance of acquittal which he might otherwise have possessed.”  
      
       
     40    In Glennon v R (1994) 119 ALR 706 at 710-712 Mason CJ, Brennan and Toohey JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         The applicant’s arguments 
         
        
        
         
         The applicant contended that the Court of Criminal Appeal was in error in applying the proviso in the circumstances of this case. First, the applicant argued that the nature of the trial judge’s error was so fundamental as to depart from the essential requirements of a fair trial. In such circumstances, according to the applicant, there is no room for application of the proviso because there has been no proper trial of the case and so a miscarriage of justice has occurred. In this respect, the applicant relied on the judgment of Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ in  
         Wilde v R 
          [(1988) 164 CLR 365 at 372-3. See also  
         Quartermaine v R 
          (1980) 143 CLR 595 at 600-1; 30 ALR 616 at 620 per Gibbs J (with whom Stephen and Murphy JJ agreed)]. In the alternative, the applicant argued that the trial judge’s error was such that it cannot be said that, had the misdirection not occurred, the jury must inevitably have reached the same verdict. Here the applicant relied on  
         Driscoll v R 
          [(1977) 137 CLR 517; 15 ALR 47],  
         Maric v R 
          [(1978) 52 ALJR 631; 20 ALR 513] and  
         Mraz v R  
         [(1955) 93 CLR 493]. The applicant also contended that, as an application of the second approach to the proviso, ‘the proviso will not be applied where the error relates to the means by which, and the manner in which, the credibility of the accused is to be assessed by the jury’. 
         
        
        
         
         The two approaches to the proviso outlined above have been accepted by this court in the cases relied upon by the applicant and are not challenged in this case. The question is whether, in the circumstances of the present case, it was erroneous to apply the proviso. 
         
        
        
         
         Fundamental error 
         
        
        
         
         According to the approach of the majority in  
         Wilde 
          [(1988) 164 CLR at 373; 76 ALR at 575], the proviso cannot be applied ‘when the proceedings … have so far miscarried as hardly to be a trial at all’. But that is a particular situation arising only ‘where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings’. In such a case the accused ‘has not had a proper trial and … there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice’. [ibid] But the majority stressed that there is no mechanical formula or rigid test to be applied to determine whether an irregularity is of this nature; each case will depend on its own circumstances [ibid] and, in determining the question, it will be appropriate to have regard to the strengths and weaknesses of the prosecution and defence cases in order to assess the gravity and significance of the error. [ibid at CLR 374] 
         
        
        
         
         In the circumstances of this case, it cannot be said that the trial judge’s misdirection on the applicant’s right to silence was ‘so fundamental’ that the trial was ‘hardly a trial at all’. Although the right to silence is a fundamental right of any accused person, it cannot be said that  
         any 
          misdirection on that subject is a fundamental irregularity of the kind discussed in  
         Wilde 
         . In this case, the trial judge directed the jury that they were not to use the applicant’s exercise of his right to silence in a manner adverse to him. This direction was perfectly proper. However, the trial judge then qualified the direction by informing the jury that they might use the applicant’s silence to test the veracity of the applicant’s defence. This subsequent direction was clearly erroneous. However, in the context in which it appeared and at a trial in which there was other evidence on which the applicant could be convicted and in which there was no other misdirection by the trial judge, the trial judge’s misdirection was not a fundamental irregularity. We would reject the applicant’s submissions in so far as they are based on this approach to the proviso.  
         
        
        
         
         That brings us to a consideration of the applicant’s argument, namely, that it cannot be said that, in the absence of the misdirection, the jury would inevitably have convicted the applicant. 
         
        
        
         
         Was conviction inevitable? 
         
        
        
         
         In order to apply the proviso where there has been a misdirection by the trial judge that is not fundamental in the sense discussed above, the Court of Criminal Appeal must be satisfied that, in the absence of the misdirection, the jury would inevitably have reached the same verdict. [ 
         Domican v R 
          (1992) 173 CLR 555 at 565-6; 106 ALR 203;  
         Wilde 
          (1988) 164 CLR at 371-2 per Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ;  
         Quartermaine 
          (1980) 143 CLR at 600 per Gibbs J;  
         Driscoll 
          (1977) 137 CLR at 542-3 per Gibbs J (with whom Mason and Jacobs JJ agreed)] This is so even if the case against the accused is otherwise a strong one. [ 
         Domican 
          (1992) 173 CLR at 566]  
         
        
        
         
         In the present case, in relation to the allegations by Palmieri against the applicant, the applicant’s defence was a denial of the allegations coupled with the evidence of his cousin, Dickason, to the effect that she was present in the room at the time the offence was said to have occurred Against this was the evidence of Palmieri that the assaults had occurred. Unlike the position in relation to the Behnk allegations, there was no independent evidence tending to cast doubt on the applicant’s defence. On this count, it was a contest, in essence, between the applicant’s evidence (and Dickason’s) and the evidence of Palmieri. In those circumstances, the applicant’s credibility was of central importance to his defence, and the trial judge’s misdirection certainly went to the issue of the accused’s credibility and veracity. Given this, it is, in our view, not possible to say that, in the absence of the trial judge’s erroneous direction on the applicant’s silence, the jury would inevitably have reached the same conclusion, namely, a verdict of guilty. It is significant that the jury acquitted the applicant on counts involving two of the young people. This fact demonstrates that, in relation to some charges, the jury accepted the applicant’s defence at least to the extent of finding a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. In those circumstances, it is possible that, had the trial judge not misdirected them as to the applicant’s veracity, the jury might have accepted the applicant’s testimony in relation to the Palmieri incident and acquitted him on that count. Accordingly, the applicant ‘lost a chance which was fairly open to him of being acquitted’. [ 
         Mraz 
          (1955) 93 CLR at 514 per Fullager J;  
         Wilde 
          (1988) 164 CLR at 371; 76 ALR at 574] This means that there was a substantial miscarriage of justice so as to preclude the application of the proviso. Thus, in applying the proviso in these circumstances, the Court of Criminal Appeal erred, and its decision should be set aside and the applicant’s conviction in relation to the Palmieri allegations should be quashed. 
         
        
        
         
         In reaching this conclusion, we should not be taken as accepting the applicant’s submissions that the proviso will never be applied where the misdirection goes to the accused’s credibility. The assessment of whether the proviso should be applied depends on the circumstances of each case, and it would not be appropriate to lay down such an absolute rule as that contended for by the applicant.” 
         
        
       
     41    While the right to silence of an accused person is a fundamental right, not every misdirection about the right to silence will be such a fundamental irregularity that no proper trial should be regarded as having taken place: R v Bozzola [2001] NSWCCA 8 at [60] per James J (Giles JA and Hulme J concurring). This case cannot be regarded as one in which there was a “fundamental error” in which “the proceedings … have so far miscarried as hardly to be a trial at all”. The question rather is whether conviction was “inevitable”. 
      
       
     42    The evidence about the fight given in the witness box was given three years and three months later. Many if not all of the witnesses had given statements to the police, some very soon after the night in question, and had given evidence at the committal proceedings. The events on the night in question seem to have blown up quite suddenly to the perception of some witnesses, and without any warning at all to the perception of others. The opportunities for clear observation were not ideal. The Crown witnesses offered a considerable disparity of observation and recollection, both when witness was compared with witness, and when particular parts of what one particular witness said was compared with other parts of what that particular witness said. The case against the appellant was far from being weak, but he could point to the fact that some parts of the evidence of some witnesses were favourable to him in the sense of being capable of creating a reasonable doubt. On any view the case against the co-accused, who had expressly admitted kicking the deceased, was stronger. The kicking issue may not have been in law an essential element of the Crown’s case at trial, but it loomed large in the proceedings as they were actually conducted before the jury. If it could have been proved that the appellant kicked the deceased, the Crown’s chances of proving the mental states it alleged against him would have been significantly increased. The Crown before this Court correctly highlighted the evidence about kicking as a central part of its contentions in relation to the proviso.  
      
       
     43    The Crown could and did point to the strength of its case. It was a case of sufficient strength to appeal to the trial judge. The Crown also pointed out that several of the witnesses whose evidence told against the appellant were not cross-examined to suggest that they were wrong. That may indicate that the appellant’s advisers were experiencing a sense that his case was weak; or it may indicate sound tactical judgment. By itself it does not demonstrate that the Crown would inevitably have succeeded. 
      
       
     44    “Inevitability” is a high standard. Each juror may have said: “The Crown witnesses differ among themselves as to what happened, and there is some evidence, including evidence which came into existence just after the killing, that only one man killed the deceased, and that the appellant tried to stop him being kicked. The judge said that in judging the value of weight of the Crown evidence, I could take into account Giri’s failure to give evidence. If he had denied what they said, I would have given their evidence less weight; since he did not deny it, I give it more weight. His failure to deny it removes any reasonable doubt about their evidence.” The possibility of that reasoning having been employed, when coupled with the unclearness of the evidence having the result of leaving it less than certain where the truth lay, suggests that it cannot be concluded that the jury would inevitably have convicted the appellant if correctly directed. If the jury had been correctly directed, they may have had a reasonable doubt about whether the appellant kicked the deceased and a reasonable doubt about whether he tried to stop the co-accused kicking the deceased. In turn, in consequence of these doubts, the jury may have concluded that the Crown’s failure to convince them beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had kicked the deceased, and that he had not tried to stop the fight, left open the reasonable possibility that if he abstained from kicking it was not because he had no chance to do so, and if he tried to prevent the kicking it was not because he thought it was time to flee. Rather, the jury may have concluded that they thought it was reasonably possible that the mental states alleged against the appellant by the Crown did not exist. That is, the evidence may have caused the jury to have a reasonable doubt about whether the appellant shared a common intention of causing death or grievous bodily harm, and whether he contemplated the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm as a possible incident in the joint criminal enterprise. Accordingly the proviso does not apply. 
      
       
     45    Ground 1: erroneous manslaughter directions? 
      
       
       The appellant advanced three criticisms of the trial judge’s directions. 
        
       
     46    The first criticism was put as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “If the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had in fact kicked the deceased after the initial punch (and there was, it is submitted, a basis in the evidence for them not to be) the appellant’s mere presence was insufficient to prove his participation in the alleged joint criminal enterprise relied on by the Crown. The jury were not directed to this effect. The absence of directions in these terms meant that the defence case was not fully left to the jury for their determination.” 
         
        
       
     47    That criticism fails in view of the following parts of the trial judge’s summing up: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown has to prove that the accused, the case against whom you are considering, was responsible for causing the death of the deceased. You cannot convict the accused of murder or manslaughter unless you are satisfied that the death of the deceased was caused by an act or acts for which the accused, whose case you are considering, was responsible. 
         
        
        
         
         Here the Crown relies upon the concept of joint criminal enterprise. I must now give you directions about this. You see, it is apparent, from Dr Cala’s evidence, that he could not determine what blow or blows, or kick or kicks, caused the fatal brain damage. How then is the accused to be held responsible for having caused the fatal injury? The Crown says by reference to the concept of joint criminal enterprise. That, now, is a concept about which I am going to give you some directions. 
         
        
        
         
         The law is, members of the jury, that where two or more people carry out a joint criminal enterprise each is responsible for the act or acts of the other, or others in carrying out that enterprise. It is for the Crown to prove both the existence of the joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused. 
         
        
        
         
         Liability does not extend to something done which was foreign to that enterprise. Liability does not extend to something not contemplated as a possible incident of that enterprise. Liability does not extend to something that happens after the enterprise is completed. Liability does not apply to a person who has withdrawn from the enterprise in respect of something that is done after he has withdrawn.” 
         
        
       
     48    The trial judge said a little later: 
      
       
        
         
         “The mere presence of a person at the time when the crime is committed, coupled with a readiness to help, if required, can suffice to amount to an encouragement to the other participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime. 
         
        
       
     49    The second criticism of the trial judge’s manslaughter directions advanced by the appellant was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “As well as explaining the basis of the case on the murder charge, it was, it is submitted, necessary to explain to the jury the possible interpretation of the appellant’s conduct amounting to manslaughter and not murder:  
         Gilbert v R 
          [2000] 177 ALR 88 at paras [16-17], [96], [101].”  
         
        
       
     50    The Crown pointed out that Gilbert v R was a case in which the trial judge had instructed the jury that manslaughter was not available as an alternative verdict to murder. That cannot be said of the trial judge in the present case. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Suppose two men decide to attack another but do not intend to cause death, or grievous bodily harm to that other. Suppose further however that during the course of the attack, one of the men only forms an intent to kill the victim, or to cause him grievous bodily harm and strikes the fatal blow with that intention. That man may be convicted of murder, assuming for the purposes of example only, that his blow was proved to cause the death. So too though may the second man be convicted of murder, if he had in mind that the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm by the first man, was a possible incident of the joint criminal enterprise. 
         
        
        
         
         If however the second man never entertained any intention to cause grievous bodily harm and did not contemplate, as a possibility, that the first man might intentionally cause grievous bodily harm, then the second man would not be guilty of murder but he may be convicted of manslaughter. 
         
        
        
         
         The reason why, in the circumstances outlined, the principal assailant is guilty of murder and the other participant is guilty of manslaughter, is that the former had an actual intention to kill and the latter never intended, or contemplated the possibility that death, or grievous bodily harm, would be caused to the victim and if there had been no departure from the common purpose, with which the men set out at the outset, the death of the victim, would only have rendered those two men guilty of manslaughter. 
         
        
        
         
         To prove the crime of manslaughter, the Crown is not required to prove that the perpetrator acted with intent to kill, or to cause grievous bodily harm. Manslaughter is committed where death is caused by an unlawful and dangerous act. An act is dangerous, if viewed objectively, it is such that a reasonable person would realise that it would subject the victim to an appreciable risk of serious injury. 
         
        
        
         
         I will give you further directions concerning this concept of joint criminal enterprise, when I am considering the cases against each accused separately. So I am going to come back to it. It is a difficult concept, I appreciate and I will give you what assistance I can.” 
         
        
       
     51    The trial judge fulfilled that promise in relation to the co-accused: 
      
       
        
         
         “If, in the case of Karki, the Crown has failed to prove the crime of murder, you would have to consider the alternative crime of manslaughter, about which I said something to you earlier. If the Crown has proved that the accused joined in a joint criminal enterprise that had, as its object, an unlawful assault upon the deceased, and that the deceased was punched and kicked, sustaining the injuries that caused his death, but the Crown has not proved that it was intended, in that enterprise, that death or really serious bodily injury would be caused, and if the Crown has not proved that Karki contemplated that the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm by somebody in that enterprise was a possible incident of it, then you may nevertheless convict the accused of manslaughter. You may do so if you consider that the relevant acts that caused death were dangerous, in the sense that I defined earlier; that is to say, that, viewed objectively, they were such that a reasonable person would realise they would subject the victim to an appreciable risk of serious injury.” 
         
        
       
     52    The trial judge fulfilled the promise in relation to the appellant as well: 
      
       
        
         
         “If, in the case against Nitin Giri, the Crown has failed to prove the crime of murder, then, just as with Ivesh Karki, you would have to consider the alternative crime of manslaughter. 
         
        
        
         
         If the Crown has proved that the accused joined in a joint criminal enterprise that had, as its object, an unlawful assault upon the deceased, and that the deceased was punched and kicked sustaining the injuries that caused his death, but the Crown has not proved that it was intended in that enterprise that death or grievous bodily harm would be occasioned, and the Crown has not proved that the accused contemplated, as an alternative, that the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm by one of the other participants was a possible incident of the joint criminal enterprise, then you may convict the accused of manslaughter. You may do so if you consider that the relevant acts that caused death were dangerous in the sense that I defined earlier for you.” 
         
        
       
     53    After requests for re-directions, the trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown here, let me remind you, submits that the actions it has proved the accused did, if you find that the accused punched and kicked him as he lay on the ground, evidence that he must have intended, as indicated by the manner of his participation in doing those things, that in the joint criminal enterprise, grievous bodily harm would be occasioned to the deceased. You remember Mr Watson’s vigorous submissions to the contrary. They are for you to evaluate. 
         
        
        
         
         If in the case against Nitin Giri, the Crown has failed to prove the crime of murder, you would have to consider the alternative crime of manslaughter. If the Crown has proved that Nitin Giri joined in a joint criminal enterprise that had as its object, an unlawful assault upon the deceased and that the deceased was punched and kicked sustaining the injuries that caused his death but the Crown has not proved against Nitin Giri, the requisite intent for murder that I have just been discussing with you, then you may convict the accused of manslaughter. 
         
        
        
         
         You may do so if you consider that the relevant acts that caused death were dangerous, in the sense that I spoke of on Monday. That is to say, that viewing those acts objectively, they were such that a reasonable person would realise that they would subject the deceased to an appreciable risk of serious injury. That’s the way in which you would come to consider the alternative of manslaughter in the case of Nitin Giri. 
         
        
        
         
         Turning to Ivesh Karki, the considerations are really the same but it won’t hurt if I go over them again, although it is repetitive. The issues are not easy to comprehend. 
         
        
        
         
         For the accused, Ivesh Karki, to be convicted of murder, you would have to be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, of his participation in a joint criminal enterprise. As to that you must be satisfied that Ivesh Karki, either shared a common intention with the other participants of causing death, or grievous bodily harm, or he contemplated that the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm by one or other of the participants, was a possible incident in the joint criminal enterprise. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown here submits against Ivesh Karki, that the actions it has proved he did, if you find that he kicked the deceased and stomped on the deceased, evidence that he must have intended, as indicated by the manner of his participation in the joint criminal enterprise, grievous bodily harm would be occasioned to the deceased. 
         
        
        
         
         You will remember that’s the way the Crown puts the case. You will remember Mr Cusack’s submissions to the contrary. As Mr Cusack submitted and I’m not going to review all his submissions for you at this point but you remember his submissions that you would not be satisfied of the participation, by his client, in the events that occurred in the manner in which certain of the eye witnesses said he participated. 
         
        
        
         
         If, in the case against Ivesh Karki, the Crown has failed to prove the crime of murder, then again you would have to consider this alternative crime of manslaughter. If the Crown has proved that Ivesh Karki joined in a joint criminal enterprise that had as its object, an unlawful assault upon the deceased and that the deceased was punched and kicked sustaining, in consequence, the injuries that caused his death but the Crown has not proved against Ivesh Karki the requisite intention for murder that I have just been taking you through, then you may convict the accused of manslaughter. You may do so if you consider that the relevant acts that caused death were dangerous in the sense that I have defined for you. 
         
        
        
         
         You appreciate, of course, that you have to consider the case against each accused separately. In that separate consideration you must direct your attention, as I trust my instructions have made clear, to whether the Crown has proved that the particular accused, whose case you are considering, had the requisite intent for the crime of murder, in one or other of the two ways I have explained to you. You have to consider all the evidence that bears upon that issue, in the particular case you are considering, including the ERISP and the extent of the active participation, as you find it to have been, in any assault you may find to be proved. 
         
        
        
         
         Bear in mind always, the onus of proof lying upon the Crown. You may arrive at a different verdict in the case of one accused, than in the case of another. The separate questions you will be asked, reflect that this is so. I suppose it follows, members of the jury, that the short answer to the last question that you asked, is yes but it’s a short answer that I can only give, alerting you to those instructions that I have just given you. You look at each case separately. You have to be satisfied, on the evidence available against the particular accused, whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt the crime of murder, whether if it has not, it has proved beyond reasonable doubt, the crime of manslaughter. “ 
         
        
       
     54    The third criticism advanced by the appellant was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “account should also be taken of the fact that his Honour did not summarise what are contended to be vital aspects of the evidence supporting a verdict of manslaughter. For example, when summarising the evidence of the witness Diolosa, his Honour did not refer to Mr Diolosa’s evidence that: (i) he had told the police that there was  
         one 
          man kicking the deceased who was 6ft 5” (the man Karki) and; (ii) he had told the police (T75.35) that he had seen a man with a ponytail (the appellant) move in front of the man doing the kicking and push him away towards the bank (T70). His Honour also failed to refer to the evidence of the witness Thompson (T170) that the appellant was not involved in the final stomping of the deceased and further that when the man Karki stomped on the victim, the appellant looked agitated and said ‘Let’s go’. 
         
        
        
         
         His Honour summarised the Crown’s submissions in his directions (SU49) and re-directions (SU86). His Honour did not on either of those occasions summarise the defence case on joint enterprise, saying only ‘Mr Watson, of course submitted to the contrary’ (SU49) and ‘you remember Mr Watson’s vigorous submissions to the contrary’ (SU86).” 
         
        
       
     55     The summary of the evidence of Mr Diolosa advanced by the appellant is an incomplete picture of his evidence. He gave a lot of evidence which, if it was accepted, would justify the jury in concluding that he saw two men kicking the deceased on the ground. It is not necessary that a jury be taken to the whole of the evidence: R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 105; Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 99. The fundamental issue for this Court is whether the summing up was an adequate explanation to the jury of the need for them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant on the offences charged on the basis of the evidence of the Crown as tested in cross-examination and in the light of the whole of the evidence in the case. The purpose of the summing up was to present the nature of the parties’ cases and to explain the substantive law. The only necessity to repeat any of the evidence arose from the need to highlight the nature of the parties’ cases. The evidence was completed in less than four sitting days. The conflicts within the evidence must have been plainly apparent to the jury, who were no doubt appropriately reminded of them by counsel: R v Williams (1999) 104 A Crim R 260 at [37]-[44] per Wood CJ at CL, Spigelman CJ and McInerney J concurring.  
      
       
     56    Further, counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial did not ask for a direction along the lines which it is now said should have been given. I would refuse the leave which Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules makes necessary. The only re-direction requested related to the circumstances in which the appellant could be found not guilty of manslaughter. The requests were made both by the jury (summing up, pages 73-74) and by counsel (summing up, pages 90-91). The trial judge responded to the jury’s request in the manner indicated above, and declined counsel’s request. But the requests, and in particular the request from counsel, did not relate to the detail of the evidence. Counsel for the appellant conceded in reply that the terms in which the requests were made were not satisfactory from his point of view. The reality is that what counsel at the trial was requesting was something quite different from what counsel in the appeal was complaining about.  
      
       
     57    The criticisms of the appellant of the trial judge’s manslaughter directions are not valid. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3: erroneous directions on self-defence? 
         
       
     58    The appellant’s submissions on this subject were put entirely in writing and were not developed orally. 
      
       
     59    The appellant’s complaint is that the trial judge erred in saying the following (emphasis added by appellant): 
      
       
        
         
         “The only evidence given by an eyewitness of any positive act taken by the deceased was when he grabbed hold of Ivesh Karki outside the Kings Cross hotel at a time when Ivesh Karki grabbed hold of him.  
         Nowhere else did any eyewitness observe any act either aggressive or in self-defence by the deceased. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     60    The appellant then referred to various parts of Mr Diamond’s evidence to the effect that there was “pushing and shoving” between the persons coming out of the nightclub. The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “The evidence of Mr Diamond was capable of being accepted by the jury as evidence that immediately prior to any assault on the deceased there had been a hostile argument in which the deceased had participated. This, it is submitted, is in direct contradiction to the direction on the evidence as summarised by his Honour to the jury. The direction given was, it is submitted, erroneous and since it concerned a crucial aspect of the appellant’s defence, was capable of resulting in a substantial miscarriage of justice. Self-defence was raised by the appellant and left to the jury in relation to both the charge of murder and manslaughter.” 
         
        
       
     61    According to the appellant, the trial judge summarised only incompletely Dr Cala’s evidence of bruising to the deceased’s hand and arm. The trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The only other evidence, that I can recall, that bears upon this, was the evidence of Dr Cala about marks that he saw on the body of the deceased. There were injuries to the hand and the arm. They were consistent with a defensive action. There was bruising on the left hand. He was asked whether that could be consistent with having struck something. He thought probably not, because of their position. They weren’t consistent with bruising from a punch. 
         
        
        
         
         He said if this man had struck somebody with his closed fist, the mark would most likely be over the area of the knuckles, not where he found it. So he didn’t think the bruising was consistent with the deceased having been an aggressor. They could possibly have been there; could possibly have been defence bruising.” 
         
        
        
       The appellant pointed to the following part of Dr Cala’s evidence: 
        
         
         “Q. What I am saying to you is, if he struck somebody not with a closed fist but with the open back of the fist, or something of that nature, that bruise could be readily explained? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It could be.” 
         
        
       
     62    The appellant said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The evidence of bruising to the deceased’s hand and arm was equally consistent with an aggressive action by the deceased.” 
         
        
       
     63    The Crown submitted, first, that while now the appellant was relying on Mr Diamond’s evidence, at the trial he criticised it, submitting that what Mr Diamond told the police was different from what he said in evidence. This submission is correct, though it may not go far.  
      
       
     64    Secondly, the Crown pointed out that the trial judge said the following about Mr Diamond: 
      
       
        
         
         “Jim Diamond was the doorman at the Pink Panther, a nearby establishment to Illusions apparently. He was out at the door, taking in the scenes of Kings Cross, no doubt, when he was attracted by the argument that was going on in a group of four men who came out from Illusions nearby. 
         
        
        
         
         He said that he saw one man punch the other, who then fell face down, and he said that the bloke who punched him then kicked him once but then another fellow started kicking the man on the ground as well. The first man kicked him once and the second man kicked him two or three times.”  
         
        
        
       This summary is not inconsistent with the appellant’s contention that the evidence established a “hostile argument in which the deceased had participated”.  
        
       
     65    Thirdly, the Crown submitted that the trial judge’s summary of Dr Cala’s evidence was adequate. It was not entirely complete, but it is difficult to imagine that the failure to give a direction about the point not referred to could possibly have made any difference. 
      
       
     66    Finally, the Crown relied on Rule 4. That posture is justifiable: even if the directions were misdirections, they were not likely to produce any risk of a miscarriage of justice, and their supposed shortcomings relate to so detailed a level of particularity that they ought to have been brought to the trial judge’s attention if they were thought to be important; obviously they were not thought to be important against the background of the evidence considered as a whole. 
      
       
     67    The criticisms advanced to the trial judge’s self-defence directions are rejected.  
      
       
        
       Ground 4: inadequate warnings on unreliability? 
       
     68    The appellant complained that the trial judge failed to give the jury an adequate warning about the unreliability of Mr Mahbubur, Ms Taria and Mr Diolosa.  
      
       
     69    The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour directed the jury in these terms (SU24): 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘I direct you that you just examine the evidence of these witnesses [Mahbubur, Taria, Diolosa, Bayes] very carefully. It is important that you bear in mind that the events of which they have given evidence happened quickly and that people can make genuine mistakes in seeking to recall what was seen, particularly where there may be a number of people involved in the events unfolding before their eyes.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Although his Honour at SU23-24 and SU62 summarised partially defence counsel’s submissions on the unreliability of individual witnesses, his Honour’s directions did not encompass these submissions. The jury should have been warned of the dangers of convicting on such evidence, the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to the evidence, including an explanation of the reasons particular to this case as to why the warning was being given. It is submitted that the terms of s 165 specifically state that a warning on unreliability must state that the evidence may be unreliable and the matters that cause it to be unreliable.  
         
        
        
         
         The jury were not specifically directed to the unreliability of the evidence of the witnesses Diolosa, Page and Taria. Each had earlier stated at committal or in their police statements, that they had only seen one person kicking the deceased, a vitally important issue having regard to the way in which the Crown chose to run its case. 
         
        
        
         
         In cross-examination, Diolosa agreed that his memory was better at the time of making his police statement than it was now, and that at that time he had made a statement that there was one person kicking (T71.30), and that the person was six foot five inches tall (T70). Although he gave evidence at trial that there were two men kicking the deceased (T64.50), he later accepted that what he had told the police had in fact happened and that he may have been confused in his trial evidence (T75.25). 
         
        
        
         
         The witness Page agreed that he had told the police that he saw one kick to the body which was not very hard (T225). She agreed that at the committal hearing she had stated that she only saw one person kicking (T225.55) and that when she made her police statement she said there was only one person (T229). 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Mahbubur denied telling the police that there had been 10 people kicking the deceased, although that was what was recorded in his statement (T45). At trial he stated that men he identified as both the appellant and his co-accused were kicking the deceased. He also stated that he had never said at the committal that he had lost consciousness and then regained consciousness in the course of the assault on the deceased (T115.40). The Crown conceded that he had indeed given this evidence at committal (T115.55). 
         
        
        
         
         These matters were not brought to the attention of the jury in their proper context. A direction was required that the evidence of these witnesses which claimed that there were two men kicking the deceased may have been unreliable and should be scrutinised with great care. His Honour did not warn the jury that it would be dangerous to convict the appellant of murder on this evidence alone. This was crucial evidence in a case where proof of the Crown case depended on the jury accepting beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had himself kicked the deceased in order to establish a joint criminal enterprise on the charge of murder. The caution administered by his Honour fell short of a warning of the dangers of convicting the appellant on this evidence. It is submitted that a mere caution falls short of a warning, saying ‘too little, too unemphatically’ and that a mere caution contains less than a warning requires be said:  
         Crampton v The Queen 
          [2000] HCA 60 (23.11.00) per Gaudron, Gummow, Callinan [JJ] at para 44. 
         
        
        
         
         Counsel requested a direction on unreliability be given (T292). Rule IV of the Criminal Appeal Rules does not, it is submitted, arise in relation to this ground of appeal.” 
         
        
       
     70    The only additional oral submission was: 
      
       
        
         
         “The only additional thing I might add to what is already there is this observation that the directions that the learned judge gave, and they are identified at [page] 24 - they were directions like: You heard Mr Watson this and Mr Cusack say that and you will bear this in mind. That is not a form of direction which satisfies the requirements of s 165 of the  
         Evidence Act 
         . What needs to be done is for a judge to add and inform the jury not only of the fact of [unreliability] but the reasons why it might be unreliable.” 
         
        
       
     71    The Crown submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “The appellant’s counsel asked at T292.47: ‘Unreliability is the other direction I will be asking your Honour to give. All the identification evidence in relation to what they actually do. There is no doubt they were there. But the actions of each party, the unreliability of that evidence in view of such a short period of time, such a quick thing. Those kinds of matters. That’s all I can think of at the moment.’ 
         
        
        
         
         The direction given as to these witnesses complied with this request and was sufficient. As to the appellant’s submission that to comply with s 165 of the  
         Evidence Act 
         , his Honour should have used the word ‘unreliable’, this is not required by the section. Section 165(4) states: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘(4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Immediately before his Honour gave the warning, he had summarised counsels’ criticisms of the reliability of several witnesses and then said: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Those are the sorts of criticisms, or submissions, made by counsel which, in their submission, impact upon the reliability of the evidence of these witnesses.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         As to the requirements under s 165(2), his Honour stated that witnesses may make genuine mistakes in seeking to recall what was seen and listed things happening quickly and the fact that there may have been a number of people involved in the events unfolding before their eyes as reasons for examining the evidence of these witnesses very carefully. It is submitted this complied with the section. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown again joins issue with the accuracy of the matters that Mr Diolosa is said to have testified on. 
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that the criticism of his Honour in which  
         Crampton v The Queen 
          [2000] HCA 60 is cited in support is unjustified. The comments referred to in  
         Crampton 
          related to the absence of a  
         Longman 
          warning, due to lengthy delay in complaint in a sexual assault trial. They have no application here. It was not necessary that he go as far as suggested.” 
         
        
       
     72    While it is true that the trial judge did not adopt all of defence counsel’s criticisms of the relevant witnesses - and it would not have been right to do so, that being a matter for the jury - he did bring them to the jury’s attention more fully than the appellant’s submission on this ground might suggest. It is convenient to set out the whole of the directions about the evidence of these three witnesses. The trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Before I embark upon looking at this evidence with you, I remind you that both Mr Cusack and Mr Watson have voiced criticism of the reliability you would attach to the evidence of the various witnesses, who were in Kings Cross at the time the deceased was injured and probably it is convenient if I just remind you of those criticisms, before we look at the evidence, the criticisms voiced by Mr Watson in his submissions and adopted by Mr Cusack in his submissions. 
         
        
        
         
         First of all with Mr Mahbubur and for the sake of simplicity we will call him, I think, during the course of this summing up Bablu. That is not to belittle Mr Mahbubur but it is probably easier for everybody, because that is the name he has been referred to by. 
         
        
        
         
         What Mr Watson says about Bablu is that he has obviously got a difficulty with English. He said he was a very unreliable witness. He submitted there were inconsistencies in his evidence  
         and there were 
          [emphasis added]. … 
         
        
        
         
         So far as Mrs Taria was concerned, Mr Watson submitted that she was inconsistent as to the number of people she saw kick the deceased. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Diolosa, Mr Cusack submitted, was too far away to be able to give any reliable evidence. … 
         
        
        
         
         Those are the sorts of criticisms, or submissions, made by counsel which, in their submission, impact upon the reliability of the evidence of these witnesses. 
         
        
        
         
         I direct you that you must examine the evidence of these witnesses very carefully. It is important that you bear in mind that the events of which they have given evidence happened quickly and that people can make genuine mistakes in seeking to recall what was seen, particularly where there may be a number of people involved in the events unfolding before their eyes.” 
         
        
        
       Later he said of Mr Bahbubur: 
        
         
         “In relation to the witnesses Bablu and Islam, I have been asked to draw to your attention, and I do draw to your attention, the circumstances in which their respective observations were made. Firstly, as to Bablu, that he was knocked down, had to be assisted up by Islam and was then taken across to the other side of the road, to the phone there, where Mr Islam was involved in ringing for the police. Much then of their observations was conducted from the other side of the road, with Islam intent not only upon his observations as to what was happening but also intent, no doubt, about making his telephone call. 
         
        
        
         
         These are matters that you should have regard to when you are considering what identification they made of those who were involved in the events across the road, where there may have been, depending upon the view you take of it, quite a number of people there gathered. So, they are matters that you should responsibly heed in making your careful assessment of the witnesses’ evidence.” 
         
        
       
     73    In my opinion the directions given by the trial judge more than answered the request made by defence counsel, particularly in view of the obvious conflicts between various parts of the testimony of the witnesses. That request was, in context, a very tentative one. There was some discussion of “a direction relating to circumstantial evidence” which counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial said he wanted. Three requests were made by the judge for a statement of what particular direction was wanted: none was answered. The transcript then records the following exchange: 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: If there was some particular feature that they had to be satisfied of beyond reasonable doubt on some matter of circumstantial evidence, I would want you to identify that for me. I sometimes think this minute examination just unduly complicates matters frankly. 
         
        
        
         
         WATSON: I grant I’d rather have less directions than more. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I will hear what you say when I finish directing the jury. If you think there is something else they have to be told before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt -- 
         
        
        
         
         WATSON: Unreliability is the other direction I will be asking your Honour to give. All the identification evidence in relation to what they actually do. There is no doubt they were there. But the actions of each party, the unreliability of that evidence, in view of such a short period of time, such a quick thing. Those kinds of matters. That’s all I can think of at the moment.” 
         
        
       
     74    Defence counsel appeared to be asking for a s 165(1)(b) direction. He did not ask for a direction conforming to the criteria now stipulated by the appellant as being essential - the “dangers”, the “need for caution”, the “weight”, the “reasons particular to this case as to why the warning was being given”. Nor was there a request for a specific statement “that the evidence may be unreliable and the matters that cause it to be unreliable”.  
      
       
     75    At the end of the first part of the summing up, counsel for the appellant, on being asked if any further direction was called for, said he knew counsel for the co-accused was going to ask for a further identification direction, and would let him speak first. Counsel for the co-accused asked for specific directions about Mr Bahbubur and Mr Islam and the circumstances in which they made their observations. Counsel for the appellant was then asked again for the directions he wanted. He did not ask for any re-direction about Mr Bahbubur, Ms Taria or Mr Diolosa.  
      
       
     76    In the circumstances the conduct of the trial suggests that the warnings given by the trial judge were perceived, correctly, by the appellant’s counsel as satisfactory. The substantive requirements of s 165 were complied with. The manner in which the direction was requested may reveal, as counsel for the appellant submitted in reply, that counsel perceived the issue to be important, though counsel for the appellant also conceded that “the learned Judge might have expected a little more assistance than he got”. But the failure to ask for a stronger identification direction, particularly after counsel for the co-accused raised the specific matters he did, suggests that the issue had been satisfactorily dealt with.  
      
       
     77    The appellant’s attacks on the trial judge’s directions on unreliability are unsound.  
      
       
        
       Grounds 1, 3 and 4: proviso 
       
     78    If the proviso cannot be applied in relation to Ground 2, I cannot see how it can be applied, in the circumstances of this case, on the other grounds. Similarly, if it is to be applied on Ground 2, it would be applicable in relation to the other grounds. But in view of the fact that in my opinion Grounds 1, 3 and 4 have not been made out, there is no need to consider the application of the proviso in relation to them.  
      
       
        
         
        
       Orders 
       
     79    The appellant made no submission that this Court should order an acquittal. Accordingly the appropriate orders I favour are as follows. 
      
       
        
       1. Order that the appeal against conviction be allowed. 
        
        
       2. Order that there be a new trial. 
        
        
       But in consequence of the majority opinion, the order of the court is that the appeal against conviction is dismissed. 
        
       
     80    BARR J: 
      
       
       Ground 2 
        
       I agree for the reasons given by Heydon JA that the directions given by the trial judge contravened the law as explained in  
       RPS v The Queen 
        [2000] HCA 3 and  
       Azzopardi v The Queen 
        [2001] HCA 25. I agree for the reasons explained by Smart AJ that the proviso should apply. 
        
        
       Grounds 1, 3 and 4 
       
     81    I agree with Heydon JA. 
      
       
     82    In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.  
      
       
     83    SMART AJ: The facts and circumstances are set out in the judgment of Heydon JA. I agree that the directions given by the judge as to the view the jury could take of the appellant not giving evidence complied with the law as it was understood by judges of this Court at the date of the summing-up (13 & 14 September 1999) but contravened the law as it was expounded by the High Court in RPS v The Queen (2000) 74 ALJR 449 and Azzopardi v The Queen [2001] HCA 25. I also agree with Heydon JA that this was not a case where a Weissensteiner comment could be made. 
      
       
     84    I disagree with Heydon JA that this is a case in which the proviso should not be applied. I do not disagree with his statement of the principles applicable. My disagreement lies in the application of those principles and his assessment of the evidence and its effect. In my view, having regard to the proven facts and the great strength of the Crown case there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice despite the incorrect direction and comment. 
      
       
     85    This was a joint criminal enterprise case and was so left by the judge to the jury (see SU11-14). At SU21 the judge said: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ""The Crown invites you, as the jury, to come to the conclusion that the inference is compelling and is the only rational inference, that what occurred was part of a joint enterprise that involved each accused and that that enterprise was one that involved an intention, on the part of each accused, to cause the death of the deceased, or if not his death, then grievous bodily harm to him. That is the fabric, that is the outline of the joint criminal enterprise that you are asked to find. Each accused, through his counsel, strenuously submits to the contrary."" 
           
          
         
        
       
     86    At SU 48-48A the judge said: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ""Turning to the case against Nitin Giri. This accused, you may think, having read or having listened to the ERISP, admitted punching the deceased and did not deny that he may have kicked the deceased when he was on the ground. Whatever violence the Crown has proved that Nitin Giri inflicted, you could not be satisfied that it alone caused the death of the deceased, any more than you could be satisfied that what Ivesh Karki did, alone caused the death of the deceased. So it is that in the case against Nitin Giri, also the Crown depends on the proof of his participation in a joint criminal enterprise and what flows from that. So it is the same case, the nature of the case is the same, that the Crown presents again each of the accused. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           The accused Nitin Giri can only be convicted of murder, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, of his participation in that joint criminal enterprise and as to that, you must be satisfied that the accused, either (1), shared a common intention with the other participant, or participants in this enterprise, of causing death or grievous bodily harm to the deceased, or (2) that he contemplated the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm by another participant, or participants, as being a possible incident in the joint criminal enterprise."" 
           
          
         
        
       
     87    These directions and the finding of the appellant guilty do not depend on the jury finding that the appellant kicked the deceased. At SU54 when dealing with the issue of self defence the judge stated that the Crown ""must prove that in striking the deceased, if you find that he did, and in kicking the deceased, if you find that he did, Giri did not believe it was necessary for him to do so, in order to defend himself"". The striking and the kicking are separate matters. It would be enough if the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant having hit the deceased, knocking him to the ground, was present intentionally aiding and encouraging Karki in his kicking of the deceased. Such kicking was obviously intended to inflict grievous bodily harm. The background should not be overlooked. The appellant, referred to as the man with the ponytail, was a prominent member of a group which menaced the deceased before the appellant hit him. 
      
       
     88    The evidence reveals that there was a joint criminal enterprise on foot. It was the appellant who called a halt to the kicking, he judging that it was time to flee. The appellant has not lost a real chance of acquittal. His conviction was inevitable. 
      
       
     89    The Crown did allege that the appellant kicked the deceased. Proof of that fact further strengthened the Crown case but it was not essential to the Crown case that that fact be proved or be proved beyond reasonable doubt. This was appreciated by all at the trial. If proof beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant kicking the deceased had been essential to proof of the appellant's guilt, the parties and the judge would not have spent so much time at the sentence hearing resolving that issue. The judge would have stated that such a finding was implicit in the jury's verdict. The finding by the judge that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant kicked the deceased was essential to the sentencing exercise as the judge was asked to find that the appellant's criminality was less than that of Karki. 
      
       
     90    In determining whether there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice the focus should be on the evidence proving the elements of the offence and the strength of that evidence. Having considered that evidence I consider it to be overwhelming. The focus should not be on the evidence as to whether the appellant kicked the deceased. Such an approach would not be correct as it was not an essential fact. The events prior to the appellant hitting the deceased and knocking him to the ground and those latter events bespoke the involvement of the appellant in the joint enterprise. 
      
       
     91    If I am wrong in my view as to the approach which should be taken and the evidence as to the appellant kicking the deceased is of critical importance, nevertheless the appellant would inevitably have been convicted on the evidence. 
      
       
     92    Human blood was found on the appellant's jeans. It was not his blood. It could have been the blood of the deceased or the blood of others of the same blood group. The appellant's counsel suggested that it could have been the blood of Mr Islam who had cut his finger and was trying to break up the altercation outside the hotel. That seems a little far fetched. 
      
       
     93    There was compelling evidence that the appellant kicked the deceased. That of Mr Thompson was particularly powerful. The jury requested a transcript of his evidence (SU 66) but not that of any other witness. Counsel for the appellant at the trial conceded that Mr Thompson was a very straightforward sort of person. Counsel's only criticism was that Mr Thompson had made a mistake as to the top being worn by Noggin, a member of the group of Karki and the appellant. It is hard to see how this matters. Mr Thompson's evidence was supported by that of Rahman Mahbubar, Sheikh Islam and Mr Jim Diamond. 
      
       
     94    At the trial the appellant submitted that Mr Mahbubar obviously had difficulty with English and drew attention to inconsistencies in his evidence (SU23). For a deal of the time Mr Islam claimed to see what he was talking about from across the road where he was trying to telephone for the police. He also had difficulties with the English language (SU23A). It should also be noted that Mr Mahbubar was knocked down and had to be assisted up by Islam and taken to the other side of the road. 
      
       
     95    It was submitted that what Mr Diamond told police differed from what he said in evidence (SU23A). The difference seemed to be principally as to the sequence of events. Mr Diamond was clear that the appellant had punched the deceased and then kicked him when he went down. 
      
       
     96    Mr Dilosa's evidence seemed to vary. He said that from the distance where he was standing, the events were not exactly clear to him. He told the police that the appellant did not kick the deceased and tried to stop his co-accused. At the trial in chief and in re-examination he stated that the appellant kicked the deceased. In cross-examination Mr Dilosa thought that what he said to the police was what had happened. His statement to the police was made on the day following the assault. The evidence of Mr Dilosa was also criticised because he was too far away to be able to give any reliable evidence (SU24). 
      
       
     97    Mr Simon Page was a friend of Mr Thompson. Mr Page, who had been at an automatic teller machine at a bank, arrived at the scene a little later than Mr Thompson. It was evident that his scope for observation was less than that of Mr Thompson. In his police statement Mr Page said he had seen one man give the deceased one kick while he was on the ground and that kick ""did not appear to be very hard"". In his evidence in chief he said he remembered one man, ""possibly two"" kicking the deceased on the ground.  
      
       
     98    Mrs O Taria was acting as a manager at Hungry Jacks. This is on one side of the Springfield Mall. The fight occurred on the other side of the Mall. She agreed that her vision was obscured. In her evidence in chief she said that she did not know and could not remember how many kicks she saw but it was more than one, and that there were two people who kicked. In cross-examination she agreed that at the committal proceeding she said that there was only one person who was kicking. She explained that as she walked away from the Local Court and really thought about the events which she had seen she realised that she had seen two people. There were two people standing over the body and she saw them kicking the body. 
      
       
     99    She also said ""I just saw someone kicking the man lying on the ground, stomp on his head. Three or four time he was doing that"". She could not describe the man. She thought that some of the other people around were trying to stop the fight. In re-examination she reaffirmed that stomping took place and that she saw two persons kicking. 
      
       
     100    Mr Anthony Bayes was a drug user and dealer, (mainly heroin) living on the streets in 1996. On the day in question he was using cocaine. He was in prison at the time of the trial. He saw a man grabbed and punched. That man fell to the ground and somebody started kicking this man in the head. He said another man tried to stop that but was chased away by a third man. The man who grabbed the deceased was the man who kicked him. He said he saw only one man kicking the man on the ground. He was not able to offer a reasonable description of the man who did the kicking. He had not told the truth to the police. He did not want to become involved and he did not want to give evidence as it was against his own interests. He feared that he was risking his safety in gaol. (SU62). 
      
       
     101    Counsel for the appellant submitted to the jury that Mr Bayes was the one most likely to be telling them what he actually saw because he did not want to be at the court. Anything he did say was all the more likely to be true because of his reluctance to say anything (SU24). Counsel asked the jury on the basis of Mr Bayes' evidence to find that the appellant was not a party to any joint enterprise and that the appellant sought to intervene and stop the stomping and kicking. The unsatisfactory nature of Mr Bayes' evidence emerges from both his evidence and the summing-up. 
      
       
     102    Three comments need to be made. First, some of the evidence, for example, that of Mr Bayes, was not reliable. Secondly, just because a witness did not see or recall seeing a particular event, that is the appellant kicking the deceased, does not mean that it did not happen. Thirdly, a close reading of the evidence makes it apparent that Mr Thompson's evidence is of value and it is easy to see why the jury wanted a copy of his evidence. 
      
       
     103    The lack of challenge in cross-examination to the evidence of some witnesses who stated that the appellant kicked the deceased is significant. This highlights that at the trial, while the kicking issue was canvassed, it was not seen as crucial. 
      
       
     104     In a case such as the present one where the incident erupted and took place quickly and in a very short period of time in stressful circumstances differences in observation and discrepancies are to be expected. The thrust of the evidence of the important witnesses was clear enough. 
      
       
     105    Given that evidence, the statements by the appellant that he hit the deceased and that that blow caused him to fall to the ground, the appellant's further statement that he may have kicked the deceased but did not remember doing so, his general participation in the fight, his presence, his intentionally aiding and encouraging Karki and his calling off the attack to flee, there is no real chance of the jury attaching any importance to the judge's remarks that the accused not giving evidence could go and only go to the value or weight which they gave to the evidence which the Crown witnesses had given. The evidence of the Crown witnesses needed no prop. 
      
       
     106    The jury were satisfied that the Crown had negatived self defence, that is, that the Crown had established that the appellant did not believe, on reasonable grounds, that it was necessary for him to act as he did in order to defend himself. The issue of self defence arose out of the appellant's response to the police questions. This response was that the deceased wanted to fight and approached him in an aggressive way and fighting pose. The appellant said that he had to hit the deceased because if he had hit the appellant the latter would have fallen on the ground. The appellant said that he hit the deceased who fell down to the ground. He said that all the Nepalese boys kicked the deceased. The appellant stated that he hit the deceased once to defend himself. The jury rejected the appellant's version. His record of interview reveals that he was involved in a joint enterprise. 
      
       
     107    This is an unusual case in that it is possible from reading the evidence and the summing-up to gauge the quality of the evidence. More importantly, the trial judge, who had the opportunity of seeing and hearing all the witnesses, gauging their impact, and noting the way counsel for the appellant approached the witnesses and the evidence, was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant kicked the deceased. The eye witness evidence proved that both accused kicked the appellant after he was knocked down and lay on the ground. In so finding the judge stated that he had allowed for the discrepancies in the eye witness versions. The judge's finding is important and reflects the quality and impact of the evidence at the trial. The judge further stated: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ""Each man participated in what was a savage and cowardly assault upon the unfortunate victim who, after he was knocked to the ground was kicked by each prisoner as he lay defenceless and unconscious. Each prisoner had the requisite intent for murder."" 
           
          
         
        
        
       
     108    I would apply the proviso, that is, I hold that despite the incorrect directions no substantial miscarriage of justice occurred. Accordingly I would reject the challenge to the verdict based on Ground 2. 
      
       
        
       Ground 1 - Manslaughter Directions 
       
     109    I agree with what Heydon JA has written. As to the first criticism, I add that at SU13 the judge stated that one way a person may participate in a joint criminal enterprise is, with knowledge that the crime is to be committed, intentionally assisting or encouraging another person to commit the crime. He further explained that the mere presence of a person at the time when the crime is committed, coupled with a readiness to help, if required, can suffice to amount to an encouragement to the other participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime. The directions involve the proposition that mere presence is not enough and this would have been understood by the jury. 
      
       
     110    This was in any event not a case of ""mere presence"".111    The first criticism fails. 
      
       
     112    As to the second criticism, the passages quoted by Heydon JA from the summing-up demonstrate that the judge adequately explained ""the possible interpretation of the appellant's conduct amounting to manslaughter and not murder."" The judge adequately explained the relevant general principles and what combination of the facts would amount to murder and what combination would amount to manslaughter. He related the principles to the facts of the cases of Karki and Giri. The directions given were clear and sufficient. 
      
       
     113    As to the third criticism I have nothing to add to what Heydon JA has written. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3 - Directions on self defence 
       
     114    I agree with what Heydon JA has written. 
      
       
        
       Ground 4 - Warnings on Unreliability 
       
     115    I agree with what Heydon JA has written subject to one caveat. I have considerable reservations whether the evidence in question could fairly be classed as having the potential to be unreliable within the meaning of s 165(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 and required a warning. 
      
       
     116    In many cases events occur quickly and witnesses see them from different perspectives. They may remember different matters. Some witnesses may not recall matters or events which other witnesses saw. That does not make the evidence unreliable. Nor would I regard the evidence of a witness whose evidence at the trial differs in some respects from that given at the committal hearing as necessarily falling into the category of ""may be unreliable"". It all depends on the details of the particular instance. The difference may relate to minor matters or the witness may have rethought his or her position as a result of a particular fact emerging. Lapse of time is sometimes a factor. Mistakes, misunderstandings, inability to recall matters or lack of observing matters do not necessarily place evidence in the ""may be unreliable"" category. The evidence of witnesses does not fall into the ""may be unreliable"" category because they fail to measure up to standards of perfection or near perfection. Of course, if a witness appears to be careless or biased, or trying to protect somebody or withholding matters the evidence could readily fall into the ""may be unreliable"" category. 
      
       
     117    The appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONMcCLELLAN JFRIDAY, 1 JUNE 200170046/00 - REGINA v Anh Tuan LESENTENCE 1    HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, Anh Tuan Le, was indicted that on 23 February 2000 at Cabramatta he did murder Tuan Quoc Nguyen. The jury found him not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. 
     
      
    2    The evidence discloses that the prisoner was born in Vietnam and came to Australia in August 1999 on a student visa. He initially lived with a family at Randwick and later moved to Campsie and then to Cabramatta, where he apparently lived for a time with the victim and his brother, Phat Quoc Nguyen. The arrangement appears to have been initially satisfactory but after a short while disputes arose in relation to money, and the prisoner moved out. At the time of the offence the prisoner appears to have been living variously at Bankstown or on the streets. 
     
      
    3    Tuan Quoc Nguyen died on the morning of 23 February 2000. The previous evening the prisoner was with another person, playing video games in a shop in Cabramatta. Phat Quoc Nguyen and the deceased were also there. The evidence discloses that there was a conversation, followed by a fist fight. The prisoner won the fight, which took place without any weapons. All of the parties then left those premises. 
     
      
    4    The next morning the prisoner was sitting, talking to an acquaintance by the name of Nhat in Arthur Street, Cabramatta. They were outside a restaurant, next to a lane that goes north to a carpark and then into Hughes Street. 
     
      
    5    Eyewitness accounts of the events were given by a number of people. For various reasons some of the evidence was unsatisfactory. It may be that because of the speed with which the events occurred different witnesses, without reason to do other than tell the truth, have differing accounts of some of the detail. It is difficult to reconcile all of the evidence in a satisfactory manner. 
     
      
    6    However, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that while talking to his acquaintance, the prisoner observed Phat Quoc Nguyen and the victim and another two people in the middle of the carpark. They were walking towards him when on the other side of the road to the prisoner, one person in the group, stopped but the others continued walking. The victim said to the prisoner, as he approached, ""Come over here. I want to talk to you"". The prisoner moved away but, perceiving a threat from the advancing group, ran to a nearby garden, where a knife had been secreted, and returned. 
     
      
    7    The prisoner does not accept that he delivered the fatal wound to the victim, but he does not deny that it may have been caused by him. The wound, although fatal, was of relatively small dimension and the prisoner, although conceding that he had retrieved a knife, said that its dimension was far greater than the size of the wound. If this evidence was correct, the prisoner's knife could not have been responsible for the fatal stabbing. 
     
      
    8    There was evidence that a knife of the dimensions which could have caused the fatal wound was observed to be secreted in a laneway near to the scene earlier that morning. The person identified as having placed the knife in that location, Mr Tuan Trieu, was a friend of the victim and was observed at the place where he was stabbed. 
     
      
    9    The knife which he had been observed to position before the events could not be located, when a search was conducted, and it is reasonable to assume that Tuan Trieu himself retrieved it. However, as I have indicated, he was a friend of the deceased and there is no evidence that he stabbed the deceased, although he may have joined in the melee. 
     
      
    10    There is direct evidence that the prisoner stabbed the deceased, given by the deceased's brother, Phat Quoc Nguyen. Two statements made by Phat Quoc Nguyen were tendered in evidence, submissions being made on behalf of the prisoner that they should be admitted, notwithstanding the fact that Phat Quoc Nguyen, although present outside the court on the first day of the trial, had flown to Vietnam before giving oral evidence. In that statement, Phat Quoc Nguyen not only says that he saw the prisoner stab his brother but describes the weapon he saw the prisoner using in a manner consistent with the wound which caused the death. 
     
      
    11    Because he did not give evidence Phat Quoc Nguyen's evidence must be approached with caution. However, I am satisfied that it should be accepted, at least, on these issues. 
     
      
    12    I have no doubt that it was the prisoner's act of stabbing with the knife which he retrieved from the garden which caused death. I am also satisfied that by the time the stabbing occurred a general melee was taking place, which involved a number of people, some of whom had weapons. However, although there is evidence that the victim was carrying a pipe, there is no evidence that the prisoner's life was being directly threatened at the time that he stabbed the victim. 
     
      
    13    The prisoner fled the scene and took his weapon with him, which he subsequently discarded. The weapon was not recovered and it was many days later before the prisoner was arrested and charged. 
     
      
    14    At his trial the prisoner did not deny that he killed the deceased. He said that he did not know whether it was the weapon he was holding which caused the fatal wound. He said that when he was approached by the men, including the victim and his brother, he was frightened, tried to escape, but his path, being blocked, he sought the weapon which he knew to be secreted in the garden to defend himself. He said he acted in self-defence. 
     
      
    15    The jury rejected his defence and, although finding him not guilty of murder, convicted him of manslaughter. Both the murder case and that of manslaughter were put to the jury on the alternate basis that the prisoner was engaged in a joint enterprise with his acquaintance. As I have indicated, notwithstanding that the matter was put on this basis, I have no doubt that the prisoner was responsible for the fatal wound. 
     
      
    16    I am satisfied that the prisoner either secreted the weapon or knew where it was hidden and decided to respond to the situation by retrieving it and using it in any fight. His act of stabbing was deliberate and, although a threat existed, there is no evidence which would justify him using the knife in a manner which killed the deceased. Even though there is evidence that the victim had a pipe, there is no evidence which would indicate that the prisoner was entitled to respond to any threat made to him by fatally stabbing the victim. 
     
      
    17    When sentencing the prisoner, it is necessary for me to bear in mind the objective circumstances in which he found himself. It is plain that he felt threatened by the advancing group and that, having regard to the events which occurred on the previous evening, he was entitled to believe that it may be necessary for him to respond by physically defending himself against a threat. 
     
      
    18    In these circumstances, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that although the prisoner was entitled to take steps to defend himself, retrieving the knife and using it in the melee, as he did, was an excessive response to the situation. 
     
      
    19    There is no doubt that sentencing for manslaughter is a difficult process. The range of sentence is greater than for almost any other offence. The maximum penalty is twenty-five years penal servitude. In Georgina Marie Hill v R 3 A Crim R 397, the Chief Justice said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The circumstances leading to the felonious taking of human life being regarded as manslaughter rather than murder can vary infinitely, and it is not always easy to determine in any given case what should be done in the matter of sentence. At the start it should be recognised that the felonious taking of a human life is recognised both in the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900 and in the community at large as one of the most dreadful crimes in the criminal calendar. The courts have, however, over the decades gradually manifested a willingness to recognise factual contexts which provide some basis for understanding the human tragedies that can lead to the taking of a life. The manifestation of this humanitarian tendency is necessarily attended by the utmost caution. It can be seen to be constantly written in the decisions of the courts and in the enactments of the legislature that the taking of a human life is a grave action calling for a correspondingly grave measure of criminal justice being meted out to the guilty party. 
        
       
       
        
        It is necessary to evaluate the demands of the criminal justice system, the expectations of the community at large, the subjective circumstances of the prisoner coming forward for criminal judgment and the interest of society in protecting itself and its members from criminal activity amounting, as in the present case, to the taking of a life."" 
        
       
      
    20    I must have regard, when determining the penalty which it is appropriate to impose, to the objective assessment of the criminality of the act leading to death. I must also have regard to the need for deterrence and to discourage others from unlawful and dangerous attacks using knives and similar weapons. 
     
      
    21    I must also make plain that the law will not condone the excessive use of force, especially when that involves the taking of human life. It must be made clear that persons who are tempted to commit crime will be punished severely if they yield to that temptation. This is particularly the case when the contemplated crime involves the use of knives or similar weapons with a significant risk to human life. Our community rightly expects that those who take another's life in those circumstances will be severely punished. 
     
      
    22    In the present case, I am satisfied that the events of 23 February 2000 should be understood as a continuation of the events of the preceding evening. Of course, the animosity evident on that occasion had a history stemming from the time when the prisoner lived with the victim and his brother. It would seem that the parties were unable to resolve their animosity without resorting to violence and, although, on 22 February, this was limited to a fist fight, the situation escalated greatly, the following day. 
     
      
    23    The prisoner's actions in retrieving the weapon and using it in the fight must be understood in the context of the preceding events. I have no doubt that he was ready for a fight and prepared to use the secreted knife to inflict injuries on the victim or his brother or anyone accompanying them. There is no evidence that the killing was related to drugs, gang warfare or any other organised criminal activity. 
     
      
    24    With respect to subjective matters, it is important to appreciate that the prisoner is now aged twenty-three. He was born in Vietnam and the reports from the Probation and Parole officer, who has interviewed him, and that of Terry Kesby-Smith, a clinical psychologist, both identify that the prisoner had a stable upbringing in Vietnam. He completed high school in that country and then entered university, undertaking a course in navigation. It appears that he had completed three years of that course and it was his intention to return to Vietnam to pursue a career in shipping. He came to Australia for the purpose of receiving intensive education in the English language at Martin College at Darlinghurst. I understand that his parents paid for the course and were providing money for his living expenses. At that point of his life there would appear to be no reason why he would not have gone on to become fluent in English, return to Vietnam and create a successful and fulfilling life for himself. There is no indication of any problems which occurred during the course of the years in his life prior to him coming to Australia. 
     
      
    25    However, tragically, not long after taking up residence in Australia and pursuing his studies, his life appears to have significantly deteriorated. He apparently left the accommodation which was originally available for him and, as I have earlier indicated, effectively ended up living on the streets. Although he initially attended regularly at the Martin College, his attendance appears to have deteriorated, and he was described by the college as a loner. Although his facility with the English language has increased, the apparent objective that he become fluent has not so far materialised. 
     
      
    26    There is no evidence that the prisoner has any problems with alcohol and prior to the offence it would appear he had no difficulties with drugs of addiction. He did take to using heroin in the days after the killing when he was seeking to avoid capture. I, however, am told, and accept, that he has no continuing problem with heroin. 
     
      
    27    Through the clinical psychologist the prisoner indicates significant sorrow for the death of the victim, and I accept that that sorrow is genuine. I have no doubt that the prisoner greatly regrets the path which his life has taken since he came to Australia, culminating in the tragic events of 23 February 2000. 
     
      
    28    There is some evidence of at least one prior offence for shoplifting in Australia. Although his tendered record suggests that there are other offences, these are disputed, and the Crown does not advance that, in any event, they are matters which should be considered in the course of my determination of the appropriate sentence in this matter. Accordingly, I expressly disregard the material in exhibit A when determining the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    29    The prisoner was arrested on 17 March 2000, and he has been in custody since that time. In my opinion a further custodial sentence is necessary. Furthermore, I believe that if, at the end of that custodial sentence, upon his release, he remains in Australia in circumstances similar to those which existed at the time of the present offence, he may have significant difficulties in rehabilitating himself. However, having regard to the material tendered before me, if upon his release he returns to Vietnam, there would appear to be a significant prospect that he may be able to take up his life where he left it upon coming to Australia. If this occurs, there would appear to be every reason to believe that he will be able to satisfactorily rehabilitate himself and live a productive and fulfilling life. However, as I have indicated, in my opinion the circumstances of the offence necessitate a further period of full-time imprisonment. 
     
      
    30    Mr Le, you have been found guilty of the offence of manslaughter. I have heard and taken into account all of the matters that have been put by counsel on your behalf. In particular, I have had regard to the circumstances in which the offence occurred, and to the material brought forward on your behalf by the clinical psychologist and the Probation and Parole officer. You are convicted of manslaughter. You are sentenced to a term of six years imprisonment to commence on 17 March 2000, with a non parole period of four years commencing 17 March 2000 and expiring on 16 March 2004 with an additional term of two years commencing 17 March 2004 and expiring 16 March 2006. Accordingly, you will be eligible for parole on 16 March 2004.

      PELLS v FARRELLY 
        
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
     FACTSThe respondent, Mrs Farrelly, suffered injuries in two accidents which occurred approximately two years apart. The first accident was a fall at Gosford railway station. The second was a motor car accident occasioned by Mrs Pells. Mrs Farrelly sued the SRA and Mrs Pells in separate actions in respect of her injuries. Those actions were heard together and she was successful against both defendants. The SRA and Mrs Pells appealed from the trial judge’s assessment of damages. Mrs Farrelly cross appealed on this issue. The SRA also appealed the trial judge’s distribution of damages as against each defendant. HELD per Meagher JA (Handley JA & Adams AJA agreeing):(i) There is no basis upon which to interfere with the trial judge’s award of general damages against either defendant. (ii) As to damages for matters other than non-economic loss, the percentages ordered to be paid by each defendant should be reversed, so that the SRA is liable for 40% of the sum, and Mrs Pells is liable for 60%. (iii) The respondent is to have an allowance for past and future loss of superannuation. Counsel are to devise a mode of calculating the figure.ORDERS1 In the appeal, SRA v Farrelly, appeal allowed. 2 In the appeal Pells v Farrelly, appeal dismissed.3 Cross appeal by the first respondent allowed. 4 SRA to have an order for costs.5 Counsel to bring in short minutes giving effect to these reasons.

      STATE RAIL AUTHORITY OF NSW v FARRELLY 
       
      PELLS v FARRELLY 
        
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
     1   MEAGHER JA: This is an appeal by the SRA against a verdict in favour of the plaintiff, Mrs Farrelly. It was heard by this Court together with an appeal by Mrs Pells against another verdict in favour of Mrs Farrelly, and with a cross-appeal by Mrs Farrelly. The former verdict was in the sum of $295,091.63. The latter was in the sum of $238,546.02. The two actions were heard together by his Honour Acting Judge Maxwell. The reason why they were heard together was because of the difficulty of disentangling the undoubted damage which Mrs Farrelly suffered as between the two defendants. 
     2   In the former case Mrs Farrelly sued because of what she alleged was the SRA’s negligence in its maintenance of a platform on the Gosford railway station, precipitating a fall by her when she alighted from a train at that station. Liability was contested, but only - it would seem - in a token way, as his Honour had no difficulty in concluding that the SRA was liable. Thereafter the matter proceeded on the assessment of damages. In the latter case, Mrs Farrelly sued Mrs Pells in respect of injuries she suffered in a motor car collision. Liability was admitted, but damages were very much in issue. 
     3   The accident in the former case took place on 4 October 1991. The accident in the latter case occurred nearly two years later, on 11 October 1993. 
     4   His Honour found that Mrs Farrelly was a witness of truth, but prone to exaggerate her ailments and misfortunes. 
     5   It is undoubted that in the railway accident she suffered some back injury, together with injury to her lower back - a collation of injuries not unusual in this type of litigation. However, the evidence taken as a whole compels the conclusion that these injuries had nearly healed by the time of the second, motor vehicle, accident. That is the view which the bulk of the medical evidence supports. It is also what she herself said in her evidence. She had almost given up seeing doctors about nine months before the second accident.  
     6   Then the second accident occurred, and, following it, three results of significance. First, her previous injuries were re-agitated and aggravated. Secondly, some new injuries appeared: for example, injury to her left leg. Thirdly, and most importantly, psychiatric symptoms of some gravity manifested themselves. 
     7   His Honour’s judgment is dated 13 March 2000. In it, his Honour found that all injuries, physical and psychiatric, will have resolved themselves by the conclusion of four years from that date. 
     8   The matter was argued by all counsel with exemplary consistency and commonsense. Mr Hoeben SC, learned senior counsel for the SRA, accepted many of the criticisms made of his Honour’s figures by Mr Morrison SC, learned senior counsel for Mrs Farrelly; and Mr Morrison, in turn, moderated his criticism of Mr Hoeben’s figure. What motivated both gentlemen, very properly, was a distaste for the prospect of a new trial. They have left for the Court only three issues to decide. 
     9   The first issue concerns his Honour’s treatment of general damages (or damages for non-economic loss. In the present context there is no difference between the terms). His Honour awarded $25,000 against the SRA and $68,250 against Mrs Pells. In my view neither figure ought be disturbed. In the present case, the most important component of the figure is the psychiatric disturbance. In this respect, as in most others, there was a wide conflict between the testimony of the various doctors (only one of whom was called to give oral evidence). Dr Jolly attributed 80-85% of the psychiatric problems to the second (motor car) accident, 15-20% to the first (railway) accident. Dr Phillips broadly agreed with him. These two doctors were accepted by his Honour. Their assessments are borne out of the fact that no traces of psychiatric disturbance occurred before the second accident. That, of course, does not mean that the perpetrator of the first accident has no liability in this regard. The first accident to some extent rendered Mrs Farrelly predisposed to mental disturbances. The difference between $25,000 and $69,000 is close enough to 20%-80%. 
     10   The second issue is the manner in which damages for matters other than non-economic loss should be distributed. His Honour, without any explanation, awarded them 60% as against the SRA, and 40% as against Mrs Pells. I am afraid I cannot understand this. The evidence (which I have endeavoured to summarise very shortly above) shows quite clearly that she had nearly recovered from the first accident when the second accident occurred. And, whilst in a sense the second accident may be considered as merely aggravating the symptoms which flowed from the first accident, it should more accurately be described as the major independent cause of the lady’s woes. I agree with Mr Hoeben’s submission that the percentages should be reversed, so that they lie 40% as against the SRA and 60% as against Mrs Pells. 
     11   The only other issue which requires resolution is superannuation. His Honour appreciated that this should have been allowed, but did not do so because of the difficulty of the task. However, this is no excuse. Some mode of calculating the figure must be devised, however rough. Counsel can undertake this task. 
     12   To sum up: I am in favour of allowing the appeal. Counsel should bring in short minutes giving effect to these reasons. The appellant’s success should be reflected in a costs order in favour of the SRA. 
     13   HANDLEY JA: I agree with Meagher JA. 
     14   ADAMS AJA: I agree with Meagher JA.

      60304/00 REGINA v P S 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1   DOWD J: The Court is in a position to give judgment in this matter and Newman AJ will give the first judgment. 
     2   NEWMAN AJ: This is an appeal brought against conviction. The appellant was indicted before the District Court at Liverpool on a count that he had sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years, namely eight years, contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act. An alternative charge of aggravated indecent assault was contained in the indictment. He pleaded not guilty to both counts but the jury found him guilty and he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. 
     3   He seeks not to challenge the term of imprisonment imposed but the conviction. In this regard he has filed four grounds of appeal, the first two being: (1) that a miscarriage of justice occurred by reason of the incompetence of the appellant's counsel, and (2) that his conviction constituted a miscarriage of justice and the trial was unfair. 
     4   The same arguments apply to both those two grounds. There are two other grounds relating to directions given by his Honour. In that event I do not believe it is necessary for me to say any more about grounds 3 or 4 having regard to the conclusion I have reached in relation to the first nominated ground of appeal. 
     5   At the trial five witnesses were called in the Crown case. The complainant LA, who was eight at the time of the alleged offence, her sister PA, who was 6, the mother WA, Dr Brennan, the doctor who examined the complainant, and the police officer who had taken the ERISP given by the accused. In that electronically recorded video tape the accused had denied any wrong doing of the type with which he was subsequently charged. 
     6   It is appropriate at this stage of my reasons to observe that in fact the appellant had originally been charged with sexual assault charges of the type I have identified in relation to the appeal in relation to not only the complainant in the matter but also the girl PA. 
     7   Initially indeed it was the intention of the Crown that the matter proceed as a joint trial. A decision was made to sever the indictment and to charge the appellant separately in the cases of both LA and PA. Ultimately a direction was given by the DPP that no further proceedings be brought in relation to the girl PA. Counsel for the appellant at the trial was so advised prior to the commencement of the trial. 
     8   I should say that, when on a mention in the District Court the Crown announced that it proposed to sever the indictment, objection was made by counsel who appeared in the trial for the accused to the severance. That objection, of course, could not succeed because while it is open to an accused person where a joint trial is mooted to seek severance, the Court has no power to enforce joinder upon the Crown. In any event, that was the background to the case. 
     9   The Crown case, as I have said, consisted of five witnesses, four of whom the Crown intended to call, the fifth was the girl PA. She was called at the specific request of counsel for the appellant at trial. 
     10  The Crown case as called, as I have said, involved the complainant giving evidence. She gave evidence of the events which occurred when she was eight years old at her home. The appellant was her step-father and, of course, was the step-father of her sister PA. She claimed that the appellant, after returning from a ten-pin bowling expedition in which she had taken part with the appellant, came into her room where she was sleeping on a bunk, and there had penile sexual intercourse with her. She said that she had tried to tell her mother the next morning of the event but the mother could not understand what she was putting to her. 
     11  She also gave evidence of four other occasions of sexual assault. They were not matters contained in the indictment but for reasons I need not go into in detail would have been admissible evidence in a case of this type. 
     12  The witness PA was called, as I have said upon the request of counsel for the accused, at the trial. The reason advanced by the appellant’s trial counsel to the Crown Prosecutor as to why he wished PA to be called was that he wanted to raise in cross-examination the proposition that the allegations of sexual assault by both girls were concocted by the mother WA. The Crown asked a number of uncontroversial questions and then PA was cross-examined by counsel for the accused at the trial. 
     13  I need not say more than the cross-examination resulted in PA saying that she had told the police of a penile penetration of her vagina by the appellant. There was no suggestion made, as indeed no suggestion was made to the complainant PA when she gave evidence, that the sexual assault raised by counsel for the accused at the trial with PA, was a fabricated allegation brought about by a conspiracy hatched by the mother WA. 
     14  WA gave evidence of events which occurred including, I might say, evidence of a note given to her by the complainant relating to a question of sexual assault by the appellant. Again no questions were asked of the witness WA which involved a suggestion that she had concocted a fabricated story for the purpose of seeking revenge or otherwise doing mischief to the accused - the appellant here. 
     15  The doctor who was called, Dr Brennan, was cross-examined by counsel for the accused at the trial of not only her examination of the complainant but of PA, again highlighting the allegation that the appellant had carried out a sexual assault upon PA. 
     16  The ERISP evidence was uncontroversial save counsel for the accused insisted that those matters relating to PA, which the Crown in my view quite properly wished to have excised, went before the jury. 
     17  The law relating to this question of whether counsel's incompetence can give rise to interference by this Court has been discussed in a number of cases in recent years. In this State the leading case is that of Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677. The then Chief Justice summarised the principles which are to be applied at p 685 of that report and he set out on that page in pithy form the relevant principles. He said: 
      
       
        
        ""The relevant principles, may be summarised as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        1. A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates. 
        
       
       
        
        2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 
        
       
       
        
        3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as a result of 'flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which would be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention."" 
        
       
     18  It is the fact that this ground has been raised a number of times before this Court unsuccessfully; see for instance R v A R D [2000] NSWCCA 443 and indeed in my judgment in that case I specifically referred to a case where the question that counsel had not raised specifically with witnesses, a question of a concoction for conspiracy in a sexual case, at page 26 of the judgment at para 104 through.19  The learned Chief Justice in Birks case left open the question of what would constitute flagrant incompetence in any particular case. The fact that counsel might take a bold course which does not succeed, would not of itself constitute flagrant incompetence; a failure to ask a few questions, a failure to indeed seek severance, has been held by this Court not to constitute flagrant incompetence. 
     20  However, and I have taken into account the contents of a letter written by counsel for the accused at the trial, which is annexed to an affidavit of Ms Crittenden of 1 June 2001, as to what he did at the trial. I find that this is a case where forcing the Crown, and indeed the Crown can be so forced, to call a witness on a certain basis, namely to make out a case of conspiracy against the appellant, conspiracy involving the complainant, her sister, and as the author of the conspiracy, the mother, may be regarded as a bold move which, if it did not succeed, would not attract the interference of this Court. But to force the Crown to call the sister PA, then not put to her, nor to the complainant, but more importantly to the mother, this question of a concoction or conspiracy of the story, left the accused in a position where it would in fact be a matter of amazement to informed observers if he had not been convicted. 
     21   Indeed, as I have said, when Dr Brennan was called not only was she asked questions about her examination of the complainant but also questions involving the sister PA, therefore underscoring the matter of tendency evidence. I should add the Crown did not rely upon tendency evidence and I also add that counsel for the Crown at trial was so alarmed by the course of events which I have narrated above that she raised them specifically in open court in the absence of the jury after the completion of the Crown case. 
     22   I believe that what the learned Crown Prosecutor did at the trial was entirely appropriate and she deserves commendation for her keen eye for justice in that event. 
     23   However, counsel for the accused did not take up the suggestion which was emanating from the Crown. He has said he was acting on instructions. An affidavit filed by the appellant indicated that the appellant was leaving the matter of the conduct of the trial entirely to counsel. 
     24   It should be said at once that the appellant is not a person who has been the subject of close scrutiny by the law over the years and thus, unlike many who appear in this Court, was inexperienced in the ways of criminal trials. 
     25   In short I am of the view that this is one of the rare cases, and I stress the fact that these are rare cases, where a case of flagrant incompetence has been made out. 
     26   Recently the Privy Council had occasion to deal with such a case in the case of Boodram v State of Trinidad and Tobago (Privy Council, unreported, 10 April 2001) where a woman who had been sentenced to death some 13 years before eventually got her appeal on in the Privy Council. Their Lordships concluded breaches which had occurred in the conduct of the trial - it was not even her initial trial but a re-trial and counsel was unaware it was a re-trial - were of such a fundamental nature that the conclusion must be the defendant was deprived of due process. That in my view is precisely what happened here. The conduct of counsel resulted in the appellant being deprived of due process, therefore a miscarriage has occurred. In view of this conclusion I do not propose to deal with the other grounds of appeal. 
     27   What I propose is this, that the Court make the following orders: appeal upheld, conviction quashed and indeed sentence quashed, and a new trial ordered. 
     28   DOWD J: I agree with Newman AJ. 
     29   GREG JAMES J: I do also. 
     30   DOWD J: The orders of this Court will be as proposed by Newman AJ.

     17   The law relating to this question of whether counsel's incompetence can give rise to interference by this Court has been discussed in a number of cases in recent years. In this State the leading case is that of Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677. The then Chief Justice summarised the principles which are to be applied at p 685 of that report and he set out on that page in pithy form the relevant principles. He said: 
      
       
        
        ""The relevant principles, may be summarised as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        1. A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates. 
        
       
       
        
        2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 
        
       
       
        
        3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as a result of 'flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which would be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention."" 
        
       
     18   It is the fact that this ground has been raised a number of times before this Court unsuccessfully; see for instance R v A R D [2000] NSWCCA 443 and indeed in my judgment in that case I specifically referred to a case where the question that counsel had not raised specifically with witnesses, a question of a concoction for conspiracy in a sexual case, at page 26 of the judgment at para 104 through.19   The learned Chief Justice in Birks case left open the question of what would constitute flagrant incompetence in any particular case. The fact that counsel might take a bold course which does not succeed, would not of itself constitute flagrant incompetence; a failure to ask a few questions, a failure to indeed seek severance, has been held by this Court not to constitute flagrant incompetence. 
     20   However, and I have taken into account the contents of a letter written by counsel for the accused at the trial, which is annexed to an affidavit of Ms Crittenden of 1 June 2001, as to what he did at the trial. I find that this is a case where forcing the Crown, and indeed the Crown can be so forced, to call a witness on a certain basis, namely to make out a case of conspiracy against the appellant, conspiracy involving the complainant, her sister, and as the author of the conspiracy, the mother, may be regarded as a bold move which, if it did not succeed, would not attract the interference of this Court. But to force the Crown to call the sister PA, then not put to her, nor to the complainant, but more importantly to the mother, this question of a concoction or conspiracy of the story, left the accused in a position where it would in fact be a matter of amazement to informed observers if he had not been convicted. 
     21   Indeed, as I have said, when Dr Brennan was called not only was she asked questions about her examination of the complainant but also questions involving the sister PA, therefore underscoring the matter of tendency evidence. I should add the Crown did not rely upon tendency evidence and I also add that counsel for the Crown at trial was so alarmed by the course of events which I have narrated above that she raised them specifically in open court in the absence of the jury after the completion of the Crown case. 
     22   I believe that what the learned Crown Prosecutor did at the trial was entirely appropriate and she deserves commendation for her keen eye for justice in that event. 
     23   However, counsel for the accused did not take up the suggestion which was emanating from the Crown. He has said he was acting on instructions. An affidavit filed by the appellant indicated that the appellant was leaving the matter of the conduct of the trial entirely to counsel. 
     24   It should be said at once that the appellant is not a person who has been the subject of close scrutiny by the law over the years and thus, unlike many who appear in this Court, was inexperienced in the ways of criminal trials. 
     25   In short I am of the view that this is one of the rare cases, and I stress the fact that these are rare cases, where a case of flagrant incompetence has been made out. 
     26   Recently the Privy Council had occasion to deal with such a case in the case of Boodram v State of Trinidad and Tobago (Privy Council, unreported, 10 April 2001) where a woman who had been sentenced to death some 13 years before eventually got her appeal on in the Privy Council. Their Lordships concluded breaches which had occurred in the conduct of the trial - it was not even her initial trial but a re-trial and counsel was unaware it was a re-trial - were of such a fundamental nature that the conclusion must be the defendant was deprived of due process. That in my view is precisely what happened here. The conduct of counsel resulted in the appellant being deprived of due process, therefore a miscarriage has occurred. In view of this conclusion I do not propose to deal with the other grounds of appeal. 
     27   What I propose is this, that the Court make the following orders: appeal upheld, conviction quashed and indeed sentence quashed, and a new trial ordered. 
     28   DOWD J: I agree with Newman AJ. 
     29   GREG JAMES J: I do also. 
     30   DOWD J: The orders of this Court will be as proposed by Newman AJ.

      Regina v PHAN 
     The appellant was convicted of murder. He was sentenced to imprisonment for fourteen years with a non-parole period of ten years and nine weeks. He appealed against the conviction on the grounds that (1) the trial judge failed to give a formal order in compliance with s 54 Jury Act; (2) the trial judge’s directions could not remedy a prejudicial remark made by the Crown prosecutor; (3) the summing up was unbalanced; (4) the trial judge failed to give instructions on an alternative verdict of manslaughter; (5) the trial judge erred in admitting the appellant’s ERISP into evidence; (6) the trial judge’s directions in relation to the liability of the appellant as a principal in the second degree were erroneous and occasioned a miscarriage of justice.HELD (Allowing the appeal):Ground 1: Trial judge failed to give a formal order in compliance with s 54 Jury ActAlthough it is preferable for a formal order to be made in compliance with s 54 Jury Act, the trial judge gave adequate consideration to the issues before announcing that the jury could separate. The trial judge’s remarks amounted to an implied order under s 54 Jury Act. Wu (1999) 199 CLR 99 considered. Ketteridge (1915) 1 KB 467; Maher (1987) 163 CLR 99 distinguished. Radju [2001] NSWCCA 103; Hura [2001] NSWCCA 61 applied.Ground 2: Remark made by Crown Prosecutor in his closing address prejudiced the accused and warranted the discharge of the JuryThe Crown Prosecutor’s observations as to the existence of a possible motive for the murder involving a connection with drugs were both careless and imprudent, however, the remarks were sufficiently dealt with by an explicit and strong direction by the trial judge. Callaghan (1993) 70 A Crim R 350 applied.Ground 3: Summing up was unbalancedThe summing up on the Crown case fell short of any instruction or direction, which tended to boost the first limb of the prosecution case, which depended upon the appellant having been a principal in the first degree. If anything, the summing up tended to favour the appellant. In addition, the trial judge had earlier provided clear instructions to the jury that they were the judges of the facts and to ignore any view the trial judge offered in that regard. Ground 4: Trial judge failed to give an instruction on an alternative verdict of manslaughterIt does not follow that in every case where murder is charged manslaughter must also be left to the jury. In order for manslaughter to be left the case must be one where there is an evidentiary basis for it. The case fought at trial was one of murder or nothing and the introduction of a possible verdict of manslaughter would have been purely speculative, and potentially disadvantageous to the appellant. Gilbert [2000] HCA 15 distinguished. Schneidas (No. 2) (1981) 4 ACrimR 101 and Van Den Hoek (1986) 16 CLR 158 applied. Ground 5: Trial judge erred in admitting the appellant’s post arrest ERISP into evidence when appellant had indicated he did not want to participate in police interviewIt may be that despite some initial reluctance, a person being interviewed elects to continue with the interview. Each case must be looked at on its facts and by reference to the extent to which there is any unfair pressure placed upon the suspect. Although it would have been preferable to exclude the ERISP, in view of the fact that it did not add to the earlier interviews, its use was adequately dealt with in the summing up, and its admission did not lead to a miscarriage of justice. Kerrie-Anne Clarke NSWCCA 31 October 1997 applied.Ground 6: Trial judge’s directions were erroneous in relation to the liability of the appellant as a principal in the second degree and occasioned a miscarriage of justiceThe second limb of the Crown case was that the appellant was a principal in the second degree. The trial judge’s instructions gave rise to an error of law and occasioned a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. McAuliffe (1995) 79 A Crim R 229; Osland (1998) 197 CLR 316 applied.(a) The instruction given by the trial judge did not sufficiently address the matters required to be proven to establish the liability of the appellant, a case where the defence asserted that his presence at the scene was accidental, that he was unconscious at the time of the shooting, and that he did not provide any encouragement or assistance to the shooter. Coney (1882) 8 QBD 534; Allen (1963) 3 WLR 677; Clarkson 1971 WLR 1402; Georgianni v The Queen (1985) 156 CLR 473 applied. Russell (1933) VLR 59 distinguished.(b) In summing up the trial judge referred to what might be a “reasonable view” as to what a reasonable mind might suppose as to whether the appellant said or did anything to assent to or associate himself with the act of the shooter. This aspect of the summing up introduced a test that was inappropriate and risked diluting the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt.c) The case was one that should properly have been left to the jury, in the way decided in Mohan (1967) 2 AC 187and Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396.ORDERS PROPOSED(1) Appeal against conviction allowed.(2) Conviction and sentence quashed and a new trial ordered.

       JUDGMENT 
       
        
     1   WOOD CJ at CL: The appellant was indicted for the murder of Zi Qiang Jin. At his trial, before Sully J and a Jury, he was convicted of that offence and sentenced to imprisonment for fourteen years, with a non parole period of ten years and nine weeks (taking into account seventeen weeks broken custody pre-sentence). He now appeals against that conviction. 
      
       
      FACTS 
       
     2   It was the Crown case that, at about 9.30pm., on 11 July 1997, the deceased was shot three times while sitting in the front seat of his Suzuki motor vehicle, in an alleyway at Smithfield. From the spent bullet fragments recovered at the scene, and at post mortem, it was contended that two handguns had been used in the shooting. 
     3   One of the bullet wounds, being a relatively shallow wound to the left temple, the expert evidence suggested, would have had a concussive but non fatal effect. The second wound to the back of the neck, which was consistent with having been occasioned by a weapon held up against the deceased’s skin, was one that would have caused him difficulty in breathing and led him to inhale blood. 
     4   The third shot, to the upper central left back, was one that damaged the spinal cord leaving the deceased quadriplegic, and that then penetrated the pleural cavity and lacerated the left carotid artery. It was common ground that the sequence in which the shots had been fired could not be determined. 
     5   The Crown case, in the absence of evidence from any eyewitnesses or admissions, was circumstantial, and rested, as emerges from the summing up, upon the following planks: 
      
      a) the presence of the appellant in the rear seat of the deceased’s Suzuki, at the scene of the shooting; 
       
      b) the three gunshot wounds identified above at least one of which was consistent with having been caused by a shot fired from behind the deceased; 
       
      c) the fact that the .38 lead Smith & Wesson bullet recovered from the head of the deceased, the fragments of .38 special/.357 magnum bullets, and the intact copper jacket bullet recovered from the deceased’s vehicle, which although of similar calibre, were not necessarily interchangeable or capable of being fired by the same weapon thereby suggesting that more than one weapon was used; 
       
       
      d) the discovery of blood spots, consistent with blood from the appellant, around the car of the deceased, said to be consistent with him making his way to a getaway vehicle; 
       
       
      e) the discovery of a finger print of the appellant on the outside of the rear near side door of the deceased’s Suzuki, just above the door lock; 
       
       
      f) the laceration to the forehead of the appellant, which was sutured by Dr. Chae Tien Dat Le on the morning after the shooting; 
       
       
      g) the possession by the appellant of a mobile phone (conveniently referred to as service 0418), from which, telephone records disclosed, a large number of calls had been made to the deceased’s paging service, and which number was included in the deceased’s telephone organiser; 
       
       
      h) lies told by the appellant in various interviews with police, in relation to material matters, said to display a consciousness of guilt; 
      i) the fact that prior to the shooting the deceased received a telephone call at his home requesting him to meet someone, a request with which he reluctantly complied. 
     6   Based upon these circumstances the Crown case against the appellant was pursued upon the primary basis that he was one of the persons who used a weapon to shoot the deceased. Alternatively, its case was pursued upon the basis that he was present as a principal in the second degree, aiding and abetting the shooter or shooters. 
     7   It was the case for the appellant, based on the later ERISPS, in which he voluntarily participated, that although he was present in the alleyway, he knew nothing as to the circumstances of the shooting, since, at the time of its occurrence, he had been unconscious. It was his account, given in an ERISP on 29 March 1999, and again on 6 May 1999, that on the night of the murder he had gone to visit a friend Bao, in Fairfield. Bao drove him to a shop. Bao said that they would wait for a friend. Another car approached and stopped near their vehicle. Upon Bao’s instruction he got into the back of this car which drove into the alleyway, while Bao got into the front passenger seat. A quarrel started between Bao and the driver (the deceased) whereupon the appellant began to get out of the vehicle. The deceased, he said, pointed something at him as he was opening the car door. He heard the noise of a shot and then lost consciousness. He remembered nothing further until he woke up at Bao’s house in the morning, after which he was taken by a friend, Van, to a doctor at Mt. Pritchard for treatment to a head wound. 
     8   The appellant did not give evidence or call any witness. His version of events, accordingly, depended entirely upon the contents of the two ERISPS mentioned which had followed upon earlier interviews with police on 19 August 1997, 13 February 1998, 13 March 1998 and 7 August 1998 (the day of his arrest). In these earlier interviews, it was accepted, assuming the later interviews to have been correct, that he had told a number of lies concerning his presence at the murder scene, the reason for his head wound, his attendance on the doctor Mt. Pritchard on the day after the shooting, and his knowledge of the deceased. 
     9   Apart from relying upon the version of events offered in the later ERISPS, as leaving open a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant had fired any of the three shots, and/or as to whether he was present as a principal in the second degree aiding and abetting whoever it was that fired those shots, the defence relied upon two submissions. 
     10   The first rested upon the argument that the Crown could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that more than one gun was used to fire the three shots, since the slightly larger .38 Smith & Wesson cartridge could have been fired from a poorly made, or worn, .38 special or .357 magnum, even though cartridges of that description would not normally fit such weapons. 
     11   The second proposition depended upon the highly dubious argument that even assuming the appellant to have been conscious, and sitting in the back of the car, the obstruction caused by the Suzuki headrest would have made it impossible for him to have reached around and fired the shot occasioning the wound which I have referred to as wound 3. 
      
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
       
     12   Several of the grounds of appeal are devoid of any merit and they can be dealt with first. 
      
       
      1. Separation of the jury 
       
       
     13   The jury was sent out to consider its verdict on Monday 27 March. At 4.00pm. the foreman indicated that they would like to adjourn their deliberations and return the following morning. His Honour dealt with the matter in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        “That’s fine. You’re excused accordingly until 10 o’clock tomorrow. May I say something to you before you go. Please don’t think it untoward, but I think I ought to do it. There was a time not so long ago when jurors were kept together from the time the trial started until the time it finished. That has been done away with many years since, but there is still provision for the jury to be kept together after the end of the summing-up and while they are considering their verdict. I thought of doing it, but I drew back from it. I thought that after three weeks of the efforts that have been asked of you, that was altogether asking too much. So you will be allowed to disperse tonight and to resume tomorrow at 10 o’clock. 
        
       
       
        
        You would understand, I am sure, but I think I should raise the matter with you specifically, that the Court trusts you in a particular sense not to gossip about the matter outside your own number; not to do anything else at all that might have an impact upon the objectivity and the detachment with which you continue the work upon which you are now embarked in the trial. I don’t doubt for a moment that you understand it, but its an important thing, and so I think it worth while bringing it to your attention in so many words. 
        
       
       
        
        As I said to you before, but it will stand repeating: just keep your counsel to yourselves until you have finished your work, and then its time enough to, shall I say, let some steam off. 
        
       
       
        
        All right. Thank you very much for your assistance throughout the day. We will see you at 10 o’clock tomorrow.” 
        
       
       
     14   No formal order was made. None was requested by counsel, and there was no objection to the jury separating overnight. No question arose of any interference with the jurors or of any untoward event occurring that may have effected their verdict, during the period of separation; 
     15   It was submitted however that the procedure followed, in the absence of a direction expressed in terms of a “formal order”, failed to comply with S 54 of the Jury Act 1977, which provides relevantly: 
      
       
        
        “The jury in criminal proceedings: 
         
         
        a) shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, be permitted to separate at any time before they retire to consider their verdict; and 
         
         
        b) may,  
        if the Court so orders 
         be permitted to separate after they retire to consider their verdict”. 
         
        
       
      The absence of a formal order was said to constitute a fatal procedural irregularity, going to the root of the trial process. 
       
     16   Reliance was placed upon the decisions in Ketteridge (1915) 1KB 467, Maher (1987) 163 CLR 221, and Wu (1999) 199 CLR 99 in support of this argument. 
     17   Ketteridge was a case where the jury expressed a desire to retire to consider their verdict. A court bailiff was sworn and proceeded to conduct the jurors to the jury room. One of the jurors, however, departed alone, left the building, and was then absent for about a quarter of an hour before rejoining his colleagues. It was held, in the circumstances, that the whole proceedings were abortive, and that the conviction returned, following the jury verdict, must be quashed. Lush J, delivering the judgment of the court, said (at 470): 
      
       
        
        “In our opinion it is not necessary or relevant to consider whether the irregularity has in fact prejudiced the prisoner. We refused to consider an explanatory statement which we were told had been made by the juror which would clearly not be admissible in evidence. If a juror, after the judge has summed up, in any criminal trial separates himself from his colleagues, and not being under the control of the Court, converses or is in a position to converse with other persons, it is an irregularity which, in the opinion of the Court, renders the whole proceedings abortive, and the only course open to the Court is to discharge the jury and commence the proceedings afresh.” 
        
       
     18   Maher was a case where a failure to comply with a mandatory provision governing the constitution and authority of the jury, meant that a conviction founded on the verdict could not stand. The relevant failure concerned the addition of counts to the indictment after the jury had been sworn, resulting in a situation in which the jury was asked to try issues on counts which they had not been sworn to try. 
     19   The High Court said (at 233-234): 
      
       
        
        “The provisions of the Jury Act and of the Code which govern the constitution and authority of the jury as the tribunal of fact in a criminal trial are mandatory, for the entitlement to trial by jury which s604 of the Code confirms is trial by a jury constituted in accordance with the Jury Act and authorised by law to try the issues raised by the plea of not guilty. A failure to comply with those provisions may render a trial a nullity, at least in the sense that the conviction produced cannot withstand an appeal: see  
        Crane v Public Prosecutor 
         [1921] 2 AC 299.” 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        The principle is clear. A jury must be sworn to try the issues joined between the Crown and the applicant on a count then appearing in an indictment. Here the jury found the applicant guilty of the offence charged in count 20, though it had not been sworn to try the issues on that count. A conviction founded on that verdict cannot stand. There was a failure to observe the requirements of the criminal process in a fundamental respect.” 
        
       
     20   In Wu, a juror was discharged on the tenth day of the trial after a report was received that the juror was unwell and would probably not be able to attend Court for two days. The trial proceeded to a verdict of the jury constituted by the remaining eleven jurors. No formal order was made to continue the trial with eleven jurors, although the trial judge said to the jury, after discharging the absent juror, “I think time is running on, so we will carry on with eleven”. 
     21   The relevant ground of appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal, and in the High Court, was confined to the correctness of the decision to discharge the absent juror. Leave was sought, but refused in the High Court, to amend the grounds of appeal so as to encompass a suggested irregularity in the continuation of the trial in the absence of a formal order.  
     22   The present case is, in my view, distinguishable from Ketteridge in that the juror’s absence there was contrary to the order which had been made, and from Maher in that the jury had there been asked to return verdicts on counts which they had not been sworn to try.  
     23   This Court recently had occasion to consider in the appeal of Radju [2001] NSWCCA 103, the point specifically raised by this ground, in the light of the obiter dicta in Wu concerning the Jury Act requirements for orders for the continuation of a trial with less than twelve jurors, and for the separation of jurors after they have retired to consider their verdict. 
     24   While the desirability of such matters being the subject of formal orders was noted, the Court recognised that the circumstances and manner in which any such questions were dealt with may give rise to implied orders which would meet the requirements of the Act. 
     25   In Hura [2001] NSWCCA 61, this Court also accepted, in the context of the finding of guilt consequent upon a plea, required by S91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, that such a finding could be implied, and that the Section should not be given so formal an interpretation as to require a finding made in express terms. 
     26   While for the reasons expressed in Radju, it would have been preferable for an order to have been made in express terms in the present case, his Honour clearly gave consideration to the question whether the jurors should be allowed to separate, and then announced that they could do so. In those circumstances, I am of the view, similarly to that reached in Radju, that his Honour’s remarks may be treated as amounting to an implied order under s54 of the Act. This ground has not been made good. 
      
       
       
      PROSECUTOR’S STATEMENT TO THE JURY 
       
     27   This ground relates to an observation by the Crown Prosecutor, in his closing address, concerning the phone messages that had been placed to the deceased through his pager, and the circumstances that may have lead to his shooting, as follows:  
      
       
        
        “But the interesting thing about it is, whenever the phone was used to contact Mr. Jin, it wasn’t a message to call Mr. Bao Pham, call Mr. Phan, call Mr. Tran. It was “call Mr 22”. Or “phone 22”. … Now, when you look at these messages to Mr. Jin and when you consider the evidence of his mother that he wasn’t a particularly nice boy and the sister-in-law didn’t have much regard for him at all, …..  
        Most probably these calls related to most likely some sort of improper business 
        . I don’t know what it was. But anybody who is going to shoot you in relation to it is going to be pretty significant. It wasn’t a dispute about whether you are going to open up a pizza shop next door. It wasn’t a dispute about whether or not your television is too loud. Whatever it is these people were involved  
        in very, very serious business 
         and whatever very serious business it was,  
        I mean you may think it was drugs or something  
        else. We don’t know from this but whatever it was somebody thought it was serious enough to shoot him three times.  
        
       
       
        
        … whether they - whether Mr. Bao and the deceased had a business relationship with one another, whether they had a friendly relationship, we don’t know, but what we do know, assuming it was Mr. Bao’s phone whatever it was they had a significant and long lasting relationship of some manner. 
        
       
       
        
        Now if you were to decide that Mr. Jin was a bad person and if you were to decide that Mr. Bao was a bad person, you can’t use that inference of what you decide to say because of that the accused is a bad person, he must have done something. You have to look at all of the evidence and decide whether or not the accused is guilty. You shouldn’t use and you can’t and his Honour will tell you, you can’t say, Mr. Bao is a bad person so I convict Mr. Phan, convict the accused, or because the deceased was a bad person I convict the accused. You can only convict the accused if on the available evidence you find him guilty.” 
        
       
       
     28   An application by trial counsel for a discharge of the jury, based upon these observations and two other observations of lesser significance, was refused, upon the basis that the matter could be dealt with by a direction in the summing up. His Honour in due course instructed the jury, in the following terms, in relation to the italicised passages: 
      
       
        
         “Now, ladies and gentlemen, that’s very dangerous material if you do not think about it carefully: “Most probably these calls related to most likely some sort of improper business”. Why? You must ask that carefully. There is absolutely no evidence to suggest it.  
        
       
       
        
        Again, forgive me if I repeat what I said to you on Friday: the drawing of a rational inference is something above and beyond intelligent guesswork and intelligent speculation of any other kind. “I do not know what it was” said the Crown. Quite right. Nobody else knows what it was either; if indeed it was something untoward to begin with. 
        
       
       
        
        “‘I mean, you may think it was drugs or something else’” Not on the evidence in this case. There is absolutely nothing. There is not a scintilla of evidence in this case that would entitle you to come to any conclusion of that kind. Not a scintilla. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, you understand I have not the faintest idea of what impact those submissions made upon you or any of you when you heard them on, when was it, Wednesday I think, of last week. But, for all I know, they might have made a very significant subliminal impact on you. If that is the case, then it is time you reined that impact in, well and truly, in accordance with the observations that I have just made. 
        
       
       
        
        I say again, there is absolutely no evidence at all to support the speculative propositions put in this part of the arguments that were addressed to you last week.” 
        
       
       
        
       
     29   The Crown Prosecutor’s observation was both careless and imprudent. In the absence of any evidence as to motivation that subject should have been left unaddressed. The floating of a possible reason for the shooting and of the existence of some improper or unlawful course of dealings between the parties, almost inevitably, would have occurred to the jury as a possibility, and it did not need any encouragement from the Prosecutor. Particularly was this so in the absence of any evidentiary basis providing either a direct or inferential basis for it. 
     30   It is important that the office of prosecutor not be used to tell the jury that which is not supported by the evidence: Callaghan (1993) 70 ACrimR 350. 
     31   It is a matter of common sense that shootings of the kind here involved are not normally motiveless, even though a motive may not be capable of ascertainment, and even though it is not essential for the Crown to prove one. I am, however, of the view that the Crown Prosecutor’s observation, while totally inappropriate, was sufficiently dealt with by the explicit and strong direction given to the jury. Accordingly, I am not persuaded that this ground was made good. 
      
       
      COMMENT IN SUMMING UP CONCERNING THE TWO LIMBS OF THE PROSECUTION CASE 
       
     32   After summarising the manner in which the Crown pursued the second limb of its case, his Honour observed:  
      
       
        
         “You might think, but again it is a matter for you; you heard the submissions that were put and may well have formed your own view - that the Crown case on this second approach is, if I may say it without doing violence to the way in which the case was presented, very much a fall-back position. You might think that the Crown’s case at the end of the day really is the case that it argued on the first limb, that the evidence as a whole, when one looks at it, justifies a conclusion, reached in the way that I have explained to you, that the accused did in fact fire one of the shots. 
        
       
       
        
        If you were not to accept that, then it seems to me - but I have to say with every proper emphasis that it is not a matter in the end for me but for you - you would have to think long and hard, I would have thought,  
        before you could turn away from rejecting the first limb of the Crown case and find yourselves persuaded and beyond reasonable doubt on the second limb of it.” 
        
       
     33   The section in italics, it was submitted, amounted to an erroneous instruction so far as it tended to support in a subtle way, the first limb of the prosecution case, thereby creating an imbalance in the summing up. 
     34   There are two answers to this submission. First, when read in its full context, the emphasis was not on boosting the first limb of the Crown case, but rather to suggest that, if that limb was not made good, then it was unlikely that the alternative limb would attract any greater favour with the jury. So understood the comment of his Honour fell well short of an instruction or direction, that tended to boost the first limb of the prosecution case. If anything, it tended to favour the appellant.  
     35   The second answer is provided by the fact that in clear and explicit terms, his Honour had earlier made it clear to the jury that they were the judges of the facts, and that they were to ignore any view he offered in that regard, whether expressly or by implication, unless it happened to coincide with their own independently formed view. Within the confines of that instruction, his Honour was entitled to comment upon the facts and upon the way the Crown case was put, which it would seem placed a good deal of weight upon the evidence suggestive of two shooters having been involved, and of at least one shot having been fired from the rear seat of the vehicle, in which the appellant had been seated. 
     36   This ground is accordingly not made good. Before departing from it, I would observe that, in a case where the Crown could not prove who, of several persons present and acting in concert at the time of the shooting, fired the fatal shot, the second limb of the case would have been the more appropriate way for it to be left to the jury: Mohan (1967) 2 AC 187 and Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396. In those circumstances, since proof that the fatal shot had been fired by the appellant from the rear seat depended upon inference, it would have been preferable for any emphasis that was thought to be appropriate, to have been placed upon the second limb rather than the first. 
      
       
      ABSENCE OF MANSLAUGHTER DIRECTION 
       
     37   His Honour did not give any instruction to the jury in relation to an alternative verdict of manslaughter. It is now submitted that such a direction should have been given for the reasons expressed by Lord Tucker in Ballard (1957) AC 635 at 644: 
      
       
        
        “Every man on trial for murder has the right to have the issue of manslaughter left to the jury  
        if there is evidence upon which such a verdict can be given 
        . To deprive him of this right must of necessity constitute a grave miscarriage of justice and it is idle to speculate what verdict the jury would have reached.” 
        
       
     38   Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the High Court in Gilbert [2000] HCA 15 where the majority (Gleeson CJ and Gummow J in a joint judgment, and Callinan J; McHugh and Hayne JJ dissenting) accepted that the fact of conviction of a greater offence is not always a good answer to a complaint of failure to direct the jury, in relation to the availability of a verdict of guilty of a lesser offence. It does not, however, follow from the reasoning of the majority, that in every case where murder is charged, manslaughter must also be left, perchance the jury might, contrary to the evidence and the directions given, and either out of perversity or out of a sense of mercy, elect to find the accused guilty of manslaughter. This decision is, in my view, to be understood in the context of its special facts, that is, as a case where in accordance with the law as later clarified, the jury having raised the question of manslaughter, were then erroneously instructed in relation to it. 
     39   In order for manslaughter to be left, it appears to me, that the case must be one where there is an evidentiary basis for it, for example evidence that raises for consideration provocation or diminished responsibility, or where it is a case in which, absent proof of the specific state of mind required for murder, the act of the accused might answer the description of an unlawful and dangerous act. 
     40   The present case was wholly circumstantial, the only direct evidence concerning the events at the scene of the shooting being that which emerged from the two later records of interview. The account there given was incomplete in the sense that, if the appellant was to be believed, his involvement effectively ceased at the point where he was rendered unconscious while exiting the motor vehicle of the deceased. 
     41   It was the defence case, based on these ERISPS of March and May 1999, that the appellant had no inkling of what was to occur at the meeting with the deceased, was not party to any concert or understanding with Bao, did not himself shoot the deceased, was not there as an aider or abettor, and simply did not know what occurred after he lost consciousness. In those circumstances, his case was one of non involvement in any activity that could have seen him guilty of either murder or manslaughter. 
     42   The jury was faced with contradictory versions from the appellant, in the earlier ERISPS, concerning his presence at the scene, and concerning whether he suffered a head injury that night which was then treated upon the following day. It may be accepted that, by their verdict the jury found that the admitted lies of the appellant, in combination with the other circumstantial evidence, were such as left them satisfied of his guilt of murder. The appellant, however, now submits that the accounts given by him, in the March and May interviews, raised the possibility that Bao shot the deceased either in defence of himself or of the appellant. Had that possibility been drawn to the attention of the jury, so it was submitted, even thought it was in truth an acquittal point (Zecevic (1987) 162 CLR 645), a possibility remains that they would have dismissed self defence, but nevertheless returned a verdict of manslaughter, by reason of the act of Bao or of himself having been unlawful and dangerous. 
     43   As I have observed, this was not the way in which the case was fought at trial, and it involves a chain of reasoning that is at best tenuous. Leaving aside the fact that self defence is also a defence to manslaughter, there was an absence of any evidence of any firearm having been found in the car, or of the deceased having himself discharged such a weapon, or of having behaved in a way that might have been seen to be threatening or provocative. 
     44   The case was fought at trial on the more narrow basis which I have previously mentioned, namely one of murder or nothing. In the context of this trial, the introduction of a possible verdict of manslaughter in the way explained would have been purely speculative and not something for which there would have been a valid basis on the evidence: Schneidas (No.2) (1981) 2 NSWLR 311 and Van Den Hoek (1986) 161 CLR 158. In summary, the case was not one where there was any reasonable possibility of the lesser verdict of guilty of manslaughter being open. There was, therefore, no occasion for it to have been left. Indeed, it might have been disadvantageous to the appellant to have done so, in case the jury, not being certain of his role, nevertheless thought it likely that he had been up to no good, and hence should be convicted of some lesser offence than that charged. This is a consideration that is more than apparent to experienced defence counsel, and respect does need to be given to forensic decisions not to raise manslaughter as a possibility, when made in the environment of the trial. 
     45   I am accordingly not persuaded that there was a risk of miscarriage of justice by reason of the absence of any direction as to manslaughter. 
      
       
      ADMISSION INTO EVIDENCE OF THE ERISP OF 7 AUGUST 1998 
       
     46   It was submitted that his Honour erred in admitting into evidence this ERISP, over objection, since it occurred at a time when the appellant was in custody, and in circumstances where he had indicated to police that he did not wish to participate in it. The transcript of he ERISP reveals the following exchange with the interviewing police: 
      
       
        
        “Q4 Do you agree prior to the commencement of this record of interview I told you that I intended to ask you some further questions about this matter. A. (Interpreter) You can ask but I don’t know anything.” 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        “Q.20 And putting it simply that is that you did, did maliciously murder Zi Qiang Jin. Do you agree that you spoke to your legal representative, Due Vu, on the telephone earlier tonight? A. (Interpreter) What did I say. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.21 Do, do you agree that you spoke to your legal representative on the telephone? A.(Interpreter) yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. 22 And he gave you certain advice? A.(Interpreter) No, he didn’t give me anything. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. 23 Did he, he didn’t tell you anything? Did he tell you anything? A.(Interpreter) He said, yes, but he said to give the police detective blood? 
        
       
       
        
        Q.24 so, is it true to say that he has indicated, that is your legal representative, that, or has advised you to give blood? A. (Interpreter) He said, Did you say anything to his solicitor? And the solicitor advised him to give blood. 
        
       
       
        
        Q, 25 In relation to police speaking to you, what, did he give you any advice? A. (Interpreter) He advised me not to, not to have the audio recording. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. 26 So you’re indicating that, I’ll withdraw that. Do you wish to participate In this electronic interview” A. (Interpreter) No I don’t want to participate. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. 27 I understand what you’ve told me and I’m intending to ask some certain questions and you can act according to, you can act according to the advice you’ve been given. A. (Interpreter) My solicitor didn’t, didn’t give any, any advice at all. He just, that’s what all he said to me or advised me.” 
        
       
       
     47   Notwithstanding those answers, the police asked the appellant a number of questions which he answered, in the course of which he said that he had never known the deceased (“Q.31), that he did not remember where he had been on the day of the shooting (Q.36), that he did not know how his fingerprint got on to the motor vehicle of the deceased (Q.86), that he did not remember if he had ever touched a vehicle described as a “white Suzuki”, and that he did not know if he had ever been in an “unknown laneway, next to Duglen Street Smithfield, in July 1997” (Q.88) A number of other questions of a more formal nature, or of no particular significance were asked, but they were of no moment, for present purposes. 
     48   In Ireland 126 CLR 321 at 333, Barwick CJ noted that: 
      
       
        
        “It was improper for police investigating the commission of a crime to persist in questioning a suspect after an indication that he did not wish to answer any more questions”. 
        
       
     49   Sully J, in his reasons for judgment on the voir dire, held that the conduct of the police in pursuing the interview after the appellant’s indication that he did not wish to participate in it, was improper. However, he declined to exercise the discretion which fell to be exercised under s 138 of the Evidence Act to exclude the interview, finding the impropriety to not have been “deliberate or reckless”. Additionally, his Honour found that the tape did not suggest to him that the interviewing police “browbeat, overbore or in any way sought to dominate the will of the appellant”. Further, his Honour observed that the appellant presented as being “laconic, self possessed and perfectly capable of understanding with the assistance of the interpreter ... what was being said to him; and of responding relevantly, and with the same assistance, in whatever way he wished to do”. 
     50   His Honour found that this was not a case where the appellant had been cross examined or badgered, in the face of a clear and consistent stance, that he did not wish to be interviewed. His Honour held, in effect, that the impropriety involved was outweighed by the desirability of admitting the evidence, observing in this regard: 
      
       
        
         
        “The evidence in question has, it is agreed on all sides, probative value of real substance. The material in the interview is capable, at least on one view of it, of manifesting lies told, in the requisite legal sense, so as to permit of the drawing of an inference of consciousness of guilt of the crime actually charged.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      and further that: 
       
        
        “I think that it suffices to say that insofar as what was done might be thought to have been improper in a relevant sense, the impropriety was not deliberate or reckless, and was not so grave as to entail that evidence having the potential importance of the evidence here in question should be excluded.” 
        
       
       
        
       
     51   The admissibility of an interview conducted in the face of an indication, by the interviewee, that he does not wish to be interviewed, needs to be considered not only in the light of s 138 but also in the light of s 90 of the Evidence Act. Although no express reference was made to this provision, his Honour did give careful attention to various technical breaches of the procedure laid down in Part 10A of the Crimes Act 1900, and in the Crimes (Detention After Arrest) Regulation 1998. A substantial, although imperfect, compliance with these provisions was found. Such failure to comply with the relevant requirements was described by his Honour as “not a simple and contumelious disregard” of them.  
     52   When his Honour came to deal with this interview in the summing up, he referred to only three questions and answers of relevance to the shooting, before observing in relation to it:  
      
       
        
        “You should just bear this in mind in connection with this particular record of interview; not in any extreme or extravagant sense, but with a little prudence and balance. 
        
       
       
        
        When a person in the position of the accused, whose first language is not English, who is dealing through an interpreter, who has had legal advice, I think one might fairly infer, from a solicitor Mr Duc Vu, who in whatever way, was able to communicate with him and give him advice, and the advice is that he does not want - a reasonable inference is that the advice is that he does not want to participate, you have got to bear these things in mind carefully. He is entitled not to participate. There is no rule of law that says that if the police want to interrogate you at all, never mind in the form of a formal record of interview, that you must take part; and you are perfectly entitled to say “I do not wish to answer any questions”. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
         
         
        “If thereupon the police continue to press you with questions without having first established clearly that you are content upon reflection to change your mind and to answer what they want to ask - your solicitor from whom you got the advice not being, as I understand the fact, present - it is worth considering whether what you say is to be held against you in quite as stark a fashion as might have been justified if you had been willingly taking part had your solicitor been there, and you knew what you were doing. 
        
       
       
        
        Again, please understand those are observations which you are free to take up or not as you prefer, but they seem to be matters of fairness and common sense. I do not say that you simply brush it aside; not at all. It is there as part of the evidence. But when you are assessing and deciding what weight to give to it, one thing - bear in mind not the only thing, not the most decisive thing - to bear in mind is that earlier in the piece he said he did not want to participate, and other questions were then asked of him searchingly and repeatedly in the face of that.” 
        
       
       
        
       
     53   These observations do not sit particularly comfortably with the reasons for judgment upon the voir dire. That is however probably explicable upon the basis that the significance of this ERISP had been viewed, by all concerned, somewhat differently earlier in the trial, and upon the further basis that, when carefully examined, it did no more than repeat some of the lies that had earlier been told.  
     54   There is no absolute rule that an interview conducted in the face of an objection by a suspect, or continued in the face of an indication that he or she does not wish to participate any further in it, should be rejected if tendered in evidence. This was made clear in Kerrie-Anne Clarke NSWCCA 31 October 1997, when Hunt CJ at CL said: 
      
       
        
        “It should be kept in mind that a police officer is under a duty to ascertain the facts which bear upon the commission of a crime, whether from the suspect or not, and the officer is not bound to accept the first answer given; questioning is not to be regarded as unfair merely because it is persistent. [19] It is a question of degree as to whether persistence has crossed the line so as to render it unfair to use the answers in evidence. [20] No doubt the evidence will inevitably be excluded if there is any suggestion of intimidation, persistent importunity or sustained or undue insistence or pressure. [21]” 
        
       
     55   Smart J similarly observed: 
      
       
        
        “It is not uncommon for an accused to intimate that he does not wish to answer any questions and then to decide to answer some questions or to make a statement or explanation. There may be something in a police statement or summary of the situation which the accused regards as wrong and needs correction or something which needs explanation. There are many possibilities. It would be unwise to hold that every time an accused states that he does not want to answer questions, some further questions are put and answers are given or explanations or statements made such answers, statements or explanations are inadmissible. Everything depends on the circumstances.” 
        
       
     56   In an appropriate case, it may well be that despite some initial reluctance, the person interviewed may elect to continue with the interview, and even see an advantage in providing further information with a view to dispelling doubts, or answering matters which may give rise to suspicion. Any apparent impropriety in continuing to question a suspect may turn out, in those circumstances, to be of such little weight as not to justify exclusion of the ERISP as evidence. Each case must be determined upon its own facts, and in particular by reference to the extent to which there is any unfair pressure placed upon the person being interviewed, or unfair advantage taken of his position, for example because of his age, vulnerability, lack of familiarity with the English language and so on. Moreover, in any weighing exercise the probative value of the evidence needs to be taken into account. 
     57   The ERISP was of relevance so far as it was the one that followed immediately upon his arrest, and was also one that the Crown relied upon as continuing the pattern of lies that could be seen in the earlier interviews. Upon the other hand, it did not add any fresh “lie”, ie it did not raise any matter that had not emerged in the earlier interviews, which was then relied upon as a further lie displaying a consciousness of guilt. 
     58   In the light of its limited probative value, and the appellant’s acknowledgment that he had told lies to the police, and in the light of the way that the interview was down-played in the summing up, I am of the view that it would have been preferable, with the advantage of hindsight for it to have been excluded. I am not, however, persuaded that its admission led to any risk of a miscarriage of justice having been occasioned. This ground has not been made good. 
      
       
      DIRECTION AS TO THE SECOND LIMB OF THE CROWN CASE 
       
     59   The Crown case was opened, and pursued, on the basis that the appellant was guilty of murder either because he fired one of the three shots (first limb); or, if he did not fire any of those shots, then upon the basis that he was guilty of murder because he was present as an accessory, encouraging or assisting the principal offender, or being ready to provide encouragement and assistance if needed (p.16 of opening address, and p.680 of the trial transcript). 
     60   It remained the Crown case at all times in relation to this second limb, that the appellant was a principal in the second degree. In a written instruction (mfi 24) given to the jury by his Honour, they were informed: 
      
       
        
        “ 
        The second approach 
         cannot succeed unless the Crown proves to your satisfaction and beyond reasonable doubt  
        all 
         of the following matters: 
         
         
        1. the death by shooting of Mr. Jin. 
         
         
        2. that the accused, although he cannot be shown to have fired himself any one or more of the three gunshots, can be shown to have been present when they were fired  
        and 
         can be shown to have said or done something that indicated  
        his willing assent 
         to what was being done. 
         
         
        3. that the accused, in so indicating  
        his assent 
         to what was being done, intended at that time that Mr. Jin should either be killed or have inflicted upon him some form of grievous bodily harm.” 
        
       
     61   When his Honour dealt with this in the summing up he said (at p.36) 
      
       
        
        “If the Crown cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused fired one or more of the shots, then it has to prove, if it is to succeed on this approach, and prove beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused, although he cannot be shown to have fired himself any one or more of the three gunshots, can be shown to have been present when they were fired, and - please note the “and” is in bold type. All these things must be brought together - the Crown has to show beyond reasonable doubt that he was present at the time the shots were fired, and said or did something that  
        indicated his willing assent 
         to what was being done. 
        
       
       
        
        You do not become vulnerable to conviction for murder because you happen to be present at the scene where somebody is murdered. What makes you vulnerable is that you are not only there when the murder is committed, but that you are therein some capacity, doing or saying something that  
        on a reasonable view associates 
         you with what is being done although you are not doing it yourself. 
        
       
       
        
       
     62   His Honour repeated this direction, although with a slight variation (at 122-123): 
      
       
        
        “In that event, the second approach that the Crown puts forward is, in essence, perfectly simple. It is this. The accused, it is argued, if he did not actually fire one of the shots, was there when the shots were fired; was not unconscious, but was conscious and aware of what was happening; and said or did something of  
        which a reasonable mind 
         would conclude that it  
        associated him deliberately 
         with what was being done - one must assume it was by Mr. Bao Pham, who is the only other person who is likely to have fired the shots, on the evidence as it stands at the moment.” 
        
       
     63   No correction of these directions was sought, but on appeal, it was argued that they were erroneous and occasioned a miscarriage of justice, in that: 
      
      a) there was an insufficient explanation concerning the need for a concert or understanding between the appellant, and whoever it was who shot the deceased, that they would kill him or inflict grievous bodily harm upon him:  
      McAuliffe 
       (1995) 79 A Crim R 229 (CCA) and (1995) 183 CLR 108 (HC); and 
       
       
      b) the direction, so far as it was predicated upon whether something was done or said by the appellant which a “ 
      reasonable mind would conclude 
       …  
      associated himself deliberately 
        
      with” 
       what was being done by the shooter, or upon whether he did or said something that “ 
      on a reasonable view” associated him with 
       what was being done by that person, was erroneous so far as it invited an objective view, and posed a test falling short of the criminal standard.  
       
     64   The first of these submissions was framed by reference to the doctrine of common purpose. The distinction between “common purpose” and “joint criminal enterprise” is not always respected, having regard to the way in which these terms, and the related terms “common design” and “concert” are very often used interchangeably: see Stokes & Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25; Tangye NSWCCA 10 April 1997; McAuliffe and Osland (1988) 197 CLR 316 per McHugh J at paras 69 to 95.  
     65   The present case, so far as the second limb was concerned, was not one of common purpose strictly speaking in which it was alleged that the parties agreed to commit a particular crime but had in contemplation some further crime, as a possible incident of its commission, cf Johns (1979) 143 CLR 108. Rather it was a case, if anything, of common enterprise in which the parties to it were each active participants and hence liable as principals in the first degree, or one where the crown being unable to prove which of several persons, present at the scene of a crime, committed the particular act giving rise to the offence, nevertheless was able to establish that each was assisting the other, in which event it was properly left as one of principal and accessory: Mohan (1967) 2 AC 187 and Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396. 
     66   The distinction between those various categories of case was carefully drawn by McHugh J in Osland in the paragraphs mentioned above, and it is an important distinction for the reasons mentioned later. 
     67   The alternative case was one which was properly presented by the Crown as one in which the appellant was a principal in the second degree (Mohan), rather than a principal in the first degree (Lowery and King No.2) (1972) VR 560.  
     68   It needs to be borne in mind that the liability of a principal in the first degree is primary (Osland at para 72) and is not derived from that of another principal, while that of a principal in the second degree is derivative and depends upon the guilt of the principal in the first degree being established; Dunn (1930) 30 SR (NSW) 210 and Osland at p 71. 
     69   Moreover, mere acquiescence or assent to a crime does not make a person liable as a principal in the second degree. What was needed in such a case is proof that the principal in the second degree was linked in purpose with the person actually committing the crime, and was by his or her words or conduct doing something to bring about, or rendering more likely, through encouragement or assistance, its commission. 
     70   In Coney (1882) 8 QBD 534, Hawkins J, at 557-558 identified the essential requirement for such a case in the following passage: 
      
       
        
        ""In my opinion, to constitute an aider and abettor some active steps must be taken by word, or action, with the intent to instigate the principal, or principals. Encouragement does not of necessity amount to aiding and abetting, it may be intentional or unintentional, a man may unwittingly encourage another in fact by his presence, by misinterpreted words, or gestures, or by his silence, or non-interference, or he may encourage intentionally by expressions, or gestures, or actions intended to signify approval. In the latter case he aids and abets, in the former he does not. It is no criminal offence to stand by, a mere passive spectator of a crime, even of a murder. Non-interference to prevent a crime is not itself a crime. But the fact that a person was voluntarily and purposely present witnessing the commission of a crime, and offered no opposition to it, though he might reasonably be expected to prevent and had the power so to do, or at least to express his dissent, might under some circumstances, afford cogent evidence upon which a jury would be justified in finding that he wilfully encouraged and so aided and abetted. But it would be purely a question for the jury whether he did so or not.""  
         
        
       
     71   Cave J, in the same case, said at 539: 
      
       
       “Now it is a general rule in the case of principals in the second degree that there must be participation in the act, and that, although a man is present whilst a felony is being committed, if he takes no part in it, and does not act in concert with those who commit it, he will not be a principal in the second degree merely because he does not endeavour to prevent the felony or apprehend the felon.” 
        
        
       
     72   Similarly, in  Allen (1963) 3 WLR 677, Edmund Davies J said at 683: 
      
       
        
        “…before a jury can properly convict an accused person of being a principal in the second degree to an affray, they must be convinced by the evidence that, at the very least, he by some means or other encouraged the participants. To hold otherwise would be, in effect … to convict a man on his thoughts, unaccompanied by any physical act other than the fact of his mere presence.” 
         
        
       
     73   In Clarkson 1971 WLR 1402, where Megaw LJ similarly pointed out (at 1405) that “non-accidental presence at the scene of the crime is not conclusive of aiding and abetting”; See also Roughley 78 A Crim R 160 at 162, per Cox J. 
     74   It is true that in Russell (1933) VLR 59, Cussen ACJ observed p 66: 
      
       
        
        “I am of the opinion: (1) that if a person present at the commission of a crime in the opinion of the jury on sufficient evidence shows his assent to such commission; he is guilty as principal, and (2) that assent may in some cases be properly found in the absence of dissent, or in the absence of what may be called effective dissent….” 
         
         
        … 
        
       
       
      and, at p 68: 
       
        
         
        “Silence in some circumstances amounts to acquiescence and gives consent.” 
        
       
       
         
       
     75   These observations were, however, made in the context of the particular facts of the case in which the accused was charged as a principal in the second degree when he refrained from intervening while his wife drowned herself and her children. In the light of the special relationship which existed between them, his acquiescence or silence was properly capable of being understood as encouragement. 
     76   That there is no general principle by which assent or acquiescence, without more, will give rise to liability can, also, be seen from the decision in Georgianni v The Queen (1985) 156 CLR 473 where Mason J said, at 493: 
      
       
        
        “In felony at common law the terms ""aid"" and ""abet"" are generally used to refer to the conduct of a principal in the second degree, or one who is present at the commission of the offence by the principal offender, while the terms ""counsel"" or ""procure"" are generally used in relation to the conduct of an accessory before the fact, or one who is absent at the time of the commission of the offence: 4 Bl Comm 34-36; Ferguson v Weaving [1951] 1 KB 814 at 818-819. In substance, however, there appears to be no distinction between a principal in the second degree and an accessory before the fact beyond the question of presence. In misdemeanour, where no attempt has been made to classify the parties to an offence, each of the four terms is employed to refer to the conduct of a secondary participant. But the terms are descriptive of a single concept. In this regard, I would adopt the observation of Cussen ACJ in Russell [1933] VLR 59 at 67, as being applicable to secondary participation in misdemeanour. Having listed various words, including ""aiding"" and ""abetting"" which have been used to refer to the conduct of a principal in the second degree in felony, his Honour observed: 
        
       
       
         
        
        ""All the words abovementioned are, I think, instances of one general idea, that the person charged as a principal in the second degree is in some way linked in purpose with the person actually committing the crime, and is by his words or conduct doing something to bring about, or rendering more likely, such commission.""  
        
       
     77   Moreover, in Georgianni, the Court made it clear that the principal in the second degree must actually know that the crime is being committed or will be committed. 
     78   To that extent, the non accidental presence of the appellant and his acquiescence in or assent to what occurred would not be enough, unless it was also made clear that the Crown had to establish that such assent or acquiescence amounted to that degree of encouragement or assistance as would constitute him a principal in the second degree. 
     79   It would have been preferable for his Honour to have directed the jury in the precise way discussed in Mohan and Clough. It would also have been preferable for attention to have been directed to the mental element of each person who was involved in the shooting, as discussed in McAuliffe, Osland and Georgianni. 
     80   Of greater importance, however, was the introduction into the oral summing up of the reference to what might be perceived upon “a reasonable view”, or what a “reasonable mind” might perceive, as to whether the appellant said or did anything to assent to or to associate himself with the act of the shooter. 
     81   It may well be that a particular fact or element of a crime may be perceived by a jury as something that upon a reasonable view was present, or as something which a reasonable mind might conclude was present. However, that is not the same as saying that such a matter has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Another possibility, even a contradictory possibility, may also be available as a “reasonable view” or as something which a “reasonable mind” could perceive as open. 
     82   The problem in this regard needs to be considered in the context that this was a circumstantial case in which the jury had to draw inferences. A critical inference, for a conviction of the appellant based upon the second limb, was his non accidental presence as an aider and abettor, in the way explained above. Unless that inference was the only rational inference available, then the proper verdict would have been one of acquittal: Shepherd (1990) 170 CLR 573 and Clarke (1995) 78 A Crim R 226. 
     83   The oral directions did not deal with this critical aspect. They introduced a test that was inappropriate and that risked diluting the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt. His Honour had earlier in his summing up given an instruction to the jury which was correct in law, as to circumstantial proof, and although the written directions did not contain the offending passages, they do need to be regarded as subservient to the specific directions given at this point of the summing up, or at least subject to any qualification introduced thereby. 
     84   In these circumstances I am of the view that the instructions given concerning the second limb gave rise to an error of law and to a risk of a miscarriage of justice.  
     85   I am not persuaded that the jury would inevitably have been convicted upon the basis of the first limb of the case, since it was classically a case of the kind considered in Mohan and Clough, in which the Crown could not prove which of Bao and the appellant fired the fatal shots. Particularly was it necessary to turn to the second limb, and to direct the jury with some precision as to what was required to establish the criminal liability of the appellant as a principal in the second degree, since it was his case that he was there as an accidental participant who had no knowledge of what was to occur, who played no intentional part in the shooting, and who provided no encouragement or assistance. 
     86   The case is not therefore appropriate for an application of the proviso. I would accordingly allow this ground of appeal, quash the conviction and sentence, and order a new trial. 
     87   McCLELLAN J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL. 
     88   SMART AJ: The facts and the background are set out in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL with which I agree. I wish to add few comments. One of the problems in the present case was that the Crown appeared to put the prosecution case in slightly different ways. 
     89   In his opening speech the prosecutor said to the jury (T 16 of 6/3/00): 
      
       
        
        ""In relation to this trial you will have to decide one of two things. You will have to decide whether or not the accused pulled the trigger or whether he was there present knowing that someone - knowing that the gun was going to be fired and knowing that Mr Jin was going to be attacked and he was there available to help him whether or not he fired that bullet …"". 
        
       
     90   That was a curious way to open the Crown case. Rightly understood, the Crown case was that both Bao Pham and the appellant were present in the car when the deceased was shot dead. Three shots were fired. Either one of the men fired all three shots or each man fired one or more shots. At least one of the shots killed the deceased. If the jury was not satisfied that the accused fired one of the shots that did not matter so long as they were satisfied that both the men were present, with one or both of them firing the shots and the other aiding and abetting. As Hunt J pointed out in Stokes & Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 23 at 35, even if the Crown had been unable to establish which one of the two co-offenders was responsible for inflicting the injury it would still have been a classic case of each of them aiding and abetting the other: Mohan [1967] 2 AC 187 at 195. In Mohan the evidence established that the two co-offenders were present and attacked the deceased. The Crown could not say who struck the fatal blow. Hunt J further explained: 
      
       
        
        ""The ratio of that case is that a person who is present, aiding and abetting another in the commission of crime is guilty of that crime as an accessory even in the absence of any pre-arranged plan. That ratio does not depend upon the fact that each of the accused in that particular case was physically attacking the deceased. It would be equally applicable where the finding of aiding and abetting is available from other conduct"". 
        
       
     91   It is a pity that the prosecutor did not open the prosecution relying on the principles of Mohan, Stokes & Difford and Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396. The judge's attention was not drawn to these authorities and the principle they supported. 
     92   At the start of his closing speech the prosecutor stated that the Crown case had both a short form and a more complicated form. The short form was that the deceased was murdered by being shot three times. The evidence against the appellant was that he was in the car behind the deceased and in a position to fire the shots. The prosecutor said: 
      
       
        
        “The only issue is … whether or not when he was sitting in the back seat behind the deceased … he was the one who fired the gun"". 
        
       
     93   The prosecutor next referred to the more complex form of the Crown case, contending that it led to the same conclusion of guilt. The prosecutor analysed and discussed the evidence at some length. His address took the best part of a day. In the latter part of his address the prosecutor said: 
      
       
        
        ""On the Crown case, it could very well be that Mr Bao shot the deceased one or more than one times. It's clear from the way the evidence is that he could very well especially have fired the shot into his temple"". 
        
       
     94   The prosecutor, after refuting the suggestion that the deceased was the one doing some shooting, contended that the appellant was trying to protect Bao Pham: 
      
       
        
        ""Why is the accused trying to protect Mr Bao here? The only possible reason is because he and Mr Bao were there together. They were there together in relation to shooting the deceased. There is nothing else … open on the evidence. Whether Mr Bao fired all three shots, or whether the accused fired all three shots or whether it was a combination of both of them, it doesn't really make any difference. It doesn't make any difference if the accused didn't fire any shots, or if you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt whether he fired any shots. On the evidence its clear they were there together and one of the reasons you can be sure why they were there together … is because the accused is lying about the whole thing"". 
        
       
       
        
       
     95   In this passage the prosecutor was adopting or close to adopting the kind of approach envisaged in Mohan, Stokes & Difford and Clough.  The matter was not put in those terms in the prosecutor's opening speech. 
     96   At the end of the prosecutor's closing speech the judge enquired of him whether he wanted the case to go to the jury ""on the principal in the first and principal in the second"". The prosecutor replied, ""I do"". 
     97   In his closing speech counsel for the appellant contended that the Crown was having a two-way bet (T689). However counsel revealed his understanding of the Crown case, stating (T689): 
      
       
        
        ""[The prosecutor] said you will have to decide one of two things: Whether … the accused pulled the trigger or whether … he was present there and knowing that the gun was going to be fired and knowing that Mr Jin was going to be attacked and he was there available to help [Bao], whether or not he fired that bullet or not"". 
        
       
     98   Counsel for the appellant also made a lengthy closing speech canvassing the facts in much detail. Upon the conclusion of that speech, the judge (at T728) told counsel how he proposed to instruct the jury on the first approach by the Crown, namely, that the accused fired some one or more of the three gunshots. The judge next explained how he proposed to instruct the jury on the Crown's second approach. That was in terms of his written directions as set out in the reasons of the Chief Judge. 
     99   The prosecutor asked the judge to tell the jury additionally on the second approach that if they were not sure whether the deceased fired one of the shots they did not have to find that the other person fired all the shots. They could still convict the accused. 
      
       
     100   The judge replied (T729): 
      
       
        
        ""The reality of your case is, isn't it, that this accused and Bao were in the car. Either or both of them fired the shots. That is your first case. Your second case is that Bao fired the shots but the accused was not unconscious. He was there sentient, observing what was happening and doing something which in the necessary sense stamped him as a principal in the second degree. 
        
       
       
       
      The prosecutor replied ""Yes"". That states the prosecution case in slightly different terms from the way it was put in the closing speech of the prosecutor. 
       
     101   At T732 the judge stated that he had some problem with the second way in which the Crown put its case. He thought that it was mainly based on speculation and suspicion and that there was not a lot of evidence to support the second approach. He indicated to counsel that he was going to warn the jury about the difficulties of the second approach in the terms which he did as set out in the Chief Judge's reasons. 
     102   I have set out the discussion at such length between the judge and counsel to show the difficulties experienced at the trial. They started with the prosecutor not opening sufficiently clearly the bases on which the Crown case was put and subsequently putting the case on a somewhat different basis. As a result of the Crown not relying on the approach in the cases earlier cited the Crown assumed a burden more onerous than the law required. It did not matter whether the appellant fired the shot or the co-offender fired the shot and the appellant was at the scene of the crime aiding and abetting, so long as one of these alternatives must have applied. 
      
       
     103   The case went to the jury on the primary basis that the Crown had to prove that the appellant fired some one or more of the three gunshots at and into the deceased and if that were not proven on the alternative basis that somebody other than the appellant was the person who actually fired the shots, but that the appellant was then present and in some way associating himself with the shooting of the deceased (SU33). The matter was not left to the jury on the basis of the principle emerging from Mohan, Stokes & Difford and Clough. 
     104   The judge's directions as to aiding and abetting did not follow the traditional format. Usually a jury is told that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt:  
      
       
      (a) the commission of the crime of murder by the principal offender 
       
       
      (b) the presence of the accused at the time the crime was committed 
       
       
      (c) the accused knew all the essential facts or circumstances necessary to show the crime was committed by the principal offender (including that the principal offender intended to kill the deceased or inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased); 
       
       
      (d) with that knowledge, the accused intentionally assisted or encouraged the principal offender to commit the crime. 
       
       
      It is then necessary for the jury to be told the elements which the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt for them to be satisfied that the principal offender committed the crime. This may overlap with sub-paragraph (c) above. 
       
     105   The directions and principles set out above are based on Stokes & Difford at 37-38, and Giorgianni v The Queen 156 CLR 473 at 487-488, 493-495, 500-501. Knowledge of all the essential facts includes knowledge of the necessary state of mind or intent encompassed within the crime. 
     106   In Giorgianni at 481 Gibbs J pointed out that similar matters need to be proved in the case of an accessory before the fact and that of an aider and abettor. Mason J at 493 stated that in substance ""there appears to be no distinction between a principal in the second degree and an accessory before the fact beyond the question of presence"". 
     107   Again, in Giorgianni at 481 Gibbs J cited this passage from Russell on Crime 12th ed (1964) p151 ""the bare minimum which is necessary to constitute a person as an accessory before the fact is that his conduct should indicate (a) that he knew that the particular deed was contemplated and (b) that he approved of or assented to it, and (c) that his attitude in respect of it in fact encouraged the principal offender to perform the deed"". Gibbs J went on to point out that the law had developed and that knowledge of the facts is necessary before a party can be made liable as a secondary party for the commission of an offence (481-482). Further, the person charged must have intended to help, encourage or induce the principal offender to bring about the forbidden result. (482) 
     108   The directions given by the judge refer to the necessity of the accused being present when the gunshots were fired. That is correct. The directions also refer to the Crown having to prove that the accused said or did something that indicated his willing assent. Technically, ""willing assent"" does not necessarily involve the same concept as intentionally assisting or encouraging the principal offender. ""Willing assent"" is however a manifestation of ""encouraging"" and in the circumstances of the present case where both the accused and the co-offender were in the car at the same time with the deceased this part of the direction is sufficient. The direction does not tell the jury that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the crime of murder has been committed (by the principal offender) and spell out the elements. Nor does it state that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was aware of all the essential circumstances including the state of mind of the principal offender. 
     109   While the direction does not state in terms that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended to assist or encourage the principal offender the direction that the jury must be satisfied that the accused intended that the deceased should either be killed or have inflicted upon him some form of grievous bodily harm sufficed. If you intend that the deceased should be killed or have grievous bodily harm inflicted at the time you indicate your assent, it follows that you intend to assist or encourage. 
     110   For the reasons earlier indicated I regard the directions given as to aiding and abetting as inadequate. I do not think that the proviso can be applied. 
     111   The Crown case has considerable strength. There should be a new trial. Upon the assumption that the Crown presents a case that the accused was either a principal offender or an aider and abettor, but it cannot say which, the jury should be instructed that before the accused can be convicted of murder the Crown has to prove the following beyond reasonable doubt. 
      
       
       (a) the deceased died as a result of a gunshot fired by the accused or Bao Pham 
       
       
       (b) with intent to kill the deceased or inflict upon him grievous bodily harm, that is really serious bodily harm 
       
       
       (c) the accused and Bao Pham were present at the time the crime was committed 
       
       
       (d) the accused and Bao Pham knew all the essential facts or circumstances necessary to show that the crime was committed by the other 
       
       
       (e) with that knowledge the accused or Bao Pham intentionally assisted the other to commit the crime. 
       
       
      I would add: 
       
       
      Thus you are required to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused fitted the role of either the principal offender who fired the fatal shot or the aider and abettor. If you are so satisfied the accused is guilty of murder. If you are not so satisfied he must be acquitted of murder. 
       
     112   There would, of course, need to be the necessary directions defining murder including intent and aiding and abetting and explaining that an aider and abettor is just as guilty of the crime as the person who actually committed it. It would also have to be explained that if the Crown cannot prove who fired the fatal shot or shots but is able to prove that the accused must have either fired the shot or aided and abetted, such accused is guilty of murder. 
     113   If, on the retrial the Crown alleged murder based on a common enterprise other directions would be required. 
     114   I return to the oral directions given by the judge on the second limb of the Crown case and in particular the words: 
      
       
        
        ""The accused, it is argued, if he did not actually fire one of the shots, was there when the shots were fired; was not unconscious, and aware of what was happening; and said or did something of which a reasonable mind would conclude that it associated him deliberately with what was being done - one must assume by Mr Bao Pham"". 
        
       
     115   The reference to ""a reasonable mind"" introduces an alien concept into this branch of law. The relevant element of aiding and abetting is that the accused assisted or encouraged the co-accused (Bao Pham) and did so intentionally. That element must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. It is not a question of something said or done by the accused which a reasonable mind would conclude associated him deliberately with what was being done by Bao Pham. 
     116   I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Judge.

     1   GILES JA: We are of the opinion, without going further, there must be a new trial. We note what Mr Odgers said about ground three. However, we do not wish to express a concluded view on that matter or to ask for further submissions from the parties. I would ask Badgery-Parker AJ to give the first reasons. 
      
       
        
       
     2   BADGERY-PARKER AJ: The appellant, Abbas Mohamed Ali, and a co-accused, Koder Jamaa, stood trial in the District Court in Sydney in March 2000 upon the charge of armed robbery. The appellant was also charged with discharging a firearm in a dangerous manner. On 23 March 2000 the appellant was found guilty of both charges, while Mr Jamaa was found not guilty. 
      
       
        
       
     3   The critical issue at the trial was the identification of the perpetrators of the armed robbery, about the circumstances of which there was no dispute. The crimes took place in a shopping complex adjacent to the Novotel Hotel at Brighton-le-Sands. The two perpetrators waited in the shopping arcade until two employees of the hotel, Mr Paul Rayner and Mr Peter Donovan, walked from the hotel into the arcade. One of them was carrying a black bag. They were going to the bank to collect money. The perpetrators evidently believed they were carrying money to the bank and they confronted the two men in the arcade near the bank entrance. One of them produced a firearm and said, ""This is a stick up, drop the bag."" Mr Rayner complied. The man who was not armed punched Mr Rayner to the right-hand side of the face, knocking him to the ground. The armed offender pointed the gun in the direction of Mr Donovan, who was still standing, and discharged it. It missed Mr Donovan and fortunately did not cause injury to any of the other people in the vicinity. The two robbers fled with the bag into Bay Street. 
      
       
        
       
     4   Briefly, the identification evidence was as follows. Mr Rayner was shown a set of photographs and picked out a photograph of the appellant. Mr Donovan was shown photographs and picked out two, as to which he said he believed one was a picture of the gunman, although he could not say which of the two. One was a photograph of the appellant, the other was not, but he expressed himself ""more sure"" about that other photograph. A witness who gave evidence under the pseudonym David White testified that he saw the two robbers running from the scene and he recognised one as the appellant, a person he had seen ""quite a few times"" over a period of seven or eight years, though he had never spoken to him nor heard him speak. Other persons who had witnessed the robbery were shown photographs of the appellant but did not identify him. Indeed, one witness, an off-duty police officer, saw the robber running near the bank. She selected a photo which she was sure was a photo of one of the robbers. It was a photograph of a person who was not either of the accused. 
      
       
        
       
     5   The identification evidence was quite cogent and certainly such as could satisfy the jury that the appellant was indeed the armed robber and a submission that the conviction was unsafe could not be sustained. However, the risk of miscarriage of justice where convictions are based upon identification evidence only is well-known, for which reason the common law and the Evidence Act 1995 both require that a jury be warned of the risk. 
      
       
        
       
     6   In this case the appellant seeks to challenge the adequacy of the directions given by the Judge with regard to the identification evidence. There is, however, another ground of appeal which it is convenient to consider first. The appellant sought to adduce upon the hearing of the appeal fresh evidence; namely, the evidence of one Michael Erdogan. The evidence was extremely relevant. It was not available to the appellant at the time of the trial, nor with reasonable diligence could it have been available. Accordingly, this court ruled the evidence should be admitted, subject to the witness being available for cross-examination. 
      
       
        
       
     7   In an affidavit sworn 16 March 2001, the witness said he was introduced to the accused in about 1995 by a mutual friend. He was not himself a close friend of the appellant but would see him socially amongst a group of people from time to time. He estimated the frequency in the earlier years as once or twice a month and between late 1998 and late 1999 rather less frequently. He said: 
      
       
        
         
          
          ""However all in all I would have met him 40 to 50 times and would have no difficulty in recognising him when I saw him."" 
          
         
        
        
         
        In evidence here in the course of cross-examination he said he was not really a friend of the appellant. He had spoken to him on perhaps five or ten occasions and, as he said in his affidavit, had seen him forty or fifty times when they just said hello. 
         
        
       
     8   Mr Erdogan is the general manager of a chain of retail fashion outlets and one of the group's stores is located in the shopping plaza in the Novotel complex. Mr Erdogan was present at that location at the time of the robbery. He came upstairs to the level upon which his shop is located, next door to the Westpac Bank and opposite the food court. He said that as he came up the stairs he noticed two men sitting at a table immediately adjacent to the stairs. There was nothing distinctive about them. He was aware of them being present over the next hour or so. He said: ""During the approximate last 20 minutes prior to the robbery occurring, there was only the smaller man seated"" at the table. That man was facing towards the witness. He observed the robbery. The two men who had been sitting at the table were the perpetrators. The smaller of the two, who had remained at the table throughout, was the man who was carrying the firearm. He was not able to identify either of the people involved, but was able to say with certainty that neither of them was the appellant. In his oral evidence today he said his observations were made from not only inside the shop but that in the course of his arranging window visuals and the like he moved outside the shop from time to time to a distance fifteen to twenty metres away from the shop front and so from time to time observed the two men at the table over a period from different points of view. 
      
       
        
         
        He gave an explanation as to why he had not spoken to the police about what had occurred at the time, which it is not necessary to repeat. He said he did not know the appellant had been accused of the robbery until the middle of the year 2000, when he heard that the appellant was in prison. Towards the end of that year he asked a mutual friend why the appellant was in prison and was then told it was ""for the robbery of the Westpac next to your shop in Brighton."" He told his friend that he had been there and had seen the robbers, and that the appellant was not one of them, and some time later he was contacted by solicitors acting for the appellant and he agreed to give evidence. The essence of his evidence is not that he admitted or claimed to be able to identify the perpetrators but that having the perpetrators intermittently in his view in the circumstances I have described, it never occurred to him that the appellant, who he was in a position to identify, was one of them. The account given by the witness in his affidavit read convincingly. In this court today he was cross-examined by an experienced Senior Crown Prosecutor. It is sufficient to say the cross-examination was not successful in destroying the witness' credibility, although there were features of his evidence from which the Crown might derive some comfort before a jury. The principles applicable to this court in setting aside a conviction on the ground of fresh evidence were concisely stated in the joint judgment of Toohey and Gaudron JJ in  
        Michelberg v. The Queen 
         (1988-1989) 167 CLR 259 at 301: 
         
          
          ""The underlying rationale for a Court of Criminal Appeal setting aside a conviction on the ground of fresh evidence is that the absence of that evidence from the trial was, in effect, a miscarriage of justice ... There is no miscarriage of justice in the failure to call evidence at trial if that evidence was then available, or, with reasonable diligence, could have been available ...  
           
           
          There is no very precise formulation of the quality which must attach to fresh evidence before it will ground a successful appeal. It has been said that it must be 'credible', 'cogent', 'relevant', 'plausible' ... In essence, the fresh evidence must be such that, when viewed in combination with the evidence given at trial, it can be said that the jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused if all the evidence had been before it 
           
          ...or, if there be a practical difference, that there is 'a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the accused' ... If there is a difference it is not material to the outcome of the present applications. For ease of expression we proceed by reference to the formulation that the jury is likely to have entertained reasonable doubt had all the evidence been before it, noting, in that context, that it is necessary that the fresh evidence be credible in the sense that a reasonable jury could accept it as true, but it is not necessary that the Court should think it likely that a reasonable jury would be believe it ..."" 
          
         
         
          
         
        
       
     9   With respect, it seems to me there is ""a practical difference"" between the two formulations - the difference between likelihood and a significant possibility. The latter formulation poses a less stringent test. In Regina v Stakeloth (NSW CCA unreported, 3 April 1996) Gleeson CJ (with whom Dowd and Hidden JJ agreed), referred to Michelberg and allowed a new trial on the basis of fresh evidence, because there was a ""significant possibility"" that, had the fresh evidence been before the trial court, ""the jury would have acquitted the appellant”. That is to say, in that case the court adopted what I have referred to as the less stringent test. 
      
       
        
         
        In this case it does not matter. I am clearly of the view that the fresh evidence on which the appellant seeks to rely meets the more stringent test. I am satisfied that it is evidence such that a jury could accept it, and it is evidence which, taken with the identification evidence led at the trial, is such that the jury, properly instructed and warned of the dangers which attend the use of identification evidence, would be likely to have entertained reasonable doubt. For those reasons I am of the view that on the basis of the fresh evidence the court should quash the conviction and send the matter back for a new trial. 
         
        
       
     10   In the circumstances, there is no need to consider the other grounds of appeal. I would only say that ground three, which challenges the adequacy of the directions and warnings given by the trial Judge, does not on the face of it, and without hearing at this stage argument but paying attention to the written submissions lodged by both parties, appear to afford a reason why this court should have intervened. In only one respect does it appear to me that his Honour should perhaps have done more; namely, having on a couple of occasions recalled to the jury the Crown's submission that because there were two witnesses who identified the appellant the possibility of error was remote. His Honour should, in my view, have been at some pains to emphasise to the jury that it is always possible that each of two or more identification witnesses may be in error for similar reasons. 
      
       
        
       
      I propose that the orders of the court be that the conviction is quashed and a new trial ordered. 
      
       
        
        GILES JA: I agree. 
         
        GREG JAMES J: I also agree. 
         
         
        GILES JA: The formal orders are that the convictions are quashed and that there be a new trial.

     1    POWELL JA: There was listed before the Court today an application to extend the time within which the Appellant, Mr Sinanovic, might seek leave to appeal from what is said to have been an interlocutory judgment or order given, or made, by Blanch J, the Chief Judge of the District Court, on 2 February last, in connection with an indictment which had been found against the Appellant, and which was to be listed for hearing in the District Court after an earlier appeal against conviction had been upheld. 
      
       
     2    There was also listed an application for leave to appeal against an order made by Moore DCJ in the District Court on 7 May last, when his Honour dismissed the Notice of Motion in which the Appellant had sought (inter alia) to have the further proceedings upon that indictment stayed.  
      
       
     3    In addition, the Appellant has sought to raise today what is, in effect, an application for leave to appeal from the refusal of Luland DCJ in the District Court on Monday last to adjourn the hearing on that indictment. 
      
       
     4    Although the materials which are before the Court make it difficult to be sure of what exactly were, and are, the Appellant's circumstances, it would appear that the Appellant had originally been arraigned on an indictment in September 1997, charging him with having fraudulently misappropriated certain moneys given to him by one Tina Ruello and, having pleaded not guilty to that indictment, he was tried before Acting Judge Stewart and a jury of twelve in the District Court during the month of September 1997. At the conclusion of that trial, the Appellant was found guilty. 
      
       
     5    Following that finding of guilt, his Honour sentenced the Appellant to a minimum term of two years and five months to commence on 3 November 1997 and to expire on 15 April 2000, and an additional term of ten months and one day, commencing on 16 April 2000 and expiring on 16 February 2001. 
      
       
     6    The Appellant appealed from that conviction and, although the matter is not entirely clear, it would seem that the Appellant also appealed to this Court in respect of a number of convictions which he had sustained following trials on other indictments before, among others, Judge Grogan and jury, Acting Judge Horler and jury, and Judge Maguire and jury, all appeals, including that in respect of the conviction before Acting Judge Stewart, seemingly being heard together. 
      
       
     7    Judgment in respect of those appeals was delivered in December last, the appeal in respect of the indictment for fraudulent misappropriation which had been dealt with by Acting Judge Stewart being upheld, the conviction and sentence quashed, and a new trial directed. However, as best I can judge it from the materials which are now before the Court, all the other appeals were dismissed and, although the sentences were adjusted because of the quashing of the conviction on the appeal that was upheld, the sentences were not reduced. 
      
       
     8    It would appear that thereafter there was, or were, filed in the High Court of Australia on behalf of the Appellant applications for special leave to appeal from the judgment or judgments of this Court dismissing the Appellant's appeals against the other convictions. The hearing of that application, or of at least one of those applications, was expedited by her Honour Gaudron J on 22 February last and that application was then heard by Gummow and Callinan JJ in the High Court on 10 April last, on which day special leave to appeal was refused. 
      
       
     9    Meantime, the proceedings which have given rise to these applications today had been listed before Blanch J on 2 February last, on which day, so it is alleged, his Honour ordered that the Appellant's wife ""not be granted leave to assist and get access to represent in relation to the trial."" That allegation appears to be based on the following passage in the transcript of proceedings before his Honour on that day: 
      
       
        
         
         ""HIS HONOUR: Yes, madam Crown? 
         
        
        
         
         MRS SINANOVIC: For the accused, Hakija Sinanovic. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Well, I am not granting you leave to appear, Mrs Sinanovic. Could you bring up Mr Sinanovic, please. 
          
          
         MRS SINANOVIC: He has not been brought in, your Honour. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Hasn't been brought in? 
          
          
         MRS SINANOVIC: No. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Why not, do you know? 
          
          
         MRS SINANOVIC: I have been instructed he has instructed me I faxed a letter to your office about power of attorney to seek leave to appear on his behalf. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Well, I'm not granting you leave, he will have to come in for these appearances. I mean you can help him, but I am not allowing you to appear in the matters. It's really for the sake of - I mean you can make an application to the judge at the trial of course to assist again as well. It is really a matter for fixing a date for the hearing of the matter and have you got any thoughts about that?"" 
         
        
       
      
      
       
     10    It would appear that his Honour then adjourned the matter to 16 February, on which day he fixed the hearing for 14 May last, and directed that the matter be listed for mention on 7 May last. 
      
       
     11    On 1 May last, the Appellant's wife filed in the District Court on his behalf a Notice of Motion in which she sought the following orders: 
      
       
        
         
         ""1. To quash indictment and enter 'No Bill'. 
          
          
         2. To stay proceedings indefinitely."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     12    That application came before Moore DCJ on 7 May last, on which day, as I have earlier indicated, his Honour refused the relief sought in the Notice of Motion, dismissed it and confirmed the hearing date which had earlier been fixed by Blanch J. 
      
       
     13    The applications which are now made, and in respect of which leave has been sought in order to raise them, are based on provisions of s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which relevantly provides: 
      
       
        
         
         ""(3) Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings: 
          
          
         (a) if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal, or 
          
          
         (b) if the judge, justice, justices or magistrate of the court of trial certifies that the judgment or order is a proper one for determination on appeal."" 
          
         
        
       
     14    Rule 5B of the Criminal Appeal Rules provides: 
      
       
        
         
         ""5B. Any party to whom section 5F(3) of the  
         Act 
          applies, which section relates to appeals against interlocutory judgments or orders (desiring to appeal to the Court or to obtain the leave of the Court to appeal against any interlocutory judgment or order) shall give notice of appeal or notice of application for leave to appeal within 14 days of the date of the judgment or order or within such extended time as may in any case be allowed by the Court."" 
         
        
       
     15    Meantime, on Monday last, the matter was listed before Luland DCJ, at which time Mr W Terracini SC, appearing pro bono instructed by a Mr Hill, Solicitor, appeared for the Appellant for the purpose only of seeking to have the hearing adjourned. A number of dates for the adjourned hearing date were suggested to his Honour from as late as October of this year and, in a descending scale, to a date no less than fourteen days from Monday last. His Honour entertained that application and - in support of it, heard certain evidence that was tendered by a witness who, it was suggested, would be able to provide expert evidence that was necessary over the period of the morning, at the end of which his Honour declined the adjournment. We have had an opportunity to read both the transcript record for the hearing of that application and his Honour's reasons for judgment. 
      
       
     16    Although there has been no definitive exposition of what is an interlocutory judgment or order for the purposes of s 5F, it seems clear enough that some judgment or order affecting the trial must have been given or made. It seems equally clear that matters which go no further than relating to the manner of conduct of the trial do not qualify as interlocutory judgments or orders (see, for example, R. v. Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136 and R. v Edelsten (1989) 18 NSWLR 213). 
      
       
     17    Further, it is clear that, insofar as a person other than the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions claims to appeal, the matter is one for leave and that it is incumbent upon the applicant for leave to demonstrate that, in some way, there has been error on the part of the presiding magistrate or judge, and that the error is of such a nature that leave ought to be given so that it can be dealt with (see R. v. Matovski (1989) 15 NSWLR 720). 
      
       
     18    So far as the first of the applications which is listed before us today is concerned, it is I believe, abundantly clear from that passage from the transcript which I have set out above that Blanch J delivered no interlocutory judgment and made no interlocutory order other than for the purpose of the application that was before him for fixing a date. In no way did his Honour seek to dictate the future conduct of the hearing, as is made abundantly clear from that part of the transcript where his Honour makes it abundantly clear that if the Appellant's wife sought to appear for or assist him on the hearing that was a matter she could put to the trial judge. 
      
       
     19    So far as the second matter is concerned, we have had the benefit of the reasons for judgment of Moore DCJ and, in my view no error of law or of principle appears on the face of the judgment. 
      
       
     20    So far as the third matter is concerned, we have, as I have earlier indicated, had the benefit of the transcript record of the hearing on Monday, both before and after Luland DCJ refused the application for an adjournment and as well, we have had the opportunity to read his Honour's reasons for judgment. It seems to me that there is no merit in the application that is now sought to be made, and, therefore, that we should not further entertain an application for leave to appeal in respect of it. 
      
       
     21    The orders which I propose in respect of the two matters that have been formally listed for hearing today are that, in each case, leave to appeal be refused and I would record that the Court should not entertain the informal application that has been made during the course of the afternoon. 
      
       
     22    WOOD CJ at CL: I agree. 
      
       
     23    SULLY J: I also agree. 
      
       
     24    POWELL JA: The orders of the Court are thus those which I have proposed.

      REGINA v. BRETT JOHN BUTCHER 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   GREG JAMES, J: The applicant, Brett Butcher, seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him by Judge Viney, in the District Court of New South Wales at Port Macquarie. 
     2   The applicant had pleaded guilty to three charges under the Drugs Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985. Those charges comprised: one charge of continual supply of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine), an offence under s.25A(1) of that Act, punishable by a maximum custodial penalty of 20 years imprisonment; two charges of supplying a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine), an offence under s.25(1) of that Act, punishable by a maximum custodial penalty of 15 years imprisonment; and one charge of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine), an offence under s.25(2) of the Drugs Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985, punishable by a maximum custodial penalty of 20 years. The charge of continual supply involved supplying the prohibited drug on three or more separate occasions within a period of 30 consecutive days. 
     3   To these counts he had pleaded guilty. The learned trial judge imposed sentences as follows:- 
      
       
        
        Count 1: Five years imprisonment. Non-parole period of two years to commence 21 May 1999. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: Fixed term of three years imprisonment to commence 21 May 1999. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: Fixed term of three years imprisonment to commence 21 May 1999. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4: Seven years imprisonment. Non-parole period of four years to commence 21 May 1999."" 
        
       
     4   The sentences were to date from the applicant's arrest. 
     5   The applicant had limited prior offences, including for matters of driving with a prescribed concentration of alcohol in 1981 and 1988 respectively and, in addition, matters of offensive language in 1990 and malicious damage to property in 1991. 
     6   The applicant successfully sought that his Honour take into account on a Form 1, two charges of possession of a quantity of methylamphetamine of some 28 grams and possession of one gram of cannabis. These drugs were located at the address at which he was arrested. 
     7   A summary of the facts was presented to his Honour. Those facts were not in contest. They were to the effect that an undercover police operative had been employed to make contact with the applicant and to purchase from him sample amounts of amphetamine to gain credibility to enable him to purchase larger amounts from the applicant. 
     8   On the occasions to which the offences charged referred, the undercover operative, known as Sam, met with the applicant in Port Macquarie and supplies of amphetamine took place in escalating quantities in exchange for the payment of increasing sums of money. The conversations were electronically recorded by listening device. 
     9   On the first of the occasions, the applicant stated he could supply the undercover operative with amphetamine on a regular basis. 
     10   Following the three supplies which were the foundation for the first count in the indictment, there was continued contact and a supply, on 30 March of 154 grams of amphetamine for $5,500; on 6 May, a supply of 56 grams for $2,200, and on that day, the applicant informed the undercover operative that he was willing to supply a pound for the sum of $16,000. After negotiation, it was agreed that the pound be supplied for a purchase price of $13,000, but the undercover operative stated that the price was too expensive based on the quality of the product previously supplied. He offered to take two ounces and depending on the quality, to make further contact about purchasing the pound. 
     11   On 21 May there was a further meeting with discussions about the purchase of the pound of amphetamines. Subsequently, the applicant rang the operative and arranged for a meeting at Town Beach. The applicant informed the undercover operative he was in possession of eight ounces which was available at a purchase price of $7,000. The transaction was completed and in due course that amphetamine after seizure was weighed at 263.2 grams. 
     12   The applicant was followed from that transaction to his home address where he was arrested and the other amphetamines and the cannabis, the subject of the matters on the Form 1, located. 
     13   He indicated to police that the money he had received was secreted under the lounge and an inspection of that lounge located $6,700 in cash and some $290 inside his wallet. 
     14   He was interviewed at the scene and then at the Port Macquarie Police Station where intercepted telephone conversations between himself and a man called Stewart were played to him. He identified his own voice but otherwise elected to exercise his right to silence. 
     15   Having recounted the facts I have summarised, his Honour observed that the offences were most serious. 
     16   He then turned to the applicant's personal circumstances and noted that the prior antecedents of the applicant indicated he had nothing in his record associated with supply of drugs. 
     17   The applicant was 37 years of age. He had worked as a miner and his Honour accepted he was a hardworking man. He has a 14 year old son by one relationship and a nine year old son by another.  
     18   After having worked in various places, he had come to Port Macquarie where a domestic relationship in which he was then involved had developed severe problems following his partner's miscarriages. His Honour referred to the applicant's evidence before him that it was in these troubled times that he was led to start experimenting with amphetamines, he having given up alcohol in deference to problems his partner had had in relationships with men who had had a problem with alcohol. 
     19   He had obtained intermittent work but his evidence was that at this point his life began to fall apart. It was whilst ""under the fog of his involvement with amphetamines that he became involved in these offences"", he said. 
     20   His Honour noted that the applicant said that he did not really make any money out of these offences, ""basically all he got out of it was some amphetamines for his own use"". His Honour referred to the applicant's assertion that all the money was there when he was arrested and that all he had anticipated getting was some $300.  
     21   His Honour referred to the applicant's experiences in custody as given by him in evidence and his determination to rehabilitate himself by drug and alcohol counselling in due course. 
     22   His Honour accepted that the applicant asserted that what he had done was wrong and that it was only after his arrest and having got out of his drug involvement that he realised just how serious his conduct had been. In referring to the submissions of counsel for the applicant, his Honour referred to the evidence of the applicant's contrition. 
     23   The listening device tapes were before his Honour. The applicant's counsel submitted that on a review of those tapes, his Honour would draw the conclusion that the applicant was not a terribly experienced drug dealer and that the undercover operative, Sam, seemed to be making all the arrangements. The applicant's counsel invited his Honour to conclude that the undercover operative ""heavied"" him, ""to try and talk up the quantity all the time"". Illustrations were given of portions of the tapes which were said to support that submission. It was put to his Honour that he should conclude that the applicant was not a principal in the exercise but was merely seeking to continue to get the amphetamine to support his own habit. 
     24   Reliance was placed on the applicant's plea for a submission there should be a substantial discount to the sentence, although it was submitted by the Crown that the plea was entered on the day of trial and that there was a strong Crown case. His Honour did accept that it was difficult for counsel on circuit to be able to advise their clients adequately in advance and that it was asserted that the trial was to be a trial only on the basis of a legal question that might otherwise have been argued. 
     25   His Honour accepted from the Crown that it was an overwhelming case, but does seem to have had regard to what was put by the applicant's counsel in favour of the applicant being given, to some extent, the benefit of having entered a plea of guilty at the first reasonable opportunity, obviating a lengthy trial. Such a conclusion might be thought to be generous but it was open to his Honour who also accepted the submission of the applicant's counsel that the year spent on remand should be regarded as having been a difficult time in the sense that it would be more onerous to the prisoner than would serving a sentence already imposed. He accepted the applicant was contrite and that there were good prospects for his rehabilitation. 
     26   His Honour recognised both specific and general deterrence needed to play a part in the sentence. He gave specific attention to the serious social problem constituted by the proliferation of drugs in the community and the pronouncements of the courts in respect of that matter. He had regard to the difficulties of detection and the cost to the community of seeking to detect those engaged in this pernicious trade. 
     27   His Honour held that these were offences over a period of ever increasing severity, albeit, that the offences were committed in what was virtually one enterprise. His Honour concluded that in those circumstances he should exercise his discretion not to cumulate sentence. His Honour had regard in these matters to the requirements of Pearce v. The Queen (1988) 194 CLR 610. 
     28   His Honour noted the applicant's counsel's submission that there were special circumstances and, in particular, the submission that the offences were brought about by the applicant seeking to obtain drugs in support of his own habit and he accepted that the special circumstances to which she referred, should include both that matter and that the applicant would need some significant amount of supervision to readjust after he emerges from what must be a lengthy sentence. 
     29   He advised counsel of the sentences he intended to pass. The learned Crown Prosecutor saw no problem with the structure of those sentences and counsel for the applicant said that there was nothing she wished to say. 
     30   Counsel for the applicant had made two crucial submissions. First, that the course on which the applicant had embarked was ""not simply a commercial enterprise to make money and that there was nothing in the evidence that he was making a lot of money out of it in any event"". That is one of the matters his Honour appears to have accepted, at least as relevant to special circumstances. 
     31   Second, the contention was made by the applicant's counsel that the undercover operative had been ""heavying"" the applicant, who was ""talked up"" into greater criminality. 
     32   The submission that the applicant was ""heavied"" was opposed by the Crown Prosecutor who drew attention to aspects of the transcript which, it was submitted, showed that at all times the applicant was willing to continue the relationship and showed an ability to obtain substantial quantities of amphetamines at little notice. 
     33   The Crown Prosecutor drew attention to the recorded conversations and the telephone calls made by the applicant to the operative wanting to promote more sales between the first and second transactions. 
     34   His Honour dealt with those two crucial submissions only in the context of considering the first, when dealing with special circumstances, and the second, when considering concurrency, on the basis that there was one continuing enterprise escalating in seriousness. His Honour expressly found the escalating criminality but, except so far as the submission overlaps that which he found supported the finding of special circumstances, does not appear to have evaluated the roles of the applicant and the operative. It was accepted by both counsel that his Honour had failed to make specific findings defining those roles, count by count, notwithstanding that he had found they were offences over a period of ever increasing severity. 
     35   On the hearing of the application for leave to appeal, written submissions were filed. It was contended on behalf of the applicant, that his Honour fell into error in two respects. Firstly, he failed to give the plea of guilty due and proper weight, and, secondly, he placed too much emphasis on the applicant's role in the enterprise and the objective gravity of that role without making proper allowance for the role of the undercover operative. 
     36   That second matter raised the correctness of the two crucial submissions I have referred to as made before the trial judge and the lack of any finding for any wider purpose than I have referred to. 
     37   The plea of guilty and the fact of contrition were expressly referred to by his Honour. He plainly intended to give some substantial discount for those matters. It was contended that his Honour must have erred in failing to do so when one had regard to the Judicial Commission statistics for offences of this type which, it was submitted, showed that seven years was at the top of or outside the range of sentences previously imposed. It was submitted that if one had regard for a discount of 10% to 25%, as might have been appropriate for the plea of guilty (see The Queen v. Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383) the sentence, as it was eventually passed, was well in excess of other sentences shown in the statistics for offences of the same kind, notwithstanding the comparatively young age of the applicant, the lack of a drug criminal record, his addiction to the drug, his contrition and his personal circumstances and commitment to rehabilitation. 
     38   It was contended again before us that the applicant's role must have been over-estimated by his Honour. Further, it was submitted that on a reading of the transcript of the listening device recorded conversations, the applicant was revealed to be a naïve dealer who was not making cash out of the exercise except such as might supplement or replace the dole, that he was selling mainly or only to Sam and taking the risk for what was comparatively nothing, that the benefit involved to him were $200 to $300. 
     39   It was said that the severity of the sentence and the lack of an express finding showed his Honour failed to have regard to the role of the undercover operative in seeking to persuade or induce the applicant to commit himself into increasing criminality he would not otherwise have embarked on. This is a relevant matter: see Regina v. Taouk (1992) 65 A. Crim. R. 387 at 396, 403; Regina v. Anderson (1987) 32 A. Crim. R. 146. The severity and structure of the sentences does indicate that his Honour had allowed for substantial culpability in the applicant's continued escalating crimes although referring to that matter in the limited way I have referred to. His Honour has certainly not found in favour of any mitigation for over-zealous inducement by the operative. 
     40   The principle to be applied in such matters is clear. The culpability of the offender may be diminished if the actions of the police or the authorities operate to induce the offender to commit an offence which otherwise might not have been committed, but it remains the fundamental task of the court to evaluate the criminality involved: Taouk (supra); Regina v. Leung (CCA, unreported 21 July 1994). It may be accepted that it may be a mitigating factor for an offender to be led by the police or by authorities into committing a more serious offence than otherwise might have been committed: see Regina v. Rahme (1991) 53 A. Crim. R. 8 but it remains necessary to assess the degree of criminality by defining the applicant's role: Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270. That such a course of conduct by the police is to be treated as serious is clear from s.7 of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997, s.7(1)(a), which provides that:- 
      
       
        
        ""An authority to conduct a controlled operation must not be granted in relation to a proposed operation that involves any participant in the operation:- 
        
       
       
        
        (a) inducing or encouraging another person to engage in criminal activity or corrupt conduct of a kind that the other person could not reasonably be expected to engage in unless so induced or encouraged."" 
        
       
     41   In this provision, the legislature has made it clear that the protection of the law will not be extended to those who so act. The case law makes clear that those whose culpability is increased by such conduct will not receive sentences which ignore that conduct. 
     42   A useful illustration of the application of these principles to a similar situation occurred in Regina v. Roach (CCA, unreported 28 April 1997), where Hidden, J. embarked on an analysis of the evidence in that case to ascertain whether the applicant had been ""prevailed upon"" to ""undertake the supply of the amphetamines"". He concluded that the applicant was initially unwilling to become involved, had no prior drug offences, the undercover operative initiated the dealing on each occasion, and talked up the applicant from small amounts to more substantial quantities which the applicant had greater and greater difficulty supplying. He held these were circumstances that created a probability that the offences ""might not have been committed had the police not in some way facilitated"" them: Taouk (supra) at 396-403. 
     43   His Honour also noted, in respect of the statistics for supplying amphetamine, that sentences of four years or more are at the upper end of the range. His Honour held in that case that the simple findings below left the matter of the undercover operative's involvement and the applicant's role properly to be considered and that more was encompassed in that consideration than concluding that the applicant might have been prevailed upon to become involved in the dealings. 
     44   Simpson, J. agreed with his Honour's views and the sentence that he proposed, which encompassed a considerable reduction, in respect of the four charges of supplying amphetamine, from the sentence of four years and one month comprising a minimum term of three years and one month and the balance by way of additional term. 
     45   Here, as in Roach (supra), it was contended that it was the operative who dictated when the various sales would occur and thus made the applicant liable to the offence of continual supply since it was the operative who had the control over the number of occasions on which supply would occur and thus was able to bring the three occasions within the 30 day period necessary for the offence to be committed. Further, that it was the operative who attempted to have the applicant supply the much larger amount involved in the last count and the applicant's inability to do so clearly showed his subordinate role. 
     46   It was asserted by the applicant's counsel that the applicant's objective criminality had to be assessed by considering the influence by operatives of the State as induced the applicant to commit crimes he would not otherwise have been minded to commit. It was submitted the applicant was entrapped and the trial judge failed to mitigate sentence in that regard. 
     47   Lastly, it was submitted that the sentences imposed were, in all the circumstances, excessive. 
     48   In response, the Crown pointed out that the use of sentencing statistics must always be approached with caution and referred to The Queen v. Prior (CCA, unreported 7 October 1997). Further, that the statistics to which reference had been made in this case indicated that in respect of one count of supply the relevant prohibited drug in a commercial quantity, six percent of offenders received a sentence of seven years or higher. It was acknowledged that the applicant was entitled to a reduction for the guilty plea, although the Crown submitted the applicant was only entitled to that reduction because the plea evidenced contrition and had utilitarian value. It was contended that his Honour had regard to and gave relevant weight to all matters and that the applicant's addiction was not a factor warranting a reduction. It was contended that the sentence was entirely appropriate. 
     49   Further, in relation to the applicant's role in the enterprise and that of the undercover operative, it was submitted that his Honour had given due regard, at least when considering special circumstances, to those matters and that his Honour had properly evaluated the role of the applicant and the level of encouragement by the police officer even if he had not made, expressly, any relevant finding. 
     50   An examination of his Honour's remarks on sentence does not disclose that his Honour has made affirmative or definitive findings of the applicant's role in respect of each count otherwise than in the limited sense to which I have referred. This was necessary: see Olbrich (supra). Both counsel's concession of the lack of appropriate specific and express findings is correct. It is not possible to determine what weight his Honour may have given to this relevant matter or whether he did weigh it at all in the absence of such a finding. It was therefore necessary for us to consider the evidence to ascertain what findings might be made and to ascertain whether the sentence was in error. 
     51   Both parties asked us to do so and not to remit the matter for further hearing in the District Court. That would involve delay, stress on the applicant and significant extra expense. In consequence, the parties were invited to put before the court by way of further submission any particular references in the large volume of transcripts of intercepted conversations to which they might wish to refer. In due course, further written submissions were provided on that question, and on the issue of whether there was more than utilitarian value in the plea. 
     52   As to that latter, although I note the submissions, I am of the view that his Honour did have regard to matters to which the applicant refers and did take into account properly the plea made as and when it was. 
     53   As to the question of the applicant's role, I have referred to the substantial further references which were provided both by the applicant's counsel and by the learned Crown Prosecutor and to the matters expressly referred to in the argument on the plea in an attempt to decide this issue to ascertain whether the sentence for lack of appropriate findings on this question was in error and, if so, what findings should be made on re-sentencing. 
     54   On the applicant's behalf, it is contended that the applicant was a naïve, small-time dealer lured and persuaded by the undercover operative into increasing criminality into which he would not have fallen without that persuasion. It is not disputed that he engaged with that operative in increasingly more serious drug supplies. But it is asserted:- 
      
       
        
        ""However, it defies commonsense to say that the escalation was at the applicant's bidding."" 
        
       
     55   It is argued that the police were attempting to get at the applicant's principals and hence he should not pay the price in his sentence of their extended investigation which had the consequences of luring him into greater criminality. It was asserted that the evidence does not support that the applicant was a regular supplier of drugs but was a person who, having been targeted by the operative, became increasingly enmeshed in supply to that operative and, as a result of the operative's persuasion, supplying ever increasing amounts. 
     56   That seems to be a submission, that the police over-zealously exploited the applicant's willingness to commit the crime and his willingness to commit ever more serious crimes. 
     57   In support, the applicant's additional submissions referred to some 21 specific references in the transcript and concluded:- 
      
       
        
        ""What is clear, however, (is) this relationship shows that Butcher was new to the game not making profit."" 
        
       
     58   It was said that it was the undercover operative who controlled the relationship, who was interested in the bigger and bigger amounts, but the applicant was a mere intermediary on behalf of principals who controlled his access to the drug. This was supported by the fact that from time to time he could not meet the operative's demands either for more frequent supplies or more substantial supplies. 
     59   In reply, the Crown submitted that the trial judge did not take the view that the applicant was a naïve, inexperienced and weak person substantially manipulated into criminality by Sam and that this court should not take that view. The Crown further submitted that the applicant was actively seeking to promote sales of the drugs to the undercover operative and that it was the applicant more so than that operative who was encouraging the escalation of the criminal activity, referring to numerous passages in the tapes. 
     60   As I have noted, the decision in Olbrich (supra) requires an assessment of the applicant's role in the matters charged and his degree of criminality. That assessment should be made in accordance with those principles as to role of the applicant and the authorities to which I have referred. Should the applicant have escalated his criminality by a readiness to commit increasingly culpable crimes, such would be a matter of aggravation. If he is induced to commit crimes he otherwise probably would not have committed but for the persuasion of the authorities, such would be a matter of mitigation. When considering what may be aggravating and mitigating features, it is necessary to have regard to the principle that mitigating features are to be proved by the applicant on the balance of probabilities, aggravating features by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt. 
     61   In attempting to perform this exercise with the materials that have been supplied and having regard to those portions of the materials to which reference has been made, I have become convinced of the difficulty of seeking to reach, on the respective onuses, a conclusion, either that the conversations showed significant matter of mitigation or, more importantly, that the conversations showed any such matter of aggravation as the Crown contended should be considered as established. I consider that his Honour must have found some such matter in finding the circumstances were such as to have merited the sentence which his Honour did pass, having regard to the matters of contrition, plea of guilty, rehabilitation and limited prior record to which his Honour referred. Such a view is supported, notwithstanding the absence of an express finding, particularly because his Honour did, to an extent, accept the two crucial submissions. The sentence appears most severe, even taking into account the multiplicity of offences but having regard to the sentencing statistics and the other relevant matters. It would seem his Honour must have allowed the escalating seriousness of the offences to weigh heavily without having adverted to what was, at least the encouragement, if not incitement, of the undercover officer. 
     62   However, I conclude from the examination of all the materials that, although the applicant, from time to time, seemed unable to comply with the requests from the undercover operative immediately, I should not conclude the applicant was at any point unwilling to seek to make the supplies the undercover operative held himself out as wanting to receive or was overborne by the operative. 
     63   I do conclude, however, as the trial judge found, that the offences were brought about by the applicant seeking to obtain drugs in support of his own habit and not simply in a commercial enterprise to make money. There was, in any event, nothing in the evidence that he was making a lot of money out of it. 
     64   As to the asserted role of the operative, I conclude the applicant was deliberately tempted to deal and to escalate his dealings. But that, in my view, is a different thing to those considerations which would significantly mitigate his culpability, having regard to the authorities to which I have referred. I conclude that the role of the operative was such that no substantial circumstance of aggravation such as would require a more severe sentence than that appropriate to the continued enterprise to which his Honour expressly referred can be found. 
     65   Having regard to those findings, the sentence passed by his Honour exceeded that which was appropriate to the criminality divulged by the applicant's activities in this extended enterprise and reflecting the other considerations I have noted. Hence it falls to this court to re-sentence the applicant. On a re-sentence it will be necessary to have regard to the matters referred to in the findings which his Honour made on the limited question of special circumstances and to consider such matters in relation to both the head sentence and the non-parole period. 
     66   I would accept that there are special circumstances to be found in the necessity for a significant period of supervision to readjust after what must be a lengthy sentence, the applicant's willingness to combat his drug addiction; this being the first occasion on which the applicant has been sentenced to imprisonment; that he has spent a significant portion of the non-parole period of the sentence on remand or awaiting appeal; and that he is a person with strong prospects for rehabilitation. 
     67   In my view the appropriate course to take is to grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I propose that we should vary the sentences on counts one and four to provide for a sentence of four years imprisonment on count one to commence 21 May 1999; for fixed terms of three years imprisonment to remain on counts two and three; on count four, a sentence of five years imprisonment and to impose a non-parole period of three years to date from 21 May 1999. 
     68   I would deem it inappropriate to impose a non-parole period in respect of the sentence on count one in consequence of the non-parole period being imposed on the sentence imposed on count four. All sentences should date from 21 May 1999 and be served concurrently. 
     69   I propose the following orders:- 
      
       
      (a) Leave to appeal granted; appeal allowed on counts one and four; sentences on those counts quashed. 
       
       
      (b) In lieu of the sentences imposed on counts one and four, the applicant is sentenced to five years imprisonment to commence 21 May 1999, with a non-parole period of three years commencing on that day and ending on 20 May 2002. 
       
       
      (c) Appeal on counts two and three dismissed.

      KAYLENE MICHELLE MALONE 
      
      
       
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
       
     1    IPP AJA: In 1980 the respondent was employed by the appellant in its supermarket business in the main street in Coleambally, a country town in this State. She worked at the checkout, packed shelves, and sometimes helped customers carry the groceries that they had purchased to their cars. 
      
       
     2    The supermarket was described as being in the middle of the Coleambally shops. Next door was a pharmacy and the owner of the pharmacy kept a labrador type dog. The dog was accustomed to lie between the supermarket and the pharmacy, but from time to time would wander off, as dogs are wont to do. 
      
       
     3    One afternoon in late 1980 the respondent served a woman customer and filled a fruit box with groceries. The box was approximately eight to nine inches in height, two feet in length and approximately sixteen inches in width. As the respondent walked out the door of the supermarket she turned her head and saw the dog lying close to the wall of the supermarket. It was about three to five metres away. She turned and continued walking in a line which would have taken her across the position the dog was in, if he had not moved. The line in which she was walking was about five feet away from the wall of the pharmacy, against which the dog was lying. The dog moved from the position in which he was in and crossed the respondent’s line of travel. She fell over the dog and injured her wrist. Complications arose as to her injuries, and she sustained a severe disability. 
      
       
     4    The respondent sued the appellant on various bases, but the only cause of action relevant to this appeal is that her injuries were caused by the negligence of the appellant. The trial Judge, Judge Puckeridge, held that the appellant had been negligent, and that its negligence had caused the respondent loss. He awarded the respondent damages of $635,056. 
      
       
     5    The appellant appeals against the decision on liability, as well as that relating to the quantum of damages. 
      
       
     6    Judge Puckeridge held that the appellant was under a non-delegable duty to take reasonable care for its employees, including the respondent. That proposition of course must be accepted. His Honour found that the appellant had breached that duty of care in the following respects: 
      
       
        
       (a) By not warning the respondent of the danger that the dog might wander around the area of the supermarket entrance. 
        
        
       (b) By not warning the respondent not to carry out of the supermarket a box of the customer’s purchases in circumstances where her forward vision might be affected or reduced, “and she might fall over the dog if it happened to be walking in the area where she was carrying such a box of purchases to a customer’s car”. 
        
        
       (c) By not instructing the respondent to carry the customer’s purchases in bags or baskets, so that her forward vision would not be affected or reduced. 
        
        
       (d) By not requiring the owner of the dog, namely, the owner of the pharmacy, “to have the dog chained or tethered so that he could not move or wander into an area where he could cause a risk of injury to employees”. 
        
       
     7    I deal firstly with the first ground, namely that the appellant was negligent in not warning the respondent of the danger of the dog wandering around the area of the supermarket entrance.  
      
       
     8    The first point to be made, and a point of substance, is that there was no evidence that the appellant failed to warn the respondent, as alleged. No witness was called on behalf of the appellant in this respect, and the respondent herself gave no relevant testimony in this regard. The onus of proof was on the respondent to prove the absence of warning. As no evidence was given on this issue by the respondent there was nothing which called on the appellant to lead evidence in respect of those matters. No inference could be drawn against the appellant because it did not do so. 
      
       
     9    That alone is enough to dispose of the finding by his Honour that the appellant was negligent in failing to warn of the danger that the dog might wander around. However, the fact is the respondent well knew that the dog was accustomed to lie in front of the pharmacy, and she knew that the dog from time to time wandered about. She was eighteen years old at the time, had grown up and had been educated in the country and would have been familiar with the behaviour of dogs. It was not unusual for dogs to frequent the main street where the supermarket and pharmacy were situated. In the circumstances I accept the submission made on behalf of the appellant that any such warning could have told the respondent nothing more than she already knew. 
      
       
     10    The second and third grounds which I have mentioned, relate to a warning and instructions to the respondent in regard to how she was to carry the purchases out of the supermarket. There again, there was no evidence that the appellant failed to instruct the respondent, as alleged. Everything that I have said on this issue in regard to the first ground of warning applies equally to the second and third grounds. 
      
       
     11    On that basis alone I consider that his Honour erred in finding, as he did, that the appellant was negligent in failing to warn or instruct the respondent on these matters. 
      
       
     12    In addition to the fatal absence of evidence on these grounds there are problems of causation.  
      
       
     13    The box was relatively small, and the respondent’s vision would have been obstructed of course vertically downwards, and marginally forward. She noticed the dog when she came out of the supermarket, as I have mentioned, and she must have moved at least three to five metres before falling over the dog. It is not clear from the evidence exactly where she fell, and in exactly which direction the dog moved from where it was lying to where it came in front of her, so that she fell over it.  
      
       
     14    No explanation was given at the trial as to why the respondent did not see the dog earlier. She did not testify that the reason for this was that the box obstructed her vision. As she came out of the supermarket she was conversing with the customer, whose goods she was carrying, and she was asking the customer where she had parked her car. She was told that the car was on the far side of the pharmacy, near a newsagent. The inference that is to be derived from the evidence in this respect is that the respondent took her eyes off the dog and looked ahead where she believed the customer’s car to be parked. 
      
       
     15    There appears to be no reason why the respondent did not see the dog from the time that it left the position where it was until immediately before she fell over it, other than the fact that she was not looking in the direction of the dog but was looking ahead, either along the path or towards the car owned by the customer. 
      
       
     16    On that basis it seems to me that the presence of the box had nothing to do with the accident. The accident was caused, in effect, by the dog moving forward and the respondent not looking, and there is no evidence that would suggest that had she not carried a box the accident would not have happened. 
      
       
     17    On that basis the causative link between the carrying of the box and the fall was simply not established. 
      
       
     18    The fourth ground is that the appellant should have required the owner of the dog to remove it from the vicinity. There was no basis suggested, however, on which the appellant could have required the owner to remove the dog. It was submitted on the respondent’s behalf that the appellant could have exhorted the owner of the dog to remove it, but there was no evidence that any such exhortations would have had any effect. In my view this ground is entirely without merit. 
      
       
     19    Finally, it was submitted on the respondent’s behalf that that Judge Puckeridge should have found the appellant was negligent in failing to provide a safe system of work. The basis of this submission was that the appellant should have provided some alternative means whereby the respondent could have transported the customer’s goods from the supermarket to the customer’s car. 
      
       
     20    In advancing this submission Mr Petty SC, for the respondent, referred to a concession made on the appellant’s behalf at trial, to the effect that there was a foreseeable risk that, if employees carried boxes which reduced their forward vision, they could trip or fall over the dog. It was submitted that, once this concession was made and accepted, it followed that a reasonable means of avoiding this foreseeable risk was to provide alternative means of transporting the goods, as I have indicated. Such alternative means would have been providing trolleys or, perhaps, baskets, or requiring the employees to carry bags, but not boxes. 
      
       
     21    Again, in my opinion, there are a number of answers to this submission which defeat the respondent’s claim.  
      
       
     22    The contention as to the failure to provide a safe system of work was particularised in the statement of claim, but appeared to receive no attention whatever in the course of the trial. Mr Petty, who said everything that could possibly have been said on behalf of the respondent, was reduced to relying upon evidence as to the nature of the appellant’s duties, and as to the manner in which the accident occurred, in arguing that an inference should be drawn that there were no trolleys available and no alternative means of moving the goods. In the light of the way in which the matter was pleaded, however, I am not persuaded that the evidence to which he referred is adequate to justify a finding that alternative means were not available. 
      
       
     23    Secondly, the mere fact that there was a foreseeable risk does not of its own necessarily mean that the appellant was obliged to take steps to avoid that risk.  
      
       
     24    The risk in this case was obvious and must have been well known to the respondent. I have drawn attention to the fact that she knew that the dog was regularly to be found in the position where it was, and was known to wander about. The prospect of falling over a dog, in a country town, in a country street, where dogs moved about, was not unusual, or unexpected. It was one of the facets of country life with which ordinary citizens are required to live and accommodate. 
      
       
     25    In my view, the appellant was entitled to regard the risk of harm caused by the dog wandering about as being so obvious as to entitle it to rely on its employees own prudence to take adequate care for her own safety: Liftronic Pty Limited v Unver (2001) HCA 24, Romeo v Conservation Commission (NT) (1998) 192 CLR 431 at 455, 456, 478 and 489. 
      
       
     26    I should mention that Mr Petty, in resisting this proposition, drew attention to two matters, namely, the relatively youthful age of the respondent and the prospect that when, carrying goods out of the store, the respondent might be talking to the customer in question, and not looking out for the dog. While there is something to be said for the points so made, I am not persuaded that they are sufficient to detract from the fact that the risk of the dog moving about was well known and the risk of injury was easy to avoid. 
      
       
     27    In all the circumstances I conclude that negligence was not established, and the appeal must succeed. I would uphold the appeal, set aside the verdict, order that a verdict be entered in favour of the appellant and order that the respondent’s claim be dismissed with costs. I would order that the respondent pay the costs of the appeal, the respondent to receive a Suitors Fund certificate if otherwise entitled. Additionally, there should be an order that the respondent repay the money that has been paid to the appellant, with interest at Court judgment rates from the date of payment to the date of repayment, and the appellant to have liberty to apply. 
      
       
     28    MASON P: I agree. 
      
       
     29    STEIN JA: I agree.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
     1    STEIN JA:  
      
      Introduction 
       
     2    On 13 December 2000 Badgery-Parker AJ, sitting without a jury, found the appellant not guilty of the murder of Benjamin Phillip Prior on 26 December 1999 but guilty of manslaughter. His Honour gave written reasons for his decision. On 19 December 2000 his Honour sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for a term of 3 years from 25 December 1999 to expire on 24 December 2002 and determined a non-parole period to expire on 22 December 2000. 
     3    Two of the grounds of appeal challenge findings of fact made by the trial judge. With the consent of the Crown the appellant added a ground to the effect that the verdict was unreasonable as not being supported by the evidence. 
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
     4    The Amended Notice of Appeal essentially raises the following issues: 
      
       
      1. That the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. 
       
       
      2. That his Honour erred in finding that the occasion for self-defence had ceased when the fatal blows were struck. 
       
       
      3. That there was no evidence to support his Honour’s finding that the fatal head injury to the victim was inflicted by the last blow or blows delivered immediately before he fell to the ground. 
       
       
      4. That his Honour erred in holding that the  
      Home Invasion (Occupants Protection) Act  
      1998 merely codified the common law as to self-defence. 
       
       
      Facts and Findings of Primary Judge 
       
     5    His Honour recited the facts as follows: 
      
       
        
        10. In December 1999 the accused … was residing at 13 Loughnan Street, Coolamon. The accused was then just over 20 years of age, having been born on 26 November 1979. Also resident there were his grandmother, … and that person’s mentally disabled daughter, an aunt of the accused. A verandah which extended part way along the front of the building and down the whole of the west side of the building was furnished as a flatette, and it was in this part of the house that the accused resided. In the next door house, No. 15, resided two brothers Benjamin Prior (aged 25 years) and Gerard Prior (then aged 17 years and two months). 
        
       
       
        
        11. Late on the evening of Christmas Eve, 24 December 1999 both the accused and Ben Prior were at a hotel in Coolamon referred to in the evidence as the “top pub”. They played a game of pool. At some state late in the evening or in the small hours of the following morning, an argument developed between them with regard to the accused’s behaviour towards a girl who had interfered with the pool table. Peace was restored and the evidence does not reveal the extent of any residual ill feeling existing at the time when one or other of the two young men first left the pub. 
        
       
       
        
        12. The accused is an epileptic and on long term medication for that condition. That medication reacts badly with alcohol and it seems he probably should not drink at all. On the evening of 24 December he consumed a quantity of alcohol and soon after his return home he became violently ill, vomiting or retching continually for some hours. Some time after 3 am the sounds that he made attracted the attention of the brothers Prior in their house next door and became a source of irritation to them. Towards dawn, but while it was still dark, they went out of their house and towards the accused’s home and yelled out to him to be quiet. The Prior brothers had been drinking and the quantity that each consumed was certainly sufficient to produce a significant measure of disinhibition. There was an exchange of words between them and him, with foul language used on both sides. Reference was made to the earlier incident at the pub, and Ben Prior challenged the accused to come out into the street to “sort it out”. He refused to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        13. The Prior brothers commenced to walk towards the accused’s home. Ben waited while Gerard Prior went back into his own home and picked up a cricket bat. … ….. By the time they reached the steps the cricket bat was in the possession of Ben though Gerard could not say in what circumstances the transfer occurred. Ben went up the steps onto the verandah. His brother was certainly on the steps if not on the verandah itself, and both young men were visible to the accused as he moved along the verandah towards them. A struggle took place between the accused and Ben Prior, and in the course of that struggle the accused obtained possession of the cricket bat. He commenced to swing it at Ben Prior and some blows made contact with him. That led Gerard to run away down the path towards the front gate, and Ben turned to follow him. The accused continued to strike at him with the bat. At a point about four metres from the house and two metres short of the gate, Ben Prior collapsed into shrubbery on the right hand side of the path. The accused continued to strike Ben as he lay on the ground, as well as fending off Gerard each time he tried to intervene. 
        
       
       
        
        14. One at least of the blows delivered before Ben Prior fell struck him on the back of the skull, causing a fracture and underlying subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhage which caused the death of Ben Prior on the morning of 26 December 1999.  
        
       
     6    In examining the evidence his Honour said: 
      
       
        
        The accused did not strike Ben Prior with the bat as soon as he obtained possession of it, but only after Prior attempted to punch him. He hit Prior two or three times while Prior was still on the verandah. He said he was trying to scare the man in order to get him off the verandah. Ben started to run and the accused says that he hit him three or four times more as Prior was running on the path. The deceased had only travelled about three metres down the path when he fell. He lay face down with his head towards the street, his feet towards the house, and Gerard’s description of the location, which places the deceased’s head a little closer to the house than the garden arbour posts, is consistent with the finding of blood in a damaged bush just on the house side of the post on the right hand side of the path looking towards the street. I am satisfied that Prior fell unconscious as a result of the blow which caused the skull fracture and that the skull fracture was not an injury caused by any blows which the accused continued to deliver after Prior had fallen.  
        
       
     7    The trial judge turned to other matters bearing on the appellant’s state of mind. These included that he was very ill at the time, having vomited for some hours; he had had little sleep; his home had been invaded in darkness by two bulky young men, one armed with a cricket bat and both acting aggressively towards him; the appellant’s concern that his elderly grandmother and mentally disabled aunt were in the house and the appellant’s possible lingering effects of earlier intoxication. To this may be added his epilepsy, mentioned earlier by his Honour. Notwithstanding, his Honour said that the impression conveyed by the appellant during his ERISP was that he was answering ‘frankly and truthfully’. The trial judge, having viewed the video tape, concluded that he had no reason to doubt the appellant’s truthfulness in the police interview. The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. 
     8    We have also viewed the tape. I agree with his Honour’s conclusions on the demeanour of the appellant on the ERISP. Notwithstanding his low IQ, his behaviour during the recorded police interview revealed an apparent ability to understand and fluently answer questions put to him in a cogent manner. His Honour said as much in his later remarks on sentence. Again, I must say that I gained much the same impression as did his Honour on viewing the ERISP. This is relevant to my later consideration of his Honour’s judgment. 
     9    His Honour considered the question of causation. At what moment and where in the sequence of blows was the fatal blow struck? His Honour accepted that if the fatal blow was struck while the appellant and Ben Prior were still on the verandah, the act would have been one done in self-defence and was an act which the appellant clearly believed was necessary to perform in self defence. There were reasonable grounds for the appellant to entertain such a belief. His Honour however found that the most likely cause of death was from the deceased’s most serious injury, that to the right posterior parietal scalp. A forensic pathologist, Dr Botterill, said that this injury was most likely to have caused the victim to become unconscious, probably instantaneously. The other injuries to the deceased were unlikely to have caused unconsciousness. While Dr Botterill stated that the degree of force causing the depressed fracture was most likely to cause unconsciousness straight away. However, he said that may not always be the case. His Honour concluded that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the significant head injuries were not inflicted on the verandah but ‘were inflicted by the last blow or blows delivered immediately before Ben Prior fell to the ground’. 
     10    The Home Invasion (Occupants Protection) Act (the Act) applied to the circumstances of the case. Counsel for the accused argued at the trial that the Act modified the common law. In particular, it was submitted that s 9 (read in light of other provisions) made the test of reasonableness of the accused’s belief that it was necessary for him to act as he did, entirely subjective. This, so it was said, is quite different from the common law. 
     11    His Honour rejected the submission finding that the Act declared the common law and was in all respects the same as the common law which existed before the Act. 
     12    His Honour then turned to determine the issue of self-defence. He focused on whether the Crown had excluded any reasonable possibility of self-defence, either by proving beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not believe that it was necessary to act as he did in self-defence, or by proving beyond reasonable doubt that the grounds for the accused’s belief to that effect were not reasonable grounds. 
     13    His Honour said: 
      
       
        
        … as Ben Prior ran away from the house, along the path towards the street a matter of a few paces only, the accused pursued him and continue to strike at him with the bat, and some of those blows landed. According to the accused himself, he hit Prior three or four times on the head and leg while Prior was running. …  
        
       
     14    This was a reference to answer 348 in the ERISP. His Honour then set forth questions and answers 289 to 297. These included answer 297, which reads in part: 
      
       
        
        … and just going up the path and his brother was already gone but I got him before he got out the gate. So he didn’t come back, I thought I’d give him a few taps.  
        
       
     15    The judge also set out paras 350 to 355 of the ERISP. These included the answer to 355 as follows: 
      
       
        
        No I had to hit him a couple of times to stop him. 
        
       
     16    Badgery-Parker AJ said that he accepted that the appellant believed that it was necessary to press home his attack up to the point where Prior had left the verandah ‘and was fleeing towards the street’. That, he said, was clearly a belief held on reasonable grounds. 
     17    However, in the ERISP, the appellant had repeatedly used the words ‘run’, ‘ran’ or ‘running’. His Honour quoted some examples. 
     18    These included the answer to 291: 
      
       
        
        He [the deceased] was running out the, trying to run out the gate … 
        
       
     19    Also, the answer to 352: 
      
       
        
        And then Ben ran, and then I hit him … 
        
       
     20    Further, the answer to 355: 
      
       
        
        I had to hit him a couple of times to stop him. 
        
       
     21    His Honour stated that there clearly came a moment when the appellant’s concern was no longer to defend himself but ‘to stop them from fleeing’. 
     22    He concluded: 
      
       
        
        … I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that when he [the accused] struck the blows which put an end to the deceased’s flight and brought him to the ground, the accused had ceased to believe that it was necessary for him to do what he was then doing by way of self-defence. He was striking the deceased not in the belief that was necessary to do so in self-defence but in a desire to stop the deceased from getting away.  
        
       
       
      and: 
       
       
        
        … 
          
        There is as I understand the facts, nothing to suggest that Ben Prior was about to resume the attack on the particular occasion, whatever may have been his thoughts about the future, and nothing to suggest that the accused believed otherwise. 
        
       
     23    The Crown had therefore excluded any reasonable possibility that the appellant acted in lawful self-defence. Alternatively, according to the trial judge, if the deceased did have the belief that it was necessary for him to act as he did in self-defence, nevertheless the grounds of his belief were not reasonable. Badgery-Parker AJ found that he was satisfied that the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did not have reasonable grounds to believe that it was necessary, in self-defence, to beat the deceased with the bat, not to drive him away but to stop him making good his escape.  
      
       
      Where were the fatal blows struck? 
       
     24    As already mentioned, the trial judge found that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the significant head injuries were not inflicted on the verandah, but that they ‘were inflicted by the last blow or blows delivered immediately before Ben Prior fell to the ground [on the pathway]’. 
     25    It is submitted by the appellant that this finding was not open to be made by his Honour beyond reasonable doubt when regard is had to the relevant evidence, in particular the evidence of Dr Botterill and statements made by the appellant in his ERISP. 
     26    In my view, the evidence was such as entitled his Honour to find as he did. His conclusion was one which was open on the evidence. 
     27    It was Dr Botterill’s opinion that the severity of the force which would be required to result in the depressed fracture to the skull, when transmitted through to the remaining brain tissue, was more likely to have caused unconsciousness straight away. That was the invariable situation but ‘not always the case’. Counsel for the appellant seized upon this concession to cross-examine the doctor. 
     28    In cross-examination Dr Botterill said: 
      
       
        
        … I can’t say I personally had any experience either in my clinical experience or forensic experience of a wound with a depressed skull fracture which didn’t result in near instantaneous loss of consciousness, but it is conceivable.  
        
       
     29    Counsel then asked him: 
      
       
        
        … it would be possible, would it not, to be struck on the head at or near the top of the steps, and to stumble, run, stumble down to that point or near that point where the shrub is even with a hard blow which caused a fracture?  
        
       
     30    Dr Botterill answered that it was conceivable but that he had had no such experience. 
     31    The witness said that there were two areas of injury to the back of the skull, which were caused by at least two blows. While it was conceivable that more than one blow may have caused the injury to the same area, it was unlikely that the two injuries resulted from ten blows to the head. 
     32    Dr Botterill also stated his opinion that it was unlikely that the depressed fracture to the deceased’s skull was caused by contact with the garden post. 
     33    The fact that Dr Botterill acknowledged the possibility that the depressed skull fracture did not cause immediate loss of consciousness does not destroy the foundation of his Honour’s finding on causation. On an examination of the relevant evidence his Honour was simply entitled to conclude as he did, that it was not a reasonable possibility that the fatal blow or blows did not cause immediate loss of consciousness. 
     34    That finding, coupled with the repeated statements by the appellant in the ERISP that Ben Prior ran from the verandah, and the finding that his answers in this respect were reliable, was fairly open to his Honour. 
     35    In my view, his Honour was entitled to accept the statements of the appellant in the interview. The appellant displayed no uncertainty in his answers about the victim running from the verandah and being pursued by him. An examination of the ERISP makes it plain that the appellant was saying that Ben Prior was running along the path towards the gate and that the appellant pursued him and hit him, causing Prior to fall to the ground. It was therefore open to his Honour to conclude from the ERISP that the fatal blow was struck when the deceased was on the pathway running away from the appellant. This evidence, combined with that of Dr Botterill, entitled the trial judge to conclude that the Crown had excluded as a reasonable possibility that the fatal blow was struck while the victim and the appellant were still on the verandah. The evidence was such that it was open to find that the significant head injuries were inflicted by the last blow or blows delivered on the pathway immediately before Ben Prior fell to the ground. 
      
       
      Had the occasion for self-defence ceased? 
       
     36    The appellant submits that his Honour was in error in finding beyond reasonable doubt that when the fatal blows were struck, the appellant had ceased to believe that it was necessary for him to do what he was doing by way of self defence. Rather he was striking the deceased in a desire to stop him getting away. 
     37    Again, it seems to me that the evidence was such, particularly the appellant’s statements in the ERISP, that his Honour was entitled to find that the occasion for self defence had ceased by the time the fatal blow or blows were delivered. 
     38    True it is that the time span was short. But his Honour was well aware of this and took it into account. His Honour was also acutely aware not to pick over the appellant’s words in the ERISP too closely but to look to the substance of what he was saying. Nonetheless, his Honour was entitled to conclude that what the appellant said in the interview accurately reflected what had occurred and the appellant’s state of mind. 
     39    It follows, in my view, that his Honour was well entitled to find that the attack on the appellant had ceased and that the deceased (unarmed) was fleeing. Nor was there anything to suggest that the attack was about to be resumed on that particular occasion or that the appellant believed otherwise. 
     40    Accordingly, the trial judge was entitled to conclude that the appellant did not hold the belief that it was necessary to do what he did in self defence. 
     41    Further, it seems to me that his Honour was entitled to find, in the alternative, that even if the appellant held the requisite belief, there were no reasonable grounds for him to hold such a belief. 
     42    In my opinion, the Crown is correct in submitting that the reason or motive of the appellant in striking the victim ‘to stop him’ matters not. For example, whether it was to stop the victim fleeing or in pure retaliation, or a bit of each, does not matter so long as the judge is satisfied that the appellant was no longer acting in self defence. 
      
       
      The  
      Home Invasion (Occupants Protection) Act 
       
     43    At the trial counsel for the accused argued that while s 6 of the Act did not depart from the common law with respect to self-defence, other provisions did so depart. It was submitted that s 9 extended the rights of an occupier at common law. 
     44    Section 9 provides: 
      
       
        
        Whether grounds are reasonable grounds for the purposes of section 6, 7, or 8 is to be determined having regard to the belief of the occupant, based on the circumstances as the occupant perceived them to be. 
        
       
     45    Counsel had submitted that the words ‘having regard to’ required the belief of the occupant to be taken into account in determining whether the grounds for that belief were reasonable. With respect to this Badgery-Parker AJ said: 
      
       
        
        The interpretation of s 9 for which Mr Toomey contends would require that the phrase “the belief of the occupant” in s 9 was intended to refer to a belief on the part of the occupant, not that it was necessary for him to act as he did in self-defence (the belief to which s 6 refers) but rather a belief on his part that he had reasonable grounds for believing that it was necessary for him to act as he did in self-defence.  
        
       
     46    In rejecting the contention his Honour said: 
      
       
        
        The significance of the words in s 9, “having regard to the belief of the occupant” is to emphasise that the determination which has to be made “whether the grounds are reasonable grounds for the purposes of s 6” is a determination about the grounds upon which the occupant himself (the actual person, not some hypothetical person in the same position as the occupant) held the relevant belief.  
        
       
     47    In my opinion, this conclusion is correct. As his Honour said, the construction contended for would make it almost impossible to apply s 10(b) of the Act. Nor was there anything in the language of s 9 to suggest that the word ‘belief’ did not have the same connotation as ‘believe’ in s 6, referring to the belief (for the purposes of s 6) which the occupant must hold so that he may lawfully act in self defence against an intruder.48    As his Honour noted, the conclusion that he had reached was entirely consistent with the second reading speech which repeatedly emphasises that the purpose of the Act was to declare and codify the common law. 
     49    I agree with his Honour’s conclusion on this issue and the reasoning which underlay it. 
     50    In my opinion, the appellant has not made out any of his grounds and the appeal against conviction ought be dismissed. 
     51    GREG JAMES, J: I agree with Stein, JA. 
     52    In particular, I too consider that his Honour’s fact finding was open to him, particularly from the applicant’s answers in the ERISP and notwithstanding the appellant’s intellectual deficit, tiredness and the remaining effect of his illness and intoxication at the time of interview. 
     53    These were matters to which the trial judge had regard. His Honour’s conclusion was not unreasonable. 
     54    There is no legal basis for this court to intervene. 
     55    BELL J: I agree with Stein JA. 
     56    I also agree with the additional observations of Greg James J.

     JUDGMENT 
    Introduction 1. Two notices of motion have arisen for determination in these class 5 proceedings. 2. The prosecutor’s notice of motion seeks an order that the summons in the proceedings be amended. The defendant’s notice of motion seeks an order that the proceedings be dismissed, or, in the alternative, that the proceedings be permanently stayed. 3. I have concluded, for the reasons which follow, that the proceedings should not be dismissed nor permanently stayed, and that the amendments sought by the prosecutor should be ordered.The nature of the proceedings and the amendments sought4. These proceedings involve a charge brought under s 6(1) of the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 1989 (“the EOP Act”) alleging that the defendant did, without lawful authority, negligently cause a substance to leak in a manner which harmed or was likely to harm the environment. The summons particularised the substance as being liquid from an effluent pond called “the Blue Lagoon” which was situated upon land at Jepson Avenue, Tumut (“the site”). The site was, at the relevant times, in the ownership of the defendant. An offence under s 6(1) is a tier 1 offence, and it carries a maximum penalty, in the case of a corporation, of $1,000,000. 5. The summons, as presently drafted, does not set out any date upon which the offence is alleged to have occurred, but it contains a heading referring to particulars pursuant to s 12 of the EOP Act and immediately below that heading there is reference to evidence of the offence first coming to the attention of an authorised officer on 6 December 1994. The prosecutor now seeks to amend the summons by:(a) inserting the words ‘between 1992 and 1995’ into paragraph 1 after the words ‘charge that’ and prior to the words ‘at Tumut’; and (b) removing the paragraph heading ‘Particulars pursuant to section 12 of the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 1989’ and the paragraph immediately below that heading.6. I shall, for convenience, refer to these amendments as “the current amendments”. 
    The relevant history7. So that the competing claims can be understood, it is necessary briefly to summarise the history of the proceedings. That summary is as follows: 
     
     7 December 1994 Two officers from the Environmental Protection Authority (“the EPA”) Mr Monteith and Mr Enright, inspect the site. 
      
      
     13 September 1995 The EPA gives a notice to the defendant under s 24 of the Pollution Control Act 1970 requiring production of information;  
      
      
     Late 1995/early 1996 The Blue Lagoon is decommissioned and removed;  
      
      
     October 1996 Affidavits deposing as to facts and circumstances concerning the Blue Lagoon are sworn by Mr Monteith and Mr Enright respectively;  
      
      
     1 August 1997 Class 5 proceedings commence by filing summons. 
      
      
     October 1997 Correspondence between the solicitors for the defendant and the prosecutor concerning further and better particulars of the charge. Specifically, the prosecutor confirms, on 31 October 1997, its allegation that the defendant, on a number of separate and unidentified occasions in a period beginning in 1980, had caused the Blue Lagoon to leak; 
      
      
     18 December 1997 I order the prosecutor to furnish further and better particulars of the charge (see  
     Environment Protection Authority v CSR Ltd  
     (Pearlman J, NSWLEC, 18 December 1997, unreported (“LEC No 1”))) and thereafter the prosecutor requests me to state a case for the determination of the Court of Criminal Appeal; 
      
      
     19 November 1998 The Court of Criminal Appeal answers the case stated by finding that I did not err in ordering the prosecutor provide further and better particulars of the charge ( 
     Environment Protection Authority v CSR Ltd  
     (1998) 101 LGERA 109 (“CCA No 1”);  
      
      
     9 February 1999 The prosecutor furnishes further and better particulars of the charge. Specifically, the prosecutor states that,  
     “… the offence was a continuing one from 1992 until the decommissioning of the Blue Lagoon”; 
      
      
     5 May 1999 I dismiss the defendant’s application for an order striking out the proceedings upon the ground that the prosecutor had failed to provide the further and better particulars ordered to be furnished, and, upon application by the prosecutor, I order the amendment of the summons by including the words  
     “or was likely to harm”  
     after the word  
     “harm” 
      ( 
     Environment Protection Authority v CSR Ltd  
     (1999) 103 LGERA 161 (“LEC No 2”)) 
     . 
      Thereafter the defendant requests me to state a case for the determination of the Court of Criminal Appeal;  
      
      
     20 September 2000 The Court of Criminal Appeal answers the case stated by holding that I did not err in the findings and orders I had made ( 
     CSR Ltd v Environment Protection Authority  
     (2000) 110 LGERA 334 (“CCA No 2”)). 
    8. An important background matter is the evidence of Mr E R Barlow. Mr Barlow was an officer of the EPA (and its predecessor, the State Pollution Control Commission) from 1975 to 1994. He swore an affidavit on 5 December 2000, a copy of which was annexed to the affidavit of Ms J Jagot, the defendant’s solicitor, and that copy was relied upon by both parties for the purpose of dealing with each of the notices of motion. 9. Mr Barlow stated that he was the primary EPA contact officer for the site from the early 1980’s until October 1994. During that period, his duties involved, amongst other things, the regular inspection of the site, and he kept field notebooks recording issues arising from his inspections. 10. Mr Barlow said in his affidavit that he does not have a clear recollection of his early inspections of the site in the 1980’s, but he recalled that the Blue Lagoon was in operation during that time. He also recalled that in about 1991, the defendant was considering the installation of a wetland to treat site effluent, and that the defendant’s intention, throughout the period 1989 - 1993, was repeatedly said to be to “‘get rid of the Blue Dam’ altogether”. In par 12 of his affidavit, Mr Barlow made the following statement: 
     
      
       
        
        In late 1992 (relatively close to the routine Christmas shutdown of the CSR site), I recall that I was informed by a CSR site representative (whose identity I cannot recall) to the effect that “the Blue Dam is seeping effluent beyond the dam walls and into the surrounding earth. 
        
       
      
    11. Upon hearing this, Mr Barlow conducted some investigations but found “no evidence that the leaching effluent had migrated beyond the boundary of the CSR site”.  12. Mr Barlow’s uncontested evidence therefore establishes that evidence of the leaking of the Blue Lagoon first came to the attention of an officer of the EPA in 1992. 13. Against that background, I turn to consider each notice of motion. The claims made by each party in relation to each of the notices of motion overlap to a considerable extent, but it is convenient to deal first with the prosecutor’s notice of motion seeking amendment of the summons. Amendment of the summons14. Mr Lloyd QC, appearing for the defendant, accepted that the Court has a discretionary power to order amendments in any proceedings, but he submitted that, in this case, the Court should refrain from exercising that power. Mr Lloyd put the defendant’s case in this respect on five grounds, and I deal with each in turn.A different offence?15. Mr Lloyd submitted that the effect of the current amendments would be to extinguish the original proceedings and to substitute new and different proceedings. He cited a number of authorities (Sydney City Council v Ilenace Pty Ltd (1984) 3 NSWLR 414; Burrell v Jacenko (1998) 99 LGERA 173; Hornsby Shire Council v Clyne (1998) 99 LGERA 432; R v Johal & Ram (1973) 1 QB 475, and R v Evans (1999) VSC 489 unreported) for the proposition that an amendment which has the effect of charging the defendant with a different offence will not be permitted, and he argued that the current amendments were in that category. 16. The basis for this claim is that the prosecutor had initially asserted that the offence with which the defendant is charged was not a continuing offence and the effect of the current amendments is to change that assertion to a claim that the offence is a continuing offence. In Mr Lloyd’s submission, this is a fundamental change in the substance and nature of the offence. The charge under s 6(1) of the EOP Act requires the prosecutor to establish, amongst other things, that there was a leak and that the leak was negligently caused by the defendant. The date or period of time upon which each of these elements is said to have occurred is, in his submission, central and fundamental to the charge, such that the alteration of these elements amounts to a new charge. 17. In considering this submission, it is important to bear in mind the precise terms of s 6(1) which are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        6(1) If a person, without lawful authority, wilfully or negligently causes any substance to leak, spill or otherwise escape (whether or not from a container) in a manner which harms or is likely to harm the environment: 
         
          
          (a) the person; and 
           
          (b) if the person is not the owner of the substance, the owner, are each guilty of an offence. 
          
         
        
       
      
    18. It is apparent that the essential nature of this offence is negligently causing a substance to leak and that it constitutes one offence (CCA No 2 par 33). The dates upon which the offence is alleged to have occurred are essential factual ingredients (Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 486). The insertion of the dates by amendment of the summons does not, however, change the essential nature of the offence. It remains one offence of causing a substance to leak. Hence although the dates are essential, their insertion by amendment does not have the effect of charging the defendant with a different offence. 19. Mr Lloyd submitted that there is an analogy between the circumstances of this case and the circumstances arising in R v Evans, in which McDonald J refused to permit amendments to particulars of counts on an indictment. In that case, the defendants had been charged with the commission of an “insider trading” crime under the Corporations Law. His Honour had previously held that there was no case to answer, on the basis that, although the defendants had a conversation with each other at a certain time, the jury could not conclude that they had at that time entered into an agreement to purchase shares (based on information not generally available), and that such an agreement could only be made when a trade or agreement to purchase securities had been achieved by the broker as agent. The prosecutor thereupon sought to amend the particulars in various ways which focussed on a subsequent time when the placing of bids was matched with offers in relation to the particular shares. One of the reasons found by McDonald J to work an injustice on the defendants was that they were, on the case made out against them in law, entitled to an acquittal, but if the amendments were permitted, the jury should be discharged and a retrial ordered to exclude any prejudice which would otherwise be suffered.  20. The circumstances of this case are entirely different. This is not a case where the current amendments would change the defendant’s position from a no case to answer and a consequent acquittal. The defendant has not yet pleaded to the charge, and the current amendments do not constitute a different charge.  21. Furthermore, the reference in the summons to s 12 of the EOP Act and the particulars as to when the offence first came to the notice of the relevant officer (which the prosecutor now seeks to omit from the summons) are not matters which are ingredients of the offence. They are procedural in the sense that they simply relate to the limitation period prescribed by the EOP Act. Section 12 in effect provides alternative starting points for the computation of the relevant limitation period. Thus, s 12(1)(a) provides that proceedings may be commenced within but not later than three years after the date on which the offence is alleged to have been committed. Section 12(2)(a), on the other hand, provides that proceedings may also be commenced within but not later than three years after the date on which evidence of the alleged offence first came to the attention of any relevant authorised officer. Accordingly, the omission of a reference to the date upon which the offence first came to the notice of the relevant officer does not fundamentally change the substance and nature of the offence with which the defendant is charged, although, as I set out later, that omission is a matter to consider in relation to a submission from the defendant that the proceedings are, in whole or part, outside the limitation period. The current amendments should therefore not be refused on the ground that they constitute a new charge. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    Without the director-general’s consent?22. Section 13 of the EOP Act provides that proceedings for an offence against that Act may be instituted only with the written consent of the EPA (which step may be carried out by the Director-General of the EPA pursuant to s 19(2) of the Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991). In this case, the Director-General consented to proceedings described in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        Proceedings for the offence, which first came to the attention of a relevant authorised officer on 6 December 1994, that at Tumut in the State of New South Wales it did, without lawful authority, negligently cause a substance to leak in a manner which harmed the environment, contrary to section 6(1) of the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act, 1989, as amended. 
        
       
      
    23. The defendant claims that the consent was limited and the current amendments will take the proceedings outside the scope of the consent, and as such should not be allowed. It is said that, if amended, the proceedings will differ from the proceedings described by the consent in four ways:1. the consent is unspecific as to the time of the alleged offence, whereas the proposed amended charge is for an offence alleged to have occurred “between 1992 and 1995”; 
     
       
    2. the consent refers to negligently causing a substance to leak in a manner which harmed the environment, whereas the proposed amended charge is of an offence “which harmed or was likely to harm the environment”;  
     
       
    3. the consent refers to an offence “which first came to the attention of a relevant authorised officer on 6 December 1994” whereas the proposed amended charge resiles from that identification and provides no information as to the date on which the offence first came to the attention of a relevant authorised officer; and 
     
       
    4. the proposed amended charge has the effect of changing the nature of the offence from being an offence committed on a number of separate and unidentified occasions to being a continuing offence. 
    24. Although the amendment of the summons to include the words “or was likely to harm” was expressly permitted by the Court of Criminal Appeal (see CCA No 2) Mr Lloyd sought to show that there was a cumulative difference between the consent and the proposed amended charge, the effect of which is to convert the proceedings from proceedings instituted with consent into proceedings instituted without consent. Mr Lloyd relied upon the following passage from the judgment of Gleeson CJ in Brownlie v State Pollution Control Commission (1992) 27 NSWLR 78 at 89: 
     
      
       
        
        Once proceedings have been instituted, the Court’s power to allow amendments cannot be exercised to change proceedings that have been instituted with consent into proceedings instituted without consent. 
         
         
        If, however, the proceedings in their amended form are in nature and substance, proceedings to the institution of which the requisite consent has been given, then the amendments are permissible: 
         Traveland Pty Ltd v Doherty (1982) 63 FLR 41; 41 ALR 563.  
        It is to be noted that in the present case the amendments did not add anything to the charge, but simply deleted the words referring to the State of Queensland. The charges as they stood with those words deleted were, in my view, still the charges that were contemplated by the consent that was given. 
          
        
       
      
    25. I do not accept the defendant’s submission. Firstly, the essential subject of the consent is one offence under s 6(1), that is, negligently causing a substance to leak. That is also the essential subject matter of the summons (cf CCA No 2 per Smart AJ par 33). The four matters raised by the defendant do not, in my opinion, either individually or cumulatively, alter the essential subject of the consent, or make the consent different in substance from the proposed amended summons. Secondly, as I have earlier concluded, the dates between which the offence is said to have occurred, although essential factual ingredients of an offence, are not critical to determining the subject matter of the offence under s 6(1). Thirdly, the amendment inserting the words “or was likely to harm” has already been ordered by the Court, and upheld upon appeal. Fourthly, the reference in the consent to the date upon which the offence first came to the attention of a relevant officer does not change the fundamental nature and substance of the offence, but instead sets the commencement date for the computation of an available limitation period under s 12 of the EOP Act (see par 21 above), and its inclusion in the consent is also not critical to the subject matter of the consent. Fifthly, the fact that the prosecutor now claims a continuing offence does not as has been discussed above, alter the essential subject matter of either the summons or the consent.  26. For these reasons, I do not consider that the amendments sought by the prosecutor will convert the proceedings into proceedings issued without consent.Prejudice to the defendant?27. There has been some confusion surrounding the prosecutor’s assertion that the offence is a continuing offence over the period from 1992 to 1995. The summons as it was framed and as it presently stands contains no such assertion, nor was any such assertion made in the course of correspondence between the parties’ solicitors concerning further and better particulars (a summary of that correspondence is contained in LEC No 1 pp 2 - 4). Indeed, as I noted in that judgment at pp 2 - 3, the defendant’s solicitors asked the prosecutor to confirm the prosecutor’s allegation that the defendant had, “on a number of separate and unidentified occasions”, placed effluent into the Blue Lagoon in circumstances where it knew or ought to have known that the Blue Lagoon would leak, and the prosecutor confirmed that this statement was correct. Furthermore, as I also noted in that judgment (at p 5) the prosecutor had not alleged a continuous offence, although in the Court of Criminal Appeal, on the subsequent stated case (CCA No 1 p 2), the prosecutor claimed that my understanding was incorrect. In cross-examination in these current proceedings, Mr P T Barley, a solicitor in the employ of the EPA who has the carriage of the proceedings on behalf of the prosecutor, stated that the prosecutor had always been of the view that the offence was a continuing one [T 5 March 2001, p 28 line 35], but it had, incorrectly, allowed a “misunderstanding” or “misapprehension” to arise out of the correspondence to which I have referred. [T 5 March 2001, p 29, line 20 - 45] 28. The prosecutor ultimately made the position clear. In the particulars which it furnished to the defendant’s solicitors on 9 February 1999, it stated that “[t]he EPA alleges that the offence was a continuing one from 1992 until the decommissioning of the Blue Lagoon”.  29. The defendant claims that it will be prejudiced if the current amendments are made. Mr Lloyd cited R v Johal & Ram (at p 481) as authority for the proposition that the longer the period between the commencement of proceedings and amendment, the more likely it is that injustice will be caused. It was put to the Court that the defendant has relied upon the summons as framed and has been preparing its case on that basis. A change of particulars, it was said, will require new evidence to support its case, which may be difficult, given the length of time that has passed since the institution of proceedings in August 1997. 30. I put aside for later the question as to whether delay both in the institution and the conduct of the proceedings has prejudiced the defendant in such a way that the Court should stay the proceedings. That is a different question. The present point is whether the delay in amending the summons, since the institution of the proceedings, and the prosecutor’s conduct in, as Mr Barley frankly called it, allowing the misapprehension to “fester”, are such that the current amendments should not now be permitted. 31. I have come to the view that there is no basis for refusing to order the current amendments on this ground. There was confusion about the precise nature of the offence, but it was unequivocally corrected in the particulars furnished on 9 February 1999, and the defendant has been on notice since then as to the nature of the offence charged. The current amendments seek to formalise the offence as a continuing offence, and although the current amendments could, and should, have been sought earlier, I am unable to discern how, if they are made now, the defendant will be prejudiced in preparing its case and determining how it wishes to plead.Out of time?32. Section 12 of the EOP Act prescribes a limitation period of three years for an offence under s 6(1) (see par 44). The defendant’s case is that the current amendments should not be allowed, because, if permitted, the proceedings will be wholly or in part outside the limitation period. In amplification of this claim and by reference to the fact that the proceedings were instituted on 1 August 1997, Mr Lloyd submitted that, if the offence is not a continuing offence, but is constituted by a number of discrete acts which complete the offence on a number of separate occasions, then, to the extent that an offence is completed on or before 31 July 1994, the proceedings are out of time. If, on the other hand, the offence is a continuing offence over the period 1992 to 1995, as the prosecutor now asserts, then, in Mr Lloyd’s submission, this involves an allegation that the offence was committed on each day during the stipulated period such that the limitation period commenced to run from each day an offence was committed. Again, to the extent that the offence is alleged to have been committed prior to 31 July 1994, it is out of time. 33. The question of whether or not the offence with which the defendant is charged is a continuing offence remains to be decided. The Court of Criminal Appeal has put beyond doubt that an offence under s 6(1) may be a continuing offence, and the offence as particularised in this case “is capable of being a continuing offence” (CCA No 2 par 52). Furthermore, the Court of Criminal Appeal, in par 53 of that decision, held that “[t]he final determination whether the offence particularised is a continuing one must await the trial and the completion of the evidence”. 34. Accordingly, the Court’s only task at present is to determine whether, by reason of a possible infringement of the limitation period, the current amendments should be refused (and, as I mention later, the proceedings stayed). I have concluded that I should reject this course, on two grounds. 35. Firstly, I am of the view that, whilst the defendant is correct in contending that a continuing offence may be the subject of prosecution on any day during the stipulated period, it is not correct in asserting that the limitation period commences to run from any day of that period. Rather, the limitation period commences to run from the day upon which the commission of the offence has ceased. Accordingly, if this offence is ultimately found to be a continuing offence, then no question of infringement of the limitation period will arise, because the period will commence to run from some date in 1995, and the proceedings were instituted within three years thereafter. 36. I have derived the proposition which I have just put from the authorities, and, in deference to the arguments of the defendant, it is appropriate to deal with them at some length. In Jones v Lorne Saw Mills Pty Ltd (1923) VLR 58, the defendant was charged with failing to observe the terms of an award in that it failed to pay award wages to one of its employees for a period during 1920. The proceedings were instituted in 1922. In response to a submission that the proceedings were out of time, it was held that the offence was a continuing one and the limitation period had not been infringed. Cussen J said at p 65 that “[I]t is sufficient to say that, in my opinion, there was here just as much non- observance in 1922 as in 1920 and the information on its face is within time”. His Honour continued at p 66 “… there is but one offence - namely, ‘non-observance’, an offence in which the time element is extensible so as to provide a real continuum”. 37. This decision was expressly approved as correct by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Industrial Appeals Court Ex parte Barelli’s Bakeries Pty Ltd (1965) VR 615 and see particularly the judgment of Smith J at p 623. See also Brammer v Deery Hotels Pty Ltd (1974) 22 FLR 276 at 278 - 279. 38. Cook v Cook (1923) 33 CLR 369 was concerned with a claim for maintenance. The husband ceased to pay maintenance under an order in 1922 and in 1923 the wife instituted proceedings to enforce compliance with the order. The information was not laid within twelve months from the time when the matter of the information arose, as required by the relevant limitation provision. It was held by Knox CJ and Starke J at p 375 that, assuming the limitation provision applied, “still the disobedience of the maintenance order is a continuing act giving a cause of complaint de die in diem”. In my respectful understanding of their Honours’ decision, the principle is not that the continuing offence was completed from day to day, but that it continued, giving a cause of complaint from day to day whilst the order was being disobeyed. In a separate judgment, Isaacs J said, at p 381, that “[D]isobedience is a continuing offence … as the order still stands and the disobedience still continues and includes (the whole amount claimed), (the whole amount) may be recovered”. 39. In Ex parte Wakefield (1927) 27 SR (NSW) 261, a claim was made upon the applicant arising out of his failure to pay maintenance for his children between certain dates. The claim was held to be subject to a limitation period which required it to be made within six months from the time when the matter of the information or complaint arose. In holding that the claim was out of time, the Court computed the limitation period from the last of the dates upon which payment had not been made.  40. In J Robins and Sons Ltd v Maloney (No 2) (1935) IR 155, Cantor J referred to a passage from the judgment of Lord Alverstone in Chepstow Electric Light and Power Co Ltd v Chepstow Gas and Coke Consumers’ Co Ltd (1905) 1 KB 198 at p 209 in which, amongst other things, the statement was made that “… I doubt whether the time of limitation can be said to begin to run where persons are continuing to disobey an order which is always operative until it is obeyed”. 41. My second reason for declining to adopt the course which the defendant urges upon the Court is that, in my opinion, it would be inappropriate to refuse to order the current amendments (or to stay the proceedings) because of a possible infringement of the limitation period. Whether or not such an infringement will arise will depend upon findings at the trial as to whether the offence is a continuing one, and it is at least possible, on the particulars thus far furnished, that it is a continuing one (see CCA No 2 pars 52 - 53).  The prosecutor’s election?42. The defendant claims that, in framing the summons to comply with s 12(3) of the EOP Act, the prosecutor elected to rely on s 12(2) and not s 12(1). The prosecutor should not be permitted, by virtue of the current amendments, to withdraw this election and change the basis of the prosecution.  43. Section 12 relevantly provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Time within which summary proceedings may be commenced 
         
         
        12(1) Proceedings for an offence against this Act may be commenced: 
         
          
          (a) in the case of a prescribed offence - within but not later than 3 years after the date on which the offence is alleged to have been committed, or 
           
          (b) in any other case - within but not later than 12 months after that date. 
          
         (2) Proceedings for an offence against this Act may also be commenced: 
          
          (a) in the case of a prescribed offence - within but not later than 3 years after the date on which evidence of the alleged offence first came to the attention of any relevant authorised officer; or 
           
          (b) in any other case - within but not later than 12 months after the date. 
          
         (3) If subsection (2) is relied on the purpose of commencing proceedings for an offence, the information or application must contain particulars of the date on which evidence of the offence first came to the attention of any relevant authorised officer and need not contain particulars of the date on which the offence was committed. The date on which evidence of the offence first came to the attention of any relevant authorised officer is the date specified in the information or application, unless the contrary is established. 
          
           
         
        
       
      
    44. Section 12(7) provides that a “prescribed offence” means an offence arising under, amongst others, div 1 of pt 2 of the EOP Act, which includes s 6(1). 45. Mr Lloyd submitted that the opening words of s 12(3) indicate a legislative intention that either s 12(1) or s 12(2) will be relied upon, and they cannot be relied upon interchangeably. Once the prosecutor has made its choice, it has made in effect an election, and that cannot now be reversed or undone, nor can reliance upon s 12(1) be substituted for reliance upon s 12(2). He relied, by analogy, on S v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 266 and Walsh v Tattersall (1996) 188 CLR 77. 46. I am unable to accept this submission. In my opinion, s 12 has a specific purpose. It provides alternative periods of limitation depending upon the particular offence, and alternative methods of computing the time from which the relevant limitation period commences to run. I cannot discern anything in the language of s 12 which would indicate that that the prosecutor must choose between the alternatives at the outset of proceedings and must thereafter be bound by that choice.  47. I agree with the submission made by Mr Rushton SC, appearing for the prosecutor, that the selection of s 12(1) or s 12(2) does not alter the substance of the offence charged, and this supports a conclusion that the prosecutor may rely upon either subsection, and is not obliged to make a binding choice. The prosecutor’s only obligation is to prove that the proceedings were commenced within the relevant limitation period. 48. I also agree with Mr Rushton that neither S v The Queen nor Walsh v Tattersall is relevant to the point. Both those cases were concerned with the form of a charge and the manner in which it was particularised, leading to a question in each case of whether the charge was latently duplicitous. This, however, is not a case where two charges have been rolled up into one, and it is not a case where the prosecutor must be required to select which of the charges it wishes to prosecute.Should the current amendments be permitted?49. In summary, for the reasons which I have set out, I conclude that there are no grounds which would justify refusing to order the current amendments. The Court has power to do so, and it would be appropriate to do so in this case.Should the proceedings be permanently stayed?50. The defendant seeks a permanent stay of the proceedings. It claims that, by reason of a combination of factors, it will not be possible for the defendant to have a fair trial. 51. There is no dispute that the Court has the power to grant a permanent stay in criminal proceedings. That power is derived from the express provision to that effect in pt 12 r 1 of the Land and Environment Court Rules as well as the from the inherent power of the Court to prevent an abuse of process and to ensure a fair trial (Jago v The District Court of New South Wales & Ors (1989) 168 CLR 23). And the defendant accepts that it bears the onus of establishing that the trial would be unfair: cf Barron v Attorney General for New South Wales & Ors (1987) 10 NSWLR 215 at 219 and 233. 52. The principles that apply in considering whether to grant a stay are well established. In Jago v The District Court Mason CJ said, at p 34: 
     
      
       
        
        To justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings, there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial  
        ‘of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences’: Barton v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR at 111 per Wilson J. 
        
       
      
    53. It is extremely rare for a court to grant a permanent stay, particularly in criminal matters: The Queen v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 593 per Mason CJ and Toohey J at p 605; Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 at p 392 - 393. The exercise of the power involves balancing the risk of unfairness to the defendant against the community expectation in criminal matters that a trial will occur: Jago v The District Court at p 33 and p 72, Walton v Gardiner at p 396. 54. Before turning to the factors put forward by the defendant as establishing that the trial will necessarily be unfair, I deal with the prosecutor’s preliminary submission that the defendant’s application for a stay is premature, because the power to grant a stay is enlivened only after a plea has been entered. In putting this submission, Mr Rushton said that the power to stay criminal proceedings presupposes that the defendant contends that it is not guilty, but that a trial as to its guilt or innocence would be manifestly unfair. He relied for this proposition upon the use of the word “trial” in the judgments of all the members of the High Court in Jago v The District Court and in particular in the passage from the judgment of Mason CJ at p 34 which I have earlier quoted. It was submitted that the proposition also arose from a passage in the judgment of Hunt J in R v Tolmie (NSWCCA, 7 December 1994, unreported) at p 4 where his Honour, by reference to Jago v The District Court at p 29, said that “[t]he right to a fair trial is entrenched in the criminal justice system, to ensure that innocent people are not convicted of criminal offences …”.  55. But the error of that proposition is demonstrated, as Mr Lloyd pointed out, by other passages from the judgment of Mason CJ in Jago v The District Court. In discussing the right of an accused person to receive a fair trial, Mason CJ, at p 29, said: [b]ut there is no reason why the right should not extend to the whole course of the criminal process …” and in a later passage at p 30, his Honour said that “… the power to prevent an abuse of process in this context is derived from the public interest…that trials and the processes preceding them are conducted fairly …”. (my emphasis) 56. I conclude, therefore, that the fact that the defendant has not yet entered a plea to the charge against it does not of itself preclude the grant of a permanent stay. I turn then to the factors which the defendant puts forward for the Court’s consideration.Loss of evidence57. The loss or destruction of evidence may be a circumstance justifying a stay of proceedings. Each case must be considered on its own facts (R v Beckford (1996) 1 Cr App R 94 at pp 102 - 103). It is not necessary to show that the missing evidence was essential to the defendant’s case, but merely that there is a risk that the defendant would not receive a fair trial as a result of that evidence being unavailable (R v Yuill (1993) 69 A Crim R 450). In R v Gajree (Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, 20 September 1994, unreported) the conviction of the defendant on a charge of rape was quashed as unsafe and unsatisfactory because, as a consequence of delay and ineptitude in the police investigation of the offence, alleged seminal staining of a carpet was not examined and, by reason of a fire, plans and photographs of the layout of the shop in which the offence was alleged to have taken place were not available. On the other hand, in R v Beckford, in an appeal against a conviction for causing death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drugs, the Court of Appeal held that, in the circumstances of the case, the absence of the car did not affect the fairness of the trial.  58. In the defendant’s submission, two evidentiary matters give rise to a risk that the trial will be unfair. The first is the removal of the Blue Lagoon, and the second is the loss of Mr Barlow’s field notebooks. 59. As to the Blue Lagoon, Mr Lloyd submitted that its removal amounts to “an evidential hole at the heart of the case” (R v Michael John T United Kingdom Court of Appeal (Criminal Division), 27 March 2000, unreported, at p 3) such that the defendant will not receive a fair trial. The defendant claims that there is a fundamental difference between the work that could have been carried out while the Blue Lagoon was in existence to establish whether and when it leaked, compared to the work that, in the absence of the Blue Lagoon, can be carried out in an endeavour to establish those matters. To prove that this is so, Mr Lloyd relied on the evidence of two experts, Mr G P Kotze, an engineering geologist, and Mr A P Lane, a hydrogeologist and environmental auditor. 60. In his affidavit, Mr Kotze specified the combined geotechnical and hydrogeological investigation that would have been possible if the Blue Lagoon was still in existence, and, by way of comparison, he specified the investigation that could be carried out now, which, instead of being based on field work and testing, would be based predominantly on reviews of information “collected for other purposes”, computer modelling and interpretation. He drew the conclusion that work which could have been carried out when the Blue Lagoon was still in existence “would have enabled a reliable and accurate determination of whether the Blue Lagoon was leaking during 1995 or had leaked in the recent past”. In contrast, the work that could be carried out now would be likely to yield results “which could only be described as inconclusive, particularly with regard to details of timing of any leakage”. 61. Mr Lane outlined in his affidavit the extent of the advice and investigation which he had provided to the defendant in 1995 in connection with groundwater problems at the site and proposed remediation. He stated that, if the Blue Lagoon was still in existence, work additional to that which he had already done would be needed to establish whether it was actually leaking in 1995 or that it had leaked in recent years before 1995. His affidavit evidence corroborated that of Mr Kotze, namely, that “… it is impossible now to obtain reliable evidence in respect of … whether the Blue Lagoon was leaking at the time of my investigations in 1995/1996; or … whether the Blue Lagoon had leaked prior to my investigations and, if so, then the likely duration of such leaking …”. 62. Mr Lane was extensively cross-examined. Despite his assertion in his affidavit that additional work would be needed to establish whether the Blue Lagoon was leaking in 1995, he ultimately conceded that there was no reasonable inference available from the reports of the investigations that were then carried out other than that the Blue Lagoon was leaking when it was removed in 1995. He conceded that he was satisfied that the Blue Lagoon was the source of contamination at that time (T 2 March 2001, p 33 line 10) and said that there was “fairly compelling evidence” of that fact (T 2 March 2001, p 42 line 20). Various parts of his investigation reports, to which he was taken during cross-examination, appear to reflect his conclusion that the Blue Lagoon was leaking. It is only necessary to quote two examples. First, Mr Lane referred, on p 7 of his report of 7 July 1995 (annexure 2 to his affidavit) to a monitoring bore, B 11, and stated that “… water most probably seeping from beneath the effluent dam, was entering the borehole …”.  In his oral evidence, Mr Lane sought to say that he had recently changed his mind about the interpretation of the fact that water was seeping into the borehole, but he conceded that when he wrote his report he meant to convey that contamination was most probably seeping from the Blue Lagoon to bore B11 located outside it. (T 2 March 2001 p 47 line 10). Secondly, on p 4 of his report of 30 April 1996 (annexure 4 to his affidavit) he produced a figure which summarised the results of monitoring of the water quality in the spring on the adjacent property, and that figure demonstrated, as Mr Lane put it on p 5 of his report, that “… the main indicators of contamination, salinity, conductivity, carbonate/bicarbonate and formaldehyde have reduced steeply (note the logarithmic scale) since the Blue Lagoon was removed in late 1995”. 63. In his affidavit, Mr Kotze drew attention to the unreliability of information “collected for other purposes”, and Mr Lloyd pointed to this opinion in order to submit that Mr Lane’s reports remain unreliable for the purpose of this prosecution. But in his April 1995 investigation report, to which I have referred, Mr Lane stated at p 8 that the “[t]he general approach will be to drill and construct a number of groundwater monitoring bores … to fingerprint the source and evaluate the significance of the impact”. Although Mr Lane endeavoured in cross-examination to resile from this and other similar statements he had made, I accept that it is obvious, as Mr Rushton submitted, that the identification of the source of the contamination was an important element of the investigation that Mr Lane carried out. 64. I am prepared to accept, from the evidence I have outlined, that investigations were in fact carried out by the defendant when the Blue Lagoon was still in existence to determine if it was the source of contamination, and those investigations indicate that it was leaking in 1995 when it was removed. I accept Mr Rushton’s submission that it is not correct to say that it is impossible to obtain evidence as to whether the Blue Lagoon was leaking when it was removed, and I therefore conclude that there is no “evidential hole at the heart of the case” which would be likely to render the trial unfair. 65. No doubt, further investigation and testing could have been done when the Blue Lagoon was in existence. However, the defendant, or at least, its advisers, were aware from an early stage that a prosecution was likely. Ms Jagot conceded in cross-examination that, when she received instructions in September 1995 in relation to the notice issued under s 24, she formed the view that a prosecution was likely (T 2 March 2001 p 17 line 50 - 51). In a report on the preparation of an environmental management plan dated 22 May 1995 and furnished to Mr M Alston, the site manager, Mr S Jenkins, a director of EnviroRisk Management, expressed his view at p 2 that “[p]rosecution at this stage is likely”.  If the defendant had genuinely believed that it would be prejudiced by the removal of the Blue Lagoon had a prosecution ensued, it could have conducted further investigations to support its position. 66. Mr Lloyd submitted that Mr Lane was not questioned about the years before the removal of the dam, so that there remains an unreliability in the evidence for the period 1992 to 1995. However, Mr Barlow’s evidence, if accepted (it has not yet been tested in cross-examination) indicates that the Blue Lagoon was leaking in 1992. I am not persuaded, in the light of these matters, that the evidence is so unreliable as to justify a permanent stay (R v Tolmie at pp 7 - 8). 67. As to the field notebooks, the evidence is unclear. Mr Barlow stated in his affidavit that he left his notebooks with the EPA. But, despite a search following a call for their production, they cannot now be found. In a file note of his conversation with Mr Barlow, Mr Enright noted as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Hand over of notebooks: I cannot recall this occurring, and Alan Wragg is definite that this did occur, as he still has in possession course notes, technical reference handed to him by Mr Barlow when his employment was terminated. 
        
       
      
    68. Mr Barley thought Mr Enright meant to say that Mr Wragg was definite that it did “not” occur (T 5 March 2001, p 19 line 15), but neither Mr Enright nor Mr Wragg were called to give evidence about their recollections. Neither was Mr Barlow called. The Court cannot know what was in the notebooks, or whether it was or was not relevant. Mr Barlow has, however, sworn an affidavit as to his recollections of his observations of the Blue Lagoon. In view of his evidence, I am not prepared to conclude that the notebooks contain vital evidence, the absence of which would so prejudice the defendant that it could not have a fair trial.Delay69. The defendant claims that delay both in commencing the prosecution and in conducting the proceedings are serious and justify a stay in the interests of the proper administration of justice. 70. As to delay before commencement of the proceedings, Mr Barlow’s evidence is that the EPA knew that the Blue Lagoon was leaking in 1992, and certainly, by 1994, Mr Monteith and Mr Enright had inspected the site. The prosecutor’s affidavits were sworn by various witness in October 1996, but the prosecution did not commence until 1 August 1997. 71. The defendant has not yet pleaded to the charge, and the trial has not yet taken place. The intervening delay since the prosecution commenced is largely the consequence of preliminary points being taken in this Court by each of the parties, and subsequent stated cases being referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, one at the request of the prosecutor and the other at the request of the defendant. 72. The principles upon which delay might justify a permanent stay of proceedings were enunciated by Lord Lane CJ in giving the opinion of the English Court of Appeal in Attorney-General’s Reference (No 1 of 1990) (1992) QB 630. At pp 643 - 644, his Lordship said: 
     
      
       
        
        In principle, therefore, even where the delay can be said to be unjustifiable, the imposition of a permanent stay should be the exception rather than the rule. Still more rare should be cases where a stay can properly be imposed in the absence of any fault on the part of the complainant or prosecution. Delay due merely to the complexity of the case or contributed to by the actions of the defendant himself should never be the foundation for a stay. 
         
         
        … no stay should be imposed unless the defendant shows on the balance of probabilities that owing to the delay he will suffer serious prejudice to the extent that no fair trial can be held; in other words, that the continuance of the prosecution amounts to a misuse of the process of the court. 
        
       
      
    73. Similar principles were expressed in R v West London Stipendiary Magistrate, Ex parte Anderson (1985) 80 Cr App R 143 at 149 and R v Oxford City Justices, Ex parte Smith (1982) 75 Cr App R 200 at 206. 74. The facts show that there has been considerable delay, both before and after the proceedings were commenced, but it is not possible in this case to find that delay has occurred solely by the conduct of one party; both the prosecutor and the defendant have been instrumental in causing delay. Furthermore, I am unable to conclude that the defendant will be prejudiced to the extent that no fair trial can be held. The defendant points to the removal of the Blue Lagoon, the loss of the field notebooks, the late amendment to the summons, and the prosecutor’s belated assertion that the offence is a continuing one. For the reasons that I have earlier dealt with, I do not find that any of these matters will cause such prejudice to the defendant that it cannot have a fair trial.Conduct of the prosecutor75. Mr Lloyd submitted that the conduct of the prosecutor was such that the proceedings should be permanently stayed. He drew attention to the following matters:(a) the conduct of the prosecutor in allowing a “misapprehension to fester” as to the continuing nature of the offence (see pars 27 and 30 above);  
     
       
    (b) the conduct of the prosecutor in allowing the defendant until about December 2000 to rely on the statement that the offence had first come to the attention of the relevant authorised officer in 1994;(c) the conduct of the prosecutor in not contacting Mr Barlow itself until after the defendant’s solicitors had called for production of the field notebooks; and 
     
       
    (d) the delay in seeking an amendment of the summons to insert the period 1992 - 1995.76. In addition to these matters, the defendant claimed that the Blue Lagoon was removed at the insistence of the EPA, and that the EPA gave the defendant no notice that it was considering prosecution. The evidence, however, appears to be to the contrary. I have already found that the defendant’s advisers were aware in 1995 that a prosecution was likely (see par 65), and, in a letter dated 21 September 1995 to the EPA, Mr Alston (the defendant’s site manager) stated that “[t]he removal of the lagoon is integral to our overall groundwater remediation strategy”. 77. The defendant did not point to any particular prejudice caused by any of the matters I have outlined above, other than its claims that I have previously dealt with, namely, the impact of the removal of the Blue Lagoon and the loss of the field notebooks. I do not consider that either of these matters justifies a finding of prejudice to the defendant which would require a permanent stay.Conclusion78. I have concluded, in accordance with the foregoing, that a permanent stay of the proceedings should not be ordered, and that the prosecutor should be permitted to amend the summons in the way that its seeks by its notice of motion. 79. Mr Lloyd in his submissions, stated that, in the event that the Court should conclude that the current amendments should be allowed, the defendant would wish to make submissions as to the terms, including costs, upon which the amendments are allowed. I take this to relate only to costs, and not to the actual form of the amendments, which, as is obvious from this judgment, were the subject of lengthy submissions. The appropriate course, then, is to reserve the question of costs. 80. Accordingly, my formal orders are as follow:(1) The defendant’s notice of motion dated 2 February 2001 is dismissed. 
     
       
    (2) I grant leave to the prosecutor to amend the summons by:(a) inserting the words “between 1992 and 1995” into paragraph 1 after the words “charge that” and prior to the words “at Tumut”; and 
     
      
       
         
       
      
    (b) removing the paragraph heading “Particulars pursuant to section 12 of the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 1989” and the paragraph immediately below that heading.(3) I reserve the question of costs. 
     
       
    (4) The exhibits may be returned.

     NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION v 
       
     SHARYN ALLANA GARDINER & ors 
      
       JUDGMENT 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: On 12 December 1996 Newman J made a restraining order pursuant to s 10 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (""the Act"") (then known as the Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Act 1990) in respect of a number of items of property set out in the schedule thereto because of a suspicion that Sharyn Allana Gardiner had engaged in ""serious crime related activity"", namely the possession and cultivation of a large number of cannabis plants.  
    2    On 20 May 1996, the said Sharyn Allana Gardiner was convicted of cultivating prohibited plants (56 plants) contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, s 23(1)(a).  
    3    On 14 July 1997 the restraining order was varied to its present form and subsequently a number of consent orders have been made relating to all items the subject of the restraining order except for $40,700 found in the house of the applicant Keith Anthony Gardiner, the former husband of Sharyn Allana Gardiner, at ""Lara"", his farming property outside Deniliquin. It is conceded by the plaintiff that these moneys are in no way related or derived from the ex-wife's drug related activities and, although at one time there was a query whether any of the money belonged to their son, James Keith Gardiner, he has been made a defendant in the proceedings and been served with all relevant documents, but he has not appeared nor made any application in respect of any part of such money, and so the plaintiff is entitled to proceed in his absence. 
    4    Pursuant to paras 13, 14 and 15 of the Amended Summons filed 13 December 1996 as amended by the Second Amended Summons filed 15 July 1997, the plaintiff (the New South Wales Crime Commission) now seeks orders pursuant to s 22 of the Act forfeiting and vesting in the Crown the interests in property specified in the restraining order.  
    5    The only defendant who has opposed the making of the forfeiture orders is the applicant, and by Amended Notice of Motion filed in Court on 21 February 2001 he seeks exclusion orders pursuant to ss 25 or 26 in respect of the $40,700 seized from his house at ""Lara"" on 7 December 1996. This is the only interest in the property of the applicant which is still in dispute. All issues in respect of the other interests in property of his referred to in the restraining order have been resolved. 
    6    The plaintiff concedes that the $40,700 is the property of the applicant and that it is not in any way the proceeds of drug related activity, but opposes the making of the exclusion orders on the ground that although not the proceeds of ""serious crime related activity"" it is ""illegally acquired property"" within the meaning of the Act in that it is the proceeds of perverting the course of justice and perjury by the applicant in proceedings in the Equity Division of this Court.  
    7    Section 10 of the Act provides for the making of restraining orders if it is suspected that a person has engaged in a ""serious crime related activity"", not only against the property of such person but also against the property of a number of other people: s 10(2)(b). If there is a restraining order in force the court may make an assets forfeiture order: s 22; and must do so if it finds that the person whose ""serious crime related activity"" which formed the basis of the restraining order was at any time within 6 years before the making of the application convicted of a ""serious crime related activity"", which includes offences under s 23, Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. This condition has been satisfied in the present case and the plaintiff is entitled to an assets forfeiture order. 
    8    Under s 25 a person whose interest in property is affected, or may be affected, by an assets forfeiture order, may apply for an “exclusion order” which has the effect of excluding the interest from the operation of the assets forfeiture order, but s 25(2) provides that the court must not make an exclusion order unless it is proved that it is more probable than not that the interest in property to which the application relates is not “illegally acquired property”; which means in effect that it is not the proceeds of an “illegal activity"" or wholly or partly acquired using illegally acquired property: s 9; which includes an act or omission which constitutes an offence (including a common law offence) against the laws of New South Wales or the Commonwealth: s 4(1). So, although the making of a restraining order requires ""serious crime related activity"", the making of an exclusion order under s 25 will be defeated by ""illegal activity"", the onus being on the applicant to negative such illegal activity. Compare Jeffrey v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (1995) 79 A Crim R 514, a case under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth), a statute with a somewhat similar structure although the language and the arrangement of the sections is different. 
    9    Reference should also be made to the definition of “proceeds” in s 4; where they are defined as including ""any . . . advantage or benefit, that is derived or realised, directly or indirectly, as a result of the activity”. 
    10    Applying these various definitions, it can therefore be seen that an applicant for an exclusion order under s 25 must show on the balance of probabilities that the interest in property to which the application relates is not all or part of any advantage or benefit derived or realized, directly or indirectly, as a result of an act or omission which constituted an offence against a law of New South Wales or the Commonwealth, and that it was not wholly or partly acquired by using any advantage or benefit derived or realized, directly or indirectly, as a result of such activity. 
    11    Although exclusion orders under s 25 can be made before or (subject to certain restrictions) after the making of an assets forfeiture order, orders under s 26 can only be made after a forfeiture order. That section, so far as presently material, provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
       (1) If it is proved that it is more probable than not that a specified proportion of the value of an interest in property that has been forfeited under an assets forfeiture order is not attributable to the proceeds of an illegal activity, the Supreme Court may:  
        
         
         (a) make a declaration to that effect, and 
          
         (b) order that the person who has forfeited the interest is entitled to be paid the proportion of the proceeds of sale of the interest that is specified in the declaration. 
         
        
       (2) Any such declaration is to be made on the basis of the extent to which the interest in property concerned was not, when it first became illegally acquired property, acquired using the proceeds of an illegal activity. 
        
       (3) The Supreme Court may make a declaration and order under this section in relation to an interest in property on the application of the person whose interest it was when forfeited under an assets forfeiture order . . . 
        
       
      
    12    The principles by which legislation such as this is to be construed are set out in Director of Public Prosecutions v Logan Park Investments Pty Ltd (1995) 37 NSWLR 118 and Jeffrey v Director of Public Prosecutions supra, both cases under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth), and it is not necessary to repeat them here. 
    13    The applicant is the son of the late Wallace and Decima Gardiner who died on 30 March 1982 and 29 June 1987 respectively. Following his father's death he commenced proceedings in the Equity Division no. 2831 of 1987 seeking provision under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act 1916 out of his father's estate, and following the death of his mother he commenced proceedings in the same Division no. 2753 of 1988 seeking similar provision out of his mother's estate pursuant to the Family Provision Act 1982. Such proceedings were set down for hearing together on 7 February 1994, but on that day they were settled on terms favourable to the applicant. 
    14    Leading up to and during the course of such proceedings the applicant started accumulating cash funds in the safe in his house because (as he said in his Statement of Affairs, Ex. 1) ""he did not want easily identifiable funds in bank accounts"" during such proceedings. See also paragraph 14 of his affidavit of 19 August 1998. 
    15    Then on 19 November 1992 the money in the safe amounting to $85,000 was placed in a bank account with the Westpac Bank at Deniliquin, account no. 401365 in the name of the son, James Keith Gardiner, as trustee for the applicant. 
    16    In an affidavit in the Equity proceedings sworn 19 September 1988 the applicant purported to list his assets as at the dates of his father's death, his mother's death and the affidavit, but he made no reference to the money being accumulated in the safe or the other bank accounts from which it was over time accumulated, and on 4 February 1994 he caused his then solicitors to forward to the solicitors for the executors an unsworn draft affidavit (Ex. G) which the accompanying letter said would be sworn on the morning of the hearing. This draft affidavit made no reference to the trust account held in the name of his son to which I have referred which the relevant bank statements (Ex. K) show was at that time in credit in the sum of $118,024.49. 
    17    The proceedings were settled on terms favourable to the applicant and I am satisfied as a matter of inference that the terms of the settlement were more beneficial to the applicant than they would have been if the executors and those representing them had been aware of the applicant's true financial position. I am therefore satisfied that in swearing the affidavit of 19 September 1988 the applicant was guilty of either perjury or false swearing contrary to ss 327 or 330 of the Crimes Act 1900; and by deliberately ""hiding"" the money, firstly in the safe and subsequently in the trust account, by not disclosing such funds in the said affidavit, and by causing his solicitors to forward the draft affidavit which was likewise misleading in failing to disclose the funds in the trust account, I am satisfied that the applicant was guilty of perverting the course of justice contrary to s 319 of that Act, or at least of attempting to commit such offence - see The Queen v Rogerson (1991) 174 CLR 268 at 280. 
    18    The benefits which the applicant obtained out of the settlement over and above what he would have obtained if he had made full and honest disclosure of his assets were the proceeds of illegal activity and were therefore ""illegally acquired property"" within the meaning of s 9 of the Act. The extent to which he improperly benefited from the settlement cannot be precisely ascertained but it would have been at least tens of thousands of dollars. 
    19    That however was in 1994 and the issue on this application is not related to money in the trust account at that time, but to whether the money in the applicant's house ($40,000 in the safe and $700 in a bedroom) in December 1996 was illegally acquired property. The two amounts may be considered together because, according to the applicant, the $700 was the repayment of a loan to his daughter for the purchase of a car and the money for the loan had itself come from the safe. 
    20    As the Act makes clear, the onus is on the applicant of proving on the balance of probabilities that the money was not illegally acquired property or the proceeds of illegal activity, and the plaintiff submits that as the $85,000 or thereabouts originally deposited in the trust account was later used to acquire the particular bank notes amounting to $40,700 found in the applicant's house, these moneys were also ""illegally acquired"" property. It submits that it does not matter that there were numerous other transactions in the meantime; the applicant carries the onus of proof and has failed to prove that the bank notes in the house came wholly from legal activities, and not at least in part indirectly from the proceeds of the $85,000 transferred to the trust account some four years previously. 
    21    As the applicant carries the onus of proof (i.e. to prove the negative) it is necessary to make a finding on his credibility. Although he lied in his affidavit and proposed affidavit in the Equity proceedings, and although he declined to answer a number of questions because the answers may have tended to incriminate him, I am satisfied that when he did answer questions in these proceedings such answers were generally and substantially true, and I reach this conclusion largely because he did in his evidence make a number of concessions against his interest, although reluctantly, and his answers were generally consistent with his tax returns and bank statements. 
    22    The plaintiff points to three withdrawals from the trust account totalling $10,799 which the evidence discloses went directly into the safe; and also to two withdrawals from the trust account in 1994 totalling $60,000 which were deposited into the applicant's working account (no. 400610 at Westpac Bank, Deniliquin - Ex. J) out of which three withdrawals totalling $59,000 found their way into the safe at the applicant's house; and submits that I should therefore find that the $40,700 all came indirectly from the trust account and therefore from the illegal activities associated with the Equity proceedings. 
    23    In my opinion there are at least two problems with this approach; firstly, if the approach were correct there should have been $69,799 in the house, not $40,700; and secondly, the analysis ignores the fact that a lot of other money, including legitimate income from rice, wheat and wool growing was deposited to the appellant's working account (no. 400610), so that the $59,000 withdrawn from that account could have all come from legitimate sources.  
    24    Over many years the applicant has been a successful primary producer as shown by the income tax returns prepared by his accountant and the deposits to his working bank account no. 400610 at Westpac Bank, Deniliquin. He has had a lot of legitimate income passing through that account and I am satisfied that some of it has found its way into the safe in the house. His gross income from legitimate sources from 1991 to 1996 was $900,000 and his tax returns for 1995 and 1996 confirm gross income of over $150,000 per year; and although based on the tax returns his net income over expenditure appears small, this can be explained by the purchase of expensive farm machinery and such like which for taxation purposes had to be depreciated at a designated rate, and by other particular factors. 
    25    Taking all these matters into account I am satisfied that, subject to three amounts, it is more probable than not that the balance of the money in the house seized by police on December 1996 was the proceeds of legitimate farming activities and was not the ""proceeds"" as defined in s 4 of illegal activities. 
    26    However, in relation to the three amounts of $3,750 on 6 April 1994, $5,560 on 14 June 1995, and $1,489 on 28 June 1996, totalling $10,799, withdrawn from account no. 401365 (the trust account) which on the applicant's own evidence went directly into the safe, he has not so satisfied me. I realise there were other payments in and out of the safe between these withdrawals and the seizure of the money on 7 December 1996, but the applicant carries the onus, and in respect of these amounts he has failed to satisfy me that an amount in the safe equal to the total of these amounts was not a benefit derived directly or indirectly as a result of the illegal activity involved in hiding assets at the time of the Equity proceedings. 
    27    That however does not entitle the applicant to an exclusion order in respect of the balance pursuant to s 25(2). Not only does that section refer to interests in property without reference to parts or proportions of such interests, but when s 9(4) is applied to s 9(1)(c), and that provision is in turn applied to s 21(2), it becomes necessary for the applicant to prove on the balance of probabilities that the money in the house was not wholly or partly acquired using any advantage or benefit derived directly or indirectly from an illegal activity. As part of the money in the house was on my findings so derived the whole of the interest in property being the money in the house is ""illegally acquired property"" for the purposes of s 25(2). 
    28    But s 26 is in somewhat different terms. It refers specifically to a ""specified proportion"" of the value of an interest in property and authorises the making of an order under the section if it is proved that it is more probable than not that such a specified proportion is not attributable to the proceeds of an illegal activity. For the reasons already given I consider it more probable than not that, apart from the three amounts totalling $10,799 withdrawn from the trust account and placed directly into the safe, the moneys in the house were the proceeds of legitimate farming operations and not attributable to the proceeds of illegal activity. 
    29    It follows that the applicant is therefore entitled to a declaration and order under s 26(1) in respect of a specified proportion being the balance of the money in the house namely $29,901, but such declaration and order can only be made after the forfeiture order is made. 
    30    I shall stand the proceedings over for the parties to bring in short minutes of declarations and orders to give effect to this judgment.

      Regina v Jesse Graeme BLACKMAN and Clinton John WALTERS 
     The respondent, Blackman, pleaded guilty to one count of accessory before the fact of break, enter and steal; one count of accessory after the fact of break, enter and steal, and one count of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon. He was ordered to enter a good behaviour bond for a period of four years for counts 1 and 2. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment (suspended) for the armed robbery offence.The respondent, Walters, pleaded guilty to one count of break, enter and steal and one count of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon. He was similarly ordered to enter into a good behaviour bond for the offence of break, enter and steal and was given a suspended sentence of two years for the armed robbery offence on the same terms as Blackman. The Crown appeals against the sentences imposed on the grounds that (1) the sentences were manifestly lenient; (2) the sentencing Judge erred in “eliding” the two steps involved in ordering that the sentence for the armed robbery offence be suspended; (3) the objective criminality involved was such that the sentence for armed robbery should not have been suspended. HELD (Appeal dismissed): Ground 1: sentences passed were manifestly lenientThe imposition of a non-custodial sentence for armed robbery is justifiable only where exceptional circumstances are shown. In each case there were powerful subjective circumstances and the sentencing Judge was entitled to find that the position of each respondent was wholly exceptional. The respondents were very much junior partners in the exercise and their complicity was attributable to their immaturity at the time of the offence. Moreover, each had achieved a remarkable level of rehabilitation. There was every reason to suppose that to send them to gaol would have been more likely to turn them towards a criminal way of life, than to maintain the degree of rehabilitation which each had, of his own efforts and initiative achieved.The protection of the community is contributed to by the successful rehabilitation of offenders. This aspect of sentencing should never be lost sight of and it assumes particular importance in the case of first offenders and others who have not developed settled criminal habits. Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; Taylor CA Qld 20 August 1999; Edwards (1993) 67 A Crim R 487; Blocki (1991) 56 SASR 250; Blanco (1999) NSWCCA 121; Kovacevic (2000) 11 A Crim R 131; Yardley and Betts (1979) 22 SASR 108 applied. Ground 2: Two step process Two distinctive steps are involved in sentencing; a primary determination that a sentence of imprisonment is called for; and a determination that such a term of imprisonment should be suspended. In the present case the sentencing Judge did not expressly go through the two step process. However, there was no basis to suppose that his Honour erred in looked for a soft option which allowed him to choose the maximum sentence for which suspension was permissible, instead of imposing the sentence which he considered was required.Dinsdale (2000) 175 ALR 315; JCE (2000) NSWCCA 498 applied. Ground 3: Whether suspension of sentence was inappropriateIn exercising discretion to suspend a sentence, it is proper to have regard to the factors pointing towards rehabilitation, however, it is also necessary to give consideration to the objective seriousness and matters of aggravation of the offence. It was not inappropriate in this case for the sentences to be suspended.Dinsdale (2000) 175 ALR 315; JCE (2000) NSWCCA 498 applied. ORDERS PROPOSED(1) Appeal dismissed.

       Regina v Jesse Graeme BLACKMAN and  
        
        
       Clinton John WALTERS 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1   STEIN JA: I agree in every respect with the judgment of Wood CJ at CL, which I have had the benefit of reading in draft. 
     2   WOOD CJ at CL: The Crown appeals against the leniency of the sentences imposed by Kirkham DCJ, in the District Court at Tamworth, on 13 October 2000, in respect of the respondents Jesse Graeme Blackman and Clinton John Walters. 
     3   In the case of Blackman, there were pleas of guilty entered to one count of accessory before the fact of break enter and steal, for which the maximum available sentence was fourteen years imprisonment; to one count of accessory after the fact of break enter and steal, for which the maximum sentence was five years imprisonment; and to one count of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, for which the maximum available sentence was twenty-five years imprisonment. For the first and second of those offences the respondent was ordered to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of four years. For the offence of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, a sentence of imprisonment for two years was passed, which was suspended upon condition that he enter into a good behaviour bond. 
     4   In the case of Walters, he pleaded guilty to one count of break, enter and steal and to one count of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon. He was similarly ordered to enter into a good behaviour bond for the offence of break, enter and steal which also carried a maximum available sentence of imprisonment for fourteen years; and given a suspended sentence of the same duration, and upon the same terms as that applicable to Blackman for the offence of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon.  
     5   In the case of each respondent an intention to plead guilty to the relevant charges had been made clear from at least 14 August 2000, and possibly from as early as 13 June 2000. 
      
       
      Facts 
       
     6   The offences of the two respondents arose in the following circumstances. Between 23 and 28 December 1997, they, and one Darren Taylor, went to premises at 231 Manilla Road Tamworth, which were owned by Mr. Reid, the president of the local gun club, but which were unoccupied at the time. They gained entry, but after an inspection, left. 
     7   A day or so later Blackman was contacted by both Walters and Taylor and informed that these two offenders had been back to the premises and had stolen the floor safe which contained a number of handguns, a quantity of ammunition, and some personal items. The safe was said to be at Walters home. 
     8   Blackman went straight over to Walter’s home where he saw the safe sitting on a tarpaulin. A fourth person attended with grinding disks which Walters, Blackman and Taylor then used, in conjunction with an angle grinder, to open the safe. After it was opened its contents were removed, and it was then dumped at the local tip. 
     9   When Mr. Reid returned to his home he found the safe to be stolen and reported that fact to police. His next door neighbour was Taylor’s mother, with whom Mr. Reid had left a key to the rear door, so that she could look after the premises and feed his pets. Taylor was living with his mother at the time, and obviously knew that the premises were vulnerable. 
     10   Armed with some of the weapons obtained from the safe, and also with a softball bat and a cricket bat, Blackman, Walters and Taylor made their way, at about midnight on 1 January 1997, to premises at 28 Melissa Avenue, Tamworth, where they expected to find a hydroponic cannabis installation, as well as cash. Each was disguised. Blackman and Taylor, it would seem, entered the premises, while Walters, it would seem, remained outside. 
     11   There were five occupants of this house including MG, his two adult sons RG and JG, and two females AG (the partner of JG) and a teenager CB. There was no evidence to suggest that the information or belief which took the offenders to the premises had any substance to it.  
     12   The accounts of the victims, which his Honour accepted as more reliable than the version of events given by the respondents to police, painted a very frightening picture of a home invasion in which demands were made, and weapons were used in a threatening way. 
     13   RG said that the offenders arrived while he was watching television. A knock at the front door was heard. GB went to the door and it was pushed open. She saw two and possibly three men outside, one of whom, Taylor, the sentencing Judge found, was carrying a handgun and wearing a balaclava and a dark trench coat. The second person, who his Honour found was Blackman, was similarly dressed in dark clothing. CB screamed and ran from the doorway, but tripped and fell to the ground. She later saw JG lying face down on the hallway with a pistol pressed to his head by a man who yelled out “where’s the hydro?”. 
     14   Upon hearing CB’s scream, RG said that he also went to the front door. He saw a tall man with a black balaclava come through that door, carrying a firearm which was about half a meter in length. He tried to retreat but was struck on the back and knocked to the ground. He heard a male voice say “where’s your hyde (sic) and where’s your money?”. He responded “my wallet’s on the table, just take it and go”. When he turned around he saw another shorter man, whose face was covered by a bandanna, and who was carrying a pistol. 
     15   JG and AG said that they had already gone to bed. When JG heard CB’s scream, he opened their bedroom door, from which position he saw CB crouched on the floor of the hallway, and two males standing nearby. The nearest of these to him lifted his hand, pointed a gun at him, and instructed him to get down on the floor. He noticed that his partner AG was, at that point, lying in a foetal position up against a wardrobe in his father’s room, crying and shaking. He heard persistent demands being made for the hydroponic system and drugs. In the meantime, the male, who his Honour found was Taylor, stood over him with the barrel of the gun up against the back of his head. The second male questioned him as to the ownership of the house and as to the presence of “hydro” and drugs. 
     16   AG similarly described being in bed with JG when she heard CB scream. When JG opened their bedroom doors she saw a man standing there carrying a long firearm and wearing a long khaki coloured coat. He yelled “put your head down, put your head down”. She saw the man leaning over JG, with a gun at his head, asking “where’s the hydro set up, where’s the money?” 
     17   MG, who was visiting the premises, had similarly gone to bed before the others. When he opened his eyes, after hearing CB scream, he saw a tall male wearing a balaclava and greatcoat standing in the doorway of his room with a pistol pointed at him. He got up and saw JG lying on the hallway floor, with the man who had come into his bedroom bending over him, with a pistol against his head, asking for drugs and money. A second man came to the bedroom doorway and looked in. He was wearing a scarf or bandanna over his face and was carrying a shortened rifle or shotgun. 
     18   When interviewed by police, Blackman said that while he had a gun with him, it remained in his pocket, as he did not feel comfortable pointing it at anyone. He acknowledged that he did carry a softball bat. Walters said that he had a cricket bat as well as a firearm, and that Blackman had a pistol. It was his account that Taylor, who was carrying a few firearms, had the responsibility of rounding up the occupants, that Blackman was to search the premises, and that he, Walters, was to stand by the door. He said that soon after Blackman and Taylor entered the house, he told Taylor that he was leaving, realising that it was all a horrible mistake. Taylor castigated him for addressing him by his first name. He returned to their vehicle where, a short time later, he was joined by Taylor. They left and picked up Blackman later. 
     19   Blackman gave a slightly different version, which his Honour described as “rather confused”. It was his account that it was Taylor and Walters who first entered the premises, and that it was Walters who was forcefully making inquiries about the hydroponically grown cannabis. 
     20   His Honour accepted the evidence of the victims in finding that it was Taylor and Blackman who were inside the premises, menacing the occupants. He found, however, that there had been a joint criminal enterprise between all three men, the ringleader of which was Taylor. These offences he said had to be viewed in a “very serious light”. This was an entirely appropriate description of what amounted to a home invasion in the middle of the night, in which law abiding and innocent victims were each subjected to an experience that could only have been absolutely terrifying.  
     21   As his Honour observed, the premises had been targeted in mistake, there being no reason to suppose that drugs were being grown or held there. Even had the contrary been the case, that would not have provided any excuse for a violent invasion of domestic premises of the kind which here occurred. Nor would it have provided any basis for mitigation of the seriousness of the conduct of the three offenders. 
     22   The significant degree of criminality involved was recognised by his Honour. However, in the case of each offender, he found that there were impressive subjective features present to a degree which justified a departure from the sentences which might otherwise have been expected. 
     23   In part, they depended upon the circumstance that although the offences occurred in December 1997, and the respondents came under suspicion as the result of a call, possibly from an unidentified and uncharged co-offender, to Crime Stoppers in May 1998, they were not arrested until May and June 2000. No explanation was provided to the sentencing Judge, or to this Court, for the delay in the investigation of the very serious offences involved. 
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
       
     24   In the case of Walters, the relevant subjective circumstances were as follows: 
      
       
      a) he was twenty years of age at the time of the offences, and twenty-three years old when he appeared for sentence; 
       
       
      b) he had no prior criminal convictions, had never been under previous adverse police notice and had not reoffended; 
       
       
      c) his involvement in the offences was said to be attributable to some financial difficulty that he was experiencing; 
       
       
      d) he was easily influenced by Taylor; 
       
       
      e) he did not use drugs but was mistakenly led to believe that, since the armed robbery offence was to be directed against a person who supposedly was a drug dealer, its seriousness was diminished; 
       
       
      f) he admitted his involvement in all offences immediately when confronted by police; 
       
       
      g) he offered to assist the authorities in bringing Taylor and another man to justice, and thereafter provided significant assistance in accordance with the contents of sealed documents, notwithstanding subsequent serious threats to his person on the part of Taylor; 
       
       
      h) he pleaded guilty to the charges at the earliest opportunity; 
       
       
      i) by reason of his assistance and his undertaking to give evidence against Taylor, he would need to serve his sentence in protective custody, with all of the hardships and loss of opportunity for progression through the classification system and access to programs, that such circumstance would entail; 
       
       
      j) without his confession, it is improbable that the authorities would have been able to prove his guilt - a matter of considerable importance, for the reasons explained in  
      Ellis 
       (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. 
       
       
      k) he had demonstrated considerable remorse for his offending, and had written an apology to the victims; 
       
       
      l) he had remained crime free since the offences, and in fact had established an extremely creditable record of service as a soldier in the Regular Army, a circumstance attested to by a most impressive, and extensive volume of references from both commissioned and non commissioned officers with whom he has served; 
       
       
      m) his father gave evidence that after having joined the army, he had matured significantly, having overcome the effects of the teasing as a child that had been attributed to his height, and the drowning of sister which had had a long term effect upon him. 
       
     25   In the case of Blackman, the relevant subjective circumstances were as follows: 
      
       
      a) he was seventeen years of age at the time of the offence, and twenty years old when he appeared for sentence; 
       
       
      b) he similarly had no prior convictions and had hitherto not come under adverse police notice; 
       
       
      c) his family background had been difficult, so far as his mother had become depressive and suicidal after the breakdown of her marriage, with the consequence that the family environment had become unstable; 
       
       
      d) he had returned to school to complete his Higher School Certificate; 
       
       
      e) when confronted by police, he also immediately admitted his complicity, without which the authorities may not have been able to prove his guilt; 
       
       
      f) his plea was offered at the first available opportunity; 
       
       
      g) he too had given assistance and had offered to give evidence against Taylor, although this assistance was assessed as being of a lesser value than that offered by Walters; 
       
       
      h) his remorse was genuine, and like Walters, he had experienced considerable misgivings soon after entering the premises; 
       
       
      j) he had been easily led by Taylor; 
       
       
      k) he had secured employment as an assistant chef and had an opportunity to complete an apprenticeship in that field; 
       
       
      l) he had not re-offended; 
       
       
      m) there was available character evidence from family friends that was entirely favourable and held out the expectation that if, given the chance, he would become a law abiding member of the society. 
       
     26   In his case, he was a child, within the meaning of the Children’s (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, to whom S6 and the special principles recognised in GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 were, accordingly, applicable. 
     27   It was by reference to those circumstances that his Honour imposed the sentences, and made the orders previously mentioned, recognising that they were particularly lenient, but pointing out to each offender that this was the one chance in life that they were likely to receive with these sorts of offences, and that they were being given an “opportunity in very rare circumstances, exceptional circumstances to make good.” 
     28   The Crown in pursuing these appeals recognises that there were present, in the case of each respondent, very powerful subjective circumstances. Nevertheless, it submitted that: 
      
       
      a) the sentences passed were manifestly lenient; 
       
       
      b) his Honour erred in “eliding” the two steps involved in ordering that the sentence for the S 97(2) offence be suspended; and that 
       
       
      c) the objective criminality involved was such that the sentence for the S 97(2) offence should not have been suspended. 
       
       
      Inadequacy of Sentence 
       
     29   The S 97(2) offence here involved was a particularly aggravated form of the offence having regard to the nature and degree of the violence threatened, and also having regard to the fact that it involved a home invasion of a very frightening nature. 
     30   Of particular relevance in this regard were the observations in Broxham NSWCCA 3 April 1986, cited with approval in Bavadra (2000) NSWCCA 292: 
      
       
        
        “The prevalence of the offence in respect of which the applicant was sentenced is matter of grave social concern … It is now well recognised that the victims of such armed robberies or attempted armed robberies may suffer devastating psychological damage consequent upon the trauma necessarily involved with the commission of such offences. In these circumstances sentencing judges will be recreant to the trust which the community places in them, were they not to impose sentences consistent with the seriousness and prevalence of such offences.” 
        
       
     31   Equally relevant was the warning given by Abadee J in Li NSWCCA 9 July 1997 (a break enter and steal case) at pp 7 and 8, and similarly that given by Lee CJ at CL in Cue Thanh Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128, in relation to the strong stand that this Court expects to be taken in relation to home invasion offences. In the latter decision, Lee CJ at CL said (at 135): 
      
       
        
        “The crimes, on any view, were of great gravity; they are crimes for which the legislature has prescribed heavy penalties. They are crimes which are becoming all too frequent. Day and night people live in fear and terror of being assaulted and robbed in their own homes. Frequently this class of offence along with robberies of commercial premises are committed by persons who have barely entered upon manhood. Whilst the early background of each respondent merits sympathy and understanding it can not be used to cloak or disguise the fact that the actions of the respondents and the other men involved can only properly be described as the actions of a gang of thugs and armed thugs at that, violently invading the home of the victims and rendering them helpless.” 
        
       
     32   The criminality involved in an offence of armed robbery is such that, consistently with a long line of sentencing principle laid down in cases such as: Ellis (1993) 68 A Crim R 449; Maddocks NSWCCA 25 November 1993; Roberts (1994) 73 A Crim R 306; Atonio (1999) NSWCCA 266 ; Webster (1999) NSWCCA 313; Doorey (2000) NSWCCA 456; and Readman (1990) 47 A Crim R 181, significant sentences of imprisonment, of a full time nature, might in fact and law reasonably have been expected here in the case of each offender. 
     33   As was reaffirmed in Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at para 113, the imposition of a non custodial sentence for such offences is justifiable only where most exceptional circumstances are shown. Moreover, that sentence might have been expected to have been one in excess of the four to five year guideline there laid down for the lesser S 97(1) offence, since there were here present circumstances of the kind which Spigelman CJ recognised, at para 170, as potentially aggravating. They related to the number of offenders, the number and nature of the weapons carried, the vulnerability of the victims who were entitled to feel secure in their home, the obvious planning involved, and the intensity of the threats. The need also for a proportionate increase in the guideline to reflect the aggravated version of the offence charged would have the support of his Honour’s observations in McKinney (1999) NSWCCA 51 at para 14. 
     34   Additionally, there was the circumstance compounding the total criminality, that each offender had been involved in the serious break, enter and steal offences also charged, a matter that normally would attract some additional punishment: Wheeler (2000) NSWCCA 34 per Sully J, at paras 36 to 37. 
     35   Latent error of law, it was submitted, was demonstrated in these circumstances, when the sentencing orders were compared with the maximum available penalties and with the guideline. This, it was submitted, may have been related to an element of double counting when giving each applicant top of the range allowances of 50% for assistance, and of 25% for the pleas, notwithstanding the cautions expressed in this regard in S (2000) 111 A Crim R 225 at 228, and Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 per Gleeson CJ at 227 to 228. 
     36   Further, it was submitted, his Honour may have allowed the subjective circumstances of the case to overwhelm his primary duty of giving appropriate weight to the objective circumstances of the crimes involved. The consequence, it was put, meant that he failed to ensure that the sentences accorded with the general moral sense of the community, or to ensure that they provided a sufficient deterrent to the respondents and others minded to engage in similar criminality: Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594 at 598 and Dodd (1999) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. 
     37   These are submissions of very considerable weight, as is the related submission that, while special consideration needed to be given when sentencing young offenders, since the interests of punishment and deterrence in such cases generally weigh less heavily than that of rehabilitation: (See S6 Children’s (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, and GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 at 116, which were applicable to Blackman; as well as C, S & T NSW CCA 12 October 1989, Wilkie NSW CCA 2 July 1992, and XYJ NSWCCA 15 June 1992); nevertheless these principles have less weight in the case of offenders approaching the age of adulthood, particularly when they behave as adults Tran (1999) NSWCCA 109 at para 10 and 12, Nguyen NSWCCA 14 April 1994; and SDM NSW CCA 4 August 1997.  
     38    In Pham and Ly Lee CJ at CL said: 
      
       
        
        “It is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court’s function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes. It is appropriate to refer to the decision of  
        Williscroft 
         [1975] VR 292 at 299, where the majority of the Full Court of Victoria expressed the view that, notwithstanding the enlightened approach that is now made to sentencing compared to earlier days, the concept of punishment, ie coercive action is fundamental to correctional treatment in our society."" 
        
       
       
      See also  
      Webb 
       NSW CCA 12 September 1997, and  
      Mastronardi  
      (2000) NSWCCA 12, which confirm that youth cannot be used as a cloak of convenience to enable an offender to shelter from accepting proper responsibility for his or her criminal behaviour.  
       
     39   On the other hand, the decision in Henry, which in my view is of continuing relevance in relation to young offenders (I do not consider Sua 2000 NSWCCA 94 to be an authority to the contrary), does admit of the imposition of non-custodial sentences where exceptional circumstances exist, and (at para 373) notes some instances where that has occurred; see also Govinden (1999) 106 A Crim R 314 and Griggs (2000) 113 A Crim R 233. 
     40   It is upon the existence of exceptional circumstances that this appeal turns. As I have observed there were, in each case, powerful subjective circumstances as well as other circumstances suggesting that Blackman and Walters were very much the junior partners in the enterprise, having been unduly influenced by Taylor. There is also support for the view that their complicity was, to a considerable measure, attributable to their immaturity and was quite out of character for each of them. 
     41   There is precedent elsewhere for Courts of Criminal Appeal upholding similar sentencing orders where the respondent is a youthful first offender for whom there are exceptionally good prospects of rehabilitation, and where there is genuine remorse, see e.g. Taylor CA Qld 20 August 1999, Edwards (1993) 67 A Crim R 487; and see also Blocki (1991) 56 SASR 250 for an example of a case where the prospects of rehabilitation were held to justify suspension of a sentence, and in that sense to prevail over the deterrent aspects of punishment. 
     42   Here there is the additional circumstance of delay between offence and arrest, which each respondent used to break away from his criminal associates, and to demonstrate actual and substantial rehabilitation. Although no detriment was occasioned to either of them by reason of the delay, cf Johnson NSW CCA 16 May 1997, V NSW CCA 28 February 1998, it was nevertheless relevant, as this Court explained in Blanco (1999) NSW CCA 121, for his Honour to take into account the substantial change in each respondent in his attitude towards life, as well as their immediate response in admitting their culpability and in providing assistance (see also Gannon NSWCCA 29 August 1984, per Street CJ at p 3, and Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 also per Street CJ). 
     43   Although expressed in the context of a social security fraud case, the South Australian Full Court, in Kovacevic (2000) 111 A Crim R 131 at 139, reiterated that while general deterrence may loom large in determining an appropriate sentence, (as it certainly must in the case of an armed robbery) nevertheless: 
      
       
        
        “… there is still a need to consider all aspects of the matter, and to consider the interests of society and of the offender in the rehabilitation of the offender. Also, in an appropriate case, there may be room for the exercise of mercy and leniency….” 
         
        
       
     44   The Full Court also cited (at 147) with approval the following passage from the judgment of King CJ in Yardley v Betts (1979) 22 SASR 108 at 112-3: 
      
       
        
        “The protection of the community is also contributed to by the successful rehabilitation of offenders. This aspect of sentencing should never be lost sight of and it assumes particular importance in the case of first offenders and others who have not developed settled criminal habits. If a sentence had the effect of turning an offender towards a criminal way of life, the protection of the community is to that extent impaired. If the sentence induces or assists an order to avoid offending in future, the protection of the community is to that extent enhanced. To say that the criminal law exists for the protection of the community is not to say that severity is to be regarded as the sentencing norm…” 
        
       
     45   This has particular relevance for the present case. His Honour was, in my view, entitled to find that the position of each respondent was wholly exceptional, and that each had achieved a remarkable level of rehabilitation. Additionally, as I have previously noted, it was only by reason of their admissions, that their guilt could ever have been established. Moreover, if they had been sentenced to full time custody, they would have been at considerable personal risk by reason of the assistance given, which would have made their detention arduous and limited their opportunity to participate in the kinds of rehabilitation programs that would have been appropriate for young offenders. There was every reason to suppose that to send them to gaol would have been more likely to turn them towards a criminal way of life, than to maintain the degree of rehabilitation which each had, of his own effort and initiative, achieved. 
     46   In these circumstances, I consider that while individual judges may have exercised their sentencing discretion differently, I would not be prepared to find error of law in the approach taken.  
     47   As Gaudron and Gummow JJ said, in Dinsdale (2000) HCA 54 (at par 22). 
      
       
        
        “… the question for the Court of Criminal Appeal was whether the result reached by the trial judge had been ‘upon the facts … unreasonable or plainly unjust [so that] the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the Court at first instance’:  
        House v The King 
         (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. Was the sentence manifestly wrong?” 
        
       
     48   The observations of the High Court in Lowndes v The Queen (1999) 195 CLR 665 (at 671-672) are also pertinent. There it was said: 
      
       
        
        “Of particular importance in the present case is the principle that a court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion. The discretion which the law commits to sentencing judges is of vital importance in the administration of our system of criminal justice.” 
        
       
     49   For these reasons I am not persuaded that this ground has been made good. I would, however, emphasise that this is a wholly exceptional case, and that both in it, and in similar cases it is essential that sentencing judges exercise a good deal of vigilance to ensure that evidence or submissions as to rehabilitation are adequately tested and not taken at face value: Govinden (1999) NSWCCA 118. That his Honour did not fall into that trap can be seen from the very careful evaluation that was made of the evidence, and of his closing remarks in the reasons for sentence. 
      
       
      Two step process 
       
     50   In Dinsdale (2000) 175 ALR 315, Kirby J said, in a passage relating to the legislation in Western Australia, concerning suspended sentences, but equally of application to New South Wales: 
      
       
        
        “The starting point … is the need to recognise that two distinctive steps are involved. The first is the primary determination that a sentence of imprisonment, and not some lesser sentence is called for. The second is the determination that such term of imprisonment should be suspended for a period set by the Court. The two steps should not be elided. Unless the first is taken, the second does not arise.” 
        
       
       
      To similar effect were the observations of Fitzgerald JA in  
      JCE 
       (2000) NSWCCA 498 at para 17. 
       
     51   His Honour did not here expressly go through a two step process. It was submitted that, had he done so, he would have reached a conclusion in the first step that sentences in excess of two years were warranted. Upon such a finding, their suspension would not have been possible, since S 12(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 only permits suspension where the sentence is for a term of not more than two years. So, it was submitted, error had been shown. 
     52   The vice to which the observations in Dinsdale were directed appears to me to be that which can arise where, in a state of uncertainty as to the proper sentencing order, a Judge selects a suspended sentence as a ‘soft option’. This submission does, however, need to be considered in the light of S 5(1) of the Act, which provides: 
      
       
        
        “….a Court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is involved” 
        
       
       
     53   I am not persuaded that his Honour, as a very experienced trial Judge, was unaware of the requirements of the law in determining an appropriate sentence, or that being in doubt, he looked for a soft option and then chose the maximum sentence for which suspension was permissible. Had that been his approach then error would have been demonstrated. 
     54   However, even if that was the approach taken, I am not persuaded, for the reasons earlier explained, that this Court should intervene, upon this account. 
      
       
      Suspension inappropriate 
       
     55   Finally, it was submitted that even had sentences of two years been appropriate, his Honour erred in the exercise of the discretion to suspend them. In this regard, it was accepted that while in exercising the discretion to suspend a sentence, it is proper to have regard to factors pointing towards rehabilitation, nevertheless it remains necessary also to give consideration to the factors of objective seriousness and of aggravation of the offence: Dinsdale also per Kirby J at paras 84 to 89, and JCE per Fitzgerald JA at para 17. 
     56   These principles are clearly correct. Had his Honour directed his mind solely to the question of rehabilitation, when exercising the discretion, then error would have been shown. However, I am not persuaded that this was the case, in view of the care taken in finding the objective facts, and in view of the conclusion reached as to the seriousness of the offences. For the reasons already advanced, where wholly exceptional circumstances of the kind here demonstrated exist, it is appropriate for sentences to be suspended. The strength of this ground depends substantially upon the remaining grounds. In view of the conclusions which I have reached in relation to them, I do not consider that it been made good. 
     57   If, however, I am in error in these respects, then the case is one which, by reason of the enormous change in each respondent, and the time which has passed, I would regard as warranting an exercise of the special discretion attaching to Crown appeals, not to intervene. To do so would in my view place the progress of each respondent at serious risk: cf Kyroglou and Tsoukatos (1999) NSWCCA 106 per Simpson J at par 98, and paras 101-102; Hayes (1987) 29 A Crim R 452 per Kirby P, at 457 and 472, Crotty CCA NSW 28 February 1994 and Lattouf CCA NSW 12 December 1996. 
     58   I would accordingly propose that each appeal be dismissed. 
     59   STUDDERT J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.

      JUDGMENT 
       
     1   NEWMAN AJ: This is a appeal against conviction on the first count of seven counts charged before his Honour Judge Kirkham in the District Court in Sydney on 11 August 1998. As I have said, the appellant was charged with seven charges relating to acts of indecency and assault involving a fourteen year old boy, JM. 
     2   He was convicted on the first count, which was in these terms: 
      
       
        
        “For that he between 1 February 1995 and 28 February 1995 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did assault JM and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency on the said JM, JM being a person between the age of ten years and sixteen years, namely, the age of fourteen years.” 
        
       
     3   On the other six counts the jury had been directed by His Honour to find the appellant not guilty on count five. They found him not guilty on counts 2, 3, 4 and 6 and, as to count 7, they were unable to reach a verdict. 
     4   All the charges related to events alleged to have occurred between 1 February 1995 and 1 March 1995. 
     5   The Crown case against the appellant may be simply stated. It was this. That the appellant had befriended the fourteen year old complainant at Richmond railway station some time about the beginning of February 1995. They then travelled quite regularly on the railway system to various places. The complainant had a girlfriend known as DG who travelled with the appellant and the complainant on a number of occasions. 
     6   The allegations in relation to the first count were that on one of these occasions the appellant was sitting near the complainant on a train journey to the city, DG being also present. The Crown alleged the appellant put his hand down the complainant’s pants and played with the boy’s penis. 
     7   In his evidence to the jury the complainant had said the appellant was touching his penis and rubbing it. When asked whether anything was then said, the complainant, in evidence, said:  
      
       
        
        “Q. ‘And when he did that, put his hand down your pants, was anything said then? 
        
       
       
        
         A. I said to him like - because I was looking out the window and I was pointing out stuff - I was saying to him things about building such and such, and that, to try to get him to look and stop, but he didn’t. So I just moved over.’” 
        
       
     8   The complainant alleged he then moved away and sat next to the girl, DG. 
     9   The appellant, as I have said, was convicted on that count and on those allegations of fact and was duly sentenced by His Honour. That sentence indeed was overturned and a fresh sentence substituted by this Court differently constituted on 26 August 1999. 
     10   The appellant appealed on two grounds. The first ground was on the basis that His Honour erred in his directions of the danger of convicting on the evidence of the complainant. The second ground was that he erred in his directions on the failure of the appellant to testify. 
     11   Because I am of the view, for reasons I shall now give, that the second ground must succeed and a new trial ordered, I will deal with the second ground first. 
     12   The appellant’s argument on this ground may be shortly stated. It is that a direction given by His Honour relating to the absence of evidence from the appellant was contrary to what had fallen from the High Court in RPS v The Queen (2000) 168 ALR 729  and indeed contrary to what had fallen from the High Court in a judgment delivered yesterday, namely, The Queen v Azzopardi [2001] HCA 25. The direction complained about was found at page 11 of the summing up of His Honour. 
      
       
        
        “In the presence [sic] case however you may, when judging the value of the weight of the evidence which has been put forward by the Crown, as establishing its case against the accused, take into account the accused's election not to deny or contradict the matters about which he could have given evidence, direct evidence, from his personal knowledge. 
        
       
       
        
        Now you may think it is only commonsense that where a Crown witness and the accused are directly involved in a particular incident, so that there are two persons best able to give evidence of what happened in that incident and where the evidence of the Crown witness is left undenied or uncontradicted by the accused, any doubts which may otherwise have been cast on the evidence of the Crown witness, may more readily be discounted, on the evidence of that Crown witness, may more readily be accepted as the truth and that is the approach which you may take in relation to the evidence of JM."" 
        
       
     13   Plainly enough, and indeed the Crown quite properly concedes this point, that His Honour’s direction was contrary to what had fallen from the High Court in RPS, and that, in terms of the case of Weissensteiner (1993) 178 CLR 217-228, that the decision in Azzopardi alters a view previously expressed in certain quarters as to the effect of Weissensteiner. 
     14   In essence, the Court in Azzopardi held that the Weissensteiner decision relates to an allowance of a comment made by a judge on a failure of an accused person to offer an explanation where the facts would be peculiarly within his knowledge, rather than comment relating to his failure to give evidence. The High Court in Azzopardi clearly indicated that it is a matter of comment and not a matter of direction for a judge to deal with the failure of an accused person to offer an explanation in circumstances where he is the only person who could give such an explanation. The subject direction here falls contrary to that which is now allowable. 
     15   As I have said, the Crown properly conceded that that is so. However, the Crown argued that the jury’s findings indicated that they did not act upon that direction because it is consistent with the direction given by the trial judge as to the manner in which the jury could deal with corroborative evidence, the corroborative evidence, of course, being the girl, DG. 
     16   In relation to other counts there was no corroboration of any type and the Crown points to the jury’s verdicts as indicating the logical conclusion which the jury drew, having regard to His Honour’s directions. 
     17   In my view, the Crown argument cannot succeed. Essentially the Crown argues that, when you read the two paragraphs which I have set out, the jury would have concluded that the direction, wrong as it was, referred only to the evidence of the complainant, JM. I do not share that view. There is reference in the second of the paragraphs to a Crown witness. Plainly enough I am of the view that the jury may well have considered that the directions as given referred to the evidence of DG as well as that of the complainant. 
     18   In those circumstances, I am of the view that the appellant has made out the second ground and, accordingly, I do not believe it necessary for me to deal with the first ground of appeal. 
     19   In my view the order of the Court should be that the appeal is upheld, the conviction is quashed, and that a new trial should be ordered. 
     20   WOOD CJ at CL: I agree. 
     21   MATHEWS AJ: I also agree. 
     22   WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the Court will be as Acting Justice Newman has proposed.

      1     
      GROVE J : 
        
       The appellant challenges conviction following a trial before Flannery DCJ and a jury upon an indictment charging that between 1 January and 28 September 1993 he conspired with one Bijkerk and others to import a commercial quantity of cocaine into Australia. In the alternative, he seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him of twelve years imprisonment with a non parole period of eight years.  
       
        
       
      2     
      Bijkerk and the appellant were scheduled to be indicted on 19 April 1999. A voir dire hearing proceeded in connection with objection to proposed evidence. The objection was significantly based upon principles articulated in  
      Ridgeway v The Queen 
       1995 184 CLR 19. The hearing was extensive but not continuous, however on 11 May the learned trial judge ruled against the objections by the then accused, although he did not publish his reasons until 27 July. Upon the ruling being made, Bijkerk sought to be re-indicted. This occurred and he pleaded guilty and the trial of the appellant proceeded culminating in the verdict of guilty found by the jury on 7 June. Further proceedings by Bijkerk are reported in 2000 111 A Crim R 443 and a description of some common background can be extracted from that report: 
       
        
         
          
          “In the course of employment for a corporation which involved some customs agency, one Modica discovered that the Australian Customs utilised a stamp which, if impressed on an invoice prior to goods being shipped, at least from the United States, signalled that the goods had been inspected at the point of export and no further inspection was required in Australia. Modica forged such a stamp. Importing contraband by means of its use was referred to as Modica’s ‘scheme’. 
          
         
         
          
          In February 1992 Modica was arrested in connection with a planned importation of a large quantity of heroin coming from Asia. At interview he mentioned to police that a person named Cluff and an associate of his, whom Modica knew as Warren, were interested in utilising his scheme. The police suspected, correctly as it turned out, that Warren was in fact, Warren Richards. ” @ p 444. 
          
         
        
       
      3     
      The correctness of this identification of the appellant is not the subject of challenge. 
       
        
       
      4     
      Four grounds of appeal against conviction were advanced. It was stated by senior counsel for the appellant that the principal thrust of challenge was comprehended in ground 1.  
       
        
         
        Ground 1 
         
         
        The learned trial judge erred in admitting evidence that had been obtained in contravention of an Australian law.  
         
        
       
      5     
      Argument in support of this ground relied upon  
      Ridgeway 
       (supra) in the context of the express provisions of s138 of the Evidence Act 1995.  
       
        
       
      6     
      It was contended that the whole of the evidence in the Crown case (described as effectively the evidence of the witness Cluff) or at least certain evidence to which I will later refer concerning the importation of a firearm, should have been excluded on the basis that the case fell into either or both of the categories mentioned in the joint judgment in  
      Ridgeway 
      , namely as to the first that illegal or improper conduct of police had induced the appellant to commit the offence and as to the second, that illegal conduct of police was an element of the charged offence.  
       
        
       
      7     
      No oral evidence was adduced on the voir dire hearing but a very substantial quantity of documentation was tendered. Included were three sets of particulars, transcripts of interviews by police with intended witnesses (Modica and Cluff), witness statements by Cluff, an affidavit by the then detective in charge of the operation leading to the arrests of the appellant and others, transcripts of recorded conversations, committal depositions and the transcripts of three earlier uncompleted trials. 
       
        
       
      8     
      In relation to the lastmentioned, it can be noted that a trial presided over by Viney DCJ resulted in the jury being unable to agree. Two further trials commenced, presided over by Christie DCJ, but both were aborted. The circumstances in which one of these terminated will be touched upon in relation to ground 3. Both Viney DCJ and Christie DCJ had conducted similar voir dire hearings to that conducted by Flannery DCJ and each had ruled, on the evidence respectively before them, that the evidence which was the subject of the objection should be admitted. 
       
        
       
      9     
      Flannery DCJ (dealing both with the appellant and Bijkerk) found that “neither accused was induced to commit a crime which either would have been unlikely to commit”. The appellant gave no evidence that he was induced to commit the offence and relied, both at first instance and in this court, upon a contention that it should be inferred from the documentation that he was so induced.  
       
        
       
      10     
      It is apt to sketch a chronology of some significant events and circumstances.  
       
        
       
      11     
      Being in possession of the forged customs stamp, Modica sought to use it in ventures by others who wished to bring into Australia contraband of various sorts including drugs. In about 1990 Modica became acquainted with Cluff, the point of contact being a hairdressing salon being operated by Modica’s brother- in-law of which they were customers. Modica sought Cluff’s help in acquiring venturers. Cluff introduced a man named Harvey and two importations of illicit drugs were undertaken. One succeeded and the second was foiled by authorities. Thereafter Harvey declined to make another attempt and Modica, with some persistence, sought Cluff’s help in finding another venturer. 
       
        
       
      12     
      On 11 February 1992 Modica was arrested. He agreed to assist police. On 25 February 1992 there was a meeting at the West Ryde Hotel between Modica and Cluff and this meeting was recorded by a listening device. The purpose of the meeting was for Modica to see if Cluff had found someone “to organize another cocaine importation”. By this time of course Modica, but not Cluff, was acting at the behest of police. Cluff nominated the appellant as a person desirous of importing narcotics from America. They (Cluff and the appellant) had first discussed the possibility of importing narcotics with the help of Modica’s forged stamp “a month or two” before the West Ryde Hotel meeting, therefore the discussion was either in late 1991 or early 1992.  
       
        
       
      13     
      There was a considerable delay before any actual activity and the evidence suggested several reasons contributing to this. The appellant was seeking funds for his venture and it was in connection with this that Bijkerk ultimately joined. In addition, the appellant required a share of the potential profit more favourable to himself than had originally been proposed. He also wished to be satisfied that, if Modica’s scheme was implemented, the degree of risk of detection by authorities would be low. There was further delay when the appellant reported an unwillingness to engage in activity for a time owing to the terminal illness of a family member. 
       
        
       
      14     
      However, in the first half of 1993 a meeting was held between the appellant, Bijkerk and Cluff at a location described as outside the Lion Battery factory at Burwood, and the desire to make an illicit import was affirmed. In June 1993 the appellant informed Cluff that he and Bijkerk “had the money arranged”. There were subsequent meetings by various conspirators including a gathering of Modica, Cluff, Bijkerk and the appellant at a chinese restaurant in Croydon when Modica reassured the others that the reason for the failure of the second importation involving Harvey had been learned (the invoice had been placed within the package instead of being attached to the outside) and he further assured them that the mistake would not be repeated.  
       
        
       
      15     
      The evidence did not enable a finding that agreement was reached at any exact time but it obviously had been reached prior to July 1993 when Bijkerk travelled to the United States. Whilst there the conduct of a “trial run” importing a pistol into Australia was conceived. Neither Modica nor Cluff was involved in the conception of this part of the plan. Modica reported to police when he found out about it and, after intercepting and disabling the weapon, police and customs permitted a routine delivery to be completed. Bijkerk made a second excursion to the United States in September 1993 when cocaine was despatched to Australia by a similar means. The authorities intercepted the narcotic and replaced it with a licit substance. Arrests followed shortly after delivery.  
       
        
       
      16     
      The offence of conspiracy charged against the appellant was complete upon his agreement to participate in the narcotics importation and the occurrence of events in furtherance of the agreement after it had been struck were evidential of, but not elemental to his crime.  
       
        
       
      17     
      The principal submission of the appellant was that he had been induced to commit the crime by conduct by or on behalf of authorities which was both illegal and improper in the sense that it involved harassment and manipulation inconsistent with “minimal standards of acceptable police conduct”:  
      Ridgeway 
       @ p37 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ. It was also submitted that the facts went “beyond a situation in which police have merely provided the opportunity for an offence to be committed”: @ p57 per Toohey J. Reference was made to the observation of Gaudron J: 
       
        
         
          
          “The question whether an accused would not have committed the offence charged if law enforcement agents had not in some way incited or participated in its commission is a question of causation. It may be that, in some cases, it is more accurately described as a question of the causative influence of an inducement. But however it is described, it is a question to be decided as a matter of common sense and experience, not by some hard and fast test which focuses on the disposition of the accused. Of course, disposition will be relevant in some cases, but even then, it may not be decisive. And in some cases - the present case is one - disposition may be of no relevance at all.” : @ p78. 
          
         
        
       
      18     
      Finally senior counsel for the appellant adverted to the remarks of McHugh J (dissenting in the result) : 
       
        
         
          
          I do not think that it is possible to formulate a rule that will cover all cases that arise when an accused person seeks to stay a prosecution on the ground that the offence was induced by or was the result of the conduct of law enforcement authorities. The ultimate question must always be whether the administration of justice will be brought into disrepute because the processes of the court are being used to prosecute an offence that was artificially created by the misconduct of law enforcement authorities. That question should be determined after considering four matters: 
          
         
         
          
          (1) Whether conduct of the law enforcement authorities induced the offence. 
          
         
         
          
          (2) Whether, in proffering the inducement, the authorities had reasonable grounds for suspecting that the accused was likely to commit the particular offence or one that was similar to that offence or were acting in the course of a bona fide investigation of offences of a kind similar to that with which the accused has been charged. 
          
         
         
          
          (3) Whether, prior to the inducement, the accused had the intention of committing the offence or a similar offence if an opportunity arose. 
          
         
         
          
          (4) Whether the offence was induced as the result of persistent importunity, threats, deceit, offers of rewards or other inducements that would not ordinarily be associated with the commission of the offence or a similar offence.” : @ p92. 
          
         
        
       
      19     
      His Honour’s preceding remarks should also be noted: 
       
        
         
          
          “The State can justify the use of entrapment techiques to induce the commission of an offence only when the inducement is consistent with the ordinary temptations and stratagems that are likely to be encountered in the course of criminal activity. That may mean that some degree of deception, importunity and even threats on the part of the authorities may be acceptable.” 
          
         
        
       
      20     
      As a primary matter, consideration must be given to identifying those persons or categories of persons who can relevantly be regarded as representative of authority. Police and customs officers are obviously included. In the present case Modica must be so regarded only after his arrest in February 1992 when he agreed to assist police. Contrary to the submission of the appellant, Cluff was not relevantly an agent of authority. I say not relevantly because until he was arrested for his own involvement in the conspiracy on 1 November 1993 he was unaware of the police investigation. By that date the appellant’s offence had been committed and anything that Cluff did or agreed to do thereafter could not affect the appellant’s culpability. Insofar as prior to his arrest, Cluff dealt with the appellant at the behest of Modica he did not thereby become the agent of those on whose behalf Modica was acting and indeed, Cluff was a target of, rather than a tool of, the investigation.  
       
        
       
      21     
      In a written submission senior counsel for the Crown conceded that “while their (police) conduct was unlawful in that they ‘counselled or procured’ the importation of narcotics through the agency of Modica contrary to s 233B(1)(d) (of the Customs Act), they did not induce the appellant’s involvement. Rather they merely allowed Modica to continue to promote his scheme through Cluff mindful that the appellant had already expressed interest in it”.  
       
        
       
      22     
      In support of the principal submission it was contended that on all the material here … “(the appellant) would not have made the agreement to import prohibited drugs unless the proposition had been put to him in this form by the Federal Police…”. The reference to form included the terms of the profit share to be allocated to the appellant. It was submitted that the appellant might be inferred to have agreed only to participate in the crime on terms and not generally, and that he had agreed only after a significant and unacceptable degree of pressure had been placed upon him. 
       
        
       
      23     
      This pressure was said to have been applied by Cluff who, it should be repeated, was not even aware of any police investigation or activity at the relevant time. Evidence showed that Cluff undoubtedly made frequent enquiry of the appellant as to whether he remained interested in the scheme and the appellant’s response was to use expressions such as “just leave it with me”. The proposition that inducement of the appellant should be implied - as it must be in the absence of any direct testimony from the appellant - has to be examined in the whole context. As already stated, the appellant needed assistance by way of finance and was not content with the original profit sharing arrangement. The agreement was able to crystallise when Bijkerk was introduced. The appellant was the medium through which he was found and introduced and nothing in the evidence suggests that this was inspired by suggestion from either Cluff or Modica.  
       
        
       
      24     
      It was pointed out that some of the evidence of Cluff’s repeated approaches to the appellant emerged in the trial and was not before Flannery DCJ at the voir dire hearing. This is an appeal against conviction and I see no reason for limiting material available for examination in order to consider the appellant’s contentions. However I am unpersuaded that his Honour’s conclusion that the appellant had not been induced to enter the criminal agreement has been shown to be wrong and no material at trial additional to that was available on the voir dire hearing causes me to reach a different conclusion. 
       
        
       
      25     
      Obviously extracted from the observations of the joint judgment in  
      Ridgeway 
       @ p37 much stress was placed in submission upon an assertion that the appellant was the subject to “manipulation and harassment”. There was nothing which occurred which could merit description as “manipulation” of the appellant, and if (ignoring the absence of Cluff’s agency for the police) analysis is undertaken of the descriptions of the encounters between Cluff and the appellant, there is shown a persistence rather than a “harassment”. The appellant was acting in accordance with his own wishes and any unwillingness can be seen to relate, not against involving himself in the criminal enterprise but towards his desire of achieving favourable terms for himself and fulfilling a need for assurance concerning the degree of risk of detection.  
       
        
       
      26     
      The finding that the appellant was not induced to commit the offence by police conduct excludes the case from the first category mentioned in  
      Ridgeway 
       @ p39. Nor, so far as the second category mentioned is concerned, was any police conduct an essential ingredient of the charged offence. The submission that such conduct was an element of offence overlooked the fact that the crime of conspiracy had been committed prior to any actual importation either of the illicit drug or of the pistol on the “dummy run”. It was argued that the charged offence was ancillary to illegal police conduct but it is plain that, on the Crown’s concession that police counselled or procured Modica to import narcotics, such conduct has to be classified as ancillary to the crime of conspiracy charged rather than the other way around.  
       
        
       
      27     
      The evidence does not show that the appellant was directly involved in the decision to test the efficacy of the scheme by despatch of the pistol. This would appear to have been conceived by Bijkerk and, presumably, American connections. It was undertaken nevertheless after the agreement to import narcotics in which the appellant was a participant was struck and was in a real sense in furtherance of that agreement in that assessment of the risk of detection was always a major consideration. There was no error in admitting that evidence. 
       
        
       
      28     
      Insofar as his Honour declined to exercise the discretion to exclude the evidence, no basis has been shown for this Court to intervene and there is manifest no failure to adhere the principles established in such cases as  
      Bunning v Cross 
       1978 141 CLR 54 and  
      Ridgeway 
       or by s138 of the Evidence Act. 
       
        
       
      29     
      Ground 1 is not made out. 
       
        
         
        Ground 2 
         
         
        The learned trial judge erred in not allowing counsel for the appellant at his trial to cross examine the witness Cluff about the sentence that Cluff received in relation to his involvement in this matter. 
         
        
       
      30     
      On 7 April 1994 Cluff appeared before Johnston DCJ and pleaded guilty to an indictment charging that he was knowingly concerned in the importation of a commercial quantity of cocaine between 1 January and 28 September 1993. This related to the actual importation consequent upon the conspiracy in which the appellant was a participant. Cluff also pleaded guilty to a charge that between 1 January and 1 April 1990 he was knowingly concerned in the importation of a traffickable quantity of the same drug. This related to a quantity of about seven hundred and fifty grams in which Harvey abovementioned and others were involved. The appellant was not in any way involved in the latter offence.  
       
        
       
      31     
      Taking into account two months of pre-sentence custody Johnston DCJ ordered that Cluff be released on conditioned recognizance. His Honour, complying with s21E of the Crimes Act (Commonwealth) 1914, specified that he would but for “the assistance” have imposed a head sentence of five years imprisonment with a non parole period of three years. In evaluating “the assistance” he noted that Cluff was to give evidence at the trial of Modica, committal proceedings against the appellant and Bijkerk and potentially at their following trials. He observed:- 
       
        
         
          
          “It is conceded by the Crown that the prisoner’s life is in extreme danger. As to date, there have been two death threats communicated to the prisoner in a face to face situation. On these charges the prisoner has spent two months in custody. On his release to bail he was placed in protection, a form of quasi custody, and he will remain in protection until both trials are completed. This could continue for at least another year. After the trials the prisoner, if at liberty, will be relocated under an assumed name by the Federal Police. It is conceded that the prisoner will be in constant danger. To use an expression, he will forever be looking over his shoulder.” 
          
         
        
       
      32     
      The remarks on sentence of Cluff by Johnston DCJ were before Flannery DCJ when he dealt with the issue raised under this ground.  
       
        
       
      33     
      At trial counsel sought a ruling as to whether he might cross examine Cluff seeking to establish these facts:- 
       
        
         
          
          (a) That he had received a non custodial sentence (apart from pre-sentence custody); 
          
         
         
          
          (b) That he had received a substantial discount as a result of agreement to assist authorities, in particular by giving evidence against appellant and Bijkerk; and 
          
         
         
          
          (c) That he understood that if he failed to give evidence in accordance with certain statements previously made he would face the prospect of at least three years in custody. 
          
         
        
       
      34     
      Flannery DCJ ruled, and the Crown had not opposed, that cross examination could seek to elicit that Cluff had received a substantial discount by reason of his undertaking to give evidence and that, failure to do so would expose him to a minimum of three years imprisonment. However he upheld the Crown objection to any question “to bring to the jury’s attention that no gaol sentence, apart from a pre-sentence custody was served”.  
       
        
       
      35     
      The Crown objection was based upon a linking of the non custodial sentence with the agreement to testify in isolation from the other reasons expressed by Johnston DCJ for not committing Cluff to prison, in particular the perceived dangers to Cluff’s person. Thus it was argued that, if the defence put the unelaborated proposition, the Crown would be entitled to correct the impression that a non custodial sentence depended solely upon the agreement to give evidence and show that it depended also significantly on the danger to Cluff. It might be taken to be implied in Johnston DCJ’s remarks that Cluff would be vulnerable even if in prison.  
       
        
       
      36     
      Flannery DCJ referred to s135 of the Evidence Act which provides:- 
       
        
         
          
          “The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
          
         
         
          
          (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) be misleading or confusing, or 
          
         
         
          
          (c) cause or result in undue waste of time.” 
          
         
        
       
      37     
      His Honour stated: 
       
        
         
          
          “…I am of the view, pursuant to s135 of the Evidence Act of 1995, which enables the Court to refuse to admit evidence if probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger, that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to a party. Such evidence without explanation per media (sic) of the judgment of his Honour Judge Johnston QC, results in it being outweighed by the danger that it might be prejudicial to the prosecution. An unusual position to take dealing with prejudice, but an available one, and I think appropriate to this case.” 
          
         
        
       
      38     
      The evidence which the appellant sought to have admitted was the fact that Cluff (save two months pre-sentence custody) was not sentenced to imprisonment for his part in the crime. It would have been legitimate to cross examine Cluff to this effect as it would clearly have been capable of touching upon his credibility. As there was no objection to evidence that he received some favourable treatment by way of discount for his offer of assistance, it was the Crown’s limited desire to avoid the drawing of inference that the offer was the sole cause of the express non-custodial sentence. That led to the Crown Prosecutor foreshadowing proof of the other reasons expressed by Johnston DCJ for not imposing custody. This would involve the finding or at least the expressed belief that Cluff was likely to be in danger. That evidence would be unfairly prejudicial to the appellant in that the jury might imply the responsibility for the danger lay with him, either in whole or in part. On that hypothesis Flannery DCJ stated: 
       
        
         
          
          “…they (the remarks of Johnston DCJ when sentencing Cluff) would so allude to the (appellant) that I would find it difficult to resist, and I don’t foreclose on this, but difficult to resist a discharge application …” 
          
         
        
       
      39     
      The prejudice to the Crown, as I understand his Honour’s reasoning, lay at the end of this chain reaction when the trial may have to have been aborted. The power vested by s135 is to refuse to admit evidence when there is danger that  
      the  
      evidence (my emphasis) might be unfairly prejudicial to a party. The proposed evidence in this case was that Cluff received a non custodial sentence and it was not of itself unfairly prejudicial to the Crown. It was the possible consequence of the response which the Crown wished to make to the evidence which may have been prejudicial and, in a general sense, could be perceived in the circumstances to be unfair. The reason given for rejecting the evidence was wrong.  
       
        
       
      40     
      That is not necessarily the end of the matter. The power of a trial judge to regulate and control the manner in which evidence is presented or elicited is recognized at common law: see the extensive analysis by Barry J in  
      Mooney v James 
       1949 VLR 22 and the power is preserved following the enactment of the Evidence Act: see ss9 and 11(1). It is to the discretions inherent in this power that I understand the reference in written submissions by the Crown that “in all the circumstances no error has been demonstrated in the exercise of his Honour’s discretion in disallowing the cross examination of Cluff as to the specific sentence imposed upon him by Johnston DCJ”. In my opinion, discretion does not extend to the rejection of admissible evidence adduced in response to a question or questions which were not improper. It is important to note that, as canvassed in the court below, it was intended to ask Cluff (on this topic) merely whether he received a non custodial sentence, whether he received a substantial discount as a result of agreeing to give evidence against the appellant and others and whether he faced three years in custody if he failed to fulfil his agreement. Those questions were not objectionable. If questions were asked which suggested that the non custodial sentence was  
      solely 
       the result of the agreement (as distinguished from a substantial discount resulting from it), such questions would have been misleading in the context of the combination of reasons expressed by Johnston DCJ and there is express power in s41(1)(a) of the Evidence Act to reject such misleading questions. This situation did not arise in the light of the ruling.  
       
        
       
      41     
      Nevertheless it is appropriate to examine what in fact occurred. Cross examination of Cluff by counsel for the appellant included the following: 
       
        
         
          
          “Q. You are subject to a contract now, aren’t you? 
          
         
         
          
           A. What do you mean? 
          
         
         
          
           Q. I mean this, that if this undertaking signed by you is not kept, then what you expect will happen to you is that a sentence which has as its component a three year minimum term and two year additional term will be a sentence you have to serve? 
          
         
         
          
           A. I found that out later on. 
          
         
         
          
           Q. You know it today? 
          
         
         
          
           A. When I signed that, there was never any deal that you are saying I was going to be given this or that. As I said, I was informed by the police and the DPP that, even with the help that I was giving, I would go to gaol. But they didn’t have any say on what the judge was going to say, but in their eyes I was going to gaol. When I went into that court to get my sentence, I was always under the impression I  
          was 
           going to go to gaol. I didn’t do any deal with the police. 
          
         
         
          
          ……………… 
          
         
         
          
          Q. Were you interested in the outcome of the sentencing proceedings of yourself for a very serious offence? 
          
         
         
          
           A. Was I interested? 
          
         
         
          
           Q. Yes? 
          
         
         
          
           A. What do you mean? If you were so worried about what would happen? 
          
         
         
          
           Q. Were you concerned? 
          
         
         
          
           A. Of course I was concerned. I just told you that I thought I  
          was 
           going to gaol. 
          
         
         
          
          ……………… 
          
         
         
          
           Q. It comes down to this, don’t you agree, if you fail to give evidence against Mr Richards in conformity with your witness statement, what you understand yourself to be facing is at least three years, possibly more, up to five, in gaol. As you sit here today, that’s how you understand the position? 
          
         
         
          
           A. I realise that now after the sentencing, but prior to the sentencing -- 
          
         
         
          
           Q. Never mind -- 
          
         
         
          
           A. Prior to the sentence I didn’t know anything along those lines. I thought I  
          was 
           going to gaol. I now know after, but not prior.” 
          
         
         
          
         
        The emphases are added. 
         
        
       
      42     
      The implication in this evidence that Cluff did not in fact go to gaol verges upon the irresistible and would have been conveyed to any reasonable listener and hence to the jury. Thus despite his Honour’s ruling, there were adduced all the matters desired to be elicited on behalf of the appellant, although one emerged in thinly veiled expressions. The point of evidence in terms of his Honour’s published reasons may be decided in favour of the appellant but no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred and insofar as it might be required, the proviso to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act should be invoked.  
       
        
         
        Ground 3 
         
         
        The learned trial judge erred in closing the court and making provisions for special arrangements for the jurors during the course of the trial after Mr Bijkerk had entered a plea of guilty to the charges against him. 
         
        
       
      43     
      Prior to the trial of the appellant and Bijkerk the issue addressed in this ground was dealt with in this court on appeal from interlocutory orders by Flannery DCJ:  
      R v Richards and Bijkerk 
       1999 107 A Crim R 318. It is not necessary to recapitulate the content of the judgments therein nor to detail the arrangements beyond what can be read there. 
       
        
       
      44     
      The present ground is advanced on one express basis that the circumstances altered after Bijkerk had pleaded guilty and “there was no continuing reason to have these extraordinarily prejudicial arrangements in place”. The reasons for the special arrangements emerged from apparent attempts to tamper with the jury at the earlier trials mentioned above. In his judgment (107 A Crim R @ p20) Spigelman CJ said: 
       
        
         
          
          “… The nature of the conduct (the apparent attempts to tamper with the jury) is such as to indicate that some person, it doesn’t matter whom, has a level of determination to abort the trial of these particular accused for this particular offence”. 
          
         
        
       
      45     
      The arrangements did not stem from any finding of culpability of either or both of the then accused and the absence of one of them did not alter the situation remarked upon concerning the particular accused and the particular offence. 
       
        
       
      46     
      This ground is not made out. 
       
        
         
        Ground 4 
         
         
        The learned trial judge erred in failing to discharge the jury, and then empanel a fresh jury to hear the appellant’s case, following the plea of guilty by Mr Bijkerk. 
         
        
       
      47     
      This ground is advanced by senior counsel for the appellant who did not appear at trial. Counsel at trial appearing for both the appellant and Bijkerk informed his Honour in the absence of the jury (after the ruling on the voir dire hearing) that Bijkerk would plead guilty. This indication was given to his Honour by counsel in the presence of both accused. The transcript then shows: 
       
        
         
          
          COUNSEL: “I invite your Honour to allow me the opportunity to confer with Mr Richards. It seems to me there is a formal need for the indictment to be put again to Mr Bijkerk in the presence of the jury so the formalities can be completed. 
          
         
         
          
          SHORT ADJOURNMENT 
          
         
         
          
          COUNSEL: On instructions I am more than happy to press on with the trial with the jury empanelled.” 
          
         
        
       
      48     
      In due course Bijerk was re-arraigned in the presence of the jury and pleaded guilty whereupon his Honour gave the jury directions including charging them that “the fact that Mr Bijkerk has pleaded guilty is no way admissible against Mr Richards. In other words you do not treat the plea of guilty by Mr Bijkerk as evidence against Mr Richards”. What is now being advanced was not unanticipated. Shortly after the plea of guilty by Bijkerk and his Honour’s adjuration to the jury the transcript shows that there was, again in the absence of the jury, further discussion. The Crown Prosecutor asked that his concern to be recorded about the fact that Bijkerk pleaded guilty in the presence of the jury which was about to try Richards and he referred to the matter being raised “in another court”, presumably here. This provoked counsel at trial to confirm that he was satisfied with the direction which his Honour gave.  
       
        
       
      49     
      Reference was made to  
      R v Stokes 
       CCA, unreported 16 June 1988, where a new trial was ordered following the remarks to a jury by a trial judge concerning previous trials and other accused. This was said to be “a similar situation” but the situations are markedly different. In  
      Stokes 
       a complainant was allegedly taken to a shed by five men and there raped. Stokes was standing trial alone and during cross examination of the complainant questions were asked about her testimony on other occasions and the presiding judge gave the jury information about other proceedings against three men (not including Stokes) and he told them, inter alia, that another jury had convicted two and acquitted one. The jury were told not to speculate about the identity of these three who were obviously three of the five men who took the complainant to the shed. 
       
        
       
      50     
      The appellant’s situation was nothing like this. Modica and Cluff were going to be revealed as undoubted participants in the conspiracy and Bijkerk had also admitted his participation. The appellant’s case was that any involvement of his was unwitting and there was potential forensic advantage (availed of by his counsel in his address) in asserting that these three were conspirators to the exclusion of the appellant.  
       
        
       
      51     
      This ground should also be rejected. 
       
        
         
        Sentence 
         
        
       
      52     
      I turn to the application for leave to appeal against sentence. The sentence imposed is at the upper end of the range of guideline specification for importation of a low range commercial quantity of cocaine (2 to 3.5 kilograms) in  
      R v Wong 
       1999 48 NSWLR 40. There is ample authority refuting any suggestion that conspiracy is inevitably less serious than commission of crime. No submission in those terms was made unless an observation in written submissions concerning actual importation is read with stress upon the word “actual”. The seriousness of any crime, including conspiracy, must be gauged in the context of its facts and of the particular offender. 
       
        
       
      53     
      The appellant argues that the learned trial judge fell into error in determining the sentence in two specific respects, first in finding that the appellant was not entitled to any discount for “entrapment”, and second, in failing to assess the sentence in parity with those imposed upon the co-offenders. 
       
        
       
      54     
      The basis upon which entrapment may be taken into account as a matter going to mitigation of penalty was analysed extensively in  
      R v Taouk 
       1992 65 A Crim R 387. It was pointed out that there was authority for the proposition that if entrapment did in fact occur it should be taken into account as a mitigating factor:  
      R v Birtles 
       1969 Cr App R 469;  
      R v Sloane (No 2) 
       unreported CCA 15 July 1992. Short of actual entrapment, the principle to be extracted was that “… even where the conduct of the police was regarded by the court as within the bounds of acceptable police procedures, nevertheless if there was a possibility that the offence might not have been committed had the police not in some way facilitated it, that might be regarded as a matter which diminished the culpability of the offender”:  
      Taouk 
       @ p403.  
       
        
       
      55     
      The question was determined by Flannery DCJ contrary to the interest of the appellant when he found that the evidence did not manifest “a real possibility that but for the assistance, encouragement or incitement by the police (the appellant) would not have committed the offence”. His Honour declined to reduce sentence for the claimed factor. This was entirely consistent with the principle expounded by King CJ in  
      R v Mandica 
       1980 24 SASR 394: 
       
        
         
          
          “This ground for leniency does not exist, however, where the effect of the police trap is not to encourage a person to commit an offence which he otherwise would not have committed, but merely to detect and obtain evidence against an offender who is only too ready to commit the offence.” 
          
         
        
       
      56     
      The finding was further consistent with his Honour’s conclusion after the voir dire hearing, to which he referred, that the appellant had not been induced to commit the crime by police conduct. His Honour did not err in rejecting the claim for discount to the appellant’s sentence for “entrapment”.  
       
        
       
      57     
      Nor was he in error in not reducing the sentence on the appellant to reflect parity with the co-offender Cluff. No sense of grievance arising from the milder treatment (noted above) received by Cluff could be justifiable:  
      Lowe v The Queen 
       1984 154 CLR 606. 
       
        
       
      58     
      The circumstances were that the appellant was in a principal role as a financial partner and organizer of the proposed importation of drugs and, on subjective matters, he had significant prior convictions and earned no leniency for any acknowledgment of guilt or remorse. Cluff played a relatively minor role as an intermediary and was intended by the appellant and others to be excluded from the ultimate execution of the enterprise and, presumably, its anticipated profit. When arrested, Cluff made full and frank admissions which were essential to any proceeding against him in respect of the earlier crime involving Harvey. He was found to have manifested remorse and contrition and, of paramount importance, he placed himself in real danger by agreeing to give evidence against the other conspirators. That Johnston DCJ had apparently incomplete information about his antecedents at the time of sentence does not affect current issues. 
       
        
       
      59     
      There was no requirement to adjust the appellant’s sentence downwards to accommodate any parity with that received by Cluff. 
       
        
       
      60     
      Bijkerk stood for sentence at the same time as the appellant. His situation was distinguished from that of the appellant obviously by his plea of guilty but it should be noted that this was given late in that it followed the earlier trial and two aborted trials and the objection leading to the voir dire hearing, in respect of the determination of which, he sought to preserve his right of appeal. Flannery DCJ found that both he and the appellant were “principals”. It is, of course, requisite to go beyond mere categorization and examine what the offender has done:  
      The Queen v Olbrich 
       1999 199 CLR 270. Bijkerk entered the conspiracy as a co-financier with the appellant; in furtherance of it he travelled twice to the United States, on the first occasion organizing the “dummy run” importing the pistol into Australia and on the second, the cocaine which he had acquired. Bijkerk was sentenced to six and a half years imprisonment with a non parole period of four years. Subject to the increase of six months on the head sentence, this was half of the sentence imposed on the appellant. 
       
        
       
      61     
      Flannery DCJ noted the lesser criminal history of Bijkerk compared with the appellant and accepted a volume of impressive character evidence concerning him. The appellant called no evidence of this type. However, the significant reason for the difference in sentence was the application of a discount to Bijkerk’s sentence of approximately 40 percent for “entrapment”. His Honour made no finding as to what circumstances constituted either actual or possible entrapment. He stated: 
       
        
         
          
          “The Crown very fairly conceded that Mr Bijkerk is entitled to a benefit by way of mitigation for entrapment but made no submission as to the amount of discount for entrapment and the reason for that position, I won’t call it a concession it is not really a concession I think, was that at the time Modica was arrested Mr Bijkerk was not aware of the Modica scheme as distinct from Mr Richards. It might be more accurate to say there is no evidence that he aware of the scheme and that was the point made by the learned Crown Prosecutor. 
          
         
         
          
          So, it follows that the sentence to be imposed on Mr Bijkerk for that reason must be less than the sentence imposed on Mr Richards.” 
          
         
        
       
      62     
      Senior counsel for the Crown appearing in the appeal (who had not appeared below) was unable to cast light upon the reasons for the stated Crown concession save to observe that, as his Honour had, Bijkerk only became involved after Modica’s arrest and, accordingly, after Modica had agreed to assist police. In the absence of any finding, it is difficult to perceive how this or anything else could have given rise to the substantial discount to Bijkerk’s sentence or, indeed, any discount at all. The evidence shows that when Bijkerk “appeared on the scene” his first enquiry was whether the Modica scheme could be used to import cocaine from South America where it could be obtained more cheaply than in the United States. Bijkerk’s foreknowledge of this asserted fact offers a considerable clue that he was not “an unwary innocent”:  
      Sherman v United States 
       356 US 369 (1958);  
      R v Sloane 
       1990 49 A Crim R 270. He was told by Cluff that Cluff thought this (import from South America using the scheme) was not possible and the conspiracy to import narcotics from the United States proceeded. 
       
        
       
      63     
      I am unable to identify what circumstances in the relevant sense gave rise to the concession by the Crown that Bijkerk was entitled to a discount of sentence for “entrapment” nor what it was (other than the bare fact that police activity through Modica was underway before Bijkerk joined in) that could have led to a conclusion that Bijkerk may possibly not have offended but for some assistance, encouragement or incitement by police or Modica acting on their behalf.  
       
        
       
      64     
      Nevertheless, assuming the soundness of the sentence imposed on the appellant, as in my view is the case, senior counsel for the Crown conceded that there was a “real problem about parity” (between the appellant and Bijkerk) and commented that “whether or not there is to be some adjustment to account for that (the extensive difference between the respective sentences) it is not a position that I could strongly argue against”. 
       
        
       
      65     
      Application of the principle of parity requires consideration in appropriate cases of the total effect of differing sentences imposed upon co-offenders:  
      Postiglione v The Queen 
       1997 189 CLR 295. A prominent circumstance which has arisen is that the appellant will serve twice the custody of his co-offender before each reaches their respective dates of parole eligibility. The disparity between the sentences is so gross that intervention by this court is called for even though, viewed in isolation, the sentence imposed on the appellant was entirely appropriate. It is recognized that such intervention may occur when there is a manifest discrepancy such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance by reducing a sentence, which is not excessive or inappropriate considered apart from the discrepancy, even to the point where it might be regarded as inadequate:  
      Lowe 
       (supra) per Mason J @pp 613-614. 
       
        
       
      66     
      I do not regard it as requisite to reduce the appellant’s level to that of the sentence received by Bijkerk but the disparity should be reduced so that the “gap” is not such as to engender any grievance in the appellant which could be assessed as justifiable. 
       
        
       
      67     
      Basic matters have already been touched upon. The learned trial judge referred to personal circumstances and what he observed about such matters can be adopted without repetition. A report by a probation and parole officer manifested the difficulty of analysing the appellant’s attitude. In part he reported: 
       
        
         
          
          “The offender presents as a man whose formative years appear to have been stable and who subsequently excelled in his chosen sporting field and represented his country in the 1976 Olympic Games. Since then, while appearing to have had a satisfactory relationship with family members, he has come under adverse notice in relation to serious offences which he has repeatedly denied, and convictions against which he invariably appeals. He remains a convivial person, seemingly unperturbed in the face of the possibility of a further period in custody. He remains desirous of re-uniting with his family, maintaining that he is only motivated to live a trouble free existence and continue to be involved in the sport of judo.” 
          
         
        
       
      68     
      On resentence the strictures of s16A and s16G of the Crimes Act (Commonwealth) 1914 must be applied and the guidance available from  
      Wong 
       (supra) must not be overlooked.  
       
        
       
      69     
      Flannery DCJ specified a non parole period equivalent to two thirds of head sentence. I consider that proportion is appropriate. I would resentence the appellant to nine years imprisonment with a non parole period of six years.  
       
        
         
        Orders 
         
         
        I propose the following orders and direction: 
         
        
       
      70     
      (1) Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
        
        (2) Leave to appeal against sentence granted and appeal allowed. 
         
        (3) Sentence imposed below quashed. 
         
        (4) In lieu thereof the appellant be sentenced to nine years imprisonment with a non parole period of six years; the sentence and non parole period both to commence from 2 July 1998. 
         
        (5) That the solicitor for the appellant be directed to explain to his client the purpose and consequences of fixing a non parole period in fulfilment of the obligation in s16F of the Crimes Act (Commonwealth) 1914 that the court cause such an explanation to be given. 
         
        
       
      71     
      POWELL JA: I agree with Grove J. 
       
        
       
      72     
      SIMPSON J: I agree with the judgment of Grove J and with his reasons therefor.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONTuesday 1 May 2001SPERLING J10267 / 01 ASIC v Farley & AnorJUDGMENT 
     
      
       
       Background 
        
       
      
    1    Mr Farley was charged on information, prosecuted by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), with market manipulation, contrary to s 998 of the Corporations Law. In particular, it was alleged that, on 23 March 1994, Mr Farley entered an offer to purchase 1000 shares in a listed company, intending to create a misleading appearance, namely, the appearance that there was buying support of the shares. 
     
      
       
      
    2    The proceedings were heard summarily by Ms L Horler, magistrate, sitting in the Local Court. On 23 June 2000, her Worship dismissed the information on the ground that the prosecution had failed to establish that Mr Farley’s purpose in making the bid was to create a misleading appearance. 
     
      
       
      
    3    On 8 January 2001, her Worship made an order that ASIC pay Mr Farley’s legal costs in the sum of $50,000. 
     
      
       
      
    4    It appears from her Worship’s judgment in relation to costs that there was a review in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) of an order banning Mr Farley from carrying on business as a stock broker for 4 years, and that the banning order was upheld in the AAT by Mr McMahon, Deputy President. The order was cumulative upon a de facto exclusion of Mr Farley from carrying on business as a stock broker for 3 years following the incident. 
     
      
       
      
    5    The order for costs was ostensibly made pursuant to s 81(4)(d) of the Justices Act. Section 81(4) provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         81(4) Costs are not to be awarded in favour of a defendant unless the Justice or Justices is or are satisfied as to any of the following: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner, 
         
        
        
         
         (b) that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecution in an improper manner, 
         
        
        
         
         (c) that the prosecution unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the defendant might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought, 
         
        
        
         
         (d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecution, it is just and reasonable to award costs. 
         
        
       
      
    6    By summons filed on 31 January 2001 ASIC, relevantly, claims an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the order for costs made by Ms Horler on 8 January 2001, and a further order that the matter be remitted to her to be determined according to law. 
     
      
       
        
       The judgment 
        
       
      
    7    In her judgment in relation to costs, her Worship recorded that the application for costs was made under s 81(4)(c) and (d). Paragraph (c) was held not to apply. The following is an extract from her Worship’s judgment holding that Mr Farley was entitled to costs under para (d). 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Let me say at the outset that I appreciate and agree with the remarks of the Attorney in the 2nd Reading speech quoted to me by the Respondent that ‘the award of costs (under NSW law, my brackets) is regarded as a means of penalising or discouraging any improper or unreasonable behaviour on the part of the informant or the prosecution’ (Hansard 10 April 1991 p1827). I also agree with the comment that the NSW law, before  
         Latoudis 
         , permitted ‘local courts to depart from (the traditional rule that the Crown neither sought costs in criminal cases nor had them awarded against it)’ by making costs orders where ‘special circumstances so warranted without attempting the difficult task of defining what those special circumstances might be’. I also note that the learned Attorney General (now Justice Dowd) said ‘Obviously, the fourth category is intended to read ejusdem generis with the first three categories and not to create an entirely different category for the awarding of costs’. 
         
        
        
        . . . . . . 
        
        
         
         However, I am equally unable to agree with the proposition, advanced on behalf of ASIC at #33 of Mr Hammerschlag’s submissions, that the decision of Justice Woods in  
         Fosse 
          in quoting the language of s 81(4)(d) gave weight to the proposition that the subsection requires only matters relevant to the conduct of the criminal proceedings  
         in question 
          to be taken into account. 
         
        
        
        . . . . .  
        
        
         
         It is plain from the passages of the Deputy President’s comments quoted to me, that the Bendigo bid was one crucial allegation which he found proved and grossly reprehensible. Apparently, so serious that, more than a year after the ASC’s delegate’s finding, when the Applicant has already endured a 3 year de facto barring from exercising his profession, it justified the affirmation of the ASIC delegate’s 4 year banning order, not yet officially in place, resulting, as the Deputy President conceded, in an effective 7 year plus ostracism of Mr Farley from his profession and thitherto livelihood. 
         
        
        
         
         These links in the various proceedings by the ASIC against Mr Farley, it seems to me, cannot be ignored, and the proceedings before me treated in isolation. The very fact of there having been both disciplinary and criminal proceedings brought by the one regulatory authority under 2 interrelated provisions, one criminal and one not, of the one piece of legislation, must in my view constitute exceptional circumstances, within the meaning of those words in s 81(4)(d). There is no comparison in this regard with the quite ordinary circumstances of the goods in custody prosecution which founded the appeal referred to in  
         Fosse 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         Of course s 81(4)(d) does require an ejusdem generis construction with the other paragraphs of s 81(4). But to my mind this simply means that there must be some fault in the prosecution of some kind: unreasonableness, or impropriety or bad faith of some kind ...... in the conduct of the proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         There was, of course no impropriety or bad faith. But, very early on in the trial, I think in the opening, the learned Prosecutor, explaining how the Crown case depended on the construction of the relevant part of s 995 of the Corporations Law by the High Court in  
         North 
         , responded to my query as to whether there was any less illustrious guidance in the form of another result in an ASIC criminal prosecution told me that as he was instructed there had not been one though another was pending in the District Court. 
         
        
        
         
         So, clearly, the Farley criminal prosecution was a test case. 
         
        
        
         
         Given 
         
        
       
      
    · the significant time delay in this prosecution under s 998, 
     
      
       
      
    · the fact that it was conceded that the prosecution was asserting neither any financial gain to Farley, nor any actual effect on the market, 
     
      
       
      
    · the severe penalty that Farley had already suffered and was still suffering as a result of an administrative decision and review based at least partly (and seemingly significantly: at least a de facto period of 3 years of exclusion from the industry) on the same set of facts, 
     
      
       
      
    · the fact that that financial penalty was likely to have already cost the Applicant far more than the maximum financial penalty the Local Court could have imposed for a worst case scenario. 
     
      
       
        
         
         It seems to me that the Respondent and/or ASIC could have been given due consideration to the likely practical consequences, both in costs and in penalty to the Applicant of the prosecution’s maintaining these proceedings, even if successful at first instance, and unappealed, should they be defended. If it was thought to be significant in the public interest for the ASIC to obtain an authoritative Superior court decision on the applicability of  
         North 
          specifically in a criminal prosecution, some arrangement might have been considered as to costs. 
         
        
        
         
         Conclusion 
         
        
        
         
         It therefore seems to me that the criteria of s 81(4)(d) are met. There are relevant and exceptional circumstances, indicating not impropriety, nor bad faith, but in all the circumstances between the parties, a certain lack of appreciation by the prosecuting authorities of the significance to the Defendant of its seeming  
         persecution 
          of him, although already severely punished, for public interest reasons.” 
         
        
        
       Is jurisdictional error necessary or will any error of law suffice? 
        
       
      
    8    Section 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 provides that this Court has power to grant relief in the nature of certiorari by judgment or order. Subsections (3) and (4), as introduced in 1996, provide as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “(3) It is declared that the jurisdiction of the Court to grant any relief or remedy in the nature of a writ of certiorari includes jurisdiction to quash the ultimate determination of a court or tribunal in any proceedings if that determination has been made on the basis of an error of law that appears on the face of the record of proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), the face of the record includes the reasons expressed by the court or tribunal for its ultimate determination.” 
         
        
       
      
    9    The phrase “error of law” is not limited to jurisdictional error. Accordingly, since 1996 but subject to other legislation, this Court has had power to grant relief in the nature of certiorari for any error of law that appears on the face of the record of the proceedings (which includes the reasons for determination of the court or tribunal concerned). That includes non-jurisdictional error. (See Hargrave v Slater [2000] NSWSC 387 per Davies AJ at [15] for what may be a contrary view.) 
     
      
       
      
    10    Section 69 was limited, in relation to determinations made before 1 March 1999, by a privative provision, s 146 of the Justices Act 1902 (now relevantly repealed). That section provided that no order of a justice could be removed by any order into the Supreme Court. (Section 146 also protected the appellate jurisdiction of the District Court in the same way.) The section was given a restrictive interpretation by the courts. It was held to be limited in its operation to determinations made within jurisdiction: Re Hateley [1965] NSWR 1061, A-G (NSW) v Dawes [1976] 1 NSWLR 242, Anderson v Judges of the District Court (1992) 27 NSWLR 701, Yisrael v District Court of NSW (1996) 87 A Crim R 63. 
     
      
       
      
    11    The result was that an order in the nature of certiorari could be made by this Court for jurisdictional error - and only for jurisdictional error - in relation to determinations of the Local Court made before 1 March 1999. 
     
      
       
      
    12    Section 146 was amended in 1999 by deleting reference to the determination of a justice, with effect in relation to determinations made from and including 1 March 1999. (The section continued to apply in relation to the District Court in its appellate jurisdiction). That left unfettered the jurisdiction of this Court to make an order in the nature of certiorari for any error of law, including non-jurisdictional error. That was then the position in relation to determinations of the Local Court made on or after that date. 
     
      
       
      
    13    Care has therefore to be taken in relation to decided cases. For example, Fosse v DPP & Anor [1999] NSWSC 367 relates to a determination of the Local Court made before 1 March 1999. Section 146 operated in that case to limit the ambit of certiorari. Section 146 does not apply in the present case, because the determination below was made after that date. 
     
      
       
      
    14    In the present case, there is jurisdiction in this Court to make an order in the nature of certiorari for any error of law, including non-jurisdictional error. 
     
      
       
        
       Was there error of law? 
        
       
      
    15    The considerations specified by the learned magistrate were such as to lead her to the conclusion that instituting and maintaining the prosecution against Mr Farley was unduly harsh to the point of apparent persecution, and that what had occurred constituted exceptional circumstances.  
     
      
       
      
    16    In relation to para (d), her Worship referred, in the course of her reasons, to the discussion in Fosse (supra). I set out here the passage from that decision which is relevant to the construction of s 81(4)(d) (at [34]): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “[T]he defence had to establish something about the conduct of the proceedings being an ‘exceptional circumstance’ other than some matter mentioned in subsections (a)(b) or (c) of s 81(4), to make it just and reasonable for the plaintiff to have his costs. In that regard the mere fact that the proceedings were resolved in his favour was not enough. There had to be something in relation to  
         the manner in which the proceedings were conducted 
          that had led to it being just and reasonable for a costs order to be made.” [My emphasis] 
         
        
        
       I agree with this construction of the legislation.  
        
       
      
    17    I have no problem with the her Worship’s observation that the passage from Fosse does not confine attention to the criminal proceedings themselves. Earlier events may provide a context. If the complaint is one of conduct injurious to the defendant, the conduct may be a blow upon a bruise. The circumstances may therefore include prior events upon which the conduct of the criminal proceedings is cumulative. But for para (d) of s 81(4) to be attracted, the circumstances relied upon as making it just and reasonable to award costs must relate to the manner in which the criminal proceedings were conducted. 
     
      
       
      
    18    Significantly, the learned magistrate’s reasons include a finding that the matters specified in her judgment constituted special circumstances but the judgment does not include a finding that those circumstances related to the conduct of the criminal proceedings.  
     
      
       
      
    19    The matters specified in the judgment as constituting exceptional circumstances did not relate to the manner in which the criminal proceedings were conducted. It was not open to the to learned magistrate to find that they did. Either her Worship failed to find a necessary condition for the operation of para (d) or - if the finding is implicit - it was not open to be so found. Either way, there was error of law.  
     
      
       
        
       Was there jurisdictional error? 
        
       
      
    20    I answer this question in case I am wrong in my view that s 69 operates in relation to non-jurisdictional error in this case. 
     
      
       
      
    21    The ambit of certiorari in its pristine form, absent statutory amplification or restriction, was discussed in the following terms in the High Court decision of Craig v South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163, 177-8: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “An inferior court falls into jurisdictional error if it mistakenly asserts or denies the existence of jurisdiction or if it misapprehends or disregards the nature or limits of its functions or powers in a case where it correctly recognises that jurisdiction does exist. Since certiorari goes only to quash a decision or order, an inferior court will fall into jurisdictional error for the purposes of the writ where it makes an order or decision (including an order or decision to the effect that it lacks, or refuses to exercise, jurisdiction) which is based upon a mistaken assumption or denial of jurisdiction or a misconception or disregard of the nature or limits or jurisdiction. 
         
        
        
         
         Jurisdictional error is at its most obvious where the inferior court purports to act wholly or partly outside the general area of its jurisdiction in the sense of entertaining a matter or making a decision or order of a kind which wholly or partly lies outside the theoretical limits of its functions and powers. 
         
        
        
        . 
         . . . . .  
        
        
         
         [A]n inferior court can, while acting wholly within the general area of its jurisdiction, fall into jurisdictional error by doing something which it lacks authority to do. 
         
        
        
        . . . . . .  
        
        
         
         Similarly, jurisdictional error will occur where an inferior court disregards or takes account of some matter in circumstances where the statute or other instrument establishing it and conferring its jurisdiction requires that that particular matter be taken into account or ignored as a pre-condition of the existence of any authority to make an order or decision in the circumstances of the particular case. Again, an inferior court will exceed its authority and fall into jurisdictional error  
         if it misconstrued that statute  
         or other instrument 
          and thereby misconceives  
         the nature of the function which it is performing or 
          the extent of its powers in the circumstances of the particular case. 
          In the last-mentioned category of case, the line between jurisdictional error and mere error in the exercise of jurisdiction may be particularly difficult to discern.” [Emphasis added] 
         
        
       
      
    22    This statement of principle applies as much to a statute which only confers a jurisdiction (as in the present case) as it does to a statute which also establishes the court or tribunal (referred to in Craig). There is no material difference.  
     
      
       
      
    23    By finding that the matters specified in the judgment grounded an entitlement under s 81(4)(d) when it was not open to be found that they did, her Worship misconstrued the statute and thereby misconceived the extent of her powers in the circumstances of the case. That was a jurisdictional error. 
     
      
       
        
       Should relief be granted in the exercise of the Court’s discretion? 
        
       
      
    24    It is submitted, on behalf of Mr Farley, that an order in the nature of certiorari should be refused on discretionary grounds, by reason of there having been a right of appeal available to ASIC. It appears that there was such an available right of appeal, pursuant to the Justices Act 1902, s 104(2) and s120, which would now be time barred. This Court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction to grant prerogative relief where an appeal was available: Meagher v Stephenson (1993) 30 NSWLR 736 at 738 - 739; Hill v King (1993) 31 NSWLR 654 at 656, 658 - 659. But that is not mandatory. I do not refuse relief on that ground in the circumstances of this case. An appeal pursuant to s 104 would have been preferable, but I think that the day has passed when rights were lost because of the form of proceedings. 
     
      
       
      
    25    If Mr Farley can demonstrate that costs have or will be unnecessarily incurred as a result of ASIC’s choice of process, it may be that that should be reflected in an order in relation to costs. If no such argument is advanced and subject to anything else that may be said, Mr Farley should pay ASIC’s costs of the present proceedings. 
     
      
       
        
       Conclusion and orders 
        
       
      
    26    Orders should be made pursuant to paras 1 and 3 of the summons. 
     
      
       
      
    27    The parties should bring in short minutes of order reflecting that determination and for any other orders said to flow from this judgment including as to costs. There will be an opportunity to speak to the minutes at a time to be appointed.

      WALLABY GRIP v STATE RAIL AUTHORITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES & ORS 
       
       
      JAMES HARDIE & COMPANY PTY LIMITED v STATE RAIL AUTHORITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES & ORS 
       
     Facts: These appeals arise out of an action in the Dust Diseases Tribunal by Mr Raynor who claimed damages against the First Respondent (SRA) and the Second Respondent (Ampol) for negligently exposing him to asbestos during his employment which lead to him contracting mesothelioma. Mr Raynor was successful against the SRA and Ampol in claiming damages before Maguire J in the amount of $154,500.75, of which SRA and Ampol each agreed to pay $77,250.37. The SRA and Ampol each filed a cross claim against the Appellants (Wallaby Grip and James Hardie) for contribution. This meant that SRA and Ampol each cross claimed for contributions from each of James Hardie and Wallaby Grip in respect of the liability of each SRA and Ampol of $77,250.37 to Mr Raynor. These cross-claims were heard by Curtis J. His Honour apportioned one fifth of the liability to SRA and two fifths to each James Hardie and Wallaby Grip. He held that both Appellants, if sued, would have been liable for Mr Raynor’s damage and thus s.5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 applied. In relation to the respective contribution claims, Curtis J held that, as Mr Raynor had recovered $154,500.75, the contributions claims should be resolved as follows;(a) the SRA to bear $30,900.15(b) James Hardie to bear $61,800.30(c) Wallaby Grip to bear $61,800.30(d) Ampol should bear no liability and was entitled indemnity in the amount of $77,250.37Curtis J granted judgment in favour of Ampol for $38,025.18 against each of James Hardie and Wallaby Grip. He granted judgment in favour of SRA for $23,175.11 against each of James Hardie and Wallaby Grip. The sum of $38,625.18 was half of the $77,250.37 which Ampol had agreed to pay Mr Raynor and $23,175.11 was half of the $77,250.37 less one fifth, being the extent of SRA’s apportioned liability.It is from these decisions of Curtis J that these appeals now arise. James Hardie’s Arguments on Appeal1.  In James Hardie’s appeals against Ampol, it argued that: 
      
       
       (a) James Hardie was not liable for the “same damage” as Ampol as required by s.5(1)(c) of the Act, as that damage was caused by SRA; 
        
       (b) Ampol acted unreasonably or negligently in conceding various issues in Mr Raynor’s action against it, and, as a result, judgment in an excessive amount was granted against Ampol. 
         
       Had Ampol defended Mr Raynor’s action more effectively, Curtis J would have held that Ampol did not cause Mr Raynor’s mesothelioma. 
       
     2. In James Hardie’s appeal against SRA, it argued that it was not open to Curtis J to find that any of its conduct had caused the mesothelioma while Mr Raynor was employed by SRA. James Hardie also argued that Curtis J had failed to consider certain evidence in the case.HELD in regard to James Hardie’s Appeal(Per Priestley JA, Meagher JA and Ipp AJA agreeing) (a) Ampol, being a joint tortfeasor was liable to Mr Raynor in respect of the same damage for which SRA was liable and further, James Hardie and Wallaby Grip would also have been liable if sued. Therefore, Ampol was entitled to claim contribution from James Hardie. (see paras 33-34) 
      
       
       (b) Ampol did not conduct itself unreasonably and/or negligently and did not thereby incur an excessive verdict. 
        
       (c) In regard to James Hardie’s appeal against SRA, evidence should be admitted as the case would otherwise be decided on a factual basis known to be false, on that evidence James Hardie’s argument fails, in any event, there was sufficient evidence, which was properly considered, upon which it could be found that James Hardie materially contributed to Mr Raynor’s mesothelioma. 
        
       (d) Curtis J was bound to consider whether Ampol had incurred an excessive judgment, but on the footing that it had been adjudged liable for negligence against Mr Raynor and that Mr Raynor had suffered damage caused by it’s breach of duty. 
        
       (e) Curtis J was embarking upon an issue not open to him when he expressed and acted upon the opinion that Ampol had not caused Mr Raynor’s mesothelioma. He should have approached Ampol’s contribution claim on the footing that Ampol did cause Mr Raynor’s damage. 
        
       (f) The apportionment in SRA’s case against James Hardie and Wallaby Grip should not be interfered with. 
        
       (g) Therefore this apportionment should be applied in respect of the sum of $77,250.37 so that SRA should have judgment in it’s action against James Hardie in the sum of $30,900.15 and for the same amount in the action against Wallaby Grip. 
        
       (h) The apportionment in Ampol’s case should be the same, with Ampol bearing the same share. 
        
       (i) Therefore judgment should be entered for Ampol in the same amounts against James Hardie and Wallaby Grip as for SRA against those parties. As this was not the subject of any submission, the parties should be given the opportunity to put submissions on this issue before the Court. 
       
     Wallaby Grip’s Arguments on AppealWallaby Grip appealed against the judgments for SRA and Ampol and raised the same issues and arguments as James Hardie.HELD in regard to Wallaby Grip’s Appeals(Per Priestley JA, Meagher JA and Ipp AJA agreeing)The conclusions in regard to Wallaby Grip’s appeal against Ampol and SRA are the same as those in regard James Hardie’s appeals.

      JAMES HARDIE & COMPANY PTY LIMITED v STATE RAIL AUTHORITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES & ORS 
      
      
       
     1    PRIESTLEY JA:  
      
      Introduction. 
      Preliminary. The points eventually relied on by the appellants in these two appeals are quite short, but in order to say what they are it is necessary to describe the course of the proceedings that gave rise to them.2     Mr Raynor (the plaintiff), boilermaker and leading hand, brought common law claims for damages in the New South Wales Dust Diseases Tribunal against State Rail Authority of New South Wales (SRA) and Ampol Refineries (NSW) Pty Limited (Ampol). His statement of claim in the proceedings is dated 24 May 1996. 
      
       
     3     The plaintiff’s claim against SRA was that he had been employed by it between 1938 and 1950, that while so employed he had been negligently exposed to asbestos dust and fibre and that the exposure materially contributed to his contracting mesothelioma. 
      
       
     4     The plaintiff’s claim against Ampol was that in 1954 and 1955, while employed by a construction company in the building of the Kurnell Oil Refinery, allegedly owned and occupied by Ampol, and between 1955 and 1985 while employed by Ampol at that refinery, he had been negligently exposed to asbestos dust and that the exposure materially contributed to his contracting mesothelioma. 
      
       
     5     SRA filed a defence to the plaintiff’s claim and filed cross-claims against Wallaby Grip Limited (WG) and James Hardie & Coy Pty Limited (Hardie). These companies had been major suppliers of asbestos materials to SRA and Ampol. SRA said that the plaintiff’s injuries had been caused by the negligence of WG and Hardie and claimed complete indemnity or contribution from them. WG and Hardie filed defences to the cross-claims.  
      
       
     6     SRA filed a cross-claim against Ampol, but this was later not pursued so that I need not give any details about it.  
      
       
     7     Ampol filed a defence to the plaintiff’s claim and filed cross-claims against WG and Hardie claiming indemnity or contribution from them on the same basis as SRA had done. 
      
       
     8     WG and Hardie each filed defences against the cross-claims. 
      
       
     9     Hardie filed a cross-claim against SRA and Ampol claiming indemnity on contribution from each of them on the ground that each had negligently caused the plaintiff’s injuries. 
      
       
     10     Before Maguire J. The plaintiff’s claim against SRA and Ampol was heard on 4 and 5 July 1996 by Maguire J.  
      
       
     11     In his case against SRA, the plaintiff proved his pleaded employment with SRA and the circumstances of his exposure to asbestos dust and fibre during that employment. There was evidence before the court pursuant to s 25(3) of the Dust Diseases Tribunal Act 1989 upon which Maguire J was prepared to find that SRA had been in breach of its duty of care to the plaintiff and was liable in damages to him “if the exposure during the relevant employment was a contributing factor in the causation of his disease”.  
      
       
     12     In the plaintiff’s case against Ampol, Ampol admitted, for the purpose of the trial, (1) that the plaintiff had mesothelioma, (2) that he had been employed by Ampol and exposed to asbestos dust and fibre as alleged in his statement of claim, (3) that Ampol had breached its duty of care to the plaintiff, and (4) that Ampol was liable “if the plaintiff’s exposure to asbestos whilst employed by [Ampol] was a contributing factor in the causation of his disease”.  
      
       
     13     Thus, before Maguire J the live issue he had to decide in regard to both defendants was that of causation. In regard to this, amongst the evidence before Maguire J was that of Dr Gianoutsos, a thoracic physician, who had said that the plaintiff’s malignant mesothelioma was “directly attributable to the inhalation of asbestos dust and fibre, first in 1938 and then continuing through until at least 1985” and also, that in his opinion, “... on the balance of probabilities all periods of employment are materially contributory”.  
      
       
     14     Maguire J accepted and acted on this evidence, and on 5 July 1996 found for the plaintiff against both defendants ordering that there be judgment against them both in the sum of $154,500.75.  
      
       
     15     Before Curtis J. The cross-claims by SRA and Ampol against Hardie and WG were heard by Curtis J on 14 days from October 1998 to June 1999. He delivered judgment on 25 June 1999. Before Curtis J the cross-claim by SRA against Ampol was not proceeded with because they had agreed between themselves that each would pay, and each had paid, to the plaintiff half of the judgment ordered against them by Maguire J.  
      
       
     16     This meant that in their separate cross-claims against Hardie and WG each of SRA and Ampol was claiming contribution from Hardie and WG towards its actual liability of $77,250.37. At the commencement of the hearing before Curtis J on 19 October 1998 it was made clear that the two claims which were proceeding were SRA’s claim against Hardie and WG and the separate claim of Ampol against Hardie and WG. Counsel applied for the two cases to be heard separately and consecutively, but Curtis J decided they should be heard together. 
      
       
     17     Section 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (the LRMPA) was central to the cross-claims. So far as presently relevant the section says: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         (1) Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether a crime or not): 
         
        
        
         
         ... 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) any tort-feasor liable in respect of that damage may recover contribution from any other tort-feasor who is, or would if sued have been, liable in respect of the same damage, whether as a joint tort-feasor or otherwise ... 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) In any proceedings for contribution under this section the amount of the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as may be found by the court to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person’s responsibility for the damage; and the court shall have power to exempt any person from liability to make contribution, or to direct that the contribution to be recovered from any person shall amount to a complete indemnity. 
         
        
        
         
         ... 
         ” 
         
        
       
     18     On the basis that both SRA and Ampol were by the judgment of Maguire J liable in respect of the plaintiff’s damage, Curtis J observed that in order to determine whether Hardie or WG or both would if sued have been liable in respect of the same damage, he must determine first when the damage was caused and second whether the products of Hardie or WG were causally relevant. After consideration of those questions he came to the conclusion that the plaintiff’s exposure while employed by the SRA caused his mesothelioma and that the products of both Hardie and WG were causally relevant to the contraction of the disease. In reaching this conclusion he took into account medical evidence that had not been before Maguire J. 
      
       
     19     Curtis J, having thus satisfied himself that Hardie and WG would, if sued, have been liable in respect of the same damage for which SRA and Ampol were liable, proceeded to consider the claims of SRA and Ampol for contribution. He began by noting both that Ampol by Maguire J’s judgment had become a tort feasor liable in respect of damage within the meaning of the opening words of par (c) of s 5(1) of the LRMPA and that the legislation did not permit a re-trial of Ampol’s liability to the plaintiff. He then referred to arguments raised by Hardie and WG which were based upon a passage in the High Court decision Bitumen and Oil Refineries (Australia) Ltd v Commissioner for Government Transport (1955) 92 CLR 200. The passage, which is of basic importance in the present case, is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         A decision that the liability imposed by the previous judgment is a liability which par (c) of subs (1) contemplated does not necessarily mean that the tribunal which discharges the responsibility of fixing the amount of contribution under subs (2) of s 5 cannot consider whether owing to the fault of the now plaintiff it stands at an excessive figure. No doubt the Court under subs (2) must accept the assessment as conclusive as to the existence and the amount of the liability of the plaintiff claiming contribution. The Court, however, is required to find what is just and equitable as an amount of contribution having regard to the extent of the responsibility for the damage of the tortfeasor against whom the claim is made. There does not seem to be any valid reason why that tortfeasor may not say to the tortfeasor making the claim, if he has improvidently agreed to pay too large an amount or by unreasonable or negligent conduct in litigation has incurred or submitted to an excessive verdict, that the excess is due to his fault and not to that of the tortfeasor resisting the claim. It would be a matter for the Court to consider under the heading of ‘just and equitable’. 
         ” (at 212-213) 
         
        
       
     20     Based on this passage, it was submitted against Ampol that it would not be just and equitable for it to recover any contribution because of what was said to be its supine conduct of its defence against the plaintiff, allied with this was the contention that had Ampol properly fought the question of causation against the plaintiff, Ampol could not have been held liable because it was the exposure of the plaintiff during his employment with SRA that caused his mesothelioma. 
      
       
     21     Curtis J did not accept this submission. He pointed out that Ampol had not conceded causation before Maguire J and that it had been properly open to Maguire J to accept the opinion of Dr Gianoutsos. Nor was the amount of the judgment recovered by the plaintiff excessive. 
      
       
     22     However, because of his view that SRA and not Ampol had caused the contraction by the plaintiff of mesothelioma, combined with his opinion that Ampol was entitled to contribution from Hardie and WG because of the judgment against it, he concluded that Ampol was entitled to complete indemnity in respect of the amount in fact it paid in satisfaction of the plaintiff’s judgment.  
      
       
     23     Turning then to SRA’s contribution claim, he reviewed the material relevant to the responsibility for the plaintiff’s damage of SRA, Hardie and WG and decided he should apportion one fifth of the liability to SRA and two fifths to each of Hardie and WG. He then continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         In money terms, the plaintiff having recovered $154,500.75. State Rail Authority of New South Wales is to bear $30,900.15, James Hardie and Coy Pty Ltd $61,800.30 and Wallaby Grip Limited $61,800.30. Ampol Refineries (New South Wales) Pty Ltd is to bear no liability and is entitled to indemnity in the sum of $77,250.37. This apportionment is effected by the following orders. 
         
        
        
         
         Judgment for Ampol Refineries (New South Wales) Pty Ltd in its action against Wallaby Grip Limited in the sum of $38,625.18. 
         
        
        
         
         Judgment for Ampol Refineries (New South Wales) Pty Ltd in its action against James Hardie and Coy Pty Ltd in the sum of $38,625.18. 
         
        
        
         
         Judgment for State Rail Authority of New South Wales in its action against Wallaby Grip Limited in the sum of $23,175.11. 
         
        
        
         
         Judgment for State Rail Authority of New South Wales in its action against James Hardie and Coy Pty Ltd in the sum of $23,175.11. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     24     $38,625.18 is half of the half of the plaintiff’s judgment sum which Ampol had agreed with SRA to pay, and had paid, to the plaintiff. $23,175.11 is half of the half of the plaintiff’s judgment sum which SRA had agreed with Ampol to pay and had paid to the plaintiff, less one-fifth of the plaintiff’s judgment sum. 
      
       
     25     There appears to me to be an inconsistency between the method of calculation of the judgment sums payable to Ampol on the one hand and SRA on the other. 
      
       
     26     In the first paragraph of the quoted passage it was said that SRA must bear $30,900 (one fifth of the judgment sum) and Ampol was entitled to indemnity for $77,250, half of the judgment sum. I would have thought that since SRA could only claim contribution from Hardie and WG in respect of what it had actually paid to the plaintiff bringing about the discharge of his judgment by co-operation with Ampol, namely $77,250, and since Hardie and WG each bore culpability for two-fifths of the total amount payable to the plaintiff they should only have to contribute to SRA two-fifths each of the amount SRA had paid, that is, SRA was entitled to judgment for $30,900 against each of them. Alternatively, if the amount to be borne by SRA was to be calculated by reference to the full amount of the plaintiff’s judgment, so should the indemnity to Ampol; that would have meant that that amount was $154,500. A mechanism would then be needed to adjust the amounts between the four tortfeasors to avoid double payments. 
      
       
     27     I think the former of the two approaches just mentioned must have been that adopted by the trial judge, because, amongst other indications in the transcript, the following is recorded as having been said to the trial judge on the second last day of the fifteen days of hearing by counsel for WG: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         What your Honour has been asked to do here is to embark on two enquiries, one by each defendant, as to how much my client ought to contribute to their 50% that they have paid of this amount. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I appreciate that but if Ampol has paid 50% and they are not liable in law but you are, then they are entitled to that full 50% back, only if they are not legally responsible. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     28     The question of the method of quantification of the amounts of the judgments entered by the trial judge and the possible inconsistency between the way in which he approached quantifying the judgments for SRA and WG was not referred to in the argument in the appeals. 
      
       
     29     Curtis J’s reasons covered a number of other issues which I have not mentioned in the above summary because they were not the subject of argument in the appeal; I have only referred to the matters necessary for an understanding of the points actually relied upon by the appellants. 
      
       
        
       The appeals 
       
     30     Both Hardie and WG filed notices of appeal against the judgments against them. In their written and oral submissions in the appeals a number of the grounds of appeal in their notices of appeal were abandoned. 
      
       
     31     I will deal first with the grounds of appeal relied on by Hardie against the judgments obtained against it by Ampol and SRA.  
      
       
     32     Hardie’s appeals; (i), against Ampol’s judgment against it. Hardie had two separate arguments against its liability for contribution to Ampol.  
      
       
     33     The first argument was that since Curtis J had found that it was the plaintiff’s exposure to asbestos fibre and dust while employed by SRA that caused him to contract mesothelioma and since Curtis J had made it clear in various places in his reasons that he did not consider that the plaintiff’s employment with Ampol had been causative of the plaintiff’s mesothelioma, therefore, to quote Hardie’s written submission on this point, which it called the “the same damage” submission “the claim made by Ampol against ... Hardie could not succeed because ... Hardie could never have been held to be ‘liable in respect of the same damage as Ampol, as ... required by s 5(1)(c) of the LRMP Act”. It was said that the “damage” suffered by the plaintiff was caused by the SRA. 
      
       
     34     I do not think this argument can succeed in face of the two facts that (a) Ampol, on my reading of s 5, having been one of two tortfeasors against whom judgment had been recovered in respect of the same damage, was by the words of s 5 liable to the plaintiff in respect of the same damage as that for which SRA (the other tortfeasor) was liable to the plaintiff and (b) Curtis J held that both Hardie and WG would if sued by the plaintiff have been liable in respect of that damage. Since judgment was recovered by the plaintiff against Ampol in respect of that damage Ampol in my opinion was entitled to claim contribution from Hardie who would if sued have been liable in respect of that same damage. 
      
       
     35     The second argument was a repetition of the one put to Curtis J which had relied on observations in the passage set out above from the Bitumen and Oil Refineries case. The first proposition in this argument was that Curtis J had the power under s 5 in deciding what was just and equitable between the tortfeasors to examine the question whether Ampol had by unreasonably or negligently conducting itself in its defence of the plaintiff’s claim incurred an excessive verdict. I think this proposition must be accepted. There was some discussion in the course of the oral submissions about whether the passage from Bitumen and Oil Refineries relied on for the proposition was part of the ratio of that case or had the lesser status of obiter dictum. I do not think it necessary to explore that question, because whatever its precedential status may be on strict analysis, the passage has been acted on by courts throughout Australia for so long now that if what it says is to be re-examined, that re-examination seems to me to be appropriately done only by the High Court. (In James Hardie & Coy Pty Ltd v Seltsam Pty Ltd (1998) 196 CLR 53 Gaudron and Gummow JJ wrote joint reasons in which they appear to have accepted the passage as correct; they, with Callinan J, were of the majority in the decision; McHugh J agreed with Kirby J, they comprising the minority, with Kirby J also referring to the relevant passage without any apparent criticism.) 
      
       
     36     Hardie, after stating the mentioned first proposition, then submitted that (i) Ampol’s concession before Maguire J that it had been the plaintiff’s employer at relevant times and that it was in breach of its duty of care, were mistaken; as to employment because there was material before Curtis J, which, it was said, showed that another company than the defendant Ampol was the plaintiff’s employer; (ii) that Ampol had been unreasonable or negligent in not contesting the medical case against it because had it done so it would have been found, as Curtis J found that the plaintiff’s mesothelioma was not caused by Ampol and; (iii) it was therefore also improvident of Ampol to agree to share liability with SRA.  
      
       
     37     The argument that Ampol’s concession of employment had been wrongly made was put in Hardie’s written submissions; at first sight I found it hard to accept because it seemed very difficult to suppose that such a concession was made without careful consideration and without good reason by Ampol. However, Hardie pressed the submission, arguing that two questions and answers extracted from a set of interrogatories directed to and answered by Ampol and tendered in evidence, showed that the concession was wrong. Ampol took the submissions sufficiently seriously in its own written submissions to foreshadow an application to put further evidence before the court in the appeal to show that the company which employed the plaintiff had changed its name on a number of occasions but was the same company as Ampol the second defendant in the plaintiff’s proceedings, under the name it bore at the time the proceedings began.  
      
       
     38     When the question first came up in the beginning of the appeal the court was inclined to think there was no need for the further evidence foreshadowed on behalf of Ampol. Both questions extracted from the interrogatories were limited to a period, called in the questions “the period”, the meaning of which was undefined in and unascertainable from the questions. Presumably it was defined elsewhere in the set of interrogatories, but these were not in evidence. This court could not know what “the period” was about which questions were being asked. (As mentioned earlier, the plaintiff’s claim against Ampol alleged two relevant periods, the earlier, when employed by a construction company engaged in building the Kurnell Oil Refinery and the later while he was employed by Ampol at that refinery.) Without any definition of “the period”, the answers to the questions seemed to the court to be relevantly unintelligible and unable to carry any weight against the otherwise obvious inference from all the circumstances of the trial before Maguire J that Ampol’s concession about the employment of the plaintiff was properly made. 
      
       
     39     Later in the hearing it was submitted for Hardie that it would be unfair for the court to act on the foregoing basis, as it had indicated it was proposing to do, because the question of employment, it was submitted, had been a real issue before Curtis J, and when the interrogatories were tendered, the judge and all counsel understood what the “period” was that was being spoken of, so that what seemed to this court to be unintelligible, was perfectly understood in the court below. Reference was made to discussion of the matter at Black Appeal Book 213 and following. 
      
       
     40     The court therefore heard the application by Ampol for the further evidence to be put before the court. This evidence showed, beyond any doubt whatsoever, that Ampol had been the employer of the plaintiff from 1955 until 1985. Hardie did not attempt to gainsay that position, but submitted that the evidence was of the kind that the court should not receive on appeal except on special grounds, and that no special grounds had been shown: cf s 75A(8) of the Supreme Court Act. 
      
       
     41     Counsel for Hardie was asked what prejudice would be suffered by his client if the evidence were admitted. He submitted that some expense had been incurred at the trial because the issue had not there been conclusively dealt with and matters had apparently been left on the basis of the intended interrogatories and further that Hardie might have conducted its case differently in respect of settlement. Having looked through, without trying to absorb in full, the transcript that followed the specific pages to which the court was referred at 213 and following, (it ran for another 483 pages) I cannot see that any real prejudice would be suffered.  
      
       
     42     So far as I can make out, and I repeat that I have not taken in every page, counsel for Ampol at the trial had responded to the tender of the interrogatories by saying that he would see to it that evidence was put before the court showing the identity of the plaintiff’s employer with the company (Ampol) named as defendant in the plaintiff’s proceedings. That is he was asserting that the position was as it later turned out to be when the appropriate evidence was put before this court in the application for reception of further evidence. I have not seen any further reference in the appeal papers to the matter after that stage of the hearing. My impression, which may be wrong, is that the hearing proceeded without any particular attention later being paid to the issue and with all counsel dealing with the case as if the right party were before the court. As well as the very lengthy oral submissions the transcription of which was in the appeal papers, written submissions were made available to the trial judge, but not to this court. In this court counsel told us that they did not think the written submissions would advance matters any further.  
      
       
     43     By the ordinary rules, which are well known, and the references to which appear in Ritchie’s Supreme Court Procedure at pp 3068.44 and 3068.45, the evidence is not admissible but, as is noted at 3068.45 the ordinary rules are “merely guides”. The rules guide but do not imprison the court. They will usually be followed unless there is very good reason against it, which Dixon CJ described as “some insistent demand of justice” (Wollongong Corporation v Cowan (1954) 93 CLR 435 at 444. In the circumstances of the present case it would seem quite unjust to me to permit this appeal to be decided on a factual basis known to everybody connected with the case to be false. I would therefore allow the further evidence. 
      
       
     44     That evidence being admitted, Hardie’s point disappears. A further reason for finding against Hardie on the point is probably available even in the absence of the further evidence. It seems to me to be likely that it follows from the passage in the Bitumen and Oil Refineries case earlier set out that since the court hearing the contribution claim must accept as conclusive “the existence and the amount of the liability of the plaintiff claiming contribution” it must accept also matters which were essential to that liability. One of the matters essential to Ampol’s liability was its employment of Mr Raynor.  
      
       
     45     As to the concession concerning breach of duty of care, Hardie’s original criticism of this was contained in its written submissions and I am not sure whether it was relied on in the oral argument. In any event, it seems to me to have no substance. There has been a long and melancholy sequence of cases before the courts concerning asbestos, asbestosis and mesothelioma. The plaintiffs in many of these cases have been employees of large corporations. The sequence of cases has contributed to a continually growing accumulation of materials, in the early days of the litigation not so readily available or well understood as later, about both the dangers of asbestos and the extent of the knowledge of its distributors and of the manufacturers who used it, which makes readily understandable the decision of such a company as Ampol not to contest the breach of duty question. This is said not in criticism of Ampol, but in recognition of its good sense at the litigation stage. The concession seems to me to be completely justifiable and for Hardie to describe it as “unreasonable”, “negligent” and “improvident” seems to me to be quite unwarranted.  
      
       
     46     Submission (ii) (see par 36 above), that Ampol could have defended the medical case against it so that it would have been held that Ampol did not cause the plaintiff’s mesothelioma, was based upon Curtis J’s causality finding to that effect.  
      
       
     47     There are several answers to Hardie’s contention. One is that to me at any rate it is by no means obvious that it is right as a matter of fact. Curtis J rejected the same submission on the ground that there was strong authority supporting the position adopted by Ampol at the time of the hearing. I agree. Curtis J also referred to the continuing growth of medical expertise since the decision of Maguire J. This may have meant that judges had a somewhat different understanding of causality questions in mesothelioma cases in 1999 from their understanding in 1996, but that does not affect the soundness of Ampol’s approach in 1996. 
      
       
     48     A more important answer for purposes of this appeal is that Curtis J was, in my respectful opinion, embarking upon an issue not open to him when he expressed and acted on the opinion that Ampol had not caused the plaintiff’s mesothelioma. I refer again to the passage previously cited from Bitumen and Oil Refineries which, as I have indicated, should, in my opinion, be treated by this court as authoritative. I repeat that this passage makes it clear that under subs (2) of s 5 of the LRMPA the court deciding the application for contribution must accept an earlier judgment against the now plaintiff tortfeasor “as conclusive as to the existence and the amount of the liability of the plaintiff claiming contribution”. In the remainder of the passage, following that observation, it was made equally clear that the court could investigate whether the amount for which the party claiming contribution had been made liable was excessive due to some default on that party’s part. That investigation would be permissible, and, if required by the party resisting contribution, no doubt obligatory, because of the court’s duty to decide upon what would “be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person’s responsibility for the damage”.  
      
       
     49     It follows that although Curtis J was bound to consider the question whether Ampol had incurred an excessive judgment, he was also bound to do so on the footing that it had been adjudged liable for negligence against the plaintiff, which necessarily involved that the plaintiff Mr Raynor had suffered damage caused by Ampol’s breach of duty.  
      
       
     50     This means that the only foothold that Hardie might have had, in my opinion, in this appeal, for arguing against the order that it contribute to Ampol, namely Curtis J’s apparent finding that Ampol did not cause the plaintiff’s damage, was not open to Curtis J to find, with the result that Hardie cannot base its argument upon that finding.  
      
       
     51     Submission (iii) (see par 36 above) must also fail for the same reasons as submission (ii). 
      
       
     52     Although therefore in my view Hardie’s arguments in one sense all fail, they nevertheless also show, in my respectful opinion, that Curtis J in one respect approached the question of Ampol’s contribution claim on a wrong footing: he dealt with it on the basis that Ampol had not caused the plaintiff’s damage, when, in my opinion, he should have approached it on the basis that Ampol did cause, in the sense of materially contribute to, the plaintiff’s damage. It was against that background that he had to consider Ampol’s contribution claim against Hardie and WG, each of whom he had found, in my opinion correctly, was an “other tortfeasor” within par (c) of s 5(1). In considering the comparative responsibility of the three tortfeasors, Ampol, Hardie and WG for the same damage and then deciding what amount it would be just and equitable for Hardie and WG to contribute to Ampol, it was then open to the trial judge to take into account his view of the extent of Ampol’s material contribution to Mr Raynor’s mesothelioma in comparison to that of the other tortfeasors. This is what Curtis J did in James Hardie & Coy Pty Ltd v Roberts and which this court approved of on appeal: (1999) 47 NSWLR 425. In my respectful opinion Curtis J should have done the same in the present case.  
      
       
     53     I will consider the consequences of my conclusion later in these reasons.  
      
       
     54     Hardie’s appeals; (ii) against SRA’s judgment against it. The only ground relied on by Hardie against SRA’s judgment against it was the first ground in its notice of appeal. This had two parts. The first said that the trial judge erred in finding that any conduct by Hardie caused the mesothelioma suffered by the plaintiff while he was employed at the SRA and that the error consisted in the misapplication of the legal principles established in a number of cases. The second said that the trial judge failed to consider certain evidence in the case. 
      
       
     55     The only rights of appeal against decisions of the Dust Diseases Tribunal are those permitted by s 32 of its Act. The only presently relevant ground in that section is dissatisfaction in point of law. Thus the ground of appeal that the judge’s method of deciding the causation question was wrong, is only available if it means that his method was wrong in point of law. 
      
       
     56     I sought to explain my understanding of the way in which this court approaches appeals limited to error in point of law in Wallaby Grip Ltd v Peirce [2000] NSWCA 299, 27 October 2000, pars 6-10. In the present case I adopt the same approach.  
      
       
     57     In my opinion, there was ample evidence before Curtis J upon which to find, on the probabilities, that Hardie had materially contributed to the plaintiff’s contraction of mesothelioma. That part of Hardie’s submission which criticised the method by which the trial judge arrived at his conclusion analysed the method which the trial judge said he had used in reaching that conclusion. In this particular case any normative factor in reaching that conclusion was of little significance. No argument concerning such a factor was put to the court. Hardie’s analysis of the trial judge’s method did not, so far as I could see, show any error in point of law or misunderstanding of any legal rule by the trial judge. In other words, the argument on this point seems to be of a factual kind in the sense in which “factual” is used in contrast to arguments involving a “point of law”. 
      
       
     58     The other branch of the present argument, that the trial judge failed to consider certain evidence in the case, in my opinion fails for the same reason, once it is accepted that there was evidence upon which the trial judge could reach the conclusion that he did. Further, I do not accept that the trial judge failed to consider the evidence to which Hardie referred. It seems to me that a better way of describing what the trial judge did was that he took a different view of the evidence from that which Hardie was submitting he should take.  
      
       
     59     Finally, in regard to this argument, it was submitted by SRA that the method used by Curtis J was substantially the same as that approved by this court in James Hardie & Coy Pty Ltd v Roberts. This seems to me to be a sound submission. 
      
       
     60     WG’s appeals. WG’s appeals against the judgments for SRA and Ampol against it raised the same points as Hardie’s appeals had done, and my conclusions are the same. 
      
       
     61     The judgments in favour of Ampol. The only point of the many decided by Curtis J in which legal error has in my opinion been shown is his assessment of Ampol’s culpability, compared with that of Hardie and WG, on the basis that Ampol had not caused (materially contributed to) the plaintiff’s contraction of mesothelioma when, in my opinion, he was bound to make the assessment on the footing that Ampol had materially contributed to it.  
      
       
     62     Consequences of my opinion. Section 75A of the Supreme Court Act applies to an appeal to this court, subject to subss (2) and (3), which are not relevant to an appeal from the Dust Diseases Tribunal. Section 75A(10) empowers the court to “make any finding ..., give any judgment, make any order ... which ought to have been given or made or which the nature of the case requires”. Section 32(2) of the Dust Diseases Tribunal Act says that the Supreme Court, on the hearing of an appeal under s 32 “may ... remit the matter to the Tribunal for determination by the Tribunal in accordance with any decision of the Supreme Court and may make such other order in relation to the appeal as the Supreme Court sees fit”.  
      
       
     63     If s 32(2) were looked at by itself, it might be arguable that the Supreme Court’s power to “make such other order” was ancillary to the power to remit the matter the subject of the appeal to the Tribunal, so that the “make such other order” power was not free standing. However, I know of no reason why s 75A(10) of the Supreme Court Act and s 32(2) of the Dust Diseases Tribunal Act should not be read together, and doing that, it seems to me that this court is empowered to make the orders that should have been made below, using substantially the same premises as Curtis J arrived at on the facts, but against the necessary background I have spoken of, and should exercise that power, if the case seems sufficiently clear, as to me it does, in order to avoid sending this matter back for what might turn out to be another inordinately lengthy hearing at first instance.  
      
       
     64     In my opinion in view of the way the separate cases were conducted before Curtis J, and in light of the facts found by him, his finding that in SRA’s case against Hardie and WG one-fifth of the liability should be apportioned to SRA and two-fifths to each of Hardie and WG was sound, and should not be interfered with; further, it seems to me that this apportionment should be made in respect of the $77,250 which SRA paid to Mr Raynor so that SRA should have judgment in its action against Hardie in the sum of $30,900 and in its action against WG for the same amount.  
      
       
     65     In regard to Ampol’s actions, once the basic background fact is taken into account that Ampol caused (materially contributed to) Mr Raynor’s mesothelioma, the further fact that SRA and Ampol agreed between themselves to share equally their liability to pay damages to Mr Raynor assumes greater importance than Curtis J was able to give it on the basis of his finding about causality. It is true that the agreement between SRA and Ampol has no binding or conclusive force so far as the other tortfeasors are concerned, but it seems to me to be an evidentiary fact of considerable weight. These after all were the two parties most concerned with the apportionment of responsibility between themselves. No reason was suggested why either of them would make other than a practicable assessment of its situation as against the other.  
      
       
     66     In the circumstances it seems to me that the same general factors that led Curtis J to apportion one-fifth of the liability to SRA as against Hardie and WG lead to the conclusion that the position must be much the same in regard to Ampol.  
      
       
        
       Proposed orders 
       . 
       
     67     In my view therefore judgment should be entered for Ampol in the same amounts against Hardie and WG as for SRA against those two parties. 
      
       
     68     As I mentioned earlier, the question I have raised about the calculation of the judgment amounts in favour of SRA was not the subject of any submission before the court. For that reason alone, the parties should be given an opportunity to put such submissions to the court about the matter as they may wish to do after considering these reasons. Another good reason for allowing the parties that opportunity is that there may well be some explanation of the way in which the sums were calculated which I have overlooked. If so, that can be pointed out and any necessary adjustments made to my opinion. 
      
       
     69     Since Ampol seems to be the party most adversely affected by my conclusions, I would propose that Ampol be given liberty to file within fourteen days of the publication of these reasons any further submissions it may wish to put before the court; this liberty to be given only in respect of three matters, the first the question of the calculation of the judgment sums, the second this court’s power to make orders disposing of the litigation in the way presently proposed, rather than remitting it to the Dust Diseases Tribunal, and the third costs.  
      
       
     70     The other three parties should have liberty within a further fourteen days from the date fixed for Ampol’s submissions to file any submission they may wish the court to consider on the three matters in respect of which the liberty is proposed. 
      
       
     71    MEAGHER JA: I agree with Priestley JA. 
      
       
     72    IPP AJA: I agree with Priestley JA.

      Regina v GJH 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     The appellant was indicted on four counts of indecent assault of a female under the age of sixteen years pursuant to s 76 Crimes Act 1900, and one count of rape, pursuant to s 63 Crimes Act 1900. The appellant was convicted of two counts of indecent assault and one count of rape, but acquitted in relation to two of the counts of indecent assault. He appeals against the convictions on the grounds that (1) the trial judge failed to give a Longman direction; (2) the trial judge failed to give a direction on the way the jury ought to proceed if they were not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was telling the truth in relation to one or more counts on the indictment; (3) the trial judge failed to give a direction in relation to intoxication; (4) the trial judge failed to direct the jury in relation to lies; and (5) the directions in relation to alibi evidence were deficient.Held: (Appeal allowed):Ground 1: trial judge failed to give a Longman directionWhile the trial judge brought the matter of delay to the attention of the jury, and gave it substance, so far as she related it to specific areas where evidence may have been lost, there lacked any warning in the express terms which Longman and Crampton held essential in a case involving lengthy delay. The trial Judge did not express the matter of delay in terms of “dangerousness”. Nor was the summing up sufficient to bring the matter home to the jury in the way Spigelman CJ had referred to in Johnston. The summing up amounted to a comment that was comprehensive, but was not a warning of the unmistakable and firm kind that was needed in a case of such lengthy delay. Appellant entitled to a new trial on this ground.Longman (1989) 168 CLR 79; Crampton (2000) 176 ALR 369; Mayberry (2000) NSWCCA 531 applied. King NSWCCA 507; Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 distinguished.  Ground 2: absence of direction on way jury ought to proceed if not satisfied the complainant was telling the truth in relation to one or more counts on the indictmentThe appellant submitted that the jury were insufficiently directed when the trial judge stated that it did not necessarily follow that because a jury finds an accused guilty or not guilty of the first charge, that they will automatically find the same verdict in relation to the other charges. It was submitted that addittionally a direction should have been given in accordance with the dictum in RAT. Doubt was expressed as to whether such a direction is appropriate. However, it was not necessary to decide this issue as the appellant was otherwise entitled to a new trial. Jones (1997) 191 CLR 439; RAT (2000) 111 A Crim R 360 considered. Ground 3: trial judge failed to give a direction in relation to intoxicationThere was some evidence from the complainant that the appellant was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the acts alleged. There was, however, no evidentiary issue as to the knowledge of consent, since the appellant’s case was one of denial. It remained necessary for the trial Judge to direct the jury in relation to the elements which had to be proved, including knowledge and lack of consent, even though the direction suggested may have seemed somewhat unreal in the context in which the case was fought. A trial judge has no authority to dispense with the directions that the law requires. Although error was shown, there was no reason to suppose that the failure to give the direction resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Stokes and Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25; BRS (1999) 191 CLR 275 applied. Ground 4: failure to direct the jury in relation to liesIt was not entirely clear whether the lies were relied upon as matters that went to credibility, or to consciousness of guilt although they were the subject of very strong comment in the prosecution address. So far as the trial judge dealt with the matter of consciousness of guilt, the summing up clearly fell short of the directions required in Edwards. Since there was some uncertainty about the matter, then the trial judge should have required the prosecution to state in clear terms whether it contended that the evidence was relied upon as showing a consciousness of guilt or was a matter going to credibility and then directed the jury accordingly. Otherwise, a direction should at least have been given so as to ensure that the jury did not embark upon an impermissible line of reasoning. A concession was made by the Crown that the jury were not given any proper assistance as to what they were to do if they came to disbelieve the appellant. Appellant entitled to new trial on this ground. Edwards (1993) 178 CLR 193; Zoneff (2000) 74 ALJR 895 applied.Ground 5: directions given in relation to the alibi evidence were deficientThe alibi witness was allowed to give evidence even though no proper notice had been given in accordance with s 48 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The Crown was, however, permitted by way of concession from the defence to show that notice had not been given. The trial judge reminded the jury of that fact but did not explain what followed. It was submitted that proper assistance was not given to the jury, it not having been made clear whether the procedural failure was a matter going to the weight of the alibi evidence, or was indicative of a false alibi, evidencing a consciousness of guilt. The jury were also not given any direction as to where the onus of proof of alibi lay, a matter that should be addressed where there is danger of them assuming it rests with the accused; or as to the circumstances that if the alibi was reasonably possible then they should acquit; or as to the circumstances that even if they rejected it, that did not necessarily mean that the appellant was guilty. The jury were entitled to appropriate directions concerning the matter. Although it was conceded that this matter would not have been sufficient to give rise to a miscarriage of justice had it been the sole ground for appeal, there were independent grounds for allowing the appeal.. J No.2 (1998) 3 VR 602; Steeden NSWCCA 19 August 1994; Visser NSWCCA 29 July 1994 applied.ORDERS PROPOSED(1) Appeal allowed (by reference to Grounds 1 and 4).(2) Convictions quashed and new trial ordered.

      Regina v GJH 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   STEIN JA: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.2   WOOD CJ at CL: The appellant appeared for trial in the District Court at Dubbo, before Judge Morgan and a jury of twelve, in answer to an indictment containing four counts of indecent assault of a female under the age of sixteen years (S76 Crimes Act 1900), and one count of rape (S63 Crimes Act 1900). He was convicted of two of the counts of indecent assault and of the count of rape, but acquitted in relation to two of the counts of indecent assault. He now appeals against the convictions. 
      
       
      Facts 
       
       
      Count 1 
       
     3   The complainant gave evidence that when she was eleven or twelve years of age she was living at a property in the Western Districts, with her parents, five brothers and two younger sisters. Her elder sister C, was living with her boyfriend at his parent’s home in Bourke. The complainant gave evidence of an occasion in 1977 or 1978, when she visited those premises. She was taken to the bedroom where her sister C and the appellant were in bed. Her sister left the room for a short time. While she was absent the appellant, according to her, walked up to her from behind, turned her around, kissed her on the lips and touched her breasts over her clothing. She said “Don’t” and pushed him back. Footsteps coming in the direction of the room were heard, and when the door was opened, the appellant let her go. 
     4   The complainant said that she did not mention the incident to anyone as she was too scared. She thought that this event occurred before her sister’s wedding, during summer. She also thought that the appellant’s parents and sister were in the house. A verdict of guilty was returned in relation to this count. 
      
       
      Counts 2 and 3 
       
     5   The complainant gave evidence of two further indecent assaults which she said occurred in about 1978, this time in the caravan at the rear of the home of the appellant’s parents, in which he and her sister C were living. Again she said these acts occurred before they were married. On this occasion, it was her evidence that the appellant came home drunk with a male friend. The friend slept in the bed which the complainant had intended to use. The appellant told her to sleep in the bed he shared with her sister. During the night, she said, he touched her first over the breast and stomach, and later over the breast and vaginal area. The appellant was acquitted of these two counts. 
      
       
      Count 4 
       
     6   The complainant gave evidence of attending a party at the home of the appellant’s parents, which she thought was a barbecue held on the occasion of her sister’s eighteenth birthday, again prior to her marriage. At about midnight, she said, guests were leaving by the back lane. She went out to see someone off. Having done that she found herself alone with the appellant. According to her, he pulled her down the lane to a grassed area where he pushed her to the ground. He kissed her and touched her on the “breast, on the stomach and down below”. She asked him to stop, but he ignored her request and tried to undo her clothes, before undoing his belt and trousers. When a car started up down the laneway he stood up and adjusted his clothing. When the lights of the car were illuminated he told her not to move. He went over and spoke to someone in the car. After it drove off she returned to the party. The appellant was convicted of this count. 
      
       
      Count 5 
       
     7   The complainant gave evidence that she enrolled at a college at Forbes in 1981. As the boarding section was not ready, she went to stay with her sister and the appellant at a property he was managing at Grenfell. Her sister, who was pregnant, became sick and was taken to the Forbes Hospital. The complainant went back to the property. Later that afternoon, she said, the appellant returned, under the influence of alcohol. 
     8   She said that when she went to bed the appellant asked her, from the bedroom door, whether she was going to kiss him goodnight. She went into the bedroom where he was lying on the bed, and gave him a peck on the forehead. The appellant, she said, pulled her down and rolled on top of her. He took her nightdress and his shorts off, and started touching her on the breast, stomach and vagina. He tried to put his finger in her vagina and then grabbed her hand and placed it on his penis. Although she told him not to do this, he spread her legs apart and started pushing his penis inside her. She said that it was hurting her and she asked him to stop. He said that it would not hurt after a while and persisted in what he was doing, despite her plea and attempts to push him away. When he got off her in order to reach for some vaseline, she managed to get away and run into the bathroom.  
     9   There she said that she noticed that she was bleeding from the vagina. When she left the bathroom she pushed the appellant, who was waiting outside, out of the way and said that she was going to bed. Once in her bedroom she locked the door. The appellant followed her and told her to come out and that he would not hurt her. He tried the door handle unsuccessfully and then left her alone. 
     10   She said that she did not wake up until late the next day. At around lunchtime, the appellant took her to see her sister at the hospital, and then he dropped her off at the College. She was unable to see her sister because the appellant said that she was in intensive care. Her sister gave birth two or three days later. The baby was ill and taken to Sydney. 
     11   The complainant said that after this incident she could not find the bottom part of her nightie. Many months later, she said, her sister returned it to her, saying that she had found it under her bed. The appellant was convicted of this count. 
     12   Some evidence was led of an uncharged incident that allegedly occurred on Christmas day at the home of the complainant’s grandmother. Against her wishes, and upon her mother’s instructions, she said that she accompanied the appellant to his home to get some ice. When they got there, she said, he began to touch her. She pushed him away and said to him “leave me alone or I’m going to tell.” 
     13   Of relevance for the time frame charged, 21 July 1977 to 20 January 1980, for the indecent assault offences; and 21 January 1981 to 9 February 1981, for the rape count, were the following pieces of objective evidence obtained from official records or from other unquestioned sources: 
      
       
      a) the complainant was born on 21 January 1966; 
       
       
      b) the marriage of the complainant’s sister C, to the appellant occurred on 3 May 1980; 
       
       
      c) their child was born on 8 February 1981; 
       
       
      d) the complainant attended the College in Forbes during the year 1981. 
       
     14   Additionally of relevance were the following pieces of evidence: 
      
       
      a) the complainant’s mother initially said that she believed that her daughter C and the appellant lived in a caravan at the back of his parent’s home before they were married, but later was less sure about the time that they did this; 
       
       
      b) she also gave evidence that there had been a party to celebrate “C”s eighteenth birthday, but it was on the property where the family lived. Additionally, she said, she recalled a celebration that had been held at the home of the appellant’s parents, which the complainant would have attended. She could not, however, remember the occasion for it; 
       
       
      c) the complainant’s stepfather gave evidence that his daughter C and the appellant lived together in a caravan at the home of the appellant’s parents, for a period of between three to eight months after C left school in about 1979, including a short time prior to their marriage; 
       
       
      d) he also gave evidence of attending a party at the home of the appellant’s parents at about the time he and C were married, which continued into the evening. 
       
       
     15   It was the complainant’s account that she had stayed with the appellant at Forbes, despite the earlier assaults, because she had done what she was told when she was a child, and because she expected her sister to be there. She also said that she had not complained because she had been too scared to tell her sister or her parents, and because she had not wanted to hurt her sister. 
     16   In the defence case, evidence was called from the appellant and his wife, as well as from his sister in law and a friend of his wife. 
     17   In substance, the appellant denied the allegations. He said that : 
      
       
      a) He first met C in September 1979, at a Race dance, and became engaged to her in December 1979; 
       
       
      b) he first met the complainant in November 1979 at her school in Bathurst. 
       
       
      c) from about December 1979, C had moved into the front room at his parents home, where they lived together until two or three months after their marriage in May 1980; 
       
       
      d) they then moved into the caravan, where they stayed for no more than a month before moving to Grenfell; 
       
       
      e) he did not recall the complainant visiting them at the caravan, and denied that she ever got into his bed. 
       
       
      e) on the occasion of taking his wife to the hospital in Forbes, he had not returned to the Grenfell property, but had stayed with a friend of his wife at Forbes, remaining there for a few days before accompanying his wife and baby to Sydney for treatment. He denied that the complainant had visited them at this time or had ever stayed overnight at the Grenfell property. 
       
     18   His wife C supported this evidence, and additionally said that: 
      
       
      a) the complainant only ever came to the home of the appellant’s parents on the day of the wedding, and had never visited her in the bedroom; 
       
       
      b) there never were any parties or celebrations at this house before the wedding; 
       
       
      c) she did not have any celebration for her eighteenth birthday; 
       
       
      d) the complainant was not at the Grenfell property at the time of her admission to hospital on about 7 February 1981, and so far as she was aware, had never been to the property; 
       
       
      e) there never was any occasion when the complainant went off with the appellant to fetch ice, although on Christmas Day 1981, she did leave with her stepfather for this purpose. The day was, however, spent at premises other than those of the complainant’s grandmother, as was said to be supported by photographs taken that day; 
       
       
      f) she denied locating any item of clothing belonging to the complainant at Grenfell. 
       
     19   The appellant’s sister in law said that she had lived in the caravan with her husband until about July 1980, when they moved it to the home of the appellant’s parents, whereafter the appellant and C lived in it for a few months. 
     20   The friend of the complainant’s sister C, gave evidence that on the day that she had been admitted to hospital, the appellant had come to their home. He had stayed there until his wife was discharged. Although only asked to remember this about a week before giving evidence, she was certain that she was not mistaken about it. 
     21   The following grounds of appeal were advanced:  
      
       
      Ground 1 - failure to give a Longman direction 
       
     22   Although the trial Judge gave detailed directions concerning delay, and identified several respects in which the appellant may have been disadvantaged in his ability to procure evidence to answer the complaints, it was submitted that these directions fell short of that required in Longman(1989) 168 CLR 79, where Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said (at 90-91): 
      
       
        
        “But there is one factor which may not have been apparent to the jury and which therefore required not merely a comment but a warning be given to them: see  
        R v Spencer 
         (1987) AC at 141. That factor was the applicant’s loss of those means of testing the complainant’s allegations which would have been open to him had there been no delay in prosecution. Had the allegations been made soon after the alleged event, it would have been possible to explore in detail the alleged circumstances attendant upon its occurrence and perhaps to adduce evidence throwing doubt upon the complainant’s story or confirming the applicant’s denial. After more than twenty years that opportunity was gone and the applicant’s recollection of them could not be adequately tested. The fairness of the trial had necessarily been impaired by the long delay (see  
        Jago v District Court (NSW) Ante pp 31-32, 42-44, 56-57) 
         and it was imperative that warning be given to the jury. The jury should have been told that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of more than twenty years, 
         it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone 
         unless the jury, scrutinising the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. To leave a jury without such a full appreciation of the danger was to risk a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
     23   These statements were endorsed by the majority of the High Court in Crampton (2000) 176 ALR 369 where Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ noted that the passage from Longman cited above, “distinguished between two different sets of circumstances: those which might well invite, and we would interpolate, will generally require comment; and those in respect of which a warning is imperative.” 
     24   Their Honours held that the summing up at first instance in that case had fallen short of a warning, and that what the trial Judge said was “to say too little, too unemphatically, and less than what Longman required in the circumstances of this case” and noted (at par 45): 
      
       
        
        “An accused’s defence will frequently be an outright denial of the allegations. That is not a reason for disparaging the relevance and importance of a timely opportunity to test the evidence of a complainant, to locate other witnesses, and to try to recollect precisely what the accused was doing on the occasion in question. In short, the denial to an accused of the forensic weapons that reasonable contemporaneity provides, constitutes a significant disadvantage which a judge must recognise and to which an unmistakable and firm voice must be given by appropriate directions. Almost all of the passage of the majority in  
        Longman 
         to which we have referred (with appropriate adaptations to the circumstances of this case, including that because of the passage of so many years, it would be dangerous to convict on the complainant’s evidence alone without the closest scrutiny of the complainant’s evidence) should have been put to the jury.” 
        
       
     25   Kirby J, similarly noted the importance of the distinction between a comment and a warning, observing: 
      
       
        
        “125. … It is important to note the distinction made by the majority in  
        Longman 
         between  
        comment 
         (which a trial judge may and sometimes should give to ensure the fairness of the trial) and a  
        warning 
         (which in circumstances of “long delay” it is “imperative” in the sense of obligatory, that the trial judge must give to the jury). 
        
       
       
        
        126.  
        Comment 
         will simply remind the jury of matters frequently within common experience which they may ordinarily be taken to know but might have forgotten or overlooked.  
        Warnings 
         derive from the special experience of the law. The specific difficulties that an accused will have, in circumstances of significant delay, in defending himself or herself in a criminal trial, include securing evidence (comprising now scientific as well as lay evidence) and gathering information promptly with which to test and challenge the evidence of the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        129. The  
        warning 
         in a case involving a long delay between an alleged offence and a complaint is, in part, an element in the balance required by the law in such matters. In overseas jurisdictions courts have been more willing than they appear to have been in Australia to provide a permanent stay of proceedings to protect accused persons from the injustices that can arise in attempting to mount a defence to such charges years, or even decades, after an alleged offence occurred. This has been so, in part, because Australian courts know that  
        Longman 
         obliges trial judges, in cases such as the present, not only to  
        comment 
         about the difficulties which the long delay in complaint presents but specifically to  
        warn 
         the jury, in clear and emphatic terms, of the dangers that may be inherent in such a trial. 
        
       
       
        
        130. The warning required by  
        Longman 
         must be, in the words of the joint reasons in this case, “unmistakable and firm”. It must be related to the evidence and derived from forensic experience.” 
        
       
     26   After noting the areas of potential disadvantage faced by the appellant in that case, his Honour added: 
      
       
        
        “132 The idea that these serious disadvantages are unimportant and that the jury, unaided, will somehow sort things out by simply resolving the claims and denials in oath against oath must be firmly rejected. (cf  
        McGinley “Case and comment: Bull, King; Marotta” 2000 24(5) Criminal Law Journal 315 at 318).  
        That idea is contrary to the repeated authority of this court in and since  
        Longman 
        . The jury needs the assistance of the trial judge to warn, from the law’s long experience, that trials with such potentially grave consequences for liberty and reputation need to be fought with forensic weapons. The passage of time, especially great time - may make it difficult, or impossible, to secure such weapons for an adequate defence. A jury may not understand this. A judge will. And the law requires that the judge warn the jury in clear and unmistakable terms.” 
        
       
     27   Hayne J similarly observed: 
      
       
        
        “142. … As the joint judgment in  
        Longman 
         points out, it was proper to remind the jury of considerations relevant to the evaluation of the evidence and these were considerations of that kind. But what has come to be known as a “ 
        Longman 
         warning” is not just a judicial  
        comment 
         of this kind, proper and appropriate as it may be. It is a  
        warning 
         to the jury that, because the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of so many years, it would be  
        dangerous to convict 
         on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinising the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. “ 
         
        
       
     28   Crampton, it may be observed, has been applied by this Court in Mayberry (2000) NSWCCA 531 and distinguished in King (2000) NSWCCA 507. 
     29   In Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362, Spigelman CJ noted at 369-370: 
      
       
        
        “It is important to emphasise that what is required by way of comment or direction must depend on the whole of the circumstances. The guiding principle on such matters is stated by the High Court in 
          
        Longman 
         (at 86): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The general law requires a warning to be given whenever a warning is necessary to avoid a perceptible risk of miscarriage of justice arising from the circumstances of the case.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
       … 
       
       
       
        
        A direction which does not contain the words ‘dangerous’ or ‘unsafe’ to convict, is not necessarily inadequate: see  
        R v Spencer 
         (at 138) per Lord Ackner;  
        R v McDonald 
         (at 10-13) Terminology such as ‘considerable caution’ will sometimes be adequate. Nor should it be assumed that the use of the word ‘dangerous’ or ‘unsafe’ will necessarily be adequate. 
        
       
       
        
        As Brennan J put it in  
        Bromley v The Queen 
         (1986) 161 CLR 315 at 325: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “’The possibility of a miscarriage of justice is both the occasion for the giving of a warning and the determinant of its content.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        His Honour went on to say (at 325): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘When the danger in acting upon the evidence is real and substantial and when the conduct of the trial and evidence … are such that the jury may not have fully perceived or the jury’s attention may have been diverted from the danger, a warning should be given.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Although these comments were made in the context of dealing with evidence said to be unreliable by its nature, the reasoning is equally applicable to remedying unfairness to the ability of the accused to put his case. 
        
       
       
     30   After a review of the decisions, his Honour summed up the relevant principles as follows (at 375): 
      
       
        
        “(i) Whenever it appears to a trial judge that delay, whether occasioned by delay in reporting a crime or otherwise, may have affected the fairness of a trial, he or she should make such comments and give such warnings as will ensure that the trial is fair. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) A comment or warning is required if it appears to the trial judge that a jury may not, from its own experience, fully appreciate the effects of delay on the ability of the accused to defend himself or herself whether by testing prosecution evidence or adducing evidence in his own case, to establish a reasonable doubt about his or her guilt. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) The need for, and content of, any comment will depend on the circumstances of the case. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) Whether or not there is a need for any, and if so what, warning will also depend on the circumstances of the case. 
        
       
       
        
        (v) Where it appears from the course of evidence, including cross examination, or the conduct of the trial, including submissions, that specific difficulties were encountered by the accused in testing the evidence of the prosecution or adducing evidence in defence, then those specific difficulties should be highlighted in the summing up in such a way as makes it clear that delay, for which the accused had not been responsible, had created those difficulties. 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) Where the summing up identifies difficulties pursuant to (v), the trial judge should indicate to the jury how they should approach their task of determining whether the prosecution has proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. There is no universally applicable formula but some reference to the additional care or caution with which they should approach the prosecution evidence is usually appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) In some cases a warning which uses terminology such as ‘dangerous’ or ‘unsafe’ to convict will be required. The reasons for the warning must be explained, generally by relating the danger to the specific difficulties of the character referred to in (v).” 
        
       
       
     31   The deficiency said to exist in the present case lay in the absence of any reference by her Honour to the dangerousness of the jury convicting on the complainant’s evidence alone, unless after scrutinising it with great care, and paying heed to the warning, they were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. 
      
       
        
       
     32   The strongest terms in which a direction concerning delay was given, in the present trial, was as follows: 
      
       
        
        “The evidence in this matter, or the Crown case I should say, depends upon the evidence given by (P). She is the witness the Crown calls to give evidence of what she alleges took place on each of these five occasions and as is usually the case in this type of charge, type of matter, there are usually never any witnesses apart from the person making the allegation and the person who is charged with the offences. It is not an unusual thing at all as you would think you would reason as a matter of commonsense that this type of activity takes place in private. Because of that the Courts have always warned juries  
        very strongly 
        , not only in this type of case, but any case in which there is one person making an allegation against an accused person and there is no other evidence which supports or no eye witness but no support for the evidence other than the evidence given by the person making the allegations. 
        
       
       
        
        You must scrutinise that person’s evidence with care 
        . You must look at it very carefully before you can act upon it. This is, as I say, said in every case of this nature and where one person makes an allegation. But in this case of course not only must you look very carefully at the evidence that has been given by (P),  
        you would also have in mind the age, how long ago this took place, and how memories can change.” 
        
       
     33   The need for the jury to “very carefully consider her evidence” was repeated more than once (summing up p. 27 and p 53), although, on the first of these occasions, it followed some directions that were more pertinent to the complainant’s explanation concerning the possibility that she had mistaken some of the dates, by reason of the passage of time. 
     34   Elsewhere, the fact of delay was brought to the notice of the jury, initially in the context of the accuracy of the recollection of witnesses speaking of events that were over twenty years old (p. 6 of the summing up), next in the context of credibility so far as there had been a delay in complaint (p. 20 of the summing up), and then in the context of the impact that delay had upon the ability of the appellant to meet the Crown case (p. 22 of the summing up). 
     35   In the course of these passages the trial Judge informed the jury that: 
      
       
        
         “obviously and necessarily the accused has had difficulty in meeting”  
        
       
       
      the allegations, adding that there 
       
       
        
         “could well be material that might have been available to (him) if this matter had been raised at a much earlier time”.  
        
       
     36   Specific instances were mentioned such as the production of witnesses who may have been at the party or in the laneway at the time of the events the subject of count 4, including the person in the car; the calling of the person who slept in the caravan on the occasion of the events the subject of counts 2 and 3; and the records concerning the acquisition and move of the caravan itself. 
     37   When dealing with the addresses, her Honour also reminded the jury of the defence submission concerning the difficulties with dates: 
      
       
        
        “So not only is he placed in a position where this matter is so old that he cannot really find people to come along and say what he was doing at a certain time or any other information that may have been available to him if these matters had come to light at an earlier time. Not only is he disadvantaged by that but when he gets to Court to answer the questions the dates are changed to accommodate the problem with P’s evidence….”. 
        
       
       
        
       
     38   While it is true that the trial Judge did bring the matter of delay to the attention of the jury, and gave it substance so far as she related it to specific areas where evidence may have been lost, there was lacking any warning in the express terms which Longman and Crampton held to be essential in a case involving lengthy delay. 
     39   I have given careful consideration to whether the terms in which, and the manner in which her Honour came back on more than one occasion to the question of delay, sufficiently emphasised the danger involved, ie whether although not expressed in terms of “dangerousness” the summing up sufficiently brought that matter home in the way of which Spigelman CJ spoke in Johnston. I have concluded that it did not achieve the result. At best, I regard it as having amounted to a comment that was comprehensive, but was not a warning of the unmistakable and firm kind that was needed for a case with the delay that was here involved. It was upon the basis of the relative short delay in King that Crampton was distinguished. The present case is very different, being more akin to that seen in both Crampton and Mayberry.  
     40   Accordingly, I am of the view that while the point was not taken below, this ground of appeal has been made good. 
      
       
      2. Absence of direction as to the way in which a jury ought to proceed if not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was telling the truth in relation to one or more counts in the indictment. 
       
     41   This has a relevance in the light of the acquittal of the appellant of Counts 2 and 3. 
     42   The appellant does not suggest that there was an inconsistency of verdicts of the kind that might attract a consideration of the decision in Jones (1997) 191 CLR 439 and S6(1) Criminal Appeal Act. 
     43   In that regard, it was accepted that there was a plausible explanation for the acquittal on these two counts, since the trial Judge had instructed the jury that it would not be enough for them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the indecent assaults alleged had in fact occurred. Additionally, she emphasised, more than once, even though time was not of the essence, ie subject to the offences occurring before the repeal of s76 on 14 July 1981, that they must be satisfied that the particular acts the subject of these counts, had occurred within the time frame particularised (cf Stringer [2000] NSWCCA 293 and Dossi (1918) 13 Cr App R 158). 
     44   In the light of the evidence as to when the appellant met C, the contradictory evidence as to when the caravan was taken to the home of the appellant’s parents, and as to whether the appellant and C had moved into it only after they were married in 1980, and in the light of the complainant’s admitted uncertainty about dates, it is well understandable that the jury could have entertained a reasonable doubt about the date at which the alleged assaults occurred, while fully accepting her evidence that they did occur. 
     45   Notwithstanding this concession, the appellant now submits that the jury were erroneously directed when informed: 
      
       
        
        “You will have to consider each of the charges individually, that is to say you must consider the evidence which goes to each of those charges and you will return your verdict according to the evidence, according to the facts as you find them to be. Now it does not follow necessarily that because you find the accused guilty or not guilty of the first charge that you would then automatically find the same verdict in relation to the other charges.”  
        
       
     46   It was submitted that, additionally, a direction should have been given in accordance with the dictum in RAT (2000) 111 A Crim R 360 where Dunford J said at 371: 
      
       
        
        “If I am correct in my understanding of the effect of  
        Jones 
        , then I believe consideration needs to be given to the directions regularly given to juries in such trials. Juries are constantly told that they should consider each count in the indictment separately and also that they may accept part of a witness’ evidence and not accept other parts of the evidence of that same witness. But  
        Jones 
         appears to establish a qualification to these directions to the effect that in sexual cases, where the only direct evidence of the commission of the offences is that of the complainant, if they are for any reason not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant is telling the truth in relation to one count, it is not open to them to be satisfied to the criminal standard that she (or he) is telling the truth in relation to any other count; and therefore in such cases (that is, where there is no independent evidence of the commission of the offences) if they find an accused not guilty on one count, they must also find him not guilty on all counts. They should also be warned specifically that if they return different verdicts where there are no distinguishing features in the evidence, such verdicts are liable to be regarded as a compromise and the guilty verdicts set aside.” 
        
       
     47   Hulme J at 383, observed: 
      
       
        
        “I agree with his Honour that in some cases, a direction as contemplated by his Honour may be appropriate. However, it seems to me that before such a direction is required, not only would the complainant’s evidence have to be the only direct evidence of the commission of the offences but there would have to be nothing else in the evidence bearing on her credibility or in the evidence of surrounding circumstances which lent support for one charge rather than another.” 
        
       
       
        
       
     48   Barr J expressly did not deal with the suggested direction, confining his decision to the second ground of appeal. 
     49   The necessity for giving the direction suggested by Dunford J as a matter of course in a case involving multiple counts was rejected by this Court in ARD [2000] NSWCCA 443, and was also discussed in Robinson [1999] NSWCCA 186. I would express my doubts as to its appropriateness, both in the form suggested and as an invariable direction.  
     50   The point is however reserved in a part heard appeal (R v M ) which is now to be heard by a bench of five Justices. In that appeal, attention can be given to the possible difficulty arising with the suggested direction in so far as it may invite an obverse process of reasoning where the prosecution case is particularly strong on one count, and where the evidence of the accused is demolished on that count, or in so far as it might invite tendency reasoning of the kind discussed by the High Court recently in KRM (2001) HCA 11. 
     51   I take the view that it need not be decided in this case, since the appellant is otherwise entitled to a new trial. 
      
       
      Ground 3. Absence of direction in relation to intoxication 
       
     52   This ground was relevant only to the rape count, specifically as to the element of knowledge of lack of consent. The direction given in this regard was follows: 
      
       
        
        “That is a matter for you as the judges of the facts whether you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, first of all that it took place and that it took place without her consent. You must then be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time the accused knew that she was not consenting. That is the case even though the accused here said “well it just didn’t happen at all”. It is for the Crown to prove, and prove beyond reasonable doubt that he knew that at the time he was doing this to her she was not consenting to his actions.” 
        
       
     53   There was some evidence from the complainant that the appellant was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the acts alleged. There was, however, no evidentiary issue as to knowledge of consent since the appellant’s case was one of denial, not only of any sexual act, but also of the complainant’s presence at the premises where it was alleged to have occurred.  
     54   It was necessary for her Honour to direct the jury in relation to the elements which had to be proved, including knowledge of lack of consent. Even though the direction suggested may have seemed somewhat unreal in the context in which the case was fought, the aspect of intoxication was relevant to that element. In Stokes and Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25, at 32 Hunt J (as he then was) dealt with a similar question as follows: 
      
       
        
        “The disavowal by counsel then appearing for the appellants that intoxication was being raised as an issue, though no doubt made for tactical reasons which were bona fide thought to be in the best interests of their clients, did not relieve the judge of the duty to give directions in relation to that issue in this case:  
        Pemble 
         (1971) 124 CLR 107 at 117-118, 130. Counsel cannot concede a matter of law to the disadvantage of the accused:  
        Pemble 
         at 133,  
        Galambos 
         (1980) 2 A Crim R 388 at 395,396-397. The judge must comply within his duty to put to the jury any issue sufficiently raised by the evidence even if that issue gives an air of unreality to the case sought to be made by the accused in relation to some other issue:  
        Lawson  
        and 
         Forsythe 
         (1986) VR 515 at 548; 18 A Crim R 360 at 394-5;  
        Marshall 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, Gleeson CJ, Priestley, Sharpe JJ, 17 July 1990 ) at 1-2. 
        
       
       
        
        An error of law has therefore been established by Stokes, in that the judge erred in acceding to the request of his own counsel, made for tactical reasons to benefit the appellant’s own case, not to put intoxication to the jury as being a relevant to an issue which the Crown had to establish. The irony of such a conclusion - that the judge erred by doing precisely what the appellant had asked him to do - is even greater because, had the direction been given which  
        Stokes 
         now says should have been given it would have been likely to weaken his case.” 
        
       
       
     55   Similarly, in BRS (1999) 191 CLR 275, the majority of the High Court upheld an appeal, on the basis of a miscarriage of justice, as the result of the trial Judge’s failure to direct the jury according to law notwithstanding the absence of objection by trial counsel. McHugh J at 306 said: 
      
       
        
        “Trial judges have no authority to dispense with the directions that the law requires them to give in criminal trials. If the failure to give a direction may have resulted in the conviction of the accused person, the trial has not been conducted according to law and the conviction constitutes a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
       
     56   In the present case it is likely that the question of intoxication was deliberately ignored by Counsel for the appellant, since similarly to the case of Stokes, to draw the jury’s attention to it was only likely to weaken the defence case. This flowed from the circumstance that the jury may well have concluded that the effects of alcohol were disinihibiting or such as to fan the appellant’s ardour, thereby providing an explanation for the conduct alleged: cf Coleman (1990) 19 NSWLR 467 at 486. 
     57   Error has been shown. However, had this been the only ground of appeal, then I would have regarded the case as appropriate for an application of the proviso, as occurred in Stokes and Difford; and see also Khouzame (1999) 108 A Crim R 170 at 187 where leave was refused under r4 of the Criminal Appeal rules to argue a similar ground. Upon a retrial, it would, however, be appropriate to ensure that the necessary direction is given.  
      
       
      Ground 4 - Failure to direct the jury in relation to lies 
       
     58   The appellant was cross examined by the Crown Prosecutor in relation to certain matters that were submitted to have been lies told to police or to the jury. They encompassed the following matters: 
      
       
      a) the answer he gave to police to the effect that he did not hold parties at his parent’s home; 
       
       
      b) the answer given to police that he did not remember how many bedrooms were in his parent’s home; 
       
       
      c) the evidence which he initially gave that his wife had been admitted to the Forbes Hospital on 7 February 1981, which he later corrected to 6 February 1981. 
       
     59   In relation to each of those matters he was cross examined along the lines that he had tried to block these things out of his mind, because they were linked with unpleasant memories of what had occurred with the complainant. In relation to the last matter, this was embellished by a question in cross examination along the lines that there were other events, undefined, at the time, that he also wanted to put out of his mind. 
     60   In dealing with these various exchanges, and with the cross examination of the appellant generally, her Honour did no more in the summing up than to remind the jury that: 
      
       
        
        “It was suggested to him that he was avoiding the questions, that he did not want to answer them because it would reveal his guilt.” 
        
       
       
      Specifically in relation to the rape count, her Honour said: 
       
       
        
        “As I say he was cross examined very closely in relation to all of these matters and it is a matter for you ladies and gentlemen as to whether you feel he was shaken by the evidence, that he revealed that he was not telling the truth about his whereabouts and indeed as I say those are matters for you. The Crown has addressed you on it and I do not take it any further.” 
        
       
     61   During the course of argument on the appeal the Court requested that a transcript of the addresses be taken out, since it was not clear from the appeal papers whether the lies were relied upon as matters that went to credibility, or to a consciousness of guilt. So far as the latter was suggested in the way her Honour dealt with the matter in the first of the passages mentioned, then the summing up clearly fell well short of the directions required in Edwards (1993) 178 CLR 193.  
     62   If, however, there was some uncertainty about the matter, then, consistently with the decision in Zoneff (2000) 74 ALJR 895, her Honour should have required the prosecution to state in clear terms whether it contended that the evidence was relied upon as showing a consciousness of guilt or was a matter going to credibility. Otherwise if the matter had been left in the air, then a direction of the kind mentioned by Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ in Zoneff at para 23 could properly have been given, so as to ensure that the jury did not embark upon an impermissible line of reasoning. Their Honours there observed: 
      
       
        
        “[23] A direction which might have appropriately been given and which would have allayed any concerns which the trial judge may have had, in this unusual case, in which the issues may not have been defined as they might have been had the prosecutor made a speech to the jury, is one in these terms: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘You have heard a lot of questions, which attribute lies to the accused. You will make up your own mind about whether he was telling lies and if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies have in relation to the issues in the case but I give you this warning; do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something, that is evidence of guilt.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [24] A direction in such terms may well be adaptable to other cases in which there is a risk of a misunderstanding about the significance of possible lies even though the prosecution has not suggested that the accused told certain lies because he or she knew the truth would implicate him or her in the commission of the offence.” 
        
       
     63   Now that a transcript has been provided, it is apparent that the Crown Prosecutor attached a great deal of weight to what were said to be lies told by the appellant, which at one point were described in terms of having been “baldfaced and blatant”, and such as to invite scepticism as to what he had told the jury. The submissions in this regard extended to matters additional to those mentioned earlier, including the appellant’s assertion that he had been unable to see a fence that the complainant had described on the property, his claim to having been a gardener rather than a stationhand, and whether the property carried sheep rather than cattle.  
     64   Few if any of the “lies” identified related to a material aspect, being very much concerned with peripheral detail. The clear and strong thrust of what the Crown Prosecutor was putting, however, was that the appellant “would sooner slide off a question than face up to it and answer it”, because he had a “guilty conscience”, because he knew “he had a lot to hide” and because he knew “ultimately that the truth (would) reveal his guilt.” 
     65   In a supplementary submission delivered after the Court’s decision was reserved, the Crown has very fairly and responsibly accepted that while much of the submissions (and I would add the cross examination) went to the issue of credibility, at least some of the matters relied upon could be considered as having touched upon the issue of consciousness of guilt. It was further accepted that the credibility of the appellant was very important, and that as the jury had not been given any proper assistance as to what they were to do if they came to disbelieve him, this ground of appeal had been made good, even though no point was taken at trial. 
     66   The concession was properly made, and the appellant is, additionally, entitled to a new trial by reason of this ground. 
      
       
      Alibi direction  
       
     67   The appellant next submitted that the directions in relation to the alibi evidence concerning the rape count were deficient. The relevant witness was allowed to give the evidence, even though no proper notice had been given. No adjournment was sought by the Crown. It was, however, permitted to place before the jury, by way of a concession from the defence, that notice of the alibi had not been given by it (in accordance with S48 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986). 
     68   The trial Judge dealt with this in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        “Indeed you will recall that it has been conceded by Counsel, as is usually required if there is an alibi to be raised by an accused person that he was in another place at another time when the offences were supposed to have taken place that notice of that should be given to the Crown. And as Counsel conceded such a notice has never been given to the Crown that he was apparently so he says staying at (M’s) place over this period of time ….” 
        
       
     69   It was submitted by the appellant that this direction did not provide proper assistance to the jury as to the way in which they might take that procedural failure into account. In particular it was not made clear whether it was a matter going to the weight of the alibi evidence, or was indicative of a false alibi evidencing a consciousness of guilt (as to which an Edwards type direction should be given). Nor were the jury given any directions as to where the onus of proof lay, a matter that should be addressed where there is a danger of them assuming that it rested with an accused (J No.2) (1998) 3 VR 602 at 630); or as to the circumstance that if the alibi was reasonably possible then they should acquit (Steeden NSWCCA 19 August 1994); or as to the circumstance that even if they rejected it, that did not necessarily mean that the appellant was guilty (Visser NSWCCA 29 July 1994). 
     70   In appropriate cases, these directions should be given, and it would have been desirable once her Honour thought it necessary to touch upon the topic, to have at least developed the last of them. 
     71   No further direction was, however, sought at trial. Counsel in the appeal properly conceded that this matter would not have been sufficient to give rise to a miscarriage of justice, had it been the sole ground for complaint. This clearly was correct, given the passing nature of the reference, in the summing up, to the procedural requirement, which was unlikely to have meant much to the jury. However, as I have observed, it is not the only deficiency in the summing up, and the failure to assist the jury in relation to the significance (or lack of significance) attaching to the concession, compounded the other problems mentioned. 
     72   I would, by reference to grounds 1 and 4, allow the appeal, quash the convictions, and order a new trial. 
     73   STUDDERT J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.

        REGINA v Marc BAVIN 
         
         
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    SPIGELMAN CJ:  The Appellant was tried on an indictment alleging two separate but related offences: 
      
       
      (i) between 22 March 1999 and 25 March 1999 at Darlinghurst, he did rob John Andrews of certain property whilst being armed with an offensive weapon, contrary to s97 of the Crimes Act 1900; 
      
       
        
       (ii) at the same time and place he did take away and detain John Andrews with intent to hold him for the purpose of financial gain, contrary to s90A of the  
       Crimes Act 
        1900. 
        
       
     2    The Appellant pleaded not guilty to each count. He was tried and convicted on each count. Bellear DCJ sentenced the Appellant to a term of imprisonment of three years with a non-parole period of two years for the armed robbery count. His Honour sentenced the Appellant to a fixed term of twelve months for the kidnapping count. The sentences were handed down on 16 February 2001. The matter was listed for hearing in this Court on 7 March 2001. However, shortly before that hearing, the Crown filed a notice of appeal against the alleged inadequacy of the sentence. The hearing of the appeal against conviction was adjourned and the two matters have now been heard together. 
      
       
     3    The essence of the Crown case at the trial was that the Appellant, together with a man by the name of Owen Pomana (“the co-accused”), arranged for Pomana to hold up John Andrews with a gun and steal his Mercedes Benz motor vehicle, together with certain personal items. The case for the Appellant was that the three people mentioned, himself, Pomana and Andrews, had together arranged for Pomana to obtain Andrews’ vehicle from him and dispose of it so that Andrews could benefit from an insurance claim. 
      
       
     4    In the Appellant's case, Andrews was fraudulently intending to represent himself as a victim of a robbery and the Appellant was intended to be a witness to it. Andrews (“the Complainant”) denied that he was a party to any such scheme. 
      
       
     5    The proceedings were conducted as a contest between these two competing versions of events. The Crown case was left to the jury by the trial judge as one of joint criminal enterprise to steal a motor vehicle and other property from the Complainant at gun point, and, in the process, to kidnap him. The competing scenario of an insurance scam was left to the jury. There is no criticism of the summing up in any respect. 
      
       
        
       The Crown Case 
        
       
     6    The Crown case against the Appellant was, in relevant summary, as follows. The Appellant and the co-accused were well known to each other and the Appellant and the Complainant were old school friends who had stayed in touch. There was evidence of conversations between the Appellant and the co-accused before the event in which it was allegedly agreed that they would steal the Complainant's motor vehicle, a Mercedes Benz, at gunpoint. 
      
       
     7    Although there was no reason for the Appellant or the co-accused to have been aware of this, the vehicle was in fact the property of the Complainant's mother under a lease agreement. The vehicle was apparently used by the Complainant as his own. However, no part of any insurance pay-out was payable to the Complainant. Nor, in the event, was any such amount paid to him. 
      
       
     8    The Crown case was that the Appellant arranged to meet the Complainant at the Dov Cafe, Darlinghurst, at about 10 pm on 23 March 1999. The Complainant gave evidence that he parked the car at the corner of Forbes and Burton Streets, Darlinghurst. He saw the Appellant walking towards him at some distance. The Complainant was approached by the co-accused, who admired the car and asked if he could listen to the stereo system. The Complainant opened the passenger side door and allowed the co-accused to listen to the stereo system for twenty or thirty seconds. He was sitting beside the co-accused. By then, the Appellant had arrived at the car. 
      
       
     9    The Complainant and the Appellant parted company with the co-accused. As he walked towards the cafe with the Appellant, the Complainant asked the Appellant if he knew who that was, to which the Appellant replied he did not. 
      
       
     10    As the Complainant and the Appellant were walking along, the co-accused approached again. He said it was a hold-up and that he wanted the car. The Complainant said that he noticed the barrel of a gun visible under the co-accused’s jacket and pointing in his direction. The Appellant offered the co-accused his car keys, but the co-accused said he wanted the Complainant to come with him. The three men then walked back to the car. The co-accused asked the Complainant to drive. 
      
       
     11    He got into the driver’s seat. The co-accused warned the Appellant not to contact the Complainant's family or the police until 12.30 and that he (the co-accused) would know if he did, and there was a car outside the Complainant's family residence. This statement included a threat to “put a bullet in their head” if the family was contacted. 
      
       
     12    The Complainant said in his evidence that the Appellant then sat down on the pavement and he (the Complainant) drove off with the co-accused. 
      
       
     13    At the start of the trip, the co-accused took the Complainant’s wallet, phone and watch, and two pairs of sunglasses. The Complainant said he felt scared. During the trip the co-accused was holding the gun in his left hand, with some of it protruding from his jacket. Eventually the co-accused told the Complainant to pull into a closed service station. That was at Burwood. He told the Complainant to get any stuff out of the car he wanted to keep. The Complainant removed the remote control for the house gate, CDs and a baseball cap. 
      
       
     14    Having taken the American Express card, a Westpac ATM card and cash from the Complainant’s wallet, the co-accused returned other materials from the wallet to the Complainant. The co-accused had trouble starting the car. The Complainant helped him to get the car going. He said he was still in fear at that time. 
      
       
     15    When the co-accused had driven off, the Complainant flagged down a taxi. He spoke to his brother, Peter, on the taxi driver’s mobile phone. At about a quarter past twelve on 24 March 1999, the Complainant reported the matter at Rose Bay Police Station. He said he tried to contact the Appellant while he was there but the phone was not answered. 
      
       
     16    At about 1.30 am on 24 March 1999 the Appellant also attended at Rose Bay Police Station, ostensibly looking for the Complainant. He gave an account of what had occurred. Asked where he had been since the incident, the Appellant said he had stayed at Kings Cross as he had been told to do, and had then sat in his car for a while because he had been told that people were watching him. He said he had come to Rose Bay Police Station to report the matter because it was on his way home, and he did not know why he had not thought to ring the police 000 number, or go to the nearest police station. 
      
       
     17    The Appellant’s employer gave evidence that on 30 or 31 March 1999 the Appellant and the co-accused came to his office and asked him to put an American Express card through the EFTPOS machine to see if there was any money in it, which he did. The card was “declined”. In the course of further conversation the co-accused said, in the Appellant’s presence, that the card was stolen. 
      
       
     18    On 8 April 1999 the police searched the premises where the Appellant lived and found a pair of sunglasses in the Appellant’s bedroom, which the Complainant subsequently identified as his. 
      
       
     19    Two of the Appellant’s co-workers, Messrs Symmans and Sulameh gave evidence incriminating the Appellant, including conversations between the Appellant and the co-accused in which the Appellant said that he had “a very wealthy friend”, adding the suggestion “let's rob him”. They also gave evidence of conversations about obtaining a gun. 
      
       
     20    On 12 April 1999 the Mercedes car was found at Auburn in a burnt out condition. Evidence was given at the trial by the trustee of the John Andrews Family Trust. He said the Mercedes car was purchased by Ms Mary Andrews for a price of just over $99,000 in 1995. The car was insured for $95,000. A claim on the insurers was made and paid at an agreed pre-damage value of $64,000. A $500 excess was deducted. A sum of $48,578.24 was paid to liquidate the car loan and lease. The balance of $14,921.76 was paid to a family business account, and later credited to the loan account of Ms Andrews. The accessories on the vehicle and the stereo system were not insured. The Complainant was provided by the family with an Audi motor vehicle in place of the Mercedes. 
      
       
        
       The Appellant’s Case 
        
       
     21    The Appellant gave evidence. He said that a meeting between himself, the co-accused and the Complainant took place at the Dov Cafe three or four weeks prior to 23 March 1999. He said that arrangements were made on that occasion for a mock theft of the car. According to the Appellant, the Complainant was to represent himself as a victim of the robbery, the co-accused was to be the perpetrator and the Appellant was to be an innocent witness. 
      
       
     22    The Appellant and the co-accused were to profit by sale of the vehicle for its accessories and for spare parts, the Complainant was to benefit by receiving the proceeds of a false insurance claim, or from a share in the sale. The Appellant said he did not know how much that would be, perhaps a couple of thousand dollars, for each of the participants. 
      
       
     23    The Complainant had been cross-examined with the suggestion that the theft of the car was intended to be the basis of a false insurance claim. The Complainant denied any arrangement or any such meeting. He denied that he had met the co-accused prior to the theft. 
      
       
     24    The Appellant called a witness, Mr C Chant, who said that he saw the Appellant and a fairly large man together at the Dov Cafe, and that he then saw another man, nicely dressed, alight from a Mercedes or BMW and sit down with the Appellant and the other man. This was relied on as corroboration of an earlier meeting to which the Appellant deposed. 
      
       
     25    A further meeting was said to have occurred in the street outside the Appellant’s residence. The witnesses relied on by the Appellant to corroborate that meeting were Mr W Wilcock and Mr R M Symmans. They suggested that the co-accused was present, although the Complainant spoke only to the Appellant. The Complainant denied any such meeting. 
      
       
     26    The Appellant gave an account of the incident itself which was along the same lines as that given by the Complainant, except that he denied there was a gun involved. 
      
       
        
       Grounds of Appeal 
        
       
     27    There is a single ground of appeal, namely, that the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the 8vidence or that there has been a miscarriage of justice. The Appellant invoked the terms of s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The relevant tests are now well established in accordance with the High Court decisions in M v The Queen (1994) 191 CLR 487, as explained in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 487 and followed in Gipp v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 106 and the further consideration in Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250. 
      
       
     28    The Appellant’s challenge to the jury’s verdict on the basis that the jury could not reasonably have been satisfied by the Appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt, was based on two broad propositions: 
      
       
      (i) numerous aspects of the evidence tend to indicate, according to the Appellant’s submission, that John Andrews was a willing participant in the events; 
      
       
        
       (ii) the presence of a gun or offensive weapon was an essential aspect of the charge and the Appellant submitted that the evidence as to the presence of a gun was fraught with imprecision and inconsistency. 
        
        
       Appellant’s Arguments on Appeal 
        
       
     29    To convict, the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the version of events given by the Complainant was correct. Two reasons are advanced as to why the jury could not reasonably have been so satisfied. First, it was submitted that the jury was bound to reject the Complainant’s account of events as not including pre-arrangement, because of evidence suggesting the Complainant’s poor knowledge of and involvement in the relevant events. 
      
       
     30    Secondly, it was argued that the jury could not reasonably have been satisfied, on the evidence, that a gun was involved as the Complainant asserted, and which the Appellant denied. 
      
       
        
       The First Argument 
        
       
     31    As to the first of these reasons, the Appellant in written submissions made some eighteen points by reference to the evidence. 
      
       
        
       1. The Complainant said that the meeting with the co-accused occurred on the night of 23 March 1999 in an area which he regarded as dangerous. 
       
      It is hardly unusual for a young man to go to an area that he regards as dangerous. 
      
       
        
       2. The Complainant allowed the co-accused, said to be a complete stranger, to get into the front passenger seat of the motor vehicle for the apparent purpose of listening to the stereo player. This is said to be incredible. 
       
      The whole of the evidence of the encounter has to be considered. The Complainant gave evidence that the co-accused introduced himself as a friend of the Complainant’s brother and of a friend of a friend of the Complainant’s brother, and that the latter had told him that the Complainant had recently bought a new car stereo. That piece of detail would have confirmed a link of a personal kind. 
      
       
        
       3. The Complainant left the vehicle in an area he regarded as dangerous, whereas he was known to keep a close eye on it. 
       
      This is not strong evidence of complicity. It is consistent with uncharacteristic carelessness, a common enough occurrence. 
      
       
        
       4. The ostensible hold-up was under the glare of the lights of Oxford Street. 
       
      The Crown suggested that any incongruity about the choice of the place for the hold-up might be explained by a plan to hold-up the Complainant when the co-accused got into the car ostensibly to listen to the stereo system. It suggested that the plan might have gone wrong when the Complainant got out of the car abruptly, after a very short time. However that may be, a hold-up under good lighting is, unfortunately, not an unusual event. The threat of violence by showing a concealed weapon was, in any event, covert. 
      
       
        
       5. When the Complainant returned to the vehicle, as allegedly instructed by the co-accused, the Appellant was with them. In his evidence the Complainant agreed that he could have locked the doors at that stage to prevent the co-accused from getting into the car. The implication is apparently that, if the Complainant’s story were true, it was two against one, the Complainant and the Appellant against the accused, so why would the Complainant have not resisted? 
       
      The point overlooks the evidence that, according to the Complainant, the co-accused had a gun. 
      
       
        
       6. The Appellant and the Complainant were well known to each other. Accordingly, it was submitted that it was unlikely that the Appellant would embark upon such a serious offence in circumstances where his identity was well known to the victim. 
       
      This argument overlooks the point that, on the Crown case, the Appellant cast himself in the role of an innocent bystander. This, according to the Crown case, he sought to reinforce by himself reporting the episode to the police and expressing concern about the fate of the Complainant. 
      
       
        
       7. The co-accused permitted the Appellant to remove personal property from the vehicle before it was taken away. The implication is that that is not credible unless the Complainant was complicit in what was happening. 
       
      The point is only good if the co-accused had to be all bad if he was bad at all. That does not accord with one's experience of human nature. The items removed were of some personal value to the Complainant and of no, or very little, value to the accused. 
      
       
        
       8. According to the Complainant he assisted the co-accused to start the vehicle. This is also suggested to be evidence of complicity. 
       
      Again, the point overlooks the element in the Crown case that the co-accused was believed by the Complainant to have a gun and that the Complainant was afraid. 
      
       
        
       9. The Complainant told the taxi driver he had no money because he had just been robbed. That, it is argued, was consistent with the Appellant's version of events, namely, that the robbery was staged. 
       
      The point is neutral. The evidence is consistent with both scenarios. 
      
       
        
       10. Rather than asking the taxi driver to take him to a police station, the Complainant asked to be driven home. Further, when he spoke to his brother on the taxi driver's mobile phone, he did not ask him to report the incident to the police. Again, the implication is that such complacency is consistent with complicity. 
       
      The suggestion of complacency on the part of the Complainant is, however, by no means common ground. The Complainant says that he was, at this stage, badly shaken and others, including the taxi driver who saw him at and shortly after this time, attested to that. Further, contrary to the Appellant’s submission, the evidence of the Complainant and his brother is that the Complainant spoke to his brother on the taxi driver's mobile phone and that, in the course of that conversation, it was arranged that the brother would call the police. The failure to report is not strong evidence, if any evidence at all, of complicity. It is consistent with the continuation of the Complainant’s fears and also of the effects of the evidence, particularly with respect to the Appellant, that his house was being watched according to the evidence given at the trial, and which it was open for the jury to accept. 
      
       
        
       11. There was allegedly a lengthy discussion by the Complainant with members of his family before he and his brother went to the Rose Bay police station, arriving there shortly after midnight. The Complainant's evidence was that he spent a good fifteen minutes telling his family about what he described as being “the whole ordeal” before going to the police station with his brother. Later he said twenty to thirty minutes. 
       
      Such estimates of time are notoriously unreliable. The jury did not have to accept that evidence as being reliable. But, assuming they did, spending that time with his family before going to the police is not inherently incredible if the Complainant's account of what would have been a terrifying experience is correct. 
      
       
        
       12. The Appellant arrived at the Rose Bay police station while the Complainant was still there. The Complainant said in his evidence that he did not know that the Appellant was there at that time, notwithstanding that he saw the Appellant's father, who was known to the Complainant. The point seems to be that the Complainant was wilfully concealing knowledge that the Appellant would come to the police station to report the robbery. 
       
      I do not find this to be of any significance. It is a minor discrepancy which does not point in any particular direction. 
      
       
        
       13. The versions of events given to the police by the Complainant and the Appellant were said to be “strikingly similar”, particularly in the manner in which they described the co-accused. The imputation is that there had been detailed prior agreement as to what they would say to the police. 
       
      Similarity would be expected on either version of events. The manner in which the similarity was said to be “striking” was not elaborated on. There is no reason why observing the same event would not have impressed itself on the minds of both the Complainant and the Appellant. 
      
       
        
       14. The Complainant denied a prior meeting with the Appellant and the co-accused some weeks prior to the incident at the cafe. The Appellant relied on independent evidence suggesting that there may have been a meeting. 
       
      The point is only as good as the evidence of such a prior meeting involving the Complainant was compelling. It was not compelling. Mr Chant did not identify the Complainant as the person who he said joined the Appellant and another person, with a description similar to the co-accused, at the cafe. Indeed, his description of the person was, in some respects, different from the appearance of the Complainant. 
      
       
        
       15. The Appellant also relied on evidence of what he submitted was a further meeting said to have been in the street. Mr M Wilcock spoke of an occasion when the Appellant and the co-accused were seen by him to go down to the street from the Appellant's flat to a man in a black Mercedes motor car. Before going down, the Appellant had answered his mobile phone and had said that “John” was out the front with the Mercedes Benz, and that he and the co-accused should go down and check it out. Mr Symmans gave evidence of seeing such a meeting at the car. Neither witness identified the Complainant as the other person involved. They gave evidence that the driver of the car spoke only to the Appellant. Neither gave evidence that the co-accused participated in any conversation or that he was observable to the occupant of the vehicle. 
       
      This was not strong evidence of the Complainant having been involved in a meeting with the Appellant and the co-accused. The Complainant denied it. The jury was not bound to find he was involved in any such meetings. It was a live jury question. 
      
       
        
       16. The Complainant told the police in a written statement that, prior to the incident, he heard from the Appellant only about once every two months. By contrast, mobile telephone records showed that the Complainant had telephoned the Appellant nine times between 11 March and 23 March 1999 and the Appellant had telephoned the Complainant eleven times between 20 and 23 March. 
       
      This was objective evidence of a closer association than the Complainant admitted to the police. It went to the Complainant's credit generally. In this regard, it was of significance for the jury when making an assessment of the Complainant’s credit. It was not, however, determinative. It was also consistent with the planning for a mock robbery, conformably with the Appellant’s case. Again, however, it was not determinative. On its own it would not, in my opinion, sustain a reasonable doubt about the Crown case. The matter was before the jury. Its proper assessment was a matter for them. 
      
       
        
       17. The Complainant gave a number of different versions relating to the presence of the gun. The Appellant denied that there was any gun involved. 
       
      This submission will be dealt with in connection with the second argument advanced for the Appellant. 
      
       
        
       18. The fact that the Appellant himself reported the incident to the police and his account of events to the police was, according to the Appellant's submissions, strong evidence in support of the truth of his version of events. 
        
        The reporting of the incident to the police and the Appellant’s account of events to the police are neutral considerations. The Appellant’s behaviour is as much consistent with an attempt to deflect suspicion from himself following a genuine robbery as it is with the Appellant acting out the role of an innocent bystander to lend veracity to a staged robbery. 
        
        
        
        
       The Second Argument 
        
       
     32    The Appellant submits that the evidence concerning the gun was fraught with imprecision and inconsistency. The Appellant is able to point to inconsistencies in the Complainant’s evidence concerning the extent to which he allegedly had a clear view of the gun, whether the gun was actually pointing at him, how much of the gun he was able to see at various stages, when the gun was fully exposed, whether the gun was held at times under the co-accused’s jacket or under his shirt, and so on. The Appellant agreed that he had given different versions about this and different descriptions of the gun. 
      
       
     33    The short answer to this argument is that, if the Complainant was telling the truth, this was a terrifying experience and imprecisions of detail and inconsistencies of the kind demonstrated were to be expected. They do not necessarily indicate unreliability in relation to the essence of the Complainant’s evidence, namely, that the Complainant was threatened with a gun. It is also to be borne in mind that there was evidence of an intention to use a gun in the alleged planning conversations prior to the incident. 
      
       
     34    The alleged imprecisions and inconsistencies were before the jury. Whether they were such as to justify any doubt about the presence of a gun was a matter for the jury to weigh and assess. This is not a case in which, by reason of the inconsistencies, the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt about any essential element of the offence. 
      
       
        
       Conclusions 
        
       
     35    To convict, the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was a true robbery. The competing versions of events, that it was a mock robbery, had only to be a reasonable possibility to require acquittal. The reliability of the Complainant's account of events was therefore critical. 
      
       
     36    The Complainant’s credibility has been impugned on appeal on many grounds. Overwhelmingly the points are, in my opinion, of no moment at all. Those with any cogency, such as whether there had been prior meetings, are of only marginal value. 
      
       
     37    The only point of substance is the number of telephone conversations between the Appellant and the Complainant in the ten days or so before the incident. That is objective evidence which calls the Complainant’s credibility into question in a serious way, and it bolsters the competing scenario of an insurance scam. As against this, however, there is the inherent implausibility of the Appellant having become involved in a scam which could not be of any significant benefit to him. It was open to a jury, however, to accept the Complainant’s account of the robbery as being truthful, notwithstanding that he had not been truthful about the extent of the prior association. 
      
       
     38    The points against the Complainant’s credibility ventilated on appeal were put in final address to the jury at the trial and were carefully left to the jury by the trial judge in his summing up for the jury’s consideration. The jury accepted the Complainant’s version of events, notwithstanding those considerations, as they were entitled to do. 
      
       
     39    This appeal is, in my opinion, without merit and the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Crown Appeal 
        
       
     40    I turn to the Crown appeal. The Crown appeals against the alleged inadequacy of the sentence. The maximum penalty for an armed robbery offence is twenty years and for the kidnapping offence it is fourteen years. 
      
       
     41    The trial of the Appellant was originally a joint trial with the co-accused, Pomana. During the course of that trial Pomana was discharged without verdict and his trial was stood over to a date to be fixed. The trial in relation to the Appellant continued. He was found guilty on 7 July 2000. On 8 November 2000 Pomana entered a plea of guilty to a single count of armed robbery and was sentenced, on 15 February 2001, to a community service order of three hundred hours. In sentencing Pomana his Honour took into account that he had already spent thirteen months and ten days in custody, with respect to the matter. 
      
       
     42    On 12 March 2001 the Director of Public Prosecutions signed a notice of appeal under s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 on the basis that the sentence of Pomana was inadequate. The Court was informed that the Crown has been unable to locate Pomana and, accordingly, the Crown appeal in his case has not been heard. In such circumstances, normally, no question of parity would arise. 
      
       
     43    However, Mr Paul Byrne SC, who appeared for the Appellant, submitted that concessions made by the Crown in the course of the hearing on sentence of Pomana were such as to indicate, in effect, that the Crown had no reasonable prospects of a successful Crown appeal in the case of Pomana and, accordingly, the issue of parity between Pomana and the Appellant does fall for consideration. 
      
       
     44    In his remarks on sentence in the case now before the Court the sentencing judge expressly found that there were no “special circumstances” within s44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Nevertheless, his Honour did not apply the appropriate non-parole period. His Honour imposed a non-parole period of two years, whereas, on the basis of the formula for which the Act provides, it should have been two years and three months. 
      
       
     45    The Court was informed that when the matter was re-listed before his Honour at Campbelltown District Court he indicated that the non-parole period ought to be adjusted but, in the absence of the respondent, left the making of any adjustment to this Court. 
      
       
     46    In its submissions the Crown relied on a number of aspects of the offence, to which I have already referred above. The Crown accepted his Honour’s finding that it was Bavin who initiated the scheme and that Pomana played “second fiddle”. Save in two respects, no particular criticism was directed to the remarks on sentence in the Crown's submissions. The two respects were: 
      
       
      (i) his Honour found that it was Bavin who was to tell Andrews about the scheme before it happened but failed to do so. It was submitted that there was no evidence to suggest such a finding. 
      
       
        
       (ii) his Honour found that when the planning went astray Bavin and Pomana were equally culpable in proceeding with the robbery and kidnapping. It was submitted there was no evidence before his Honour that any “planning” had gone astray. 
        
       
     47    It is not clear how either of the matters to which reference was made affected his Honour's sentence in a manner which could explain what the Crown alleges is an inadequacy in the final result. 
      
       
     48    The basic proposition of the Crown was that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate in all of the circumstances and, accordingly, reflects error in the exercise of discretion. The Crown referred to the guideline judgment for the offence of armed robbery promulgated by the Court in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. 
      
       
     49    The Crown pointed to the significant degree of planning, the large amount stolen and the use of a gun as a threat as indicating a high level of objective seriousness of the crime. Furthermore the Crown points to the kidnapping as a significant aggravating factor for the appropriate sentence with respect to the armed robbery. 
      
       
     50    The Crown does not challenge the appropriateness of his Honour’s decision to make the two sentences concurrent. Nor is there any challenge to the sentence for the kidnapping offence. However, it is submitted that the act of kidnapping was a significant aggravating feature of the armed robbery. In the circumstances it was appropriate, the Crown submitted, that his Honour reflect the total criminality in the principal sentence. 
      
       
     51    Subject to the issue of parity, in my opinion, this was a case in which the Crown made out its case that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. There were no compelling subjective considerations which justified any substantial degree of leniency. The objective circumstances of the offence were serious; property of substantial value was acquired by an express threat of violence with the victim in fear of his life, over a substantial period of time, in circumstances in which he was alone with the Appellant’s co-offender heading to an unknown destination. The evidence was clear as to the significant effect this state of fear had on the victim. 
      
       
     52    The issue of parity arises because of what occurred in the sentencing hearing of the co-offender, Pomana, a sentence hearing which Judge Bellear heard on 1 February 2001, the day before the sentence hearing of the Appellant. 
      
       
     53    The submissions made by counsel for Pomana were based on a scenario in which Pomana did not know that Andrews was unaware of the alleged “insurance scam” until he arrived at the Dov Cafe and met Andrews and the Appellant together. It was only during the course of that meeting, being the date of the offence, that Pomana, so it was submitted, became aware that Andrews was not a willing participant. It was at that point, it was submitted, that Pomana decided to proceed by means of the threat of violence. It was in that context that counsel for Pomana made the submission as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “... no further full time custody would benefit this particular accused or the community than a long period of community service, perhaps even the maximum ... I'm saying that the gaol time already is sufficient. It's near the bottom of the range but I suggest it's in range and I submit your Honour wouldn't be falling into appellable error by allowing that to stand as the full amount of full time custody ... “. 
         
        
       
     54    The Crown made submissions with respect to this issue in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “... It's also the Crown case that the victim was not aware, was not party to, any of this arrangement, as it were, and I think that's been said this morning ... in submissions that the prisoner became aware that it would appear that the victim was unaware of this arrangement.  
          And, as far as my friend’s submission concerning a non-custodial penalty your Honour, I don't wish to speak against those. 
          This is a case where the prisoner has spent a substantial time on remand. 
         
        
        
         
         (Counsel for Pomana): I’m indebted to the Crown for that submission your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Yes, and I think in fairness I think the Crown has made appropriate submissions in that regard. Just tell me this, Ms Crown, you also say this prisoner was the least involved in the scheme of the two? 
         
        
        
         
         (Crown): Yes, your Honour, those are my instructions from those who represented the Crown in both matters, this matter and the matter of the co-offender who is to be sentenced.” 
         
        
       
     55    The Crown submissions in the present proceedings as to the prospect of a successful Crown appeal in the case of Pomana must be considered in the light of the concession made by the Crown, in the italicised portion of the submissions to the effect that it did not wish to “speak against” the submission that it was appropriate for a non-custodial penalty to be imposed at that stage. 
      
       
     56    The issue arises in unusual and perhaps unique circumstances. In the normal case, this Court would wish to hear the two appeals together. It is not in a position to do so. Nor is the Crown in any position to indicate that this Court would be able to hear the two appeals together within a reasonable time. It has not been able to serve its notice of appeal on Pomana. The Court is not aware of the full circumstances of that inability. However, there is nothing before the Court to indicate that it would be in any way appropriate to stand this matter over for a short period to determine whether or not the appeal could be heard together with that of Pomana, nor was any such submission made by the Crown in that regard. 
      
       
     57    Accordingly, this case falls for consideration in circumstances in which, as I have indicated, in my opinion the sentence in this case was manifestly inadequate and in which it appears to me, at least as presently instructed, that a similar conclusion could well be drawn in the case of Pomana. 
      
       
     58    I do not wish to be understood to be expressing any opinion as to the outcome of the case of Pomana, should that ever be heard. That is particularly so because there was a significant difference between the two cases, namely, there was a further offence of armed robbery taken into account on a Form 1, a consideration that does not arise in this case. There are obviously other differences, including differences as to the apparent factual assumptions made for purposes of sentence in Pomana, with the factual findings made by his Honour in the case of the Appellant, findings that his Honour could make after hearing the evidence in a full trial. 
      
       
     59    The Crown relied on the proposition that considerations of parity may not give rise to a sense of grievance that can be regarded as legitimate in circumstances where the inadequacy of sentence imposed upon the co-offender was so grave that, whatever may be said about the grievance, it could not be regarded as a legitimate one. The Crown referred to observations to that effect in R v Diamond (NSWCCA, 18 February 1993, unreported) and also in R v Steele (NSWCCA, 17 April 1997, unreported). Other similar comments have been made in other cases. 
      
       
     60    The issue of precisely how reliance may be placed, for purposes of a parity argument, on another sentence which was itself manifestly inadequate is a matter which arises in different contexts in different ways. The cases on which the Crown relied were severity appeals. In the context of Crown appeals quite different considerations arise. As is well known the Court's approach to Crown appeals is distinctly different to the approach taken in severity appeals. 
      
       
     61    In this case, of particular significance is the unusual circumstance that the Crown seeks to challenge as manifestly inadequate in the Pomana appeal, a sentence for which the representative of the Crown before his Honour in the case of Pomana indicated the Crown did not wish to make submissions against, namely, a non-custodial sentence being imposed after the period of incarceration that had actually occurred in that case. 
      
       
     62    The Crown is not always debarred from changing its mind and adopting a different position on appeal than it took below, in respect to matters of sentence. In that regard reference was made to the passage in R v Allpass (1994) 72 A Crim R 561 where the Crown took a different attitude on appeal to that which it took below in the same case. In this case the Crown is taking a different position to that which it took at first instance on the sentencing of a co-offender in a different case, it not having taken a similar attitude of what may appear to be leniency, in the case of Bavin presently before the Court. 
      
       
     63    Nevertheless the question of parity does arise in this sense: a sense of grievance that may be regarded as justifiable would remain if the Crown, in this case, was successful in this appeal, and the Court increased to any substantial degree the sentence imposed upon the Appellant, bringing it closer to what, in my opinion, would be regarded as an adequate sentence in all of the circumstances of the case. 
      
       
     64    The Crown’s submissions in the case of Pomana, upon which the Appellant in this case relies, were contingent on and made in the context of an acceptance of the proposition that Pomana was significantly less culpable than the present Appellant. Notwithstanding its reliance on a Crown concession upon the issue which is directly pertinent to the issue of parity in the present case, the Appellant sought to question his Honour's findings about the comparative culpability of the two co-offenders being findings made in the remarks on sentence of the Appellant. Indeed, the submission went so far as to question whether or not the Appellant had a justifiable sense of grievance that he had been dealt with more harshly. 
      
       
     65    I should outline what the findings of Bellear DCJ were. His Honour made the following observations in his remarks on sentence: 
      
       
        
         
         “I'm satisfied that it was the prisoner who initiated the whole scheme and that Pomana played ‘second fiddle’.” 
         
        
        
       And, 
        
         
         “I find that the prisoner was the leader and initiator of a scheme organising and making arrangements, including luring Andrews to the hands of the co-offender. I accept, however, that once part of the arrangements broke down, that is, that Andrews was not told of the plot and was therefore not part of the scam, that when it went ahead both the prisoner and co-offender were then on an equal footing as leaders” 
         
        
        
       and 
        
         
         “I am satisfied that this prisoner planned the whole scheme and initiated and organised the event to occur on the day it did. I am further satisfied that the prisoner lured his best friend and victim to the location and for him to be kidnapped and robbed. I further accept that much of the planning went astray when the victim was not informed that he was to participate in a scheme to rob him of his motor vehicle. I am satisfied that when the robbery and kidnapping took place, both the prisoner and co-offender were equally culpable.” 
         
        
       
     66    It is by no means clear that everything in these passages are consistent with the jury's verdict. Nevertheless his Honour's findings as to the comparative culpability are, in my opinion, entirely supportable on the evidence. 
      
       
     67    Counsel for the Appellant sought to rely on some apparent concessions made by counsel for Pomana in the proceedings on sentence in the case of Pomana, as if they constituted some kind of admission of a higher level of culpability which was relevant for purposes of sentencing of his client. I do not see that the remarks made were entitled to significant, if any, weight in this regard. 
      
       
     68    His Honour’s finding that the Appellant in this case was the instigator of the scheme, in that he both planned it and took crucial steps by exploiting his personal relationship to bring the victim into a position of vulnerability, was such as to justify a conclusion that the Appellant should receive a higher sentence. 
      
       
     69    In my opinion, in the exercise of this Court’s residual discretion not to intervene, the Court should dismiss the Crown appeal on the basis of the issue of parity on which the Appellant relies. Normally the manifest inadequacy of the sentence imposed on Pomana would not necessarily lead to the Court dismissing the Crown appeal in this case, by reason of the extent to which it was inadequate and the extent to which the sentence in this case was inadequate. However, special circumstances have arisen in this case. 
      
       
     70    Those circumstances are that the Pomana appeal has not been heard and there is nothing before this Court that would indicate it can be heard in any kind of reasonable time. 
      
       
     71    Secondly, in the particular circumstances of this case the Crown itself was directly involved in leading his Honour into error in the case of Pomana by making the submission I have quoted above. That submission was made in a context where there had been discussions between the Crown and the representative of the accused resulting in a plea of guilty to one charge. The circumstances of those discussions, what was agreed upon and what other surrounding circumstances may have impinged upon the negotiations are not before the Court. 
      
       
     72    In all of these circumstances I believe that the Court should exercise its residual discretion not to intervene in the case of Bavin. 
      
       
     73    Notwithstanding what appears to have been an error in the mathematical calculation of the non-parole period, in my opinion the Court in its discretion should not intervene in this regard. The Respondent to the Crown appeal will serve a period of two years, which contrasts with the period of thirteen months and ten days actually served by his co-offender, to which must be added the three hundred hours of community service. This reflects the comparative culpability of the two offenders, so that neither can have any grievance on the basis of disparity in that regard. However, there may be other considerations that arise should the Crown appeal in the case of Pomana be heard. In my opinion the Crown appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     74    Justice Greg James has drawn my attention to the fact the trial judge did not direct the release at the end of the two years. 
      
       
     75    Accordingly, the orders I propose are that the conviction appeal should be dismissed, that the orders of the trial judge on sentence should be varied by the addition of an order directing the release of the Appellant at the expiry of the non-parole period but otherwise that the Crown appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     76    WOOD CJ at CL: I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice and with the reasons given for them. 
      
       
     77    GREG JAMES J: As I do also. 
      
       
     78    SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as I have directed.

    IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL CCA 60610/00 MEAGHER JA SULLY J DOWD J Friday, 27 April 2001 
      
      REGINA v S 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1   MEAGHER JA: On 28 August 2000 the appellant, Mr S, stood trial in the District Court charged with six offences of indecent assault on a male person, the complainant, Stuart Greenlees, (who was fourteen or fifteen at the time of the alleged offence). The dates of the alleged assault were, in the charges, said to have been between April and July of 1976. Counts 1 to 6 were listed in alleged chronological sequence. 
     2   The case was the subject of committal proceedings and also of an aborted trial before her Honour Judge Latham. It was eventually heard by his Honour Judge Howie. Mr Greenlees gave evidence on all three occasions. He also made various written statements. There was a twenty year delay between the date of the alleged incidents and the date when any complaint was made to the police. 
     3   The jury convicted the appellant on the first three charges and acquitted him on charges four, five and six. The Crown case really depended on the uncorroborated evidence of Mr Greenlees. 
     4   This appeal raises the question whether the jury’s verdicts are inconsistent and represent a miscarriage of justice. 
     5   It is not necessary for present purposes to outline the precise facts of each charge. The following will suffice for present purposes: 
      
      (a) Count 1: an act of fellation by Mr. S on Mr Greenlees. 
       
      (b) Count 2: another act of fellation. 
       
      (c) Count 3: Mr S was “pulling” Mr Greenlees penis. 
       
      (d) Count 4: a third act of fellation. 
       
      (e) Count 5: a fourth act of fellation. 
       
      (f) Count 6: a fifth act of fellation. 
       
     6   The accounts of Mr Greenlees of all six incidents were substantially denied by Mr S. 
     7   Eventually Mr Greenlees placed all six charges as having happened in 1976, however he had originally placed them in 1975. When he changed his version from 1975 to 1976 he said, “Apart from the date, the change of date in the year, all other matters were accurate”. 
     8   The accounts which he gave were accompanied by details whereby particular events were fixed in time. For example, Mr Greenlees placed the count four incident by virtue of the fact that he had been taken to the performance of a play by a Mr Gil Tucker at the Nimrod Theatre that evening. Subsequent evidence, including the testimony of Mr Tucker, which was not seriously in issue, demonstrated that Mr Tucker did not play at the Nimrod Theatre in either 1975 or 1976. 
     9   Again, Mr Greenlees gave some background evidence of his reaction to the events of the first count. He said: 
      
       
        
        “Back at school two days later on the Monday, I avoided him in a big way. In class I saw that he was obviously very angry at this. He started directing underhand comments at me and started attacking my ego. I can’t remember exactly what he said but I remember feeling very uncomfortable. I felt as if I owed him something. This went on for two or three weeks. My school work and attitude went down badly and I was under pressure from other teachers and my parents. I had a maths test around this time and I failed it”. 
        
       
       
      In fact, the evidence disclosed that Mr S did not have Mr Greenlees in his class that year, nor did he fail any maths test. His results in maths tests were uniformly high in 1975 and 1976 where he scored the result on approximately 86 percent. 
       
     10   Mr Game, in his submissions, gave many other examples where the surrounding circumstances were relied on by Mr Greenlees in respect of counts 1, 2 and 3 which were equally untruthful. Whether that was the result of mendacity or some other more charitable cause it is impossible to determine. It seems to me no sensible reliance could be placed on his evidence. In those circumstances I cannot understand how the verdicts on the first three counts are to be considered as other than unsafe and unsatisfactory and, indeed, that they are inconsistent with the jury’s verdicts on counts four, five and six and constitute a miscarriage of justice. 
     11   The Crown has pointed out a number of matters including the following: (a) That the jury are the sole judges of the truth or otherwise of any allegations, not an appellate court; (b) the apparently curious result of guilt on the first three counts but not on the fourth, fifth and sixth counts could be attributed to the fact that the jury thought there was a change in Mr Greenlees’ demeanour, the subtle influence of which made its way into the jury’s conclusions; (c) the jury may return an irrational verdict if, for example, it is of the view that three verdicts of guilty constitute sufficient punishment for the accused; (d) the fact that some incidental allegations are proved to be wrong does not justify the conclusion that the central allegation is wrong; (3) in any event, the terms of certain letters written by Mr S to or about Mr Greenlees would seem to indicate that he must in some way, at some stage, have been guilty of some misconduct. 
     12   The points which I have recited in (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the last paragraph are supportable both in principle and by reference to respectable judicial authority. However, if they were true in any absolute sense, no court could ever set aside a jury verdict, a result which would be totally inconsistent with a multitude of High Court decisions. In my view, as I have said, the verdicts are inconsistent and represent a miscarriage of justice. 
     13   The orders that this court should make are: 
      
       
        
        1. Appeal allowed; 
        
       
       
        
        2. To set aside the convictions and sentences on orders from charges 1, 2 and 3 and I should add in my view there should be no new trial. 
        
       
       
     14   SULLY J: I agree with the orders proposed and generally with the reasons given but I wish to add some brief observations.  
     15   The considerations which are decisive in the view I have taken merits of this appeal, are considerations appearing in the joint judgment of Justices Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow in Jones v R (1997) 191 CLR 439. I have in mind in particular the first three paragraphs of the material under the heading “The adverse impact on the acquittal on the second count”. This is neither the time nor the place to engage in any extended discussion of the inherent reasoning in those paragraphs. It is sufficient to say that whilever that reasoning remains on foot with the authority of the High Court of Australia then its application, given the facts of the present case, would seem to me to entail necessarily that the convictions on counts 1, 2 and 3 cannot stand.  
     16   We were referred during the course of argument to a decision of a differently constituted Bench of this Court in the matter of R v Crisologo (1997) 99 ACrimR 178. It is sufficient to say of the three relevant categories of situation there discussed, in particular in the judgment of Justice Simpson, that it would seem to me, on the material at present available, that the present case would fit within the first of those three categories. 
     17   For the whole of those reasons and, as I have said, I agree with the orders proposed.  
     18   DOWD J: I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour the presiding Judge and his reasons therefore. I also agree with the remarks of Mr Justice Sully. 
     19   MEAGHER JA: The order of the court, therefore, is the orders I have proposed. 
      
       
        
        (Further submissions from counsel). 
        
       
     20   SULLY J: My position is clear, I would not grant the application. 
     21   MEAGHER JA: I would grant the application. 
     22   DOWD J: My reasons related to matters that would have pertained to the jury generally, my reasons for concurring primarily with those reasons advanced by Mr Justice Sully in relation to Jones and I would reject the application. 
     23   MEAGHER JA: By majority the application is rejected. 
      
       
        
        (Further submissions by counsel) 
        
       
     24   MEAGHER JA: The order of this court is that in all publications of this matter the appellant should be referred to as Mr. S.

      AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED v JOHN MARSDEN 
     Facts:The claimant and opponent (Mr Marsden) are parties to defamation proceedings before Levine J. In that action Levine J made orders in relation to an application by a witness to give evidence at the defamation trial under a pseudonym. His Honour dismissed the application and this decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal, reported as Witness v Marsden (2000) 49 NSWLR 429. During these proceedings the Court of Appeal made a series of orders both interim and final. On 10 March 2000, at the commencement of the hearing the Court ordered that; 
      
       
       “Until further order there will be no publication of the name of the witness involved.” 
       
     The Court further ordered at the close of the hearing on 15 March 2000; 
      
       
       “Until further order, there be an order prohibiting publication referable to proceedings in the Court of Appeal of any material that would identify or be likely to identify the witness.”  
       
     In the judgment handed down on 22 March 2000 the Court made the following orders, which are relevant to these contempt proceedings; 
      
       
       “4. The Witness is to be addressed and referred to in the court only by a pseudonym.  
        
       5. Any matter which is likely to lead to identification of the Witness is not to be reported by those in court.”  
       
     The claimant sought a declaration that Mr Marsden was guilty of contempt in relation to these orders of the Court of Appeal. It was alleged that Mr Marsden acted in breach of the orders of 10 and 15 March 2000 and that he acted with the intention of frustrating, thwarting and subverting order 5 of 22 March 2000.The contempt charges related to Mr Marsden’s conduct on 22 March 2000 when he gave or showed an article from 13 February 1999, identifying the protected witness, to a number of journalists and discussed the matter with them. At the close of the claimant’s case it was submitted by Mr Marsden that there was no case for him to answer as the evidence did not establish that he had the requisite knowledge of the orders upon which the contempts were based and further, that the evidence did not establish that he acted to frustrate, thwart or subvert the purpose of order 5HELD(i) Per Ipp AJA, Powell JA and Giles JA agreeing;The question to be decided in a no case submission heard before a judge or magistrate alone is the same as when the trial involves a jury. Therefore the question to be decided is a question of law as to whether the defendant/opponent could lawfully be convicted on the evidence as it stands, that is, whether there is some evidence with respect to each element of the charge which, if accepted, would either prove the element directly or allow such an inference to be drawn. In deciding the no case submission the judge, whether sitting alone or with a jury, it is not the role of the judge to evaluate the evidence. (Haw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor [1982] AC 136; Torrance v Cornish (1985) 79 FLR 87; Myers v Claudianos (1990) 100 FLR 362; Cox v Salt (1994) 12 WAR 12, followed)(ii) Per Ipp AJA, Powell JA and Giles JA, agreeing in part; (a) (Per curiam) 
      
       
        
         
         Mr Marsden’s knowledge of the orders of 10 and 15 March 2000 was an essential element of the contempt charges, thus the claimant was required to show that Mr Marsden had knowledge of the substance of the orders “at, or immediately after, the time it was made”. The question of knowledge was dealt with by the claimant by relying on the evidence of various journalists, an discussion of 9 June 2000 and a proposed speech written by Mr Marsden. Whilst Mr Marsden acknowledged that he knew that the judgment in question involved an order as to the non-disclosure of the identity of the witness this did not resolve that he had knowledge of the relevant orders, or their substance. Thus the evidence did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Marsden had the requisite knowledge of the relevant orders and the case in regard to the contempt charges based on those orders fails. 
         
        
       
     (a) (Per Giles JA)  
      
       
        
         
         Taking the evidence of the journalists and the discussion of 9 June 2000 as a whole it would be open to find that Mr Marsden knew of order 5 of 22 March 2000 which prohibited the identification of the witness. However the evidence is not capable of proving beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Marsden knew of this order or its substance.  
         
        
       
     (iii) Per Ipp AJA, Giles JA and Powell JA, agreeing in part;(a) (Per Ipp AJA, Giles JA agreeing) 
      
       
        
         
         The construction of order 5 of 22 March 2000 was such that it was intended to have prospective effect and extend the protection of the witness afforded by the order of 15 March 2000 to the resumption of the defamation proceedings before Levine J. Therefore the substance of order 5 was to prohibit those who were present in the Court of Appeal or at Levine J’s court from reporting any matter that may be likely to lead to the identification of the witness. In this sense the order was capable of being frustrated, thwarted or subverted by Mr Marsden, however the evidence of the journalists and the exchange of 9 June 2000 was insufficient to prove this beyond reasonable doubt. 
         
        
       (b) (Per Powell JA on the issue of construction of order 5) 
        
         
         In relation to the construction of order 5 it must be taken into account that the judgments of Levine J and the Court of Appeal took place in different circumstances, one being in closed court, the other in open court. However it was clear that the evidence of the witness was not intended to be given in closed court before Levine J. As a result the relevant order was intended to prevent the publication of material likely to identify the witness whilst in court giving evidence.

      JUDGMENT 
       
     1    POWELL JA: I have read in draft the Judgment which has been prepared by Ipp AJA. Save only that I would not give to Order 5 made by the Court on 22 March 2000 the expansive construction suggested by him, I agree with the orders which his Honour has proposed and with the reasons which he gives for so doing. 
      
       
     2    The reasons for my differing from Ipp AJA on the question of the construction of Order 5 may be shortly stated: 
      
       
        
       a. the evidence given by the Witness to Levine J, the argument put about it, and the publication of Levine J's Judgment, all took place in closed court (49 NSWLR 463); it following that, even in the absence of a formal non-publication order, the publication by anyone with knowledge of the facts of information relating to the hearing before, and Judgment delivered by Levine J, would render that person liable to punishment for contempt (see, for example,  
       Re De Beaufeu's Application 
        [1949] Ch 230;  
       Re X 
        [1975] Fam. 47;  
       Re R 
        [1975] Fam. 89;  
       Re F. 
        [1977] Fam;  
       Re X 
        [1984] 1 WLR 1422;  
       P. v. P. 
        (1985) 2 NSWLR 401); 
        
        
       b. by contrast, the application which was made to, and was heard by, the Court of Appeal on 9, 14-15 March 2000, was heard in open court, it following that, unless there had been made an appropriately worded non-publication order, or appropriately worded orders (see, for example,  
       John Fairfax & Sons Pty. Limited v. Police Tribunal of New South Wales 
        (1986) 5 NSWLR 465) what had been said in court during the hearing could have been freely published, and, if published, would, in all probability have rendered the further prosecution of the application to the Court of Appeal futile. It was to avoid that happening the Orders of 10 and 15 March 2000 were made; 
        
        
       c. it is, however, clear enough, that it was not intended that, when the hearing before Levine J resumed, the evidence of the Witness would be given in closed court. That being so, while the pseudonym order (Order 4) would go some way towards protecting the Witness' identity, an order directed towards the non-publication, by those in court during the resumed hearing, of any material likely to lead to the identification of the Witness needed to be made if the Witness's identity was to be protected. It was to achieve this result that Order 5 was, in my view, directed. 
       
     3    GILES JA: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Ipp AJA in draft. Save as to Mr Marsden’s knowledge of order 5 made on 22 March 2000, I am respectfully content to adopt his Honour’s reasons. In what follows in relation to Mr Marsden’s knowledge of order 5, I gratefully draw upon what his Honour has written.  
      
       
     4    Whether Mr Marsden knew of order 5, or its substance, depends upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole. The material constituents of the case for his knowledge come from the evidence of Mr Price, the evidence of Mr Mitchell, the exchange of 9 June 2000, the evidence of Ms McClymont, and the speech proposed to be given by Mr Marsden.  
      
       
     5    For the reasons given by Ipp AJA, I do not think the last two of these contribute to establishing knowledge at the material time, that is between about 10.35 am and about 11.15 am on 22 March 2000.  
      
       
     6    I agree with Ipp AJA that the evidence of Mr Price is not capable of establishing that Mr Marsden was in court when judgment was delivered and when the orders made on 22 March 2000 were read out. It is capable of establishing that, after the orders were made, Mr Marsden was outside the courtroom conversing with others, including his junior counsel. While of itself falling far short of proof of knowledge of order 5, or its substance, it provides evidence of an occasion on which Mr Marsden might have become aware of the orders made when the judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered. 
      
       
     7    The judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered at about 10.15 am on 22 March 2000. Levine J sat on level 10 of the Supreme Court building at 10.30 am on that day. There was reference to calling the Witness and his Honour said, “We will be sitting in Court 12 and I will commence his evidence-in-chief at 2 o’clock”. There was then reference to looking at the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and his Honour said that he would adjourn “till 2 in Court 12”.  
      
       
     8    Mr Mitchell was in Levine J’s court at this time. On leaving the courtroom he saw Mr Marsden, and according to Mr Mitchell there occurred the suggestion to Mr Mitchell that he should arrange for the publication of the Witness’ name in his newspaper and the equivalent suggestion to Mr Grimm. 
      
       
     9    According to Mr Mitchell, Mr Marsden handed to him a photocopy of a newspaper article concerning the Witness and containing his name. 
      
       
     10    Mr Marsden said, “That’s the man whose name they have suppressed. He is to appear anonymously. It’s a disgrace.” Mr Marsden made some comments about the Witness and said, “You should use his name in the paper. You can take it from the newspaper cutting and publish his name.” Mr Mitchell replied, “Wouldn’t that be against the court order?”, and Mr Marsden said, “No, you can just say you are publishing facts from another newspaper article”. 
      
       
     11    As Ipp AJA observes, it is apparent from this exchange that Mr Marsden knew that a court order has been made. The initial references by Mr Marsden to suppression and anonymity must have been at least to order 4 made on 22 March 2000. Mr Marsden was quite clearly referring to the substantive orders made by the Court of Appeal governing the giving of evidence by the Witness. Order 4 required the use of a pseudonym, reasonably described as suppression of the name of the Witness and his appearing anonymously, although arguably what Mr Marsden said was referable to any identification of the Witness and was capable of reflecting order 5.  
      
       
     12    Of more significance is Mr Marsden’s suggested reason for publication of the Witness’ name not being against the court order. If the substance of the court order were that the name of the Witness not be published, or even that any matter likely to lead to the identification of the Witness was not to be reported, to say that there was no more than publishing facts from another newspaper article would not be an excuse. Mr Marsden’s suggestion was arguably explicable only on the basis that the publication of the name of the Witness would not be a consequence of being in court. This would involve knowledge of order 5 made on 22 March 2000.  
      
       
     13    I go then to the exchange of 9 June 2000. It has been set out and analysed in the reasons of Ipp AJA, but I set it out again - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You were in Court when the witness who is now known as D20 made his application for a pseudonym order, were you not? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you heard the whole of his evidence in respect of that application? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You were in the Court of Appeal when the appeal from that decision of his Honour was heard, were you not? 
          
         A. I was advised by Mr Barker not to go because -- 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. The answer is - where you there or not. 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         STITT: Q. Did you become aware of the judgment of the Court of Appeal when it was handed down? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You knew that the judgment of the Court of Appeal involved, amongst other things, an order that the identity of D20 not to be [sic] disclosed? 
          
         A. True. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You regarded the Court of Appeal judgment as a disgrace, did you not? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you publicly stated your view of the judgment to people who were standing near to the Court where D20 was to give evidence, isn’t that so? 
          
         A. When I was told, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You knew that the terms of the Court of Appeal order were couched so as to protect the identity of D20 so that it was not to be disclosed? 
          
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
        
       
     14    I am prepared to put to one side that part of the exchange from the question concerning public statement of Mr Marsden’s views of the judgment to people who were standing near to the court where the Witness was to give evidence. As well as being at Levine J’s court on level 10 of the Supreme Court building at about 10.30 am on 22 March 2000, Mr Mitchell was in or outside court 12, on a different level of the building, shortly before 2 pm on that day. Court 12 was the court where the Witness was to give evidence. Whoever the people were who were standing near to the court where the Witness was to give evidence, the occasion must have been different from the occasion on which Mr Marsden spoke to Mr Mitchell outside Levine J’s court on level 10. This question and answer can therefore carry no inference as to Mr Marsden’s knowledge of order 5 prior to 11.15 am on 22 March 2000, and on the flow of the questioning the following question directly going to his knowledge of “the terms of the Court of Appeal order” could not be regarded as addressing Mr Marsden’s knowledge at a time earlier than when he publicly stated his view of the judgment to people who were standing near to the court where the Witness was to give evidence.  
      
       
     15    But I do not think that the earlier part of the exchange of 9 June 2000 can be similarly put aside. Mr Marsden first agreed that he became aware of the judgment of the Court of Appeal when it was handed down. He then agreed that he knew that the judgment of the Court of Appeal involved an order that the identity of the Witness not be disclosed, and agreed that he regarded the judgment of the Court of Appeal as a disgrace. Mr Marsden must have regarded the judgment of the Court of Appeal as a disgrace for a reason, and on the flow of the questioning the reason arguably was that it involved an order that the identity of the Witness not be disclosed. The last of the questions and answers was fairly clearly descriptive of Mr Marsden’s state of mind upon his becoming aware of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and so the preceding question and answer can be taken to represent his knowledge at that time.  
      
       
     16    This understanding of Mr Marsden’s evidence would be assisted by the evidence of Mr Mitchell, according to which Mr Marsden described the outcome in the Court of Appeal as “a disgrace”. The understanding of Mr Marsden’s evidence could found a conclusion that he knew more than that the name of the Witness had been suppressed and he was to appear anonymously, and that he knew that it had been ordered that his identity not be disclosed.  
      
       
     17    Taking all these matters together, in my opinion it would be open to be found that Mr Marsden knew, at the time he spoke to Mr Mitchell at about 10.30 am on 22 March 2000, that those in court were prohibited from reporting any matter likely to lead to the identification of the Witness, with the purpose of affording to the Witness protection from disclosure of his identity.  
      
       
     18    The question then is whether that is open to be found beyond reasonable doubt. As Ipp AJA has said, the standard of proof in a no case submission is proof beyond reasonable doubt, and this Court must be satisfied that the relevant knowledge on the part of Mr Marsden, as one of the ingredients of charges 5 and 8, could be found beyond reasonable doubt. In R v Bilick (1984) 36 SASR 321, to which Ipp AJA has referred, King CJ said at 337 - 
      
       
        
         
         “The case against the appellant Starke was circumstantial in character. The same test is to be applied to deciding a submission of no case to answer in a case depending upon circumstantial evidence as in a case depending upon direct evidence, although the manner of its application will be different. The question to be answered by the trial judge is whether there is evidence with respect to every element of the offence charged which, if accepted, could prove that element beyond reasonable doubt. Where there is direct evidence of the  
         actus reus 
          and that evidence is capable of supporting an inference of  
         mens rea 
         , there is a case to answer except in the extreme case, as perhaps of testimony which is manifestly self-contradictory or the product of a disorderly mind, envisaged by the Privy Council, in which the direct ‘evidence’ is so incredible as to amount to no evidence. Where the case is a circumstantial or partly circumstantial case and therefore depends on inferences, the question may be expanded so that it becomes: On the assumption that all the evidence of primary fact considered at its strongest from the point of view of the case for the prosecution, is accurate, and on the further assumption that all inferences most favourable to the prosecution which are reasonably open, are drawn, is the evidence capable of producing in the mind of a reasonable person satisfaction, beyond reasonable doubt, of the guilt of the accused? That, as it seems to me, was the question which the learned trial Judge was required to answer in deciding on the submission of no case to answer.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     19    For this purpose the evidence of Mr Price and Mr Mitchell must be taken to have been accepted, and the reasonably open view of the exchange of 9 June 2000 most favourable to the claimant must be taken. There is then an exercise in judgment. In my opinion the evidence brought by the claimant is not capable of producing satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Marsden knew of order 5 made on 22 March 2000, or of its substance. Charges 5 and 8 fail on the standard of proof. 
      
       
     20    Accordingly, in agreement in the result with Ipp AJA, I would dismiss the claimant’s application and order that it pay Mr Marsden’s costs. 
      
       
        
       
     21    IPP AJA:  
      
       
        
       The twelve contempt charges 
        
       
     22    This is an application by the claimant for 12 orders declaring that Mr Marsden has committed contempt of this Court. The allegations of contempt involve ten alleged breaches of two orders of this Court and two instances of allegedly acting with the intention of frustrating, thwarting and subverting a third order of this Court.  
      
       
     23    The three orders were all made in the appeal reported as Witness v Marsden (2000) 49 NSWLR 429. That appeal concerned a decision by Levine J in the course of a trial of defamation proceedings brought by Mr Marsden against the claimant. A person (the “Witness”), whom the claimant wished to call as a witness in those proceedings, requested to be allowed to do so under a pseudonym. He was incarcerated in a maximum security correctional centre and had serious fears for his physical safety, and indeed his life, should it become known that he gave evidence in the trial. Levine J dismissed the Witness’s application but this decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal. 
      
       
     24    The appeal in Witness v Marsden commenced on Friday 10 March 2000. At the commencement of the hearing, the Court ordered: 
      
       
        
         
         “Until further order there be no publication of the name of the witness involved”. 
         
        
       
     25    On Wednesday 15 March 2000, while the appeal was proceeding, the Court ordered: 
      
       
        
         
         “Until further order, there be an order prohibiting publication referrable to proceedings in the Court of Appeal of any material that would identify or be likely to identify the witness”. 
         
        
       
     26    Argument was completed on 15 March 2000 and the Court reserved its decision. On 22 March 2000 the Court delivered its judgment and made a series of orders including the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “4. The Witness is to be addressed and referred to in the court only by a pseudonym. 
         
        
        
         
         5. Any matter which is likely to lead to the identification of the Witness is not to be reported by those in court.” 
         
        
        
       
     27    Order 5 of the orders that were made on 22 March 2000 is the order which the claimant alleges that Mr Marsden intended to frustrate, thwart or subvert, as alleged in the two charges to which I have referred.  
      
       
     28    In his reasons, Heydon JA observed that the orders of 10 and 15 March 2000, to which I have referred, “remain in force”. Mr Marsden does not dispute that at all relevant times those two orders (and the order of 22 March 2000) were in force. 
      
       
     29    All the charges are based on Mr Marsden’s conduct on 22 March 2000 when he gave or showed a number of journalists an article which appeared in a newspaper on 13 February 1999 concerning the Witness and containing the Witness’s name, and spoke to those journalists about the article and the Witness.  
      
       
     30    Five of the twelve charges allege that at about 10.35 am or 11.15 am (depending on the charge) on 22 March 2000 Mr Marsden published to an identified journalist “the name of the Witness in breach of the order of 10 March 2000”. A further five charges allege that at about 10.35 am or 11.15 am (depending on the charge) on 22 March 2000 Mr Marsden “published, referrable to proceedings in the Court of Appeal, material to [an identified journalist] that would identify or be likely to identify the Witness referred to in the order of the Court of Appeal made on 15 March 2000 ....in breach of that order”. The remaining two charges (charges 5 and 8) allege that between 10.35 am and about 11.15 am on 22 March 2000 Mr Marsden “solicited [an identified journalist] to report matter concerning the Witness referred to in order 5 of the Court of Appeal made on 22 March 2000….so as to identify the Witness, with the intention of frustrating, thwarting and subverting the purpose of the said order”. 
      
       
        
        
        
       The no case submission: the law 
        
       
     31    At the close of the claimant’s case on all 12 charges, Mr Marsden submitted that there was no case for him to answer. There were two limbs to this submission. Firstly, he argued that the evidence did not establish that he knew of the three orders concerned and therefore he could not lawfully be convicted of any of the contempts charged. Secondly, in regard to the charges that he performed acts with the intention of frustrating, thwarting and subverting the purpose of order 5 of 22 March 2000, he submitted that the evidence, even if accepted in its entirety, did not establish the contempts alleged. 
      
       
     32    The claimant accepted that the present application was criminal in nature and the criminal standard of proof applied. Accordingly, the matter was argued on this basis. The claimant was undoubtedly correct in the approach it took: Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525.  
      
       
     33    The claimant further accepted that, as the proceedings were criminal in nature, Mr Marsden was entitled to make a no case to answer submission at the close of the claimant’s case, and the parties accepted that the general principles governing such submissions were of application.  
      
       
     34    The standard of proof to be applied in a no case submission, made at the close of the case for the prosecution, is proof beyond reasonable doubt: R v Murphy (1985) 63 ALR 53 at 78. 
      
       
     35    The general principles otherwise applicable were stated by Dunford J (with whom Greg James J and Smart AJ agreed) in R v Serratore (1999) 48 NSWLR 101 at 130 to be as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “In determining whether there is a case to answer, the question to be decided is not whether on the evidence as it stands, the accused ought to be convicted, but whether on the evidence as it stands, he could lawfully be convicted:  
         May v O’Sullivan 
          (1955) 92 CLR 654 at 658. In considering such an application, the judge does not consider the probative value of the evidence as a whole, but only that evidence which, if believed and uncontradicted, could be accepted as proof of the Crown case:  
           
         R v Towers 
          (1984) 75 FLR 77 at 79,  
         Doney v The Queen 
          (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 214-215; 
           
         R v R 
          (1989) 18 NSWLR 74; and in a case of circumstantial evidence, such as the present, a finding of no case to answer is not open if there is evidence in support of the Crown case upon which the accused can be convicted, even though a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence can be postulated:  
         R v JMR 
          (1991) 57 A Crim R 39 at 44.” 
         
        
        
       
     36    There is some controversy as to whether these principles apply only to jury trials, or whether they apply to all criminal cases, including those before a judge alone, or a magistrate. In some cases, not involving trial by jury, it has been held that the presiding judicial officer is entitled to weigh up and make qualitative judgments as to the evidence, and may prefer one inference over another. The rationale for this approach is that it is unrealistic and impractical to require judicial officers, sitting without juries, to remove from their minds the impressions as to the credibility of witnesses that will inevitably intrude into their consciousness and that are likely to inform their judgment at the conclusion of the evidence and closing addresses when they are required to determine whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  
      
       
     37    The other view is based squarely on the difference between the functions performed when deciding a no case to answer submission, on the one hand, and deciding whether an accused person is guilty beyond reasonable doubt, on the other. In the former situation, the judicial officer is determining a question of law; in the latter, a question of fact. It has been said that the two cannot be merged.  
      
       
     38    Support for the first-mentioned approach is usually sought in the following remarks of Windeyer J in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 330 to 331: 
      
       
        
         
         “When there is no jury, the proposition “no case to answer” may obviously mean far more than, ‘is there evidence on which a jury could find for the plaintiff?’ it may mean, ‘would you, the judge, on the evidence given, find for the plaintiff?’” 
         
        
       
     39    These remarks were relied on by the Victorian Full Court in Protean (Holdings) Limited v American Home Assurance Company [1985] VR 187. Young CJ (with whom Fullagar J agreed) said that a judge, in deciding to uphold a no case to answer submission, “is entitled to draw all proper inferences from the evidence”. In the same case, Tadgell J (at 239) said: 
      
       
        
         
         “If a judge sitting alone receives a submission [concerning the quality of evidence that has been led] and decides to rule on it,… he must be entitled in doing so to assess the quality of the evidence. Were it otherwise the Judge, being the tribunal of fact, would be placed in an impossible position: he would have to assess the validity of the case for the respondent party without being able to assess the worth or weight of the evidence led in support of it.” 
         
        
        
        
       His Honour referred to the remarks of Windeyer J in 
        Jones v 
         
       Dunkel 
       , to which I have referred, and proceeded: 
        
        
         
         “If it falls to the Judge to decide whether he could find for the respondent party on the evidence so far led, it is quite unrealistic to expect him to do so without being able to consider all questions which bear on the sufficiency of the evidence and without power to draw or to decline to draw all inferences from the evidence given on which the respondent party might seek to rely. Moreover (or perhaps this is no more than another aspect of the same view) the Judge, being also the arbiter of the law, could not sensibly be required, in considering a submission [concerning the quality of evidence that has been led], to say whether the evidence could establish the case in favour of which it was adduced while shutting his mind to the question of its sufficiency in terms of quality. It might be possible to achieve such a measure of detachment in a clear case but in most or very many cases it would not”. 
         
        
       
     40    The Protean decision is consistent with Commissioner for Corporate Affairs v Green [1978] VR 505. In the latter case, McInerney J held that a magistrate had rightly acceded to a no case submission where the inference that the respondent had used information in contravention of statutory prohibition was of no more than equal degree of probability with the inference that he had not. 
      
       
     41    In Rasomen Pty Limited v Shell Company of Australia Limited (1997) 75 FCR 216, the Full Court of the Federal Court followed the reasoning in the Protean case. The Court observed (at 226) that the authorities relied on by the appellant concerned trials before a judge and jury and the statements of principle in those judgments “must be understood in that context with the trial judge as the arbiter of the law but not of the facts”. The Court pointed out that, in trials conducted before a judge alone, the judge is arbiter both of the law and the facts “and the principles require modification to reflect that different considerations apply”. Their Honours referred to Windeyer J’s remarks in Jones v Dunkel and the Protean case and said (at 228): 
      
       
        
         
         “In our opinion the trial judge did not err in her approach, or in the test of sufficiency of the evidence, when deciding the submission that there was no case to answer. In a case like this, the function to be performed by a trial judge sitting without a jury who has decided to entertain a no case submission is no different from that which has to be performed by a judge who has heard all the evidence of the parties in the ordinary way and who has to give final judgment. In both situations, the judge must make findings of fact, after assessing the quality of the evidence. Consequently, when there is a challenge on appeal to the conclusions of fact arrived at by a judge in disposing of a no case submission, the approach of the appeal court should be the same as that taken to appeals against findings of fact made by a judge who has given final judgment in the ordinary way….” 
         
        
        
       
     42    I turn now to the authorities that espouse the different approach.  
      
       
     43    In Zanetti v Hill (1962) 108 CLR 433 Kitto J, in dealing with a no case submission refused by a magistrate, said (at 442): 
      
       
        
         
         “The question where there is a case to answer, arising as it does at the end of the prosecution’s evidence in chief, is simply the question of law whether the defendant could lawfully be convicted on the evidence as it stands, - whether, that is to say, there is with respect to every element of the offence some evidence which, if accepted, would either prove the element directly or enable its existence to be inferred.” 
         
        
        
        
       His Honour went on to say (at 442-443) that there was no reason: 
        
        
         
         “why a weakness in the prosecution’s case may not be eked out by something in the case for the defence, or why a prima facie inference which by itself would not be strong enough to exclude reasonable doubt may not be hardened into satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt by a failure of the defendant to provide satisfactory evidence in answer to it when he is in a position to do so.” 
         
        
       
     44    In Haw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor [1982] AC 136 at 151; [1981] 3 WLR 395 at 403 the Privy Council held that the principles to be applied when a no case submission is made before a judge and jury apply equally to criminal trials where the combined roles of decider of law and decider of fact are vested in a single judicial officer. The underlying reason for this decision was the difference in functions to be performed by the judicial officer when a no case submission is made at the close of the prosecution case and the determination of guilt when all the evidence has been led.  
      
       
     45    In Torrance v Cornish (1985) 79 FLR 87 Yeldham J dealt with an appeal by way of a case stated from a decision of a magistrate in a summary prosecution for false pretences where, at the end of the Crown case, the magistrate held that as there were competing inferences of guilt and innocence there was no evidence that the defendant had the required intent to defraud. The magistrate dismissed the information. His Honour considered that the magistrate should have found that there was a case to answer. He was of the view that there was no difference between the test to be applied in a trial by judge and jury, on the one hand, and a trial before a magistrate of judge alone. 
      
       
     46    This appears to be the approach in Queensland (see Short v Davey, Ex Parte Short [1980] Qd R 412; R v Sutton [1986] 2 Qd R 72; (1985) 20 A Crim R 280.)  
      
       
     47    In Myers v Claudianos (1990) 100 FLR 362 Miles CJ followed Haw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor and said (at 369): 
      
       
        
         
         “The magistrate misdirected himself in not observing the distinction drawn, in  
         May v O’Sullivan 
          (1955) 92 CLR 654 and other cases, between the decision to be made on a submission made at the end of the prosecution evidence on the question whether there is a prima facie case upon which the defendant might lawfully be convicted, and the decision to be made at the end of all the evidence on the question whether the prosecution has been made out to the requisite degree, that is to say, beyond reasonable doubt. The first question is a question of law and the second question is a question of fact. 
         
        
        
         
         The distinction is more readily observed in a criminal trial where the judge makes the first decision and, if the case goes to the jury, the jury makes the second decision. In summary proceedings the magistrate acts as both judge and jury, but only if the question of law is answered in the affirmative, may the second question, the question of fact, be asked at all.” 
         
        
        
       Myers v Claudianos 
        was not referred to in  
       Rasomen Pty Limited v 
         
       Shell Company of Australia Limited 
       . 
        
       
     48    In Cox v Salt (1994) 12 WAR 12 I observed (at 14 to 15): 
      
       
        
         
         “the determination of a no case to answer submission at the close of a prosecution’s case is a question of law, whereas the determination of the ultimate question of guilt beyond reasonable doubt is a question of fact. Although in the exercise of her functions the magistrate is required to determine both questions of law and fact, this cannot destroy the essential separability of these questions. 
         
        
        
         
         Subject to certain exceptions, when adjudicating upon the evidence whether a defendant  
         could 
          lawfully be convicted, the magistrate is required to proceed on the assumption that all the evidence of primary facts, considered at its strongest from the point of view of the case for the prosecution, is accurate: See  
         R v Bilick 
           
         & Starke 
          (1984) 36 SASR 321 at 337;  
         Myers v 
           
         Claudianos 
          (1990) 100 FLR 362 at 369. The exceptions are evidence that is inherently incredible ( 
         Haw Tua Tau v Public 
           
         Prosecutor  
         [1982] AC 136 at 151; [1981] 3 WLR 395 at 403) or manifestly self-contradictory or the product of a disorderly mind: see 
          R v 
           
         Bilick 
           
         & Starke 
          at 337. 
         
        
        
         
         Where the prosecution case is based on circumstantial evidence, the magistrate is required to take into account all inferences most favourable to the prosecution which could reasonably be drawn from the primary facts: (See  
         Haw Tua 
           
         Tau v Public Prosecutor 
          (at 150);  
         Myers v Claudianos 
          (at 369).” 
         
        
        
        
       In  
       Morrison v Kiwi Electrix Pty Limited 
        (1998) 19 WAR 482 the Western Australian Full Court applied the above-quoted remarks.  
        
       
     49    The issues of principle at stake were set out in clear terms by King CJ in R v Bilick & Starke (1984) 36 SASR 321 at 334 as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “I do not think that the test to be applied by a Court of Criminal Appeal when considering whether a verdict of guilty can be supported having regard to the evidence has any bearing upon the test to be applied by the trial judge when considering a submission of no case. There is, to my mind, a very great difference between the function of a trial judge considering, as the decider of questions of law, a submission that the case for the prosecution discloses no case to answer, and the function of a Court of Appeal reviewing the verdict in the light of all the evidence, both for the prosecution and the defence, to ascertain whether a verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. In discharging its function the Court of Appeal is required to consider whether the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory ( 
         Whitehorn v The Queen 
          (1983) 57 ALJR 809), but I am unable to see that that has any bearing upon the question to be answered by the trial judge in discharging a different function at a different stage of the proceedings. I agree with the observation of Lord Lane CJ in  
         Reg. v Galbraith 
          [1981] 1 WLR 1039, at p 1041 that ‘the fact that the Court of Appeal have power to quash a conviction on these grounds is a slender basis for giving the trial judge similar powers at the close of the prosecution case.’” 
         
        
        
       
     50    With respect to those who have followed the different line, I abide by the views I expressed in Cox v Salt. In my opinion, at the stage of a no case submission it is wrong in principle for the judicial officer, in effect, to make factual findings (other than in those exceptional circumstances referred to in Cox v Salt at 15).  
      
       
        
        
       Mr Marsden’s knowledge of the orders of 10 March 2000 and 15 March 2000 
        
       
     51    I have mentioned that five charges allege that Mr Marsden published “the name of the Witness in breach of the order of 10 March 2000” and five allege that he published material that would identify or be likely to identify the Witness in breach of the order of 15 March 2000. Mr Marsden’s knowledge of the applicable order is an essential element of each of the ten charges in question.  
      
       
     52    The particulars to each of the ten charges allege that Mr Marsden knew of the Court’s orders of 10 March 2000 or 15 March 2000, as the case may be, “at, or immediately after, the time it was made”. A failure to prove knowledge, as alleged, would have the inevitable result that these charges would fail.  
      
       
     53    It is not necessary for the claimant to show that Mr Marsden was aware of the full and precise terms of the relevant orders. It is sufficient for the claimant to establish knowledge of the substance of the orders: Sun Newspapers v Brisbane TV Limited & Ors (1989) 92 ALR 535 at 538; Attorney-General for New South Wales v Mayas Pty Limited (1988) 14 NSWLR 342 at 355 to 356. 
      
       
     54    The substance of each of the orders of 10 March 2000 and 15 March 2000 cannot readily be expressed otherwise than by using more or less the very words in which they are couched. The substance of the order of 10 March 2000 is that there should be no publication of the name of the Witness. The substance of the order of 15 March 2000 is that there should be no publication, referrable to proceedings in the Court of Appeal, of material that would identify or be likely to identify the Witness.  
      
       
     55    There was no evidence that the orders of 10 March 2000 and 15 March 2000 were served on Mr Marsden, nor was there direct evidence that he was informed of their making or content. Rather, the claimant sought to establish by inference from other evidentiary material that Mr Marsden knew of the orders concerned or their substance. 
      
       
     56    The claimant submitted that, on 9 June 2000, when Mr Marsden was being cross-examined in the trial proceedings before Levine J, he acknowledged that he knew of the substance of the orders. The passages on which the claimant relied are the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You were in the Court of Appeal when the appeal from that decision of his Honour was heard, were you not? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was advised by Mr Barker not to go because -- 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. The answer is - were you there or not? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         STITT: Q. Did you become aware of the judgment of the Court of Appeal when it was handed down? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You knew that the judgment of the Court of Appeal involved, amongst other things, an order that the identity of D20 not to be [sic] disclosed? 
         
        
        
         
         A. True. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You regarded the Court of Appeal judgment as a disgrace, did you not? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you publicly stated your view of the judgment to people who were standing near to the Court where D20 was to give evidence, isn’t that so? 
         
        
        
         
         A. When I was told, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You knew that the terms of the Court of Appeal order were couched so as to protect the identity of D20 so that it was not to be disclosed? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
        
       
     57    In context, it is apparent that Mr Marsden was being cross-examined about the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on 22 March 2000 and the orders made on that date, and not the earlier orders. Mr Marsden’s acknowledgment that he knew that that judgment involved an order that the identity of the Witness not be disclosed has no bearing on whether he knew of the orders of 10 March 2000 and 15 March 2000 or their substance.  
      
       
     58    Furthermore, in context, Mr Marsden’s acknowledgment that he knew that an order had been made in terms couched so as to protect the identity of the Witness (so that it was not to be disclosed) was in regard to an order made on 22 March 2000 and not to any other order.  
      
       
     59    Accordingly, in my view, nothing in the exchange that occurred on 9 June 2000 assists the claimant in regard to the allegation that Mr Marsden knew of the orders of 10 March 2000 and 15 March 2000 or their substance. 
      
       
     60    The claimant then pointed to the fact that, in paragraph 152 of the judgment of Heydon JA in Witness v Marsden, his Honour recited the orders of 10 March and 15 March. There is nothing, however, in the exchange of 9 June 2000 (or any other evidentiary material) that establishes that Heydon JA read paragraph 152 out loud in Court when delivering the decision of the Court of Appeal, or that Mr Marsden was in court at the relevant time or that Mr Marsden read the judgment of Heydon JA at any time material to the charges. 
      
       
     61    The claimant submitted that, as Mr Marsden was a party to the proceedings before the Court of Appeal and was represented by senior and junior counsel in those proceedings, it should be accepted that he knew of the substance of all the orders that were made in those proceedings. This argument is based on the proposition that it should be inferred, without more, that Mr Marsden’s counsel would have told him of the substance of the orders of 10 and 15 March. The criminal standard of proof applies, however, and in my opinion, in the absence of any other evidence, it cannot be said - beyond reasonable doubt - that counsel would have acted as submitted.  
      
       
     62    Mr Nicholas QC, leading counsel for the claimant, eventually conceded that he could not submit that Mr Marsden was aware of the substance of the particular orders of 10 March and 15 March 2000. He was driven to submit that Mr Marsden was aware, generally, that he was prohibited from disclosing the identity of the Witness, albeit that the evidence did not establish that he knew the source of that prohibition. But Mr Marsden was not charged with having committed breaches of some unidentified order whereby he was prohibited from publishing the Witness’s name or material likely to identify him. He was charged with having breached the specific orders of 10 and 15 March 2000. I repeat that Mr Marsden’s knowledge of those orders or their substance was an essential element of the charges based on the alleged breaches of them. Accordingly, in my view, the concession made by Mr Nicholas (which was made entirely correctly) is fatal to the claimant’s case in regard to the ten charges based on those orders. 
      
       
        
       Was order 5 of 22 March 2000 capable of being frustrated, etc, as alleged by the claimant? 
        
       
     63    As regards charges 5 and 8, Mr Marsden first argued that even if all the evidence led against him were accepted, the case brought by the claimant could not establish frustration, etc, of order 5 of 22 March 2000. This submission was grounded on the argument that the conduct complained of took place before the proceedings before Levine J had resumed, and that order 5 was intended only to prohibit conduct after the resumption of those proceedings. Moreover, it was submitted, order 5 was directed against reporting of material “by those in court” (that is, against the reporting of evidence by those in court likely to identify the Witness). As Mr Marsden did not attempt to solicit the reporting of anyone who was in court, he argued that order 5 could not apply to his conduct.  
      
       
     64    The submissions on this issue require order 5 to be construed. In so doing, regard must be had to the context in which order 5 was made and, in particular, to the earlier orders.  
      
       
     65    The terms of the order of 10 March 2000, prohibiting the publication of the Witness’s name, arguably, do not prohibit material that would identify or be likely to identify the Witness. Wider protection was afforded to the Witness by the order of 15 March 2000. This provided that until further order there “be an order prohibiting publication referrable to proceedings in the Court of Appeal of any material that would identify or be likely to identify the Witness”. Presumably, the words “referrable to proceedings in the Court of Appeal” were inserted to protect the Witness from any publication of material emanating from the proceedings in the Court of Appeal, those proceedings being still pending at the time the order was made.  
      
       
     66    Order 5 of 22 March 2000 was in broader terms still. This provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “Any matter which is likely to lead to the identification of the Witness is not to be reported by those in court”. 
         
        
        
       In my view, order 5 was intended to have prospective effect and extended the protection afforded by the order of 15 March to the resumption of proceedings before Levine J.  
        
       
     67    In Attorney-General for New South Wales v Mayas at 355 McHugh JA pointed out: 
      
       
        
         
         “Courts have general authority to make orders binding on the parties, witnesses and other persons present in the courtroom. But they have no general authority to make orders binding on persons unconnected with the proceedings before them”. 
         
        
        
       Mr Nicholas submitted that these remarks were the rationale for for the fact that order 5 was directed to reporting “by those in court”. He submitted further that the “court” concerned was the trial court presided over by Levine J. 
        
       
     68    I agree that the likelihood is that the phrase “by those in court” was inserted to give binding effect to order 5. In my view, “those in court” are those who were in the Court of Appeal and also those who would be in the courtroom in the trial proceedings before Levine J. There is no reason to limit the meaning of the phrase.  
      
       
     69    The substance of the order would then be that those “in court” in the sense I have set out were prohibited from reporting any matter likely to lead to the identification of the Witness. The purpose of the order was to afford wider protection to the Witness, in the sense that I have explained.  
      
       
     70    In Attorney-General for New South Wales v Mayas McHugh JA observed (at 355): 
      
       
        
         
         “a different rule applies when a person, who is not bound by an order of the court, says or does something which has the effect of frustrating or interfering with the order. In that class of case, the person will be guilty of contempt only if he is aware of the order and it is apparent to anyone that the effect of the order would be frustrated by his act:  
         Attorney-General 
           
         v Leveller Magazine Limited 
          [1979] AC 440 at 452, 456, 458, 467, 471-472”. 
         
        
        
       McHugh JA went on to say (at 356): 
        
        
         
         “It is not necessary that the person should intend to interfere with the order. But it must be apparent to anyone who was aware of the order that its purpose would be frustrated by the particular kind of act done by the defendant. The doing of such an act with knowledge of the order and with actual or imputed knowledge of its purpose is prima facie a contempt of court.” 
         
        
       
     71    Mr Alex Mitchell, a newspaper journalist, testified that on 22 March 2000 Mr Marsden suggested to him that he should arrange for the publication of the Witness’s name in his newspaper. Mr Mitchell also testified that he heard Mr Marsden suggesting to Mr Nick Grimm, a television journalist, that he, Mr Grimm, should arrange for the publication of the Witness’s name on ABC television. Mr Grimm testified that he had no recollection of Mr Marsden asking him to publish the Witness’s name. Nevertheless, taking the evidence of the claimant at its highest, as the Court at this stage is required to do, there is sufficient evidence from Mr Mitchell on which the Court could find beyond reasonable doubt that, on 22 March 2000, Mr Marsden solicited Mr Mitchell and Mr Grimm as alleged by the claimant.  
      
       
     72    On this basis, were the Witness’s name to have been published through the efforts of Messrs Mitchell and Grimm, the purpose of order 5 would have been frustrated. That would be so even though the soliciting by Mr Marsden occurred prior to the resumption of proceedings before Levine J and even though not one of Messrs Marsden, Mitchell and Mr Grimm may have been “in court”. Once it is accepted that the purpose of order 5 was to extend the protection against identification to the resumption of proceedings before Levine J, conduct, prior to that resumption, calculated to cause identifying material to be published after the resumption, is conduct calculated to frustrate the order. 
      
       
     73    Therefore, in my opinion, subject to there being adequate evidence as to Mr Marsden’s knowledge of order 5, or its substance, the Court could find that Mr Marsden attempted to frustrate, thwart and subvert the purpose of order 5, as alleged in charges 5 and 8.  
      
       
     74    It is therefore necessary to consider the next argument raised by Mr Marsden, namely, that the claimant has failed to prove that he had the requisite knowledge of order 5.  
      
       
        
       The two charges based on order 5 of 22 March 2000: the evidence of Mr Price 
        
       
     75    In asserting that Mr Marsden knew of order 5 of 22 March 2000, or its substance, the claimant relied on several pieces of evidence. The first was evidence of a solicitor, Mr David Charles Price, that, according to the claimant, proved that Mr Marsden was in court on 22 March 2000 when Heydon JA read out the terms of order 5.  
      
       
     76    Mr Price stated in an affidavit that, at 10.15 am on 22 March 2000, when the Court of Appeal delivered judgment, he “observed that Mr Marsden was also present in the President’s Court at that time”. In a later affidavit, Mr Price made it clear that he did not intend to say that he had observed Mr Marsden in the President’s Court when the orders were read out. According to this later affidavit, Mr Price arrived at the President’s Court shortly prior to 10.15 am on 22 March 2000. As he was about to enter the Court he saw a group of people, including Mr Marsden, standing inside the entrance to the courtroom. After Heydon JA had delivered the orders of the Court of Appeal, Mr Price left the Court and noticed Mr Marsden, outside the courtroom, conversing with others, including his junior counsel. In his oral testimony Mr Price conceded that he could not say that Mr Marsden was in court the instant that Heydon JA delivered the orders. All he could say was that Mr Marsden was “there prior to the Court coming onto the bench, and immediately after I left the courtroom”.  
      
       
     77    All in all, I am not persuaded that Mr Price’s testimony is capable of establishing that Mr Marsden was in Court when judgment was delivered and when the orders made on 22 March 2000 were read out.  
      
       
     78    In Sun Newspapers Pty Limited v Brisbane TV Limited & Ors (1990) 92 ALR 535 Pincus J said at 538: 
      
       
        
         
         “If a person sitting in court heard most, but not all, of the terms of an injunction pronounced by a judge and then promptly left to arrange matters so that what he knew to be the court’s intention would not take effect, it does not seem likely that his not having heard the full terms of the order would be a defence to a charge of contempt, whether or not he was a party to the proceedings.” 
         
        
        
       There is no evidence that Mr Marsden was not in court or left the court deliberately to avoid being bound by the Court’s order. 
        
        
       The two charges based on order 5 of 22 March 2000: the exchange of 9 June 2000 
        
       
     79    The next piece of evidence relied on by the claimant was the exchange in the cross-examination of Mr Marsden on 9 June 2000 that I have set out above. The claimant submitted that, in that exchange Mr Marsden admitted that he knew that an order had been made that the identity of the Witness not be disclosed, and he knew that the terms of the order were couched so as to protect the identity of the Witness so that it was not to be disclosed.  
      
       
     80    Both charge 5 and charge 8 allege that Mr Marsden committed contempt of court in relation to order 5 made on 22 March 2000 by his actions between about 10.35 am and about 11.15 am on that day. It follows that the claimant is required to prove that Mr Marsden knew, that day, of the substance of order 5 prior to 10.35 am, or prior to 11.15 am at the latest. Mr Marsden submitted that there was nothing in the exchange of 9 June 2000 that identifies the time when he had the knowledge to which he, therein, admitted.  
      
       
     81    The first part of the exchange is as follows:  
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You were in the Court of Appeal when the appeal from that decision of his Honour was heard, were you not? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was advised by Mr Barker not to go because -- 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. The answer is - were you there or not? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No.” 
         
        
       
     82    The next part of the exchange relates specifically to Mr Marsden’s knowledge of the “judgment”, and the time when it was delivered. The relevant question and answer are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “STITT: Q. Did you become aware of the judgment of the Court of Appeal when it was handed down? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes.”  
         
        
       
     83    Knowledge of the “judgment” is not equivalent to knowledge of order 5, and the claimant did not argue that it was. In effect, however, the claimant argued that the succeeding questions and answers all proceed on the unstated assumption that they are concerned with the same time at which Mr Marsden first learned of the judgment (that is, when it was handed down), or that Mr Marsden’s succeeding answers are to be understood as relating to that particular time.  
      
       
     84    The very next question and answer are critical. These are: 
      
       
        
         
         “  
         Q. You knew that the judgment of the Court of Appeal involved, amongst other things, an order that the identity of D20 not to be disclosed? 
         
        
        
         
         A. True.” 
         
        
       
     85    The claimant’s argument depends, in effect, on an inference being drawn that this question was implicitly qualified by the words “when you first learned of it”. In other words, the argument is that the question should have been understood by Mr Marsden as meaning, “You knew, when you first learned of it, that the judgment of the Court of Appeal involved, amongst other things, an order that the identity of D20 not to be disclosed?” The drawing of such an inference is significant because of Mr Marsden’s admission that he became aware of the judgment when it was handed down.  
      
       
     86    Before commenting on this argument, it is convenient to go the remainder of the exchange, which proceeds: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You regarded the Court of Appeal judgment as a disgrace, did you not? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
        
       I pause to note that this answer presumably describes Mr Marsden’s state of mind immediately after he learned of the judgment. This is consistent with the claimant’s argument.  
        
       
     87    The next question and answer are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. And you publicly stated your view of the judgment to people who were standing near to the Court where D20 was to give evidence, isn’t that so? 
         
        
        
         
         A. When I was told, yes.” 
         
        
        
       It is to be noted that “D20” is the pseudonym for the Witness. As Mr Marsden admitted that he publicly stated his views to people standing outside the trial court, it is necessary to determine when Mr Marsden was outside that court talking to people who were standing there.  
        
       
     88    At about 10.30 am, on 22 March 2000, after the Court of Appeal had handed down its judgment in Witness v Marsden, Levine J resumed proceedings in the trial court and, after a short discussion as to what had occurred in the Court of Appeal, adjourned those proceedings until 2.00 pm. According to the evidence, Mr Marsden was sitting outside the trial court at about 10.30 am on 22 March 2000. He was also sitting in or outside the trial court shortly before 2.00 pm that afternoon. There is no evidence of other people standing outside the trial court that day. It follows that the evidence on this issue is simply too vague to determine, precisely, when Mr Marsden publicly stated his views to people standing outside the trial court. It could have been at about 10.30 am on 22 March 2000, or shortly before 2.00 pm that afternoon, or, indeed, at any other time on some other day.  
      
       
     89    Although no reliable inference can be drawn as to the specific time when Mr Marsden publicly stated his views, it must have been at a time different to that when the judgment of the Court of Appeal was handed down and he became aware of it. This follows because Mr Marsden became aware of the judgment shortly after 10.15 am when he was standing outside the President’s Court, whereas he publicly stated his views some time later to people standing outside the trial court. This difference is important as it tends to counter-balance any suggestion that the exchange as a whole (and the critical questions, in particular) is governed by the initial question concerning the time when Mr Marsden became aware of the judgment of the Court of Appeal. 
      
       
     90    The second critical question then follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “You knew that the terms of the Court of Appeal order were couched so as to protect the identity of D20 so that it was not to be disclosed?” 
         
        
        
       Mr Marsden’s answer is, “Yes.” 
        
       
     91    The claimant’s argument in regard to the second critical question similarly depends on an inference being drawn that it was implicitly qualified by the words “when you first learned of it”, so that the question should have been understood as asking, “You knew, when you first learned of it, that the terms of the Court of Appeal order …”. 
      
       
     92    Both critical questions are capable of being understood as independent and stand-alone questions. When looked at alone they do not support the claimant’s argument. The issue is whether the context in which the questions were asked makes a material difference. It is to be observed that this exercise does not involve the drawing of inferences from circumstantial evidence. Rather, it is an exercise in construction.  
      
       
     93    The question is whether the meaning the claimant seeks to attribute to Mr Marsden’s answers to the critical questions is reasonably open on the material contained in the exchange of 9 June 2000 (albeit, not necessarily the only meaning so open). That is another way of asking whether a jury could reasonably infer from the exchange of 9 June 2000 that Mr Marsden admitted therein that he knew, when he first learned of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that an order had been made that the identity of the Witness not be disclosed and that the terms of the order were couched so as to protect the identity of the Witness so that it was not to be disclosed.  
      
       
     94    In my opinion, the answer to this question has to be in the negative. Of course, generally speaking, context may contribute to and even alter the meaning of words. But, in this case, there is very little in the context capable of altering the plain meaning of the words used. The fact that the critical questions were preceded by a question relating to the time when Mr Marsden learned of the judgment of the Court of Appeal is but fragile support for the claimant’s argument. Whatever support is so provided is undermined, generally, by the numerous succeeding questions which were not concerned with issues of time, and, particularly, by the question concerning Mr Marsden’s public statement as to his views of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, a statement which had to have been made at a different time. 
      
       
     95    I therefore would not uphold the claimant’s submission in this regard.  
      
       
        
       The two charges based on order 5 of 22 March 2000: other matters 
        
       
     96    According to Mr Mitchell, Mr Marsden approached him shortly after 10.30 am on 22 March 2000 after Levine J had adjourned the trial proceedings to 2.00 pm. Mr Marsden showed Mr Mitchell the article that had been published on 13 February 1999 concerning the Witness and suggested that Mr Mitchell should use the Witness’s name in his newspaper. Mr Mitchell asked Mr Marsden: 
      
       
        
         
         “Wouldn’t that be against the court order?” 
         
        
        
       and Mr Marsden replied: 
        
        
         
         “No, you can just say you are publishing facts from another newspaper article”. 
         
        
       
     97    It is apparent from this exchange that Mr Marsden knew that a court order had been made. It is however by no means clear to which order Mr Marsden was referring when he replied to the effect that the publication of the Witness’s name would not be “against the court order”.  
      
       
     98    Again, it is to be emphasised that in regard to charges 5 and 8, the claimant is required to prove that Mr Marsden knew of the substance, at least, of order 5 of 22 March 2000, this being the order pleaded as the basis of the contempt alleged. It is not sufficient for the claimant to prove that Mr Marsden knew, generally, that at some unidentified time in the course of the proceedings an order had been made prohibiting publication of the name of the Witness. That is not a charge Mr Marsden faces.  
      
       
     99    In an attempt to overcome this difficulty, Mr Nicholas submitted that, as the conversation between Mr Mitchell and Mr Marsden took place shortly after the Court of Appeal had delivered its orders, Mr Marsden’s reference (in the course of that conversation) to the suppression of the Witness’s name, and his statements that the Witness “is to appear anonymously” and that it (presumably an order of the Court of Appeal) was “a disgrace”, were references to the orders made by the Court of Appeal on the morning of 22 March 2000. Thus, it was said, when Mr Mitchell inquired whether the publication of the name would be “against the court order” he was referring to those orders and Mr Marsden’s reply has to be seen in that context. It was submitted that this material is capable of giving rise to the inference that Mr Marsden knew that a court order had been made suppressing the name of the Witness with the result that the Witness was to “appear anonymously”. 
      
       
     100    I accept these submissions, but they do not resolve the issue. The difficulty is that the order suppressing the name of the Witness and requiring him to appear anonymously was order 4 of 22 March, and not order 5. Mr Marsden’s knowledge of these matters arguably leads to a reasonable inference that he knew of order 4, but his knowledge of these matters does not give rise to a reasonable inference that he knew that an order had been made in the terms, substantially, of order 5.  
      
       
     101    The claimant then submitted that Mr Marsden’s knowledge of order 5 could be inferred from evidence that had been given by a journalist, Ms McClymont, as to a conversation she had with Mr Marsden. According to Ms McClymont, however, her conversation with Mr Marsden occurred shortly before 2.00 pm on 22 March 2000. Charges 5 and 8 allege that Mr Marsden committed contempt of court by his actions between about 10.35 am and about 11.15 am on 22 March 2000. Whether Mr Marsden knew at about 2.00 pm of the substance of order 5 (as would arguably follow from the evidence of Ms McClymont), is irrelevant to these charges.  
      
       
     102    A further piece of evidence on which the claimant relied was a copy of a speech that Mr Marsden proposed to give some time after 22 March. No evidence was led to establish that the speech was in fact delivered but when the claimant sought to tender the document on the basis that it was a speech which Mr Marsden either delivered or proposed to deliver, Mr Marsden replied: “Now that’s acceptable to me, propose to deliver” and the document was admitted into evidence. The copy of the speech contains an admission by Mr Marsden that he told the press about the Witness. In the copy, Mr Marsden complains that the Court of Appeal had allowed the Witness to make allegations against him in court by way of a pseudonym. I do not regard anything in the copy of the speech, particularly as it was made some time after 22 March 2000, as bearing upon Mr Marsden’s knowledge at the relevant time. 
      
       
     103    In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that there is evidence on which the Court could find that Mr Marsden had knowledge of the substance of order 5. It follows that I would uphold the no case submission in regard to charges 5 and 8 as well. 
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
     104    I would uphold the no case submission and dismiss the application. I would order the claimant to pay Mr Marsden’s costs.

      REGINA v Peter Clive Basil KANE 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
      
       
     1    HANDLEY JA: I agree with Ipp AJA. 
      
       
     2    IPP AJA: Peter Clive Basil Kane appeals against his conviction on a charge of murder after a trial on 27 October 2000 before Barr J and a jury. In addition the Crown appeals against the sentence imposed of 10 years 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months. These reasons relate to both appeals. 
      
       
     3    I turn firstly to the appeal against conviction.  
      
       
     4    On 19 May 1990 Wayne George Tonks (the deceased) was killed in his home unit at Artarmon. The Crown alleged that the deceased was murdered by Kane (who, at the time, was a 16 year old school pupil) and a friend who was referred to at the trial as Andrew.  
      
       
     5    The principal Crown evidence against Kane came from admissions he made in a police interview on 16 May 1997 and to his former wife, Bedelia Dali, and his former mother-in-law, Robyn Unger.  
      
       
     6    The police interview concerned was the second interview which the police had had with Kane on 16 May 1997. There had been an earlier interview that morning. The first ground of appeal concerns the admission into evidence of the record of the first interview. 
      
       
     7    At the trial Kane contended that the evidence of the first interview had been obtained illegally and should not have been admitted. A voir dire was held by Barr J to determine the admissibility of the evidence in question. 
      
       
     8    Two police officers were present at the interview but Barr J considered the evidence of Detective Sergeant Smith to be the more important because it was he, as the senior officer, who had the responsibility of deciding what steps to take during the course of the investigation, including whether and when to interrogate Kane, arrest him and charge him. 
      
       
     9    During April and May 1997 police officers had spoken to Bedelia Dali and her mother. Each of them individually stated that Kane had confessed that he was in some way responsible for killing the deceased. The information from Ms Dali led the police to believe that Andrew was involved as well.  
      
       
     10    Prior to 16 May 1997, the police had established that one or more persons had entered the deceased’s unit at Artarmon, where he lived, assaulted him, taped his legs, arms and mouth and placed a plastic bag over his head. As a result he suffocated. Fingerprints were found on tape securing the body of the deceased that matched Andrew’s fingerprints and a fingerprint found on a glass at the deceased’s residence matched Kane’s fingerprints. 
      
       
     11    Knowing these facts, Smith and another police officer, Detective Perry, called at the residence of Kane and his parents at about 8 am on 16 May 1997. The police spoke to Kane briefly and asked him whether he knew anything about the death of the deceased. He said that he did not. Smith told Kane that he was under arrest and took him to the Surry Hills Police Station where he intended to ask him further questions. Precisely what was said to Kane before he was arrested is relevant to the first ground of the appeal and I shall return to this issue.  
      
       
     12    Shortly after 9 am on 16 May 1997, Smith commenced interviewing Kane at the police station with his father present. The interview continued until 9.51 am, during which time Kane made no admissions. He denied having been to any home unit in Artarmon, he denied knowing the deceased and denied having had anything to do with the death of the deceased. He denied having made any admission or confession to Ms Dali or Mrs Unger. 
      
       
     13    Thereafter Kane spoke privately to his father and requested a further interview. The second interview followed, commencing at 12.05 pm and ending at 1.47 pm. No objection was made to the tender of the video tape and transcript of this second interview. 
      
       
     14    At the voir dire, counsel then appearing for Kane submitted that when Smith arrested Kane he “intended to delay charging him until he had completed questioning him, however long that took”. As Barr J noted, it was submitted on Kane’s behalf that, in those circumstances, “the arrest itself was unlawful because the intention in effecting it incorporated an intent not to take the accused before the magistrate as soon as practicable”: see in this regard Williams v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 278 at 295 and 300. 
      
       
     15    Smith testified in chief at the voir dire that on 16 May 1997, when he went to Kane’s house, the prospect of charging Kane was within his contemplation but he had not then made up his mind to charge him. In the course of the cross-examination of Smith the following exchange occurred: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You said that the purpose of I think going around to Mr Kane’s home and arresting him was for the purpose of interviewing him as to his knowledge regarding the death of Wayne Tonks, is that correct? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
       
     16    In other passages, including in his evidence in chief, Smith agreed that his intention in arresting Kane “was to interview him”. His Honour, in fact, accepted that, when Smith arrested Kane, he intended to interrogate him. But, it is apparent that, when Smith arrived at Kane’s home, he already had enough evidence to charge Kane. Relying partly on this fact, Barr J found that when Smith arrested Kane he “had already made up his mind to charge him with murder”. The fact that Smith also intended to interrogate Kane did not render the arrest unlawful: Williams at 283 to 284 per Gibbs CJ. 
      
       
     17    Barr J made the following further observations: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was submitted [that] the arrest itself was unlawful because the intention in effecting it incorporated an intent not to take the accused before the magistrate as soon as practicable. 
         
        
        
         
         It is for the accused to demonstrate that that was the state of mind of Detective Sergeant Smith at the time, and I am not satisfied that it was. I very much doubt whether when he arrested the accused shortly after 8 o’clock Detective Sergeant Smith was considering what the position would be when the Local Courts opened at 10 o’clock. He certainly intended to interrogate the accused and he knew that he would be charging him and would have to take him before a magistrate, but I am not satisfied that at the time of the arrest itself he intended to delay charging the accused until after the time when it first became practicable for him to be taken before a magistrate. 
         
        
        
         
         I conclude that the accused’s arrests and detention in the first place were lawful”. 
         
        
       
     18    The next question for Barr J at the voir dire was whether, as counsel for Kane submitted, the arrest and detention later became unlawful because of a delay in bringing Kane before a magistrate. Relevant to this issue was the fact that it only became practicable to bring Kane before a magistrate at about 9.51 am on 16 May 1999.  
      
       
     19    In R v Burns, unreported NSWCCA, 19 August 1988, Street CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The requirement [to bring an arrested person before a justice ‘as soon as possible’] is not absolute. It is a requirement tinged, as are most common law principles, with an element of reasonableness and I see nothing unreasonable in the proposition that the requirement is not offended merely by reason of the failure of the police to go and find a Justice somewhere and bring him back to the police station in order to exercise his function”. 
         
        
        
       
     20    Barr J, in effect, adopted this approach. He accepted that once it became practicable to take Kane before a magistrate, it became unlawful, thereafter, to detain him other than for that purpose. Barr J considered that the police could have taken Kane to the Local Courts at 9.51 am and concluded that the detention of Kane after that time was unlawful and that the evidence he so obtained was unlawfully obtained.  
      
       
     21    Barr J proceeded to apply s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 and determined that the evidence obtained in the interview after Kane was unlawfully obtained should be admitted. In exercising his discretion under s 138(1) to admit the evidence, Barr J said that he was satisfied that Smith did not deliberately or recklessly detain Kane after the time when it ceased to be lawful to do so. Moreover, the unlawfully obtained evidence represented a very small part of the interview. Further, his Honour observed: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is necessary to know what was said during the first interview in order to gain a proper understanding of what was being spoken about in the second. Accordingly, the evidence is very important and has significant probity value”. 
         
        
        
       His Honour concluded that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting evidence that had been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. There is no challenge to this decision. 
        
       
     22    On appeal, Mr Game SC, senior counsel for Kane, submitted that Kane’s initial arrest and detention were unlawful (and hence the evidence of the first interview was unlawfully obtained) on two bases.  
      
       
     23    Firstly, he submitted that the arrest was unlawful because, when Smith arrested Kane, he told him merely that he was doing so “in view of the information that we have received, regarding the death of Mr Tonks”. He argued that Smith should have told Kane that he was being arrested on a charge of murder and his failure to do so rendered the arrest unlawful.  
      
       
     24    Secondly, Mr Game submitted that the detention of Kane was and continued to be unlawful because at the time of the arrest Smith did not have the intention of taking Kane before a magistrate and charging him as soon as practicable.  
      
       
     25    In arguing the first point, Mr Game accepted that the lawfulness of the arrest was to be determined by the principles expressed in Christie v Leachinsky [1947] AC 573 by Viscount Simon (at 587-588). Relevantly, his Lordship said:  
      
       
        
         
         “(1) If a policeman arrests without warrant upon reasonable suspicion of felony, or of other crime of a sort which does not require a warrant, he must in ordinary circumstances inform the person arrested of the true ground of arrest. He is not entitled to keep the reason to himself or to give a reason which is not the true reason. In other words, a citizen is entitled to know on what charge or on suspicion of what crime he is seized. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) If the citizen is not so informed but is nevertheless seized, the policeman, apart from certain exceptions, is liable for false imprisonment. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) The requirement that the person arrested should be informed of the reason why he is seized naturally does not exist if the circumstances are such that he must know the general nature of the alleged offence for which he is detained. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) The requirement that he should be so informed does not mean a technical or precise language need be used. The matter is a matter of substance, and turns on the elementary proposition that in this country a person is, prima facie, entitled to his freedom and is only required to submit to restraints on his freedom if he knows in substance the reason why it is claimed that this restraint should be imposed. 
         
        
        
         
         (5) …” 
         
        
       
     26    Mr Game argued, in effect, that Kane did not, in substance, know the reason why he was arrested.  
      
       
     27    In my view, this submission cannot be accepted. Immediately prior to telling Kane that he was under arrest in view of the information the police had received regarding the death of the deceased, Smith referred to that information in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Kane, as I have already told you, I am Detective Sergeant Smith and this is Detective Perry. We are attached to the Major Crime Squad North at Chatswood. We are investigating the death of Mr Wayne Tonks, a 35 year old high school teacher who was murdered at his home unit at Artarmon on the weekend of the 19th, 20th May 1990. We have received information that you may have some knowledge of the death of Mr Tonks.”  
         
        
       
     28    Accordingly, Smith made it quite plain to Kane that the deceased had been murdered, that the police had received information that Kane might have some knowledge as to his death (and, implicitly, the murder) and in view of that information Kane was being arrested. That being so, Kane knew, in substance, that he was being arrested on a charge of murder. I would not uphold the arguments advanced on this issue on Kane’s behalf. 
      
       
     29    Mr Game submitted that Barr J had decided only the question whether Smith intended to delay charging Kane until he completed questioning him and he argued that this was not the correct question. He submitted that the correct question was whether, when arresting Kane, Smith had a concurrent intention to take him before a magistrate to be charged as soon as practicable.  
      
       
     30    Mr Game pointed to the fact that Smith had testified that, at the time of the arrest, he intended to question Kane and he did not intend to charge him until he had completed the questioning. Barr J rejected this evidence. As mentioned, his Honour found that, when Smith arrived at Kane’s parents’ home on the morning of 16 May 1999, he intended to charge Kane. Mr Game submitted, however, that it was to be inferred from Smith’s evidence that he did not intend to charge Kane as soon as practicable.  
      
       
     31    I do not accept these submissions. Three points can be made. Firstly, there was no finding that Smith did not intend to charge Kane as soon as practicable (albeit that his Honour was not asked to make such a finding). Secondly, it was not proved that, at the time of the arrest, Smith did not intend to charge Kane as soon as practicable. Such a conclusion inevitably follows from the absence of direct evidence on the issue together with the findings that Smith had decided to charge Kane with murder when he arrested him and that Kane had not proved that, at the time of the arrest, Smith intended to delay charging him. Thirdly, it is implicit in Barr J’s findings that at the time of the arrest Smith intended to charge Kane as soon as practicable.  
      
       
     32    In the circumstances I would not uphold the first ground of appeal. 
      
       
     33    I turn now to the second ground of appeal. This challenges the directions given by Barr J to the jury in regard to common purpose. In this regard it is necessary first to set out briefly the competing versions before the jury. 
      
       
     34    As I have mentioned, the Crown case was based on the second police interview and the evidence of Bedelia Dali and Mrs Unger. According to Ms Dali, Kane told her that when he and Andrew were aged 16 Andrew had told him that he had been raped by a man. Andrew asked Kane to go with him to the man’s home to murder him. The two had gone to the man’s unit, were invited in and were given some drinks. They bashed the man, tied him up and placed a plastic bag over his head. When Kane and Andrew left the unit they went to McDonalds to change their blood stained clothing into some clean clothes which they had taken with them. Kane told her that he and Andrew had together murdered the man. 
      
       
     35    Similar evidence was given by Mrs Unger. 
      
       
     36    In the second police interview Kane told the police that he and Andrew had been given spiked drinks by the deceased and another man at the deceased’s unit in Artarmon. Kane was tied up and was anally raped. He was compelled to perform oral sex on the deceased. Thereafter, he and Andrew discussed getting revenge for what the deceased had done. He was aware that some film or photographs had been taken of him and wanted to find out if the film or photographs were in the deceased’s unit. He also wanted to give the deceased a hiding. For this reason he took a small baseball bat which he owned and some tape to the flat. He and Andrew gained entry to the unit by telling the deceased that they wanted a good time. After demanding the handing over of film he and Andrew commenced to hit the deceased. He said that he had tied the deceased’s hands and feet with the tape but could not remember tying his knees or putting tape over his mouth and eyes. He said that he could not remember placing a bag over the deceased’s head and could not remember Andrew doing that. Eventually he said to Andrew “let’s get out of here” and Andrew left right away. They arrived at Artarmon station together, having walked there.  
      
       
     37    The case against Kane, based on the testimony of Ms Dali and Mrs Unger and on the police interview, was that either he, Kane, had placed the bag on the deceased’s head or Andrew had done so in Kane’s presence. If Kane had placed the bag over the deceased’s head he was the murderer. If Andrew had done that, this was part of the plan, Kane having agreed to help Andrew in killing the deceased. 
      
       
     38    Kane’s second ground of appeal is directed principally against written directions given by Barr J to the jury.  
      
       
     39    These written directions were supplemented by his Honour in considerable detail in the course of his oral directions. Moreover, his Honour said in regard to the written directions: 
      
       
        
         
         “I want to give you a particular warning about [the written directions.] [They are] intended for your assistance, but [they are] not intended to be a substitute for the complete directions that I give you orally. There is always a danger that when important directions are summarised in the very short way that these directions on the document I have given you have been that there will be a temptation to stop listening to anything else I say. You must avoid that temptation. The directions I have given you are only skeletal. They do not attempt to cover everything, every important thing that I shall say to you. You should continue to heed every word that I say to you.” 
         
        
       
     40    In the circumstances, the written directions cannot be looked at alone. They must be seen in context and in particular in the context of the oral directions given by Barr J. 
      
       
     41    The written directions asserted that, before the jury could convict Kane of murder, they needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any of the following things happened, namely: 
      
       
        
         
         “2.1 Because the accused alone or jointly with Andrew did the act causing death intending to kill the deceased or do him grievous bodily harm; or 
         
        
        
         
         2.2 Because Andrew did the act causing death either pursuant to an agreement with the accused to kill the deceased or pursuant to an agreement to attack the deceased where the accused contemplated the death of the deceased as a possible result; or 
         
        
        
         
         2.3 Because Andrew did the act causing death intending to kill the deceased or do him grievous bodily harm and the accused, knowing what Andrew was doing and what his intention was, intentionally assisted or encouraged him to do the act causing death”. 
         
        
        
       
     42    Mr Game submitted that the second direction, that is, direction 2.2, was defective. The fundamental objection to direction 2.2 was that it did not make it plain that Kane had to contemplate the possibility that Andrew would, with intent to kill, place the bag over the head of the deceased and tape it. It was said that the jury might have thought that it was sufficient that Andrew did the act causing death pursuant to an agreement with Kane to attack the deceased with a baseball bat where Kane contemplated the death of the deceased as a possible result of such an attack.  
      
       
     43    Reference was also made to oral directions that were couched in terms of whether or not the “placing and taping of the bag by Andrew was within the scope of the joint criminal enterprise”. It was said that the learned judge did not expressly define for the jury the meaning of the phrase “within the scope of the joint criminal enterprise”, and the jury may well have understood that that issue was to be resolved by the application of the test articulated in the written directions. It was emphasised that the directions in these terms did not make it plain that Kane had to contemplate the possibility that Andrew would, with intent to kill, place the bag over the head of the deceased and tape it”. It was submitted that at the very least the directions on this point lacked the necessary clarity and the jury might well have found them confusing. 
      
       
     44    Direction 2.2 must, however, be seen in context. The context involves, firstly, the nature of the act the subject of direction 2.2 and, as I have said, the oral directions that supplemented the written document. 
      
       
     45    As regards the nature of the act, there could have been no misunderstanding on the part of the jury that the act that caused death was the placing and taping of the bag over the head of the deceased. As his Honour remarked when commencing the relevant part of his directions “this trial has been conducted from start to finish upon the well founded basis that nothing that happened to the deceased before the taping of the bag over the head was likely to kill him, and pretty clearly what killed him, and the only thing that killed him, was the act of putting the bag over his head and taping it tight so that he suffocated”. This was the “act” to which his Honour was referring in the phrase “the act causing death” in direction 2.2. It follows that the phrase in direction 2.2 “pursuant to an agreement to attack the deceased” must be understood as “pursuant to an agreement to attack the deceased by placing and taping a bag over his head.” 
      
       
     46    This was reinforced by other oral directions given by his Honour. For example, when dealing with the first scenario on which Kane could be found guilty, he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The first way the Crown can prove the accused’s responsibility, criminal responsibility, for the death of the deceased, is if it can prove that he did the act causing death; put the bag over the head”. 
         
        
        
       He went on to say: 
        
        
         
         “The Crown does not have to prove that the accused did the act alone. It will be sufficient if the accused and Andrew did it together. The act of putting a bag over a prostrate man’s head and taping it seems capable of being done by one person or two …” 
         
        
        
       Barr J made it clear that the essential inquiry with which the jury was concerned involved the responsibility for putting the bag over the head of the deceased and taping it.  
        
       
     47    It is also important to note that the defence did not and could not suggest that the person or persons who put the bag over the deceased’s head and taped it did so with any intention other than killing the deceased. This is not a case where the criminal acts in question could have been perpetrated with any intention other than causing death. As his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “A person who tapes a plastic bag securely over the head of a man who has been immobilised and has been beaten and cut and has his hands securely fastened behind his back and legs securely fastened together, must be taken to intend to kill him. The contrary has not been suggested here. There is no issue that who killed the deceased meant to kill him, and the second matter is not one about which the trial has been fought”. 
         
        
       
     48    Other oral directions given by Barr J further clarified what was meant by the phrase “within the scope of the joint criminal enterprise” in relation to the placing and taping of the bag by Andrew.  
      
       
     49    Barr J gave the jury unexceptionable directions as to the concept of joint criminal enterprise based upon the observations of Hunt CJ at CL in Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 556 to 557. He concluded his discussion of this topic by saying: 
      
       
        
         
         “A person participates in a joint criminal enterprise either by committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at the time when the crime is committed, and (with knowledge that the crime is to be or is being committed) by intentionally assisting or encouraging another participant to the joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime. The presence of that person at the time when the time is committed and a readiness to give aid if required is sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the another participants in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime”. 
         
        
       
     50    His Honour then gave some examples to show how the principles he had explained might be applied. One of the examples he gave was of three offenders who commit a bank robbery. One drives the get away car, another stands guard and the third enters the bank armed with a sawn off shotgun to steal money. His Honour pointed out that things do not always turn out precisely as planned. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The law therefore makes each of those involved in the joint criminal enterprise guilty not only for the acts done by each of them in the execution of that agreed joint enterprise, but also for any acts which are incidental to the execution of that joint enterprise, that is, for anything which might possibly happen which is within the contemplation of those involved in the joint criminal enterprise. If any one of them does an act which they all contemplated may possibly be done in the course of committing the agreed crime then all of then are criminally responsible for that act”. 
         
        
       
     51    Barr J then postulated, in the example which he had given, that if the man guarding the door punched a bystander to prevent him from interfering with their escape after the armed robbery was complete, all three would be guilty of the assault as well as the armed robbery. That is because the three of them obviously originally contemplated the possibility that the man on guard may have to do something like that.  
      
       
     52    His Honour then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “On the other hand, suppose the man guarding the door, unknown to the others, had a hand grenade in his pocket and he removed the pin and lobbed inside the bank to prevent those inside from interfering with their escape. That is hardly an act that the others would have contemplated might possibly happen, and therefore they would not be guilty with him for the injuries caused by the resulting explosion. His act would not have been incidental to the execution of the joint criminal enterprise to carry out an armed robbery”. 
         
        
       
     53    Barr J postulated further that the robber with the sawn off shotgun might have wounded a teller in the course of the robbery. His Honour said that, if the other members of the joint criminal enterprise were aware that the man concerned had the shotgun, and were aware that it was loaded, then: 
      
       
        
         
         “you may think that the original plan that he should threaten the teller with injury by the shotgun would almost necessarily include a contemplation or an awareness on their part that such a threat to injure may possibly lead to the infliction of such an injury, for one so easily leads to the other”. 
         
        
        
       He explained: 
        
        
         
         “The jury in such a case would be entitled to convict all three members of the joint criminal enterprise to carry out an armed robbery of the more serious crime of armed robbery with wounding even though the wounding was not part of the original plan, and even though only one of them was actually involved in the wounding. 
         
        
        
         
         Such a conviction would follow from the jury’s acceptance that they were all aware of the possibility that the shotgun would be fired and injured someone”. 
         
        
        
        
       This example was a useful illustration of the principle expressed in  
       Johns v The 
         
       Queen 
        (1980) 143 CLR 108 at 118 and 130 to 131. 
        
       
     54    His Honour then reviewed the evidence as to the alleged agreement between Kane and Andrew and the arguments of the parties in this connection. When dealing with the situation contemplated by the direction in 2.2 his Honour made it plain that the jury had to decide whether Kane contemplated that the deceased might be killed “in the manner in which the death was brought about”, namely by the tape and bag. True it is that Barr J did not tell the jury expressly that Kane had to contemplate the possibility that Andrew would place the bag over the head of the deceased and tape it with intent to kill. But he had dealt with that issue previously when telling the jury that there was no issue “that who killed the deceased meant to kill him” and that whoever taped the bag over the deceased’s head “must be taken to intend to kill him”. 
      
       
     55    His Honour went on to deal with how the jury were to consider the question whether Kane contemplated that the death of the deceased might result from the “attack”. He told the jury that this required drawing an inference and said: 
      
       
        
         
         “That inference would include some assumption that he knew something about the bag”. 
         
        
        
       This, quite clearly, again told the jury that the relevant act causing death was the placing and taping of the bag. 
        
       
     56    Barr J reminded the jury that they had to exercise extreme care when drawing inferences and said: 
      
       
        
         
         “You should not infer that the accused contemplated that the deceased’s death might result from the attack unless it is the only rational inference in all the circumstances”. 
         
        
        
       By “attack” in context it is quite plain that his Honour was referring to the attack by the bag and the tape. His Honour then went on to say: 
        
        
         
         “It is only if Andrew’s act was regarded by the accused as a possible result, the act causing death, that you could make a finding of criminal responsibility of the accused on this basis”. 
         
        
        
       Again, his Honour emphasised that the jury had to find that Kane contemplated the possibility that Andrew would put the bag over the deceased’s head and tape it. 
        
       
     57    Towards the end of his Honour’s directions he returned to the issue and said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Simply to remind you and encapsulate for you the respective cases on this question, I will tell you this. The Crown must prove that the placing and taping of the bag by Andrew was within the scope of the joint criminal enterprise, the agreement between the accused and Andrew. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown case is that the placing and taping of the bag if done by Andrew, was within the scope of the agreement between them. 
         
        
        
         
         The defence case is that Andrew placed and taped the bag and that this act was outside the scope of the agreement between them. That is to say it is not incidental to the carrying out of the agreement to bash and tie up the deceased, and it was not contemplated by the accused as a possible act of Andrew. I suppose that case is like the incident in the bank with a man, unknown to anybody, took out the hand grenade, not contemplated”. 
         
        
       
     58    In my view, in all the circumstances, there could have been no misunderstanding on the part of the jury. With regard to the issue of common purpose, the jury would have been well aware, from the nature of the case and from what his Honour told them, that the Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Kane contemplated the possibility that Andrew would, with intent to kill, place the bag over the head of the deceased and tape it. Further, the jury would have well understood the meaning of the phrase “within the scope of the joint criminal enterprise”.  
      
       
     59    Accordingly, I would not uphold the second ground of appeal. 
      
       
     60    The third ground of appeal concerns Barr J’s directions on provocation. His Honour told the jury that if they accepted the evidence of Ms Dali and Mrs Unger and if they thought that Kane was telling the truth when he told them that Andrew alone had been raped it would follow that Kane was not involved in any improper sexual conduct on the part of the deceased. It followed, he told the jury, that if they accepted that the deceased raped Andrew alone and that Andrew recruited Kane to help him kill the deceased, then the deceased’s conduct could not be evidence of provocation because it was not directed towards and did not affect Kane. 
      
       
     61    His Honour said, in this regard: 
      
       
        
         
         “In that case, all you would be left with would be the turning on and playing of the video tape on the night when the deceased lost his life”. 
         
        
       
     62    It was submitted on Kane’s behalf, however, that: 
      
       
        
         
         “The correct position is that the rape of Andrew would still have been relevant because, it being in the mind of Kane, would have affected the gravity of the provocation involved in the act by the deceased in the placing of the tape in the video (cf  
         Green v R  
         (1998) 191 CLR 334)”. 
         
        
       
     63    There is nothing in the police interview which suggests that Kane was provoked by the playing of the video. In his evidence in chief, Kane said that when he and Andrew were at the deceased’s unit on the occasion that he was killed, the deceased played a pornographic video involving sexual activities between men. Kane said that he indicated to Andrew that he wanted to leave and tried to leave. In fact, he did not leave. In cross-examination Kane said that when the deceased put the video on he hit him from behind. Kane accepted that he and Andrew had a pre-arranged plan that they were going to hit the deceased and he described the moment of playing the video as a “poignant time” and said that, given what had happened before. it was a suitable time to start hitting the deceased. He disagreed with the proposition that he was not provoked by the fact that the video was put on. He said that the video “pissed me off”. However, when he was asked whether he lost control of himself, he said “I don’t do that sort of thing”. 
      
       
     64    Although the playing of the video seems to have had only peripheral effect on Kane, Barr J gave the jury appropriate directions in regard to possible provocation caused by the playing of the video. These are not challenged. The sole point raised is that his Honour, it is said, wrongly told the jury that the rape of Andrew was not evidence of provocation of Kane.  
      
       
     65    In my view his Honour was justified in directing the jury as he did. It was not suggested that Kane had any peculiar sensitivity to homosexual conduct. In my view the rape of Andrew could not constitute provocation of Kane and Kane did not assert that he had been so provoked. His case was that he had been provoked by the rape of himself.  
      
       
     66    All his Honour did was to tell the jury that if they did not believe Kane and should they find that only Andrew had been raped then they should not regard the rape of Andrew as constituting provocation of Kane. In my view this direction was entirely appropriate. I would dismiss the third ground. 
      
       
     67    It follows that I would dismiss Kane’s appeal. 
      
       
     68    I turn to the Crown appeal against sentence. 
      
       
     69    The Crown’s submissions must be seen against the fact that the trial before Barr J was a re-trial. The respondent had been convicted of murder on 18 May 1999 and on 2 July 1999 was sentenced by Sully J to penal servitude for 13 years with a minimum term of 10 years and an additional term of 3 years. 
      
       
     70    In sentencing Kane, Sully J took into account a prior period spent by Kane in custody. The effect of this was that the effective overall minimum custodial period resulting from the sentence imposed by Sully J was 10 years and 2 months. 
      
       
     71    Barr J, as I have mentioned, on the other hand, sentenced Kane to a term of imprisonment of 10 years and 6 months to commence on 27 October 2000 and expire on 26 April 2011. A non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months to expire on 26 April 2008 was imposed. 
      
       
     72    In arriving at this sentence Barr took into account a period of custody served by Kane prior to being convicted at the second trial. On this basis the effective period of custody imposed by Barr J was 8 years and 8 months. This is to be contrasted with the period of 10 years and 2 months imposed by Sully J. It is, in effect, a reduction of 18 months. 
      
       
     73    The Crown contends that his Honour erred in this sentence in a number of respects. 
      
       
     74    The most important grounds relied on by the Crown concern two factual findings by Sully J made in the course of sentencing which differed from factual findings on the same issues made by Barr J. Firstly, Sully J found that in the first encounter between Kane and the deceased, the deceased had committed some gross sexual impropriety towards the respondent and the respondent was deeply aggrieved by this. Barr J, on the other hand, did not find that the respondent himself experienced sexual impropriety at the hands of the deceased. Secondly, Sully J found that Kane had intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. Barr J on the other hand found that Kane had intended to kill the deceased. 
      
       
     75    The Crown therefore submitted that the facts found by Barr J constituted a more serious set of circumstances than those found by Sully J. Nevertheless, the sentence imposed by Barr J was less than that imposed by Sully J. This was the Crown’s main complaint. 
      
       
     76    In my view, however, the fact that Sully J had imposed a higher sentence despite having found that the crime was committed in less serious circumstances, is not of paramount significance.  
      
       
     77    It is of the essence of the law of sentencing in this State that each individual judge is entitled and, indeed, obliged to exercise his or her own discretion in imposing an appropriate sentence on the facts found.  
      
       
     78    The dominant principle of sentencing law is that a sentence must be commensurate with the seriousness of the offence. In determining an appropriate sentence, there is ample room for the exercise of individual judgment and the appropriate sentence in each case is left to the discretion of the individual Judge.  
      
       
     79    Individual judges are not bound by sentences imposed by other judges sitting at first instance, albeit that the sentence in question may have been imposed on the same offender for the same offence. Even where that occurs the facts as found may differ in important respects and circumstances may alter. Additionally, a range of sentences would generally be available and judges might legitimately differ in philosophy, approach and result: R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 per Spigelman CJ. 
      
       
     80    Accordingly, the sentence imposed by Sully J is not a benchmark against which the sentence of Barr J is to be measured. Moreover, it is to be borne in mind that the sentence imposed by Sully J was in fact set aside.  
      
       
     81    The true question, therefore, is simply whether the sentence imposed by Barr J fell within an appropriate sentencing discretion.  
      
       
     82    His Honour took into account a number of mitigating circumstances. I shall mention these.  
      
       
     83    Kane was only 16 years old when he committed the offence. His youth was plainly reductive of the criminality involved.  
      
       
     84    Even on the facts found by Barr J, there was some mitigatory force in the fact that the crime was not motiveless but was committed by an adolescent to support a friend. As Barr J put it Kane did not take part in any mindless attack. He played his part because of his indignation over what he believed the deceased had done to his friend and because his friend had asked him for help. That did not justify what he did but it does mitigate his criminality to some minor extent. 
      
       
     85    At the time of the trial before Barr J, Kane was nearly 27 years old. He had a modest record of offences involving drugs and dishonest behaviour, but that was principally associated with a period of immature and experimental behaviour during his formative years. Nothing had been recorded against him for more than 5 years.  
      
       
     86    Kane had expressed remorse. His parents and family supported him. He appeared to be on the road to rehabilitation. Barr J found that there was every indication that when Kane is released on parole he will be able to pursue a useful role in society and avoid offending again.  
      
       
     87    His Honour referred to the stress experienced by Kane through the mis-trial before Sully J, which was no fault of his. The mis-trial led to the second conviction, Kane’s remand in custody and his return to prison. These were legitimate factors for his Honour to take into account. 
      
       
     88    Barr J concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “These matters justify a reduction in the non-parole period and, together with the need to provide a realistic period of time on parole to foster the offender’s rehabilitation, justify a parole period which is more than one quarter of the term of the sentence”. 
         
        
       
     89    In my view there can be no criticism of his Honour’s approach. I am of the opinion that the sentence was within his Honour’s discretion. I would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     90    GREG JAMES J: I agree with Ipp AJA.

      THE NOMINAL DEFENDANT v CENCIC 
     FACTS 
     The Nominal Defendant represented Mr Magro, the driver of a car that collided with the respondent’s car. The respondent successfully sued the Nominal Defendant at trial and was awarded $260,875 damages. The Nominal Defendant appealed against the trial judge’s decision on both liability and quantum. A further ground of appeal contended for was that the trial judge should not have ordered a separate hearing of liability and quantum and that this error necessitated a new trial. HELD per Meagher JA (Handley & Powell JJA agreeing):(i) The trial judge’s decision to have separate hearings on quantum and liability was a discretionary one. No error is apparent that warrants appellate intervention.(ii) There is no basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding on liability.(iii) The trial judge’s decision on damages should be set aside. ORDERS1 Appeal allowed in part.2 Judgment below set aside.3 Order a new trial limited to damages.4 No order made as to costs of the appeal.5 Respondent is to have a certificate under the Suitors Funds Act 1951.6 Costs of the first trial to abide the result of the new trial.

      THE NOMINAL DEFENDANT v CENCIC 
      
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
     1   MEAGHER JA: This is an appeal against a verdict obtained by a plaintiff (the present respondent) against the appellant Nominal Defendant in a District Court action. The learned judge, his Honour Judge W. Delbridge Hosking QC, awarded the plaintiff, Mr. Cencic, the sum of $260,875. Both liability and damages were in issue. The action concerned an accident which occurred at the intersection of Trevor and Sheffield Streets at Merrylands (a suburb of Sydney).  
     2   The appellant Nominal Defendant in effect represents a Mr. Magro, the driver of the vehicle. 
     3   The respondent plaintiff was driving a Ford Laser east along Sheffield Street and approaching the intersection of Trevor Street, intending to make a right hand turn into Trevor Street. Trevor Street formed a terminating T-intersection with Sheffield Street. Mr. Magro was travelling in Trevor Street towards Sheffield Street, and was intending to turn right into Sheffield Street. Facing Mr Magro, at the junction of the two streets, was a “Give Way” sign. The vehicle being driven by Mr. Magro was unregistered and uninsured. 
     4   But a particularly vigorous attack was made by the appellant on his Honour’s decision to have separate hearings on liability and quantum. The way it was put in the appellant’s written submissions is as follows: 
      
       
        
        Notwithstanding that the trial came on for hearing upon the combined questions of liability and quantum, his Honour chose to order separate hearings with the damages hearing to immediately follow the determination of the liability hearing. That course was not only opposed on behalf of the appellant. It arose as a result of his Honour’s own suggestion and upon his own motion. It was then enthusiastically supported by the respondent. 
        
       
     5   That way of putting the matter obscures many relevant factors. One is that there is a well-known discretion in a trial judge to proceed on separate issues, although it is clear enough that it should not be done unless there is good reason to do so. Another is that his Honour sought the views of both counsel before making his order. Yet another is that there was a very good reason to do so; Mr Rodriguez was going to be an important witness, he attended court with reluctance and subject to a subpoena, he had a seriously ill wife to attend to, and he had no evidence to contribute to the question of quantum; and his Honour believed that the trial on liability was short. And yet another was that if his Honour did not make the order off his own bat the plaintiff’s counsel was on the point of requesting him to make such an order. 
      
       
     6   There is no doubt, as Mr. Shore, learned counsel for the appellant, stressed, that the normal rule is that all questions of liability and damages should be heard together; a departure from that rule should occur but rarely, and no judge should order it except with great caution. These principles are laid down in a series of decisions: Government Insurance Office of NSW v Bailey (1992) 27 NSWLR 304, Giretti v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 70 FCR 151, Simmonds v Spooner (No 3) (unreported, NSW CA, 28/03/95) and Stead v State Government Insurance Commission (1986) 161 CLR 141. Nonetheless, the trial judge has a discretion to make an order severing the hearing of liability and damages. 
     7   Whether or not the judge in the present case should have exercised the discretion in favour of severance is another matter. That question should be decided as at the time when the offer was made, not at the time of the hearing of the appeal, when we all have the benefit of hindsight. At the relevant time, then, his Honour had to consider the convenience of the witness to whom I have referred; he was told that the liability component of the case was very short (a misrepresentation of some enormity); on that issue, it seemed that all which was involved was deciding whether Mr. Magro’s vehicle did or did not stop at a “Give Way” sign - hardly, one would have thought, an involved question; whereas, so it was said, in contrast to the shortness and simplicity of the liability question, the damages component of the case (which counsel frequently called the “medical question”) was both long and involved. (In fact the latter question was about the same size as the former question, but initially that is not what the judge was told). 
     8   In these circumstances, his Honour might well have thought, as he apparently did, that all obstacles to his devoting himself to the difficult problem should be removed. 
     9   I might add that, if I were in his position I should have decided the matter differently, but that is another matter, and one of no relevance. 
     10   For these reasons, in my view this ground of appeal must fail. 
     11   His Honour heard each question separately, and, broadly speaking, found each of them in favour of the plaintiff, Mr Cencic. 
     12   On the issue of liability, his Honour’s conclusion in favour of the plaintiff seems to me to be inevitable. It all revolved around the question of whether Mr Magro stopped at the “Give Way” sign (as he contended) or not (as the plaintiff contended). His Honour found the plaintiff a truthful witness. He also found that the only independent witness, the Mr Rodriguez to whom reference has been made, was also a witness of truth. He further found that Mr Magro was an unimpressive witness. Mr Magro begged the plaintiff not to tell the police. He offered to repair the plaintiff’s vehicle at no cost. And, in reply to the plaintiff’s question, “Why did you go through it?” (ie. the “Give Way” sign), Mr Magro replied “Because I did not see you.” I shall not recite the rest of the evidence on liability, because the combined effect of the admissions I have just referred to demanded an affirmative finding in the plaintiff’s favour on the issue of liability. That the plaintiff’s account contained some internal inconsistencies, and that his Honour’s account of the accident contained some misapprehensions, do not derogate from this conclusion. 
     13   However, on the question of damages, a different picture presents itself. The plaintiff’s case was that, although before the accident (which took place on 20 March 1997) he suffered headaches, they were of no great severity, whereas immediately after the accident his headaches were much more serious, and rather different in kind. This assertion could not but raise some questions. One was why his wife was not called to substantiate his story. Another was why no pre-accident medical reports were tendered. The diligence of the defendant’s solicitors unearthed that he went onto a Department of Social Security Sickness Benefit in or about mid November 1996, when he also obtained a medical certificate of unfitness for work for 3 months. He was experiencing cluster headaches. He obtained another 3 month certificate on 19 December 1996. In January 1997 (just 2 months before the accident) he was referred for a neurological opinion from Dr. Somerville. By 7 February 1997 (just one month before the accident) he was certified as unfit for any work (part-time or full-time) for a further 3-6 months because of chronic headaches. He had been treated by a number of psychiatrists, but the plaintiff’s counsel did not tender any of these reports. 
     14   A certain Dr Becker had apparently treated Mr. Cencic both before and after the accident - the only doctor to have done so. He opined that the plaintiff’s “ongoing disability cannot be attributed to his motor vehicle accident as his previous spinal condition is reason for his complaint of pain.” Despite the plaintiff’s best endeavours to suppress this document, the appellant, having obtained it by subpoena, tendered it. His Honour, without explaining why, treated it as having no evidentiary value. 
     15   In these circumstances, I think his Honour’s decision on the question of damages cannot, in the light of the principles laid down in State Rail Authority of NSW v Earthline Constructions Pty Ltd (in Liquidation)(1999) 73 ALJR 306, stand. 
     16   In my view, the following orders should be made:1. Appeal allowed (in part).2. Set aside judgment below.3. Order a new trial limited to damages.4. Make no order as to costs of appeal.5. Respondent to have a certificate under Suitors Fund Act 1951.6. Costs of the first trial to abide the result of the new trial. 
     17   HANDLEY JA: I agree with Meagher JA. 
     18   POWELL JA: I agree with Meagher JA.

       JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    MASON P: The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals against the adequacy of a sentence imposed following a plea of guilty to a charge under s 52A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (dangerous driving occasioning death when the driver was under the influence of intoxicating liquor). The maximum penalty is ten years' imprisonment. 
     2    The offence occurred on 11 December 1999 when the respondent was a little over seventeen and a half years of age. 
     3    The plea of guilty was entered at the Local Court on 7 July 2000. The respondent was thereupon committed for sentence and he appeared before Moore DCJ on 1 December 2000 at the Campbelltown District Court. The sentence, imposed on 2 February 2001, was eighteen months' imprisonment commencing on that date with a non-parole period of six months to be served by way of home detention. 
     4    At about 2.40 am on 11 December 1999 the respondent was driving north along Appin Road, Campbelltown. His vehicle collided head-on with a vehicle being driven in a southerly direction. The respondent's vehicle had crossed over a raised grass median strip in the middle of the road after he had failed to negotiate a slight left-hand bend in the road. The respondent had fallen asleep at the wheel shortly before the collision. 
     5    The eighteen year old driver of the other vehicle suffered extensive injuries and died in hospital that day. 
     6    The respondent was interviewed by the police on 17 February 2000. He and his girlfriend had been at the Novotel Hotel in Wollongong between about 7 pm and 12.30 am on the night in question. He drove her home to Currans Hill (which was a 40-45 kilometres journey) around 12.30 am and he returned to the Novotel briefly before driving home to Mount Annan, near Campbelltown at about 2 am. He started feeling 'a little bit tired.' He turned off the music in the car to be able to concentrate harder, but he fell asleep at the wheel. The window in the car was wound up and the air conditioner was set to a warm temperature. 
     7    The respondent could not recall anything until waking up in Liverpool Hospital the next morning. The accident occurred about ten minutes away from his home. 
     8    Driving conditions at the time were good. The traffic was light. The respondent said he was driving at approximately 70-80 kilometres per hour. The respondent told police that between 9 pm and 9.30 pm he had consumed two 600 ml bottles filled with a mixture of lemonade and around 20-25 mls of Vodka. He had mixed the drinks himself. He believed that the alcohol affected him 'to a mild amount' until around 10.30 pm - 11 pm. After that he felt 'reasonably well' and he did not believe that his consumption of alcohol affected his driving at all. 
     9    Under cross-examination in the sentencing proceedings the respondent agreed that just before he left for the final journey back to Campbelltown he also took “less than half a glass” of a mixture of Coca-Cola and a spirit which he could taste in the drink. He said that he stopped drinking when he tasted the alcoholic content.10    Notwithstanding what the respondent said in his record of interview, the plea of guilty established that the respondent was driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time of the accident. A blood alcohol reading taken at 3.40 am indicated a concentration of 0.087 gms of alcohol per 100 mls of blood. This meant that at the time of the collision the blood alcohol reading would have been between 0.1 and 0.113. According to the evidence of Dr Moynham these levels would cause a person's driving ability to be impaired. For a driver with 'P' plates the upper limit was 0.02. 
     11    The respondent has no prior convictions. He lives with his mother and stepfather. He completed the Higher School Certificate at seventeen. He had completed a cookery course at TAFE and had commenced work as an apprentice chef. 
     12    The respondent had been committed to the District Court for sentence. He came before Judge Moore on 1 December 2000. 
     13    A background report prepared by the Department of Juvenile Justice assessed the respondent as suitable for a community service order. This report was tendered along with several character references. The respondent gave evidence expressing his regret and his understanding about the consequences of his actions to the family of the young woman killed as a result of his irresponsible conduct. His mother gave evidence along similar lines. 
     14    There was tendered into evidence a letter from the deceased girl's mother in which she stated that she had no malice or anger towards the respondent and in which she felt deeply for the respondent and the burden he would have to carry. A similar letter from the deceased woman's younger sister was also tendered. 
     15    Following a short adjournment Judge Moore proceeded to give judgment ex tempore. He commenced his remarks by stating that:  
      
       
        
        ... there must be a sentence of imprisonment, but I will direct that in your case you be assessed for serving the non-parole period by way of home detention. The sentence will be one of two years with a non-parole period of six months and whilst you will be convicted and I pass that sentence, I will adjourn the matter for the purpose of your being assessed for suitability for home detention.  
        
       
       
        
        That will take some time, you will be at liberty while that occurs and then the matter will come back to this Court depending on the result of the home detention assessment. 
        
       
       
        
       
     16    His Honour set out the material facts. 
     17    He held that the alcohol contributed substantially to the drowsiness and that the respondent had some warning of his impending drowsiness although he turned off the radio in the car in an endeavour to concentrate on his driving. Such conclusions were clearly open. 
     18    Adverting to the guideline judgment in Regina v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 231, his Honour observed that the instant case contained two aggravating factors which he described as “alcohol and the length of driving during which people are exposed to risk”. His Honour did not feel it proper to categorise the case as one of an abandonment of responsibility in the sense used by Spigelman CJ at 231. He described the offender as an inexperienced driver. 
     19    His Honour also observed that the respondent was an inexperienced drinker who had no means of measuring the amount of alcohol which he had. I pause to say that I have difficulty understanding the evidentiary basis for these remarks, especially given the evidence about the respondent mixing his own drinks; and the pre-sentence report from the probation and parole officer which said:  
      
       
        
        Mr Begbie stated that he began drinking alcohol on a social basis when aged sixteen years. He indicated that he had a tendency to binge drink when in the company of friends, particularly during outings, although not on a weekly basis.  
         
         
        On the night of the offence the offender stated that he had consumed approximately five alcoholic beverages, mixed by himself. 
        
       
       
        
       
     20    Judge Moore held that the case would have required a sentence of imprisonment in routine custody were it not for certain subjective features. 
     21    His Honour referred to the remarks of Archbishop Tutu that “without forgiveness there can be no future” and said that the case was characterised by the enormous effect of the tragedy coupled with an extreme depth and genuineness of forgiveness by the family of the young girl so gravely affected by her death. 
     22    Citing the obiter remarks of Simpson J in Glen, CCA, unreported, 19 December 1994 he held that it was relevant to take into account the forgiveness of the family of the victim killed. Later in his remarks on sentence the Judge said that were it not for the forgiveness offered by the family of the victim the respondent would have been sent to gaol. 
     23    The subjective features were then addressed. The plea of guilty had avoided additional stress and grief. It was backed up by genuine and deep remorse. Several other matters were adverted to, including the favourable character references indicative that this was an offence committed entirely out of character. There were no prior convictions and the respondent had co-operated with the police from the earliest moment.24    Although the respondent was under full age at the time the crime was committed his Honour held that the matter was such that it should be dealt with according to law. 
     25    In his concluding remarks, his Honour described the case as: 
      
       
        
        an exceptional case of subjective features where a young man, at the threshold of his life is facing a sentence which would in the absence of exceptional circumstances require him to go to gaol. 
        
       
       
        
       
     26    His Honour thereupon imposed a sentence of two years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of six months. The matter was adjourned to 2 February 2001 to enable the obtaining of a report from the Probation and Parole Service as to suitability for home detention. 
     27    The proceedings were however re-listed before his Honour on 14 December 2000. Reference was made to s 79 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which precluded a concurrent or consecutive sentence involving a home detention order expiring more than eighteen months hence. (Although not cited, the directly applicable provision was s 7 of that Act, to which reference will be subsequently made.) 
     28    His Honour said that he thought he was functus officio, but indicated that the operative feature of the sentence which he intended to impose was that the respondent serve six months by way of home detention. He asked whether the Crown wished to be heard. The response suggests that the Crown's representative did not clearly embrace the proposition that the Judge might be functus officio in his sentencing function. However, it was submitted that a term of eighteen months did not really seem to fully cover the criminality of the actual offence. 
     29    The matter came again before Judge Moore on 2 February 2001. A home detention assessment report dated 31 January 2001 was tendered. The respondent was assessed as suitable to serve his sentence by way of a home detention order. The relevant consent and accompanying documents were attached. 
     30    In his further remarks on sentence Judge Moore indicated that his reasons for what he was doing had been recorded on the two previous occasions and that all that remained was to assess the effect of the home detention assessment. Observing that the respondent had been assessed as suitable for home detention, his Honour ordered that the sentence as to its custodial part be served by way of home detention. The respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen months to commence from 2 February 2001 with a non-parole period of six months to commence from that day and to expire on 1 August 2001. It was directed that the non-parole period be served by way of home detention. 
     31    Judge Moore made the following observation:  
      
       
        
        In the home detention assessment, I took this into account, I must say, before I pronounced what I just did, there is a reference to dependency on alcohol and there is an assertion which I quote, “Mr Begbie used to regularly binge drink alcohol with his circle of associates prior to the offence but has by all accounts reduced this intake over recent months”. In my remarks on sentence based on the evidence which was then before me I found that the amount which he had had to drink on the night of the crime, was one which he was unaccustomed to drinking. Neither party wishes to address me about that matter so I simply make that observation. I should not however depart from the matter without expressing two observations. Firstly, that is an assertion which has not been covered by any of the evidence other than the assertion itself. Secondly, in view of the second part of the assertion that he has reduced his intake, coupled with the previous assertion that he has changed his behaviour and also coupled with the requirement that there be no drinking of alcohol whatsoever during the serving of the sentence I would still pass the sentence which I passed today. 
        
       
       
        
       
     32    In my view the sentencing process in this matter was seriously flawed in the method and procedure adopted. These flaws contributed to but do not wholly explain a sentence that was manifestly inadequate and which must be corrected notwithstanding the exceptional nature of a Crown appeal. 
     33    Section 7(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that a Court that has sentenced an offender to imprisonment for not more than eighteen months may make a home detention order directing that the sentence be served by way of home detention. The procedure to be followed is set out in Pt 6 of that Act, especially s 78. 
     34    The decisions of this Court in Jurisic and Regina v Thackray, CCA, unreported, 19 August 1998 explain in the clearest of terms that the legislative scheme relating to home detention requires the sentencing Court to determine and specify the appropriate sentence of imprisonment before it knows whether the offender will qualify to serve it by way of home detention and whether it is appropriate in the particular circumstances for such less onerous form of sentence to be served in that manner (see especially Jurisic at 214-5 per Spigelman CJ, at 249-251 per Sully J). It is a corollary that the Court should not tailor a sentence so that it might be served by home detention. The proper procedure is to determine the appropriate sentence ignoring the provision of home detention and to consider home detention only if the sentence to be imposed is less than eighteen months (Thackray). 
     35    There are sufficient indications in the original remarks on sentence to show that Judge Moore overlooked or ignored these principles. His Honour's comments on 14 December 2000 which explain the basis for the different sentence imposed on 2 February 2001 make such errors explicit. 
     36    The respondent properly concedes that these errors occurred. Alone, they provide a sufficient basis for overturning the sentence imposed on 2 February 2001 without the necessity of tarrying over the additional question whether his Honour was then functus officio as regards imposition of a sentence of imprisonment. This was certainly an unlikely candidate for the application of the slip rule. 
     37    Quite apart from these serious procedural errors, the sentence ultimately imposed was manifestly inadequate and requires appellate correction. The inadequacy was contributed to by the erroneous approach to home detention, but not entirely so. 
     38    The respondent submits that the sentence is not manifestly inadequate. Particular reliance is placed upon the subjective features of the case: The respondent's good character, his youth, the prospects of rehabilitation and the risks involved in sending a young man to gaol. These submissions can also be read as addressing the proper sentence to be imposed by this Court in consequence of the need to re-sentence stemming from the procedural errors already discussed. 
     39    The respondent also submits that the consumption of alcohol was not the sole factor contributing to the sleep which directly caused the crash. It was about 2.40 am. As to objective seriousness, it is also submitted that the respondent was not conscious that he was driving under the influence of liquor. I cannot accept these submissions. The sentencing Judge was correct to conclude that alcohol contributed substantially to the drowsiness and that the respondent was aware of such drowsiness. I have already indicated why I cannot accept that this was a case of an inexperienced youth unaware that he was intoxicated to a substantial degree. Nevertheless, I accept that youth and inexperience contributed to the tragedy of the accident and the sad task now confronting this Court.40    There was and is no proper basis in the facts of this case to disregard the guideline judgment in Jurisic. A full-time custodial sentence should have been imposed. Failure to have done so involved disregard of clearly expressed community standards reflected in the legislative history culminating in s 52A. In Jurisic the Court approved and applied the following remarks of Hunt CJ at CL in Regina v Musumeci, CCA, unreported, 30 October 1997): 
      
       
        
        1. The legislature has always placed a premium upon human life, and the taking of a human life by driving a motor vehicle dangerously is to be regarded as a crime of some seriousness. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The real substance of the offence is not just the dangerous driving; it is the dangerous driving in association with the taking of a human life. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Such is the need for public detterence in this type of case, the youth of an offender is given less weight as a subjective matter than in other types of cases. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The courts must tread warily in showing leniency for good character in such cases. 
        
       
       
        
        5. So far as youthful offenders of good character who are guilty of dangerous driving, therefore, the sentence must be seen to have a reasonable proportionality to the objective circumstances of the crime, and persuasive subjective circumstances must not lead to inadequate weight being given to those objective circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        6. Periodic detention has a strong element of leniency built into it and, as presently administered, it is usually no more punitive than a community service order. 
        
       
       
        
       
     41    In my view, this Court should set aside the sentence imposed by the learned trial sentencing Judge. I have not overlooked the constraints involved in a Crown appeal, particularly one that seeks the imposition of a custodial sentence for the first time on a young offender who escaped such sentence at first instance. In Regina v Horne [1999] NSWCCA 391 I said: 
      
       
        
          
         
        Judges who turn a blind eye to an applicable guideline judgment must realise that a Crown appeal is very likely to succeed, with the consequence that the offender is placed into custody or returned to custody. The hardship that this imposes upon a young offender is manifest yet it is a necessary consequence of giving effect to proper sentencing principles. Misguided judicial kindness thus becomes unintended cruelty. 
        
       
       
        
       
     42    These remarks were approved recently by this Court in Regina v Harrison [2001] NSWCCA 79. 
     43    If the readiness of the young victim's family to offer forgiveness to the respondent and to empathise with the pain and sorrow he obviously feels is relevant - and on that I express no view - extreme caution would be required before giving it any weight. It should not have been determinative in the present case. The victim's family's attitude will doubtless be some comfort to the respondent, but it cannot over-reach the need for strong denunciation and general deterrence in response to the objective circumstances of this case. 
     44    The principle of appellate restraint in Crown appeals against sentence that passes under the misleading title of 'double jeopardy' requires the imposition of the minimum sentence necessary to vindicate proper sentencing principles in the particular case. 
     45    The task now before this Court is a particularly difficult one having regard to the events which have intervened including the lapse of time from when the respondent first came up for sentence in the District Court and the day on which the sentence under appeal was imposed. The respondent has already served part of the sentence of home detention. 
     46    Because of these matters, the objective circumstances (which are serious but not the worst case conceivable), the respondent's age at the time of the offence and the other subjective features I would propose that the sentence to be set by this Court is a sentence that will date from today and will be for a term of two years and nine months to be served by way of periodic detention. The term is fixed in recognition of the matters discussed in Regina v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67. 
     47    The reason why I have structured the sentence as one to commence from today is because of section 70 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which fixes a finite future period of time within which a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention order is to commence. Had it not been for section 70 then a sentence of three years dating from 2 February 2001 would have been the way that I would have adjusted for the situation in which this Court now finds itself. 
     48    Section 66 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 precludes the Court from making a periodic detention order unless satisfied of six stipulated matters. In light of the age of the offender and the material contained in the report of the Probation & Parole Service that was tendered in Court today I am so satisfied. 
     49    I would emphasise that this is not the sentence that should have been imposed at first instance or which I would have imposed at first instance. I have endeavoured to explain why a unique concatenation of circumstances makes it appropriate that in my opinion the sentence of imprisonment should be served by way of periodic detention. 
     50    The formal orders I would propose are: 
      
      1. Appeal allowed; 
       
      2. Sentence imposed in the District Court set aside; 
       
      3. In lieu the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for two years and nine months to date from 11 May 2001, such sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. 
       
     51    I should indicate that the Probation & Parole Service report indicates that vacancies exist at the Parramatta weekend facility and it is my intention that that is how the periodic detention will be served. 
     52    SULLY J: I regret that I am unable to join in the making of the orders proposed by his Honour the presiding Judge. In that regard I can say at once that I have no difficulty with his Honour’s definition of the relevant objective facts. I agree entirely that the case is a strong one on its subjective features. 
     53    It remains, however, the case that, for reasons which I shall presently endeavour to explain, I do not think that the consistent application of the existing body of relevant curial decisions, and the consistent and correct application of what is plainly a progressive hardening in the stance of the Legislature, will permit properly of the making of an order the effect of which is that the present respondent serves in a real sense no full-time custody at all. 
     54    I turn to a brief explanation of the reasoning that leads me to that conclusion. 
     55    I would wish to take up specifically but one matter touched upon in the reasons given by the learned Presiding Judge. The point has to do with the speculative opinion expressed in the decision in Glenn: that is to say, the speculative opinion there expressed as to the appropriateness of taking into account in some way or other favourable to the particular offender the fact that the particular victim's family has expressed forgiveness - rather than lack of forgiveness. 
     56    I pause to comment in particular about the matter, acknowledging that this is neither the time nor the place to attempt a definitive analysis of the proposition advanced in Glenn; but because it seems to me that if something is not said about it, it will acquire a momentum of its own until it becomes a precedent which the Court of Criminal Appeal will be expected to apply as of course in any case where a victim's family expresses, for whatever reason and in whatever circumstances, forgiveness. 
     57    It is, I think, relevant in connection with that question to consider what is, as I apprehend the law, the well-entrenched principle in a case where, so to speak, the shoe is on the other foot. There is a statute that requires sentencing Judges to take into account victim impact statements when they have been obtained and made available to the sentencing Court. The relevant statutory provision requires that the sentencing Court receive the victim impact statement; acknowledge that it has been received; and say, in terms, that it has been received and acknowledged. The ink was barely dry on the amendments which brought those provisions into operation, before clear statements were made in the Court of Criminal Appeal to the effect that it was not the law that a proper approach to the sentencing of a particular offender was to be affected in any substantial way at all by the unforgiving views, or the grief otherwise expressed, of the victims of the offender. 
     58    I confess that, as at present advised, I do not understand the logic of an approach which excludes rigidly an unforgiving attitude, but accepts some weight as being appropriate to be given to a forgiving attitude. In my opinion it is extremely dangerous to suggest any departure of any kind at all from the proposition that the views of the victim's relatives are not to affect substantially one way or the other the framing of a proper sentence.. 
     59    As I said a moment ago, this is neither the time nor the place to attempt a definitive statement in connection with the Glenn proposition; but I do not wish, by remaining silent, to give any indication that I accept the soundness in principle, or indeed the desirability in practice, of what is said in the relevant passages in the Glenn decision. 
     60    Turning to the more general propositions which I think ought to govern the outcome of the present appeal, I would take as a starting point two brief passages from the judgment of Lee CJ at CL in McIntyre (1998) 38 A Crim R 135 at 139. I do not propose to read passage after passage from reported cases; but these two passages I do propose to read because of what I see as their fundamental relevance to the present particular case. 
     61    His Honour said this,  
      
       
        
        “In dealing with the commission of a serious crime by a young man the courts make every effort, if it can properly be done, to avoid the penalty of gaol. But as against that, it must be said that when young men are able to hold licences at 17 years of age and drive their cars after drinking excessive quantities of alcohol, and at a high rate of speed as in this case, and cause death, no significant reason can be found for differentiating between their driving and that of persons who are older. Each is a potential killer on the roads. The lack of foresight in youth, the reckless spirit of youth will always be there and must always be recognised by courts, but that cannot, when punishment is under consideration, be recognised to the point of leading young drivers - who, regrettably, form a significant proportion of motor traffic offenders - to believe that an offence under s 52A resulting in death will lead to light punishment.” 
         
        
       
     62    His Honour said, further, this: 
      
       
        
        “But it must be said that this class of offence is one which in many, perhaps even in most, cases is committed by persons who are not in any sense members of the criminal class or who even have criminal convictions against them, and for that reason the courts need to tread warily in showing leniency for good character to avoid giving the impression that persons of good character may, by their irrepressible actions at the time, take the lives of others and yet receive lenient treatment.” 
        
       
       
     63    Those statements of principle were taken up and approved in terms by a differently constituted Bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the matter of Slattery (1996) 90 A Crim R 519, and in particular at 522 and 523. The Bench that decided Slattery consisted of Hunt CJ at CL, Studdert and Simpson JJ. 
     64    In December 1996 a differently constituted Bench of the Court, consisting on this occasion of the former Chief Justice, Gleeson CJ, McInerney J and me, dealt in a matter of Williams, NSWCCA 17 December 1996, with the propositions of which I have been speaking. What I said in that matter, and with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, is recorded at pages 386 and 387 of the report at 92 A Crim R 381 of the matter of Sellers, a matter decided by a Bench consisting of, once again, Hunt CJ at CL, Smart J and me. Because of the length of those passages I will not impose a reading of them on the Court; but I re-affirm what I said in that matter. 
     65    It will be observed that the citations of authority to which I have particularly referred extend as far back as 1988. Allowing, as one must of course always allow, that circumstances are always capable of altering cases, it seems to me to be nonetheless important, and very important in the context of a drunken or other irresponsible driving of motor vehicles, that there not be suffered to go abroad in any way an impression that the Court of Criminal Appeal is in any way weakening in its resolve to adhere to the principles so plainly stated from as long ago as 1988. 
     66    So much must be, as I respectfully think, completely clear to any District Court Judge, or if it comes to the point, to any primary sentencing Judge of this Court, who is called upon to deal with a matter involving that particular kind of criminal behaviour. 
     67    That being so, it is, I think, timely to add the following observation. 
     68    In the matter of Crotty (1994) NSWCCA 28 February 1994, a Bench of the Court comprising the former Chief Justice, Gleeson CJ, Newman J and me, had to deal with a situation in which a District Court Judge had, in effect, stepped around the need to impose a proper sentence of imprisonment by making, if I may so describe them, temporising orders which had the effect of referring to this Court the unpalatable task of doing what ought to have been done at first instance. 
     69    At page 9 of my judgment in that matter I made some observations about the need for primary sentencing Judges to understand the obligation to adhere punctiliously to guidance clearly given by judgments of, relevantly, the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
     70    The then Chief Justice and Newman J concurred in what was said. Once again, I will not impose upon the Court a reading of the passages, which are lengthy; but I will say that I think it timely to re-affirm them, and to buttress them by quoting two sentences from the speech of Lord Diplock in the matter of Broome & Cassel & Co 1972 AC 1131. It must be acknowledged that was a civil and not a criminal case, but the obligations that rest upon Courts in a hierarchical curial structure was very much an issue. His Lordship made these observations:  
      
       
        
        “It is inevitable in a hierarchical system of courts that there are decisions of the supreme appellate tribunal which do not attract the unanimous approval of all members of the judiciary…………………………………………. But the judicial system only works if someone is allowed to have the last word and if that last word, once spoken, is loyally accepted.” 
        
       
     71    In the present case, the easy part of the case is to define, and to feel a properly sympathetic response to, the subjective features of the respondent; but it seems to me to give a wholly disproportionate weight to those matters, important though they are in the proper scheme of things, to allow them to issue in a result which, as I said when I began these remarks, does not entail in any real sense full-time custody at all. 
     72    For the whole of the foregoing reasons, therefore, I would for my part allow the Crown appeal. I would quash the sentence passed in the Court below and set aside the home detention order. 
     73    I would pass a sentence of imprisonment for two years backdated to 2 February of this year. I would have regard to the exceptional subjective matters, and to the constraints to which the presiding Judge has referred, and which I acknowledge and accept; and would fix a non-parole period of eight months.74    That outcome would reflect two things; first that the time actually to be served in custody would have the character of what is sometimes described in the authorities as a short sharp shock; and, secondly, that it would not give the respondent what I am convinced is the entirely inappropriate leniency of a home detention order of any kind. 
     75    I would myself append to those orders recommendations appropriate to ensure both the prompt appropriate classification of the respondent; and his service of the custodial portion of his sentence in the Young Offenders Programme. 
     76    Should it prove that the views which I have expressed are the views of the majority of the Court, it will be easy enough to pick up the formalising of such recommendations. 
     77    They are the orders that I would favour. 
     78    DOWD J: I agree with the orders proposed by the learned Presiding Judge and for his reasons therefor. 
     79    MASON P: By majority the orders will be as indicated in my reasons.

     CRIMINAL LAW - forfeiture of property - Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth), s 48 - power of Court to exclude existing interest from forfeiture does not authorise the creation of a new interest for that purposeThe opponent was a prisoner in respect of whose property a restraining order was granted under s 43 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth). The prisoner sought to have the order varied to exclude two house properties and was partially successful before Donovan AJ who made an order under s 48 that an amount of $70,000 from those properties be excluded from forfeiture. The Director of Public Prosecutions sought leave to appeal.HELD, granting leave to appeal and allowing the appeal: (1) The only orders authorised by s 48(3) are orders under para (c) “to exclude the person’s interest from the [restraining] order”, namely the whole of that interest. The Court has not been given any power to create by order new interests in property in favour of an applicant. (2) The Judge rejected the prisoner’s application to exclude the whole of his interest in the relevant properties from the order and had no power to make an order creating a charge over those properties in his favour. (3) Section 48(1) only authorises orders which are incidental or supplemental to the restraining order. Such a power cannot support a substantive order of the kind made by the primary Judge. 
      
      ORDERS 
      
      
      (1) Leave to appeal granted on condition that the notice of appeal is filed within 14 days;

       DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS v RAYMOND JOSEPH KINGSWELL 
       
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1    PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with Handley JA. 
     2    MEAGHER JA: I have read the judgment of Handley JA. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and orders.3    HANDLEY JA: On 2 May 1994 the opponent (the prisoner) was charged with two indictable offences under the Customs Act relating to the importation of 4.5 kgs of heroin. On 6 May a restraining order based on those charges was granted under s 43 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth) (the Act) in respect of the whole of his property. On 31 January 1997 he was convicted by a jury of the offences and on 18 February he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 15 years 4 months. His appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and his application for special leave to appeal to the High Court, were dismissed. 
     4    On 26 March 1997 the prisoner filed a notice of motion seeking to have the restraining order varied under s 48(3) or (4) to allow him to recover his house properties at 21 England Avenue, Marrickville and 102 Tweedmouth Avenue, Eastlakes. Under s 30(1) property still bound by a restraining order is automatically forfeited to the Commonwealth six months after conviction on the charges which grounded the order, or at the end of that period as extended pursuant to s 30A. In this case the extended period expired on 30 April 1998. On 27 April the prisoner’s notice of motion came on for hearing before Donovan AJ who gave an extempore judgment on the 30th. 
     5    The Judge dismissed the prisoner’s application under s 48(4) but granted his application under s 48(3) in a limited form. Section 48(3) provides, so far as relevant: 
      
       
        
        “(3) Where: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a person (in this subsection called the defendant) has been convicted of … an offence; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a court, in reliance on the … charging … makes a restraining order against property; and; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) a person having an interest in the property applies to the court for a variation of the order to exclude the person’s interest from the order; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        the court shall grant the application if: 
        
       
       
        
         … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) in any case - the court is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so having regard to all the circumstances, including: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) any financial hardship or consequence of the interest remaining subject to the order; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) the seriousness of the offence; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (iii) the likelihood that the interest will be: 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           (A) …  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           (B) subject to s 30; or  
           
           
           (C) …”. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
     6    The Judge held that the circumstances which were relevant in considering whether the public interest required the granting of the application, were not limited to the matters specified in sub paras (i) to (iii). This was clearly correct because the paragraph refers to “all the circumstances” which include, but are not limited to, the matters referred to in the sub paragraphs and this has been recognised in the cases. The Judge said: 
      
       
        
        “… there is a significant public interest in the appropriate rehabilitation of prisoners upon their release, particularly in the circumstances of this prisoner who will be in his late 50’s or 60’s when he is finally released from jail … I think it is appropriate in the public interest that there be a fund to which the applicant can have access in order to get him started and perhaps to enable him to have, in his senior years, some financial security”. 
        
       
       
        
       
     7    He ordered: “that a proportion of the properties, being the Marrickville property and the Rosebery [Eastlakes] property representing an amount of $70,000 be released from the orders under s 48(1). I make that order bearing in mind the likely change in the value of money between now and the 15 or 20 years when the applicant may be released from prison”. 
     8    The order did not involve a matter at issue amounting to the value of $100,000 within s 101(2)(r) of the Supreme Court Act and the Director sought leave to appeal. He submitted that the Judge’s decision that the public interest required the making of such an order was contrary to the Act, and in particular its principal objects in s 3(1). 
     9    During argument one of the Judges asked the Director whether the Judge had power to create a new interest in property to be excluded from the forfeiture. The Director took up the point in further written submissions filed by leave. Since I am satisfied that there was no power to make such an order there is no need to deal with the public interest point. 
     10    Section 43(1) authorises the making of a restraining order against specified property of the defendant, all his property, or all his property other than specified property. It also authorises a restraining order against specified property of a person other than the defendant. Property is defined in s 4(1) as meaning: “real or personal property of every description .. whether tangible or intangible and includes an interest in any such real or personal property”. Interest is defined in relation to property as meaning: “(a) a legal or equitable estate or interest in the property; or (b) a right, power or privilege in connection with the property; whether present or future and whether vested or contingent”.  
     11    By s 43(2)(a) the Court may direct: “that the property, or such part of the property as is specified in the order” is not to be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person otherwise than as specified in the order and by sub para (b) it may direct the Official Trustee to take custody and control of the property, or of such part of the property as is specified in the order. Sub section (3) allows the Court to make orders for the payment out of the property, or a specified part of the property, of the person’s reasonable living expenses, the reasonable expenses of defending a criminal charge, and a specified debt incurred by that person in good faith. 
     12    Under s 30(1) it is the property that is subject to the restraining order that is forfeited to the Commonwealth if the conditions in that section are satisfied. Section 48(1) empowers the Court to make ancillary orders including: (a) an order varying the property to which the restraining order relates and (da) an order directing the owner, the defendant, or a director of a body corporate which is the owner, to provide a statement on oath setting out particulars of the property or dealings with the property of the owner or the defendant as the case may be. Where the restraining order directed the Official Trustee to take custody and control of property, orders may be made under para (e) regulating the manner in which the Official Trustee may exercise its powers or perform its duties, the Court may determine any question relating to the property to which the restraining order relates, or may direct the owner or any other person to do any act or thing necessary or convenient to enable the Official Trustee to take custody and control of the property. 
     13    The Court is given power to make orders excluding the interests of third parties from the scope of the restraining order. 
     14    Section 48(3) refers in para (b) to the existence of a restraining order “against property”. Paragraph (c) allows a person having “an interest in the property” to apply for a variation of the order “to exclude the person’s interest from the order”. The Court is to grant that application if, inter alia, the conditions in para (g) are satisfied. 
     15    The prisoner as the unencumbered owner of the properties had “an interest” in them and was a competent applicant. However the only orders authorised by s 48(3) are orders under para (c) “to exclude the person’s interest from the [restraining] order”, namely the whole of that interest. The Court has not been given any power to create by order new interests in property in favour of an applicant. As Allen J said of comparable legislation in R v Galek (1993) 70 A Crim R 252, 256: “[it] is an all or nothing jurisdiction”.  
     16    An applicant may have a limited interest in land, for example, as a tenant in common, lessee, mortgagee, or remainderman, and a restraining order in appropriate terms will bind that limited interest. Where personal property is in question and is naturally divisible (fungible) for example, cash, shares in companies, or credit balances in bank accounts (compare Manfred v Maddrell (1950) 51 SR (NSW) 95, 97), the court may well have power under s 48(3)(c) to exclude a divisible part of such property from the restraining order. No such question arises in this case and it can be left for decision if and when it does. 
     17    The Judge rejected the prisoner’s application to exclude the whole of his interest in these properties from the order, and had no power to make an order creating a charge over those properties in his favour. Similar legislation in The Crimes (Confiscation of Profits) Act 1985 (NSW) and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1991 (NZ) has received the same construction. See R v Bolger (1989) 16 NSWLR 115, 117, 124, 128, 129; R v Galek (1993) 70 A Crim R 252, 253-4, 256, 258; R v Dunsmuir [1996] 2 NZLR 1 CA and Lyall v Solicitor-General (1997) 2 NZLR 641, 647, 649 CA. There is a further difficulty. These properties were not forfeited to the Commonwealth until midnight on 30 April. When the order was made the prisoner was the owner and could have no separate charge over his own properties. 
     18    Counsel for the prisoner sought to rely on the general power in s 48(1) to make ancillary orders but this only authorises orders which are incidental or supplemental to the restraining order. See Woodcroft v DPP (2000) 174 ALR 60, 73 per Giles JA. Such a power cannot support a substantive order such as that in question here. 
     19    In my opinion therefore leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal allowed. The point was one of general importance in the administration of the Act and in all the circumstances there should be no order as to costs. 
     20    The following formal orders should be made: 
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted on condition that the notice of appeal is filed within 14 days; 
       
       
      (2) Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      (3) No order as to costs.

      Regina v Kevin Phillip GRIFFITHS 
       
     The applicant was convicted for the offence of armed robbery in company. He was sentenced to six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence on the grounds that (1) the sentencing Judge did not take into account the fact that the applicant was on bail for two years before being sentenced; (2) the applicant was addicted to heroin at the time of the offence; (3) neither psychological or pre-sentence reports were prepared; (4) the offence was out of character; (5) the complainant tainted her evidence; (6) the applicant was at the crossroads; (7) the applicant had rehabilitated since sentence. HELD: (Leave to appeal granted. Appeal dismissed):Ground 1: applicant was on bail for two years before being sentencedThe applicant did not point to any prejudice occasioned by the delay, or to any oppressiveness attributable to that fact or to the need to comply with strict bail conditions, that would justify mitigation of sentence. Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517; Blanco (1999) NSWCCA 121 applied.Ground 2: fact that applicant was addicted to heroinAddiction to narcotics may provide a reason for the commission of an offence, but it does not excuse the criminality or provide any reason for mitigation of sentence. Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 applied. Ground 3: Neither psychological or pre-sentence reports were preparedThe fact that the applicant chose not to place such material before the Court on sentence cannot be relied upon on appeal. Ground 4: Offence was out of characterThe applicant had an extensive prior record for offences of dishonesty and breaking into premises. This was not the case of a first offender. Ground 5: complainant tainted her evidenceThe complainant gave evidence before the jury which was obviously accepted. There is no basis for concluding that the verdict was unsupported. Ground 6: Applicant at the crossroadsWhere a person has reached the cross roads at the time of sentence this is a matter to be taken into account. The applicant had made some efforts at rehabilitation, however, this was not a case where the applicant was the ‘crossroads’.Salemah NSWCCA, 9 June 1994; Dawson (2000) NSWCCA 433 applied.Ground 7: Rehabilitation since sentenceEvents occurring post-conviction, with a few limited exceptions are not normally to be considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal. That power is concerned with whether the sentence passed at first instance was correct according to law and whether it was excessive or not. The judicial power of the Court needs to be distinguished from the executive power available to deal with most circumstances which arise post- sentence.

       REGINA v KEVIN PHILLIP GRIFFITHS  
       
        
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
        
     1   WOOD CJ AT CL: On 9 December 1997 the applicant, who appeared this morning in person, was convicted at trial for the offence of robbery in company (s 97 of the Crimes Act). He was sentenced to six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years. 
     2   He now seeks leave to appeal against the severity of that sentence by relying on a number of grounds which were specified in his written application for leave to appeal.  
      
       
      Facts 
       
     3   The applicant, together with a female companion, entered the premises of the victim at Budgewoi both wearing balaclavas. The applicant was carrying a pistol which turned out to be a replica pistol and the female was carrying a nife. The victim was taken into the kitchen by the female with a knife held either against or close to her throat. In the kitchen her handbag was located and taken. She was then forced back into the bedroom where the applicant removed jewellery from her hands and neck. Both offenders then left the house and the police were summonsed. 
     4   When they arrived they found that a light bulb from the front porch had been removed. Fingerprints of the accomplice were found at the premises. 
     5   It was the applicant’s case at trial that he went to those premises for the purposes of obtaining amphetamines, and that while there he was threatened by another person with a pistol. He said that he became involved in a struggle, in the course of which the victim's handbag, in some fashion, became wrapped around his hand and was then accidentally taken away by him. The Crown case, as his Honour properly observed, was a strong case and it was not at all surprising that the applicant's version of events was rejected by the jury. 
     6   I turn then to the grounds of appeal which the applicant seeks to raise. 
      
      Ground 1. The applicant was on bail for two years before being sentenced. 
       
     7   There were some delays of an administrative kind before the matter was listed for trial. These related, in part, to the fact that on several occasions the matter was not reached. Additionally, as a result of the applicant having been granted bail pending trial, the listing of his case had relatively low priority.  
     8   The applicant has not pointed to any prejudice occasioned by the delay, or to any oppressiveness attributable to that fact or to the need for his compliance with strict bail conditions, that would justify mitigation of sentence for the reasons mentioned in Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 and 519 and also in Blanco (1999) NSWCCA 121. 
     9   So far as the applicant asserts that there was a change in his attitude to his life, and a desire to rehabilitate himself over the period between arrest and trial, that is a matter which is hardly supported by the fact that he chose to go to trial in the face of a strong Crown case. In any event, this factor appears to have been fully appreciated by his Honour, and taken into account in imposing what he considered to be a lenient sentence in light of the judgment in this Court in Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. The principles in Kavich (1993) NSWCCA 26 October 1993 do not therefore apply. This ground has not been made good. 
      
      Ground 2. The applicant should have received consideration for the fact that he was addicted to heroin, and to other narcotics, at the time of the offence. 
       
     10   For the reasons noted in Henry addiction to narcotics may provide a reason for the commission of robbery type offences but it does not excuse such form of criminality, nor does it provide any reason for mitigation of sentence. The present offence was particularly serious so far as it involved the use of a replica pistol and a knife, so far as it occurred in the victim's home at night, and so far as it involved planning in the course of which the offenders disguised themselves with balaclavas and disabled a porch light. This ground is not made good. 
      
       
      Ground 5. Neither psychological nor pre-sentence reports were prepared. 
       
     11   The applicant was legally represented at the trial, and during the sentencing proceedings a report from Dr Orgas, as to his progress while on methadone, was tendered. The applicant also gave evidence. He had the opportunity of placing any further material of relevance before the Court. The fact that he chose not to do so cannot now be relied upon, since the sentencing judge was obliged to sentence him on the material which was tendered. This ground is not made good. 
      
       
      Ground 7. The offence was totally out of character. 
       
     12   The applicant had an extensive prior record for offences of dishonesty and breaking into premises. He had repeatedly been given the benefit of non-custodial sentences but by persistently reoffending he had demonstrated an attitude of disregard for the law. This is not a case of a first offender or of someone who had previously had a record of little moment. This ground is not made good. 
      
       
      Ground 9. The complainant tainted her evidence. 
       
     13   This appears to involve the submission that the victim gave untrue evidence, by reason of the fact that the applicant allegedly owed her money. The jury obviously believed her evidence and rejected that of the applicant. There is no basis for concluding that the verdict was unsupported, or that her Honour misunderstood or incorrectly determined the facts appropriate for sentence. This ground has not been made good. 
      
       
      Grounds 3 and 10. Applicant at the crossroads. 
       
     14   The applicant submitted that as a result of the birth of his son his focus and attitude to life had changed, and that he had reached the crossroads at the time he appeared for sentence. Where a case answers that description, then it clearly is a matter to be taken into account: Salemah NSW CCA 9 June 1994, and Dawson (2000) NSWCCA 433. His Honour in fact accepted that the applicant had made some efforts to rehabilitate himself and, based upon that conclusion, found that there were circumstances justifying a reduction of the non-parole period. Although the applicant claimed that he had stayed out of prison for ten years before the offence, that is not an entirely accurate statement of his rehabilitation since he has, since 1990, appeared in Court on nine separate occasions for a variety of offences, including offences of dishonesty, malicious damage, and larceny, for which non-custodial sentences had been imposed. 
     15   The applicant, who is 37 years of age, did not show himself convincingly to be at the crossroads and the sentence imposed was entirely within a proper exercise of sentencing discretion, particularly since he had failed to respond to the more lenient options that had been made available to him in the past. This ground is also not made good. 
      
       
      Grounds 4, 6 and 11. Rehabilitation since sentence. 
       
     16   Under these grounds the applicant seeks to raise several matters arising post-conviction, including the fact that he has rediscovered his mother and that he has completed various courses, including a methadone programme, while in custody. Events occurring post-conviction, with a few limited exceptions, are not normally the province of this Court when it exercises its appellate judicial power. That power is concerned with the question whether the sentence passed at first instance was correct according to law, and relevantly here whether it was excessive or not (see Munday (1981) 2 NSWLR 177 at 178 and Vachalec (1981) 1 NSWLR 351. The judicial power which this Court possesses needs to be distinguished from the executive power which is available to deal with most circumstances which arise post-sentence. In any event, it seems to me that the progress made by the applicant does no more than show that he is doing what was expected of him by the rehabilitative phase of sentencing. This ground is also not made good. 
     17   For all these reasons I would accordingly grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal. 
     18   SMART AJ: I agree. 
     19   WOOD CJ AT CL: The order of the Court then is as I have proposed.

      JUDGMENT 
     The applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to one count of supplying the prohibited drug heroin, an offence for which the maximum penalty prescribed under s 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 is imprisonment for fifteen years or a fine of $220, 000. The applicant was sentenced to sixteen months imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months. The applicant appeals against the sentence imposed on the grounds that (1) the trial judge was in error in finding that no “special circumstances” existed. Held: (Appeal allowed):Ground 1: The trial judge failed to take into account “special circumstances” of the applicantThere was a measure of misunderstanding on the part of the sentencing judge in relation to special circumstances. The trial judge’s reasoning was not directed to the existence of subjective or other reasons that might have justified an adjustment of the proportion between the head sentence and the non-parole period. The relevant subjective circumstances show that the applicant was of a relatively young age and had made positive steps towards removing himself from the drug scene. It was in the interest of the applicant and the community that he be encouraged on the path of rehabilitation and for that reason that he be afforded the opportunity for an extended period of post release supervision.

       REGINA v MIKEL GUIRGIS 
       
        
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to one count of supplying the prohibited drug heroin, an offence for which the maximum penalty prescribed under S 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act is imprisonment for fifteen years or a fine of $220,000. He was sentenced to sixteen months imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months. 
     2   The applicant was arrested shortly after he was seen speaking to another man who had walked up to his motor vehicle at Arncliffe, in the early hours of 3 March 2000. After a short conversation, that other man walked away. When police spoke to the applicant, he was found to have in his possession $580 in cash and 33 balloons containing a total of 5.5 grams of heroin. He asserted that he had resorted to the sale of drugs to assist with his heroin habit. This was his first arrest, however, for a drug offence. He had a relatively minor record for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and for some driving offences, which had been dealt with by community service and fines. 
     3   His Honour found that the balloons were in his possession for sale and that their possession by him was not just an isolated happening. So much was supported by the applicant's evidence to the effect that he had sold drugs to support his own habit. His Honour took into account the early plea as evidence of contrition and as having a utilitarian value. He declined to fix special circumstances apparently by reference to the nature of the offence. 
     4   The applicant accepts that the aggregate sentence was within range - as it clearly was - since this was a serious offence. He contends that his Honour, however, erred in his approach to ""special circumstances"" and in particular in not finding them to exist.  
     5   It does appear there was a measure of misunderstanding on the part of the sentencing judge so far as the exchange which occurred with Counsel in relation to ""special circumstances,"" seems to have turned solely upon whether a supply offence could be properly dealt with by a non-custodial sentence, or by the passing of a lesser sentence than that which his Honour had in mind. It was not directed to the existence of subjective or other reasons that might have justified an adjustment of the proportion between the head sentence and the non-parole period specified by S 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Because of the approach taken, his Honour effectively cut off the debate with the result that he did not have the benefit of any submissions from counsel directed to this aspect of the case. 
     6   Since his Honour appears not to have addressed the correct question, I would grant leave to appeal and consider the matter afresh. 
     7   The relevant subjective circumstances, identified from the applicant's evidence, show that he: 
      
      a) Was 24 years of age. 
       
       
      b) Had never previously been in custody, although he had a minor record for offences not involving drugs. 
       
       
      c) Had first consumed drugs in January 2000. 
       
       
      d) Had become addicted to smoking heroin, having a habit costing him in the order of $80 per day. 
       
       
      e) Had resorted to the sale of drugs to feed that habit. 
       
       
      f) Had been in employment during the preceding five years but was unemployed at the time of his arrest. 
       
       
      g) Had ceased to use drugs after his arrest and had disassociated himself from his previous company which was unsavoury. 
       
       
      h) Had been in full time employment as a painter for the three months preceding the date on which he appeared for sentence, and had plans to establish his own painting business, or otherwise had permanent employment to which he could return. 
       
       
      i) His parents were elderly and of ill-health who were unaware that he was facing sentence. 
       
       
      j) He had pleaded guilty from the outset although his conviction, it must be said, was inevitable. 
       
       
      k) He demonstrated contrition. 
       
        
         
          
            
          
         
        
       
     8   A presentence report confirmed that his prospects of employment were “good” and added that, if released under supervision by the Probation and Parole Service, he would be encouraged to maintain his new lifestyle. That report also noted that he would benefit from the programmes which it provided to address self esteem and stress management issues. 
     9   The simple issue which arises for this Court is whether the circumstances outlined were such as to justify a reduction of the non-parole period. In my view, what was important in the present case was the relatively young age of the applicant, and the fact that he had made positive steps toward removing himself from the drug scene. While this offence was serious, and justified a term of imprisonment, it was in his interest, as well as in the interest of the community, that he be encouraged to continue upon that path of rehabilitation, and for that reason, that he be afforded the opportunity for an extended period of post release supervision, in accordance with the philosophy mentioned in R v Moffatt (1990) 20 NSWLR 144 and R v Phelan (1999) 66 ACrimR 446. 
     10   For these reasons I would propose that the appeal be granted and that the nonparole period be reduced to one of eight months to expire on 4 August 2001. Otherwise the sentence imposed should, in my view, be confirmed. I would direct the release of the applicant at the expiration of the nonparole period. 
     11   SMART AJ: I agree. 
     12   WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the court will be as I have proposed.

      WENTWORTH SHIRE COUNCIL v SALLY INCH JOSLYN & ANOR 
      
     FACTS 
     The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor car accident near Wentworth, N.S.W. The accident occurred while the plaintiff’s car was being driven by Miss Joslyn, the first respondent, and he was a passenger. Both the plaintiff and Joslyn had attended a party the night before the accident and had been drinking heavily. After only a few hours sleep, they drove into Mildura to get breakfast. The plaintiff drove most of the way. On the return trip, Joslyn took over the driving. She did not have a driver’s license and had not driven for over 3 years. She lost control on a bend in the road and crashed the car severely. There were no road signs on the approach to, or on the bend. The road was under the control of Wentworth Shire Council.  
     At trial, the plaintiff successfully sued Joslyn and Wentworth Shire Council. The plaintiff was held guilty of contributory negligence to the extent of 25%. Wentworth Shire Council appealed from this decision on two bases; they asserted that they were not responsible for the road where the accident occurred, and challenged the finding of negligence made against them. In a separate appeal heard concurrently, the plaintiff appealed against the finding of contributory negligence. He also sought leave to file a further amended Notice of Appeal arguing that the District Court jurisdiction was not limited to $750,000. Joslyn cross appealed, submitting that the assessment of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence was inadequate.HELD per Meagher JA (Priestley JA & Ipp AJA agreeing):(i) At the time of the accident, the power to maintain and control the road resided in Wentworth Shire Council. The Council constructed the curve in its present form; failure to erect appropriate signage when the Council was constructing the curve therefore constituted misfeasance not nonfeasance. (ii) There is no basis to review the trial judge’s finding that the Council was negligent in failing to erect signage on the approach to the curve; either a sign indicating the oncoming curve, or additionally a sign setting a lower speed limit. (iii) The contributory negligence of the plaintiff should be reduced from 25% to 0%. There is no evidence that either the plaintiff or Joslyn were drunk at the time of the accident and no evidence that the plaintiff had reason to believe Joslyn was affected by intoxication. (iv) There is no substance to the “joint illegal activity” defence asserted by the Council. This is not a case where the object of the parties’ action was itself illegal, nor was it a case where the plaintiff goaded Joslyn into breaking the law. (v) Leave for the plaintiff to file a further amended Notice of Appeal refused.

      WENTWORTH SHIRE COUNCIL v SALLY INCH JOSLYN & ANOR 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1   PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with Meagher JA 
     2   MEAGHER JA: These are two appeals (and a cross-appeal) arising out of judgments and verdicts given by Boyd Boland DCJ on 5 November 1999 arising out of an accident which occurred on a road near Wentworth (which is in the south-west of New South Wales) on 27 October 1996. It occurred towards the end of a drinking binge of heroic proportions. It took place on a road called Reserve Road East, close to the intersection of that road and Hollands Lake Road. Hollands Lake Road itself branches out from Silver City Highway. 
     3   The plaintiff, Mr Berryman, who was very seriously injured, sued two defendants: Miss Sally Inch Joslyn and Wentworth Shire Council. His Honour found both defendants liable and awarded damages as follows: Miss Joslyn, $1,995,086 (calculated according to the Motor Accidents Act (1988) and the Wentworth Shire Council $2,505,311 (calculated on common law principles). His Honour also found that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, which he assessed at 25%. Judgments were then entered as followed: Miss Joslyn $1,496,314, the Council $750,000 (the limit to the District Court jurisdiction, as the plaintiff’s advisers had not obtained a consent order to unlimited jurisdiction). As between the two defendants, his Honour apportioned liability 10% to the Council and 90% to Miss Joslyn. 
     4   Hollands Park Road is a smallish road which runs between either bush or farming properties. It runs, as I have said, from Silver City Highway to another small road called Reserve Road East. Travelling up Hollands Lake Road to Reserve Road East one passes on one’s left another road which enters Hollands Lake Road at a T-intersection. The distance from that intersection to the curve which leads into Reserve Road East is not great. 
     5   The act of negligence on behalf of the Council which his Honour found had been made out was its failure to erect adequate signage before one arrived at the curve - either a sign indicating that a curve was coming up, or alternatively that sign combined with another sign setting a lower speed limit. There was much evidence, both expert and lay, that to turn the curve without fully realising what was involved was a hazardous operation. The curve was what the experts called a “compound curve”. On entering the initial part of the curve and passing into the central position, which appears partially to straighten, the inexperienced driver would gain a false sense of security about the curvature of the following section, and thus be unprepared for the very tight radius that followed. This, his Honour found, was what happened to Miss Joslyn. 
     6   However, before one can say that the Council was negligent in this regard, one must first conclude that it had either the duty to erect such signage, or at least the power to do so. Mr Garling SC, learned senior counsel for the Council, maintained, both below and on appeal, that the Council had neither duty nor power. At first sight this seems an odd submission, because normally a public road is vested in the local council, which has a vast range of powers in respect of it - including the power to erect signs. 
     7   There was no question but that the road was treated by everyone as if it was a public road. Nobody could point to any documentary evidence of dedication, but there were no physical barriers to its use, and, for as long as anybody could remember, it was used by about 200 motor cars a day as if by right, and long-continued public use permits an inference of dedication. 
     8   A number of documents were placed before the Court dealing with this topic. Of these, the most important of which was a report of the celebrated Mr Roy Ringrose dated 16 August 1999. It transpires from that that the land in question fell within the Coomealla Irrigation Area, where boundaries were fixed in 1924-1926. At this stage, the roads were formed (although apparently not tarred) and were, it would seem, Crown lands. The land was then vested in the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission, which, in accordance with the practice of this State, changed its name and identity on many occasions. The fee simple seems to have ended up being vested in a body carrying the grandiose title Lower Murray Irrigation Area Limited. 
     9   The most important document for determining the status of the relevant roads is Act No. 26 of 1944, ss 11I (2) and (3), which are in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        (2) The provisions of this section, unless the context or subject-matter otherwise indicates or requires, shall apply only to and in respect of those portions of the Coomealla Irrigation Area and the Curlwaa Irrigation Area which have been or which may hereafter be included in a municipality or shire. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Any land in the Wentworth Municipality within the Coomealla Irrigation Area or the Curlwaa Irrigation Area at the commencement of the Irrigation and Water (Amendment) Act, 1944, which has before such commencement been defined, reserved or left as a road within any subdivision of Crown lands or lands vested in the Commission as indicated on the official plans of the same, shall be deemed to be a public road for the purposes of sections two hundred and forty to two hundred and seventy-five (both inclusive) and section two hundred and seventy-seven of the Local Government Act, 1919, as amended by subsequent Acts, but any portion of such land occupied by a canal, channel or drain under the control of the Commission shall be deemed not to be a part of the road. 
        
       
       
     10   By proclamation under the Municipalities Act 1867, published in the Government Gazette of 23/1/1878, the Municipality of Wentworth was constituted to serve an “area of about 21,940 acres”. That was the area around the town of Wentworth itself. The boundaries of the Municipality were extended by two further notifications in the Gazette, and, by the second of these notifications (on 15 December 1950) the lands under discussion came within the boundaries of the Municipality. By yet another notification in the Gazette the land was included within the boundaries of a new local government body, the Shire of Wentworth. 
     11   It would seem that the roads in question were sealed at some time between 1926 and 1961. It is impossible to be more precise. 
     12   What is important for present purposes is not where the fee simple is vested but where the right to control and maintain the road resides. The combination of the various sections referred to in subsection (3) of s 11I, of Act No 26 of 1944 deal with those powers to control and maintain roads. Mr Garling SC, learned senior counsel for the Council, submitted that subsection (3) did not apply to the subject land because it had not been included in any municipality or shire at the commencement of the 1944 Act, as it first became included in a Municipal area in 1951. However, that submission, as was pointed out to us by Mr Gross QC, learned senior counsel for the plaintiff, overlooks the plain words of subsection (2), which gives subsection (3) an ambulatory effect. The consequence is that at first the Municipality and then the Shire had the power to control and maintain the roads since 1951 and 1957 respectively. 
     13   Add to that the fact that lay evidence established that Council workmen did exercise those powers. A Mr Gooding, who had been employed by the Wentworth Shire Council for 29 years, said that he had graded the corner of the road in question about three times in ten years, he did grading work on the shouldering of the curve. Mr Smyth, a local farmer whose property adjoins the accident site, gave evidence that he had seen the Council’s employees working on the corner of the road where Mr Berryman eventually came to grief. Mr Nunan, a former member of the Shire Council, said that after 1960 the Council did a great deal of work sealing the road. 
     14   There was evidence that rival bodies, if I may use that expression, did not construct the curve, neither the Road Traffic Authority or the Lower Murray Irrigation Areas Limited (or its predecessor) can be held responsible. The Council led no evidence on the question. There is therefore no argument against his Honour’s finding that the Council constructed the curve in its present form. Once this fact is established, there cannot, in my view, be any question but that failure to erect appropriate signage when the Council was constructing the curve constituted misfeasance not nonfeasance. 
     15   That in the state it was in at the date of the accident it was extremely dangerous is quite clear. The locals said so. So did the experts. Nobody really denied it. 
     16   I shall now revert to the events of October 1996. Mr Berryman and some of his friends had done some drinking on 25 October 1996. The triggering event for this merriment was the approaching 21st birthday of a friend of the plaintiff’s, Mr Rowan Crisp. He was to have a party on 26 October to celebrate this event at the house of his parents, who lived at the end of Reserve Road East at Dareton, New South Wales. Miss Joslyn was bidden to attend by Mr Berryman, who arranged to meet her there. Miss Joslyn travelled to the party in the company of three of her women friends - Miss Katherine Dean, Miss Angela Healy and Miss Michelle Polkinghorne, in a motor car driven by Miss Dean. Miss Joslyn took with her to the party a bottle of Grants Scotch Whisky (which she seemed to demolish that night, perhaps without anyone else’s assistance). Her companions took with them equivalent liquor supplies of their own. Miss Joslyn and her friends arrived at the party between 6.30 and 7.30 pm. 
     17   Mr Berryman arrived some time later, at about 9.30. The party went on for many hours. The consumption of alcohol seems to have been the principal event in the party. In traditional Australian manner, the men and the women did their drinking in two separate groups, apart from each other, although Mr Berryman did, gallantly, spend some moments drinking with, and talking to, Miss Joslyn. From the moment Mr Berryman and his friends arrived, they all intended to spend the night at the Crisps. They all caroused long after midnight. 
     18   Miss Joslyn drank heavily, and by 4.30am was seen “quite drunk and staggering about”. Most of the other guests were in like case. Mr Berryman was found by his Honour to be quite drunk. He did not know when that event took place but thought it might be about 4.00 am. It must have been later than that, because Miss Joslyn went to bed before he did, and that did not take place, according to Miss Healy, before 5 or 5.30am. 
     19   At about 4.00 or 4.30 am one of the guests, a Mr Ross Nokes, took the keys out of the ignition of Mr Berryman’s motor car, which was a 1987 Toyota Hilux Utility of unknown colour. He gave them to Miss Joslyn, who had asked for them. At about 7.00 am, after the pair by then had enjoyed no more that 3 hours sleep, they went together to Mildura for breakfast, in Mr Berryman’s car and he driving. They drove then, taking about 15 minutes, without incident. They bought food at McDonalds and took it to eat at a park on the banks of the river. Having eaten, they decided to return to the Crisp party. They took the route from Mildura via the Silver City Highway to Hollands Lake Road and then to Reserve Road East. The return drive should also have taken about 15 minutes. Mr Berryman, of course, continued driving. The weather was fine, there was little if any cloud, and the road was dry. 
     20   When they turned into Hollands Lake Road, Miss Joslyn noticed that Mr Berryman was dozing off to sleep, and said something to him. He replied “Well, you drive the car then”. At the time of this conversation he: 
      
       
        
        (a) was the owner of the vehicle and would not let anyone drive his vehicle without his permission; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) knew that he’d been drinking the evening before and knew that he could still be under the influence of the alcohol; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) knew that Joslyn had been drinking the night before; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) knew Joslyn did not have a driver’s licence; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) knew that the handling characteristics of the vehicle gave it a propensity to roll; 
        
       
       
        
        (f) knew that he was driving on public roads; 
        
       
       
        
        (g) knew the effects of alcohol had an adverse effect on the ability of a driver to manoeuvre a vehicle; 
        
       
       
        
        (h) knew it was against the law to permit an unlicensed driver to drive a motor vehicle on a road; 
        
       
       
        
        (i) knew it was illegal to permit someone who was drunk to drive a motor vehicle on a public road; 
        
       
       
        
         and 
         
        (j) knew that he was in no fit state to be driving; 
         
        
       
      At the same time, Miss Joslyn knew: 
       
       
        
        (a) she did not hold a driver’s license; 
         
         
        (b) she had not driven for over 3 years; 
         
         
        (c) she had known that the plaintiff had been drinking at the Crisps; 
         
         
        (d) knew that it was an offence for her to drive a vehicle with a blood alcohol level in excess of the legal limit; 
         
         
        (e) that she could still be over the legal permissible blood alcohol limit if she had been drinking at a party the night before; 
         
         
        (f) that the speedometer in the vehicle was not working; 
         
         
        (g) she had very little sleep in the 12 hours prior to the accident; 
         
         
        (h) she had not been anticipating that she would be asked to drive; 
         
         
        (i) knew that the Plaintiff was fatigued and falling asleep at the wheel; 
         
         
        (j) knew that driving a vehicle while intoxicated or fatigued could place Joslyn and others in danger. 
        
       
       
      After she took over driving, they went for about one kilometre along Hollands Lake Road. She had never driven this vehicle before, but had driven others like it. She did not know what the speed limit was in Hollands Lake Road; it would not have made much difference if she did, as the speedometer was not working. She passed the T-sign without noticing it, and made towards the curve, and then the accident happened. She does not remember anything after approaching the curve. On the evidence, his Honour held that she rounded the corner, not by any means at an excessive speed, but at a speed which meant that she, in the condition in which she was that morning, could not control the vehicle as it moved into the dangerous parts of the curve. A traffic-engineering report from Mr R Stuart-Smith, which his Honour accepted, concluded that (a) the speed at which Miss Joslyn was actually travelling was between 60 and 70 kph, (b) the “free speed” (ie the speed limit) was 100 kph, (c) the “critical speed” (ie the maximum speed which can be travelled round the curve) was 75kph, and (d) the “advisory speed” (ie the speed at which a prudent driver ought drive) was 45-50 kph. She said, and his Honour believed her, that if there were signage indicating an oncoming curve (especially if it were accompanied by a sign lowering the maximum speed), she would have absorbed its message and managed the curve. In these circumstances, I would not favour reviewing his Honour’s conclusion that the Council was negligent. 
       
     21   His Honour, as I have said, made a finding of 25% contributory negligence against the plaintiff. The only action of his which could possibly have amounted to contributory negligence was permitting Miss Joslyn to drive instead of him. In this regard, one must view matters as they stood at the time of handing over control of the car, (not as they were in the previous 24 hours), a task which his Honour did not really undertake. One must also, if one concludes that at the time of handing over Mr Berryman was too drunk to appreciate what was happening, a situation as to which there is no evidence in the present case, judge the question of contributory negligence on the hypothesis that the plaintiff did have sufficient foresight to make reasonable judgments. But, although at the time of the accident the blood alcohol levels of Miss Joslyn and Mr Berryman were estimated as being 0.138g/100ml and 0.19g/100ml respectively, there is no evidence that either of them were drunk at the time, and certainly no evidence that at the time Mr Berryman had any reason to think that Miss Joslyn was affected by intoxication. Indeed, quite to the contrary. Of the people who were present who gave evidence, all said that Miss Joslyn showed no signs of intoxication. His Honour so found. Despite, therefore, one’s reluctance to overrule a trial judge’s finding on apportionment (Podrebersk v Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd (1985) 59 ALJR 492), it seems quite impossible to justify his Honour’s conclusion on contributory negligence. I would be in favour of reducing it from 25% to 0%. 
     22   In considering whether what Mr. Garling SC called the defence of “joint illegal activity” was made out, as he strongly submitted it was, one must consider that factual background which I have just endeavoured to outline. One must add to it two further facts which his Honour found to be justified on the evidence: (a) at the time he commenced drinking, Mr Berryman had no intention to get drunk, and (b) at no time during the evening’s drinking did he have any reason to suppose that he and Miss Joslyn (or he and any other person, for that matter) would be driving to Mildura early in the morning. One must also add to all those facts that there is no evidence at all that he and Miss Joslyn entered into any sort of contract to indulge in a drunken driving exhibition. This is not a case where the object of the parties’ action was in itself illegal (like, for example, robbing a bank or stealing a motor car); there is (unfortunately) no criminal offence involved in eating at McDonalds, and certainly none involved in driving home. Nor was it a case where Mr Berryman, knowing Miss Joslyn was drunk, goaded her into breaking the law (Cusack v Stayt (2000) 31 MVR 517). At no point does this so-called defence of “joint illegal activity” make any sense. 
     23   One final matter must be considered. His Honour would have given Mr Berryman a verdict against the Council in the sum of $2,505,311 were it not for the fact that the District Court was not exercising unlimited jurisdiction in the matter. However the figure was reduced to $750,000. At the heel of the hunt, Mr M Williams SC, learned senior counsel for Mr Berryman, sought to file a further amended Notice of Appeal arguing that the District Court jurisdiction was not limited to $750,000. I do not think that leave should be granted. The parties chose the battlefield, and should stick to it. Particularly is this so when the Council may have conducted itself differently had the point been taken early. From Mr Berryman’s point of view, this is, of course, most unfortunate; and even more so when one contemplates that things could have been otherwise if steps had been taken to ensure that the Court’s jurisdiction was unlimited. 
     24   The orders which I propose are as follows: 
      
       
        
        1. In the appeal Wentworth Shire Council v Sally Inch Joslyn and Alan Troy Berryman, appeal dismissed with costs. 
         
         
        2. In the appeal Alan Troy Berryman v Sally Inch Joslyn and Wentworth Shire Council, appeal allowed; judgment below set aside. Verdict entered for the appellant against the first respondent in the amount of $1,995,086.36 and against the second respondent in the amount of $750,000. 
         
         
        3. In the cross appeal Sally Inch Joslyn v Alan Troy Berryman, appeal dismissed with costs. 
        
       
       
        
        4. Leave sought by the plaintiff to file a further amended Notice of Appeal refused.

      The Commissioner of Police sought leave to appeal from a decision of O’Keefe J (reported as Barbaro v Director of Public Prosecutions (1999) 49 NSWLR 68) quashing a warrant to use a listening device granted by Dowd J under the Listening Devices Act 1984 on 15 December 1997.The plaintiffs challenged the warrant on two grounds: firstly, that the person fitted with the listening device had not been named by the warrant as an authorised user; and secondly, that the warrant failed to comply with s 16(4)(c) of the Act which requires the warrant to specify the period during which it is in force. A typographical error in the warrant resulted in it purporting to be in force from “4.30 pm on 15 December 1997 until 4.30 pm on 4 January 1997”.O’Keefe J rejected the first ground but accepted the second ground and ordered that the warrant be quashed.HELD, granting leave to appeal and allowing the appeal: (1) O’Keefe J was correct in rejecting the argument about the authorised user of the device for the reasons he gave; (2) Unlike a search warrant, a warrant under the Act does not have to be produced to persons whose premises are about to be entered and searched and hence there is not the same necessity for such a warrant to be clear on its face; (3) A false description does not vitiate if there is sufficient certainty and in this case no one who was required to act on, and comply with, the warrant could possibly have been misled. The second date was obviously intended to be 4 January 1998.

       COMMISSIONER OF POLICE v PASQUALE BARBARO & ORS 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1    PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with Handley JA on both questions argued in this appeal. 
     2    The second question was whether the warrant challenged in this case was invalid because it specified that it should be in force from “... 15 December 1997 until ... 4 January 1997”. The second “1997” was obviously a mistake for “1998”. In his reasons Handley JA refers to rules of interpreting documents which authorise courts to read a mistake such as that in the present case as conveying the intended meaning if that meaning is sufficiently clear in the circumstances. In some cases the application of the rules is more straightforward than in others. In the more difficult cases an act of judgment by the court must be made. A mistake like that in this case in the date for execution in a death warrant might well be given a more literal interpretation than the same mistake in a warrant for a less grave purpose. 
     3    In the circumstances of the present case I think Handley JA is justified in taking into account the various considerations he specifies in his reasons as leading to the conclusion that “1997” should be read as “1998” and that the mistake does not invalidate the warrant. 
     4    I agree with the orders proposed by Handley JA. 
     5    MEAGHER JA: I agree with Handley JA.6    HANDLEY JA: On 26 November 1999 O’Keefe J ordered that a warrant granted by Dowd J under the Listening Devices Act (the Act) on 15 December 1997 be quashed. The Commissioner of Police sought leave to appeal and the parties agreed that the hearing of the summons for leave should be treated as the hearing of the appeal in the event that the Court decided to grant leave. The opponents filed a notice of contention in respect of the issues on which they had failed. 
     7    The warrant in paragraph 2 authorised the use of a listening device by a named police officer, and by other named police officers on her behalf, “to record or listen to the private conversations” of the opponents, two other persons, and Michael Nanai “by attaching such device on or about the person of Michael Nanai”. 
     8    Paragraph 3 of the warrant fixed the period from 4.30 pm on 15 December 1997 until 4.30 pm on 4 January 1997 (sic) as the period during which the warrant was to be in force. 
     9    Police officers fitted a listening device to Mr Nanai at different times on 15, 19 and 20 December 1997 and the device was activated on each of those days to record private conversations with one or more of the opponents. The police sought to use this evidence in committal proceedings against the opponents. The latter brought the proceedings heard by O’Keefe J to have the warrant quashed in order, if possible, to prevent this. 
     10    The plaintiffs propounded two challenges to the warrant. The first was that Mr Nanai had used the listening devices but had not been named by the warrant as an authorised user. The second was that the warrant failed to comply with s 16(4)(c) of the Act. 
     11    O’Keefe J, whose judgment has been reported as Barbaro v Director of Public Prosecutions (1999) 49 NSWLR 68, rejected the first ground but upheld the second and ordered that the warrant be quashed. He held that the warrant authorised the action taken by Mr Nanai because he was named in the warrant and his actions specifically authorised by its terms. If his actions did involve the use by him of the listening devices for the purposes of the Act, the warrant had authorised those actions. He held however that Mr Nanai had not used the listening devices because he was a mere carrier, and the devices were relevantly used by the police officers who fitted them, activated them by remote control and removed them. 
     12    I agree with the reasoning of O’Keefe J on both these points and adopt this part of his reasons as my own. I would add that this challenge to the warrant was in any event misconceived. Assuming the warrant was otherwise valid, it authorised the actions taken by the various police officers. If the warrant did not authorise the action taken by Mr Nanai, and he had in truth used the listening devices for the purposes of the Act, that simply means that his use of the devices was not authorised by the warrant. This could have other legal consequences, but would not invalidate the warrant. 
     13    The other challenge to the warrant was that it did not comply with s 16(4)(c) which provided that: 
      
       
        
        “(4) A warrant granted by an eligible Judge under this section shall specify: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) The period (being a period not exceeding 21 days) during which the warrant is in force”. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
     14    The challenge was based on para 3 of the warrant which provided that the warrant was to be in force for the period “4.30 pm on 15 December 1997 until 4.30 pm on 4 January 1997”.  
     15    The Act does not authorise the issue of a retrospective warrant or one which remains in force for more than 21 days. The warrant therefore failed to specify the period during which it would be in force unless it could be construed as fixing this as the period between 15 December 1997 and 4 January 1998. 
     16    Section 16(4) provides that the warrant “shall specify” the matters referred to in the following paragraphs, and failure to do so will invalidate the warrant. See Haynes v Attorney General (James J unrep 9/2/96) where because of a blank the warrant failed to comply with s 16(4)(c), and Bayeh v Taylor (Grove J unrep 4/2/98) where the warrant did not in terms require the retrieval of a listening device installed on premises. Statements in Ousley v The Queen (1997) 192 CLR 69 support this view. See per Toohey J at 83, McHugh J at 111, 113 and Gummow J at 127-8; compare Gaudron J at 93. 
     17    The validity of this warrant turns on the construction of para 3. Warrants under the Act authorise invasions of the privacy of the persons whose conversations are recorded, and in some cases they authorise trespasses on their property or the property of others. On the other hand warrants under the Act, unlike search warrants, do not have to be produced to persons whose premises are about to be entered and searched. They are directed to the police officers who will act on them, and this will occur in conditions of secrecy. There is therefore not the same necessity for such a warrant to be clear on its face. See Ousley v The Queen at 81-2 per Toohey J, 89-90 per Gaudron J, and 111-2 per McHugh J. 
     18    In any event the Court should not adopt a hypercritical approach to warrants. As Kirby J said in Ousley v The Queen at 144: 
      
       
        
        “Courts properly tend to take a practical rather than an unduly technical view of challenges to warrants permitting intrusion into the property and privacy of those subject to them. But when a real defect can be demonstrated, courts err, rightly in my view, on the side defensive of the fundamental rights of the individual affected”. 
        
       
       
        
       
     19    This is a proper case for the application of the principle summed up in the Latin maxim false demonstratio non nocet meaning that a mere false description does not vitiate if there is sufficient certainty. See Broom’s “Legal Maxims” 10th Ed 1939 pp 426-7. The principle embodied in this maxim has been applied in analogous contexts. In Regina v Toro-Martinez (CCA 7/6/2000 unrep) it was applied to a certificate under s 15M of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) expressed to cover the period from “13 December 1996 until 11 January 1996”. Spigelman CJ said (para 35): 
      
       
        
        “This is the kind of typographical error that often occurs at the end of one calendar or the commencement of a new calendar year. The intent is plain and the error is obvious”. 
        
       
       
        
       
     20    A related principle was applied in Fitzgerald v Masters (1956) 95 CLR 420, 426-7 by Dixon CJ and Fullagar J: 
      
       
        
        “Words may generally be supplied, omitted or corrected in an instrument where it is clearly necessary in order to avoid absurdity or inconsistency”. 
        
       
       
        
       
     21    See also Norfolk Estates Ltd v Cadiz Corporation Pty Ltd (1977) 77 ATC 4494, 4501-2, and R v Briggs [1995] 1 NZLR 196 CA, 198. 
      
       
        
       
     22    In my judgment the warrant on its true construction specified the period from 15 December 1996 until 4 January 1997 as the period during which it would be in force and as such it was valid. The word “until” showed that the warrant was intended to have a prospective operation and on that basis there could be no doubt that “4.30 pm on 4 January 1997” was intended to mean and did mean 4.30 pm on 4 January 1998. No one who was required to act on, and comply with, the warrant could possibly have been misled. Accordingly leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal allowed. The following formal orders should be made: 
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted; 
       
       
      (2) Claimant to file a notice of appeal within 14 days; 
       
       
      (3) Appeal allowed with costs; 
       
       
      (4) Judgment of O’Keefe J set aside, and in lieu thereof order that the summons be dismissed with costs; 
       
       
      (5) The respondent to have a certificate under the  
      Suitors Fund Act

      JUDGMENT 
     1    WOOD CJ at CL: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of McClellan J. I agree with his reasons and the orders he proposes. 
      
       
     2    McCLELLAN J: The applicant was charged with importing into Australia a quantity of cocaine not being less than the trafficable quantity contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). He pleaded not guilty. However, the jury was unable to reach a verdict and was discharged. On the first day of the new trial he pleaded guilty. 
      
       
     3    He was sentenced to seven and a half years imprisonment with a non parole period of four and a half years. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by Morgan DCJ. 
      
       
     4    The facts before the sentencing judge may be shortly stated. On 4 August the appellant arrived at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport together with Brandon Lee Vergara, aboard a flight from Buenos Aires. The applicant was travelling on a Unites States of America passport issued in Washington on 17 July 1998. He was in possession of a return ticket which had been purchased in the USA on 22 July 1998. The applicant had commenced his journey in Charlotte, North Carolina, and had come via Miami and then travelled to Panama where he stayed for some nine days before leaving for Australia. 
      
       
        
       On 4 August at about 7.30 am the applicant was spoken to by members of the Australian Customs Service and selected for a random search. His luggage consisted of a soft-sided suitcase and during the search of that suitcase the officers found that it was heavier than normal and had an unusual thickness around the inside. Further searching revealed an amount of white powder concealed in the framework of the luggage that was later analysed. The test was positive for the presence of cocaine which was later confirmed by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratory analyst. 
        
        
       The suitcase carried by Vergara was also searched and was also found to contain a quantity of white powder, again contained within the framework of the suitcase. It also tested positive for the presence of cocaine which was also confirmed by later analysis. 
        
        
       The applicant was questioned by customs officers at the airport and he told them that he had purchased his suitcase in Charlotte two months ago. He denied any knowledge of cocaine, although he admitted that he had packed his suitcase. He told the officers he was in Australia for eight days and his girlfriend was coming out in about three days if she could get the time off work. 
        
        
       The applicant and his co-offender, Vergara, agreed to cooperate with police in a controlled delivery. They were both taken to the Oxford Koala Motor Inn where, over the next five days, the applicant made and received various phone calls to and from a person called Caesar in Columbia. Those calls were recorded and finally on 9 August 1998 a man by the name of Elvis Power arrived at the motel to collect the bag. He was arrested by members of the Australian Federal Police. The applicant was then rearrested and taken to the offices of the Australian Federal Police in Sydney. He was given the opportunity of speaking to relatives in the United States as well as to the Consulate here in Sydney. After he had done that, he agreed to participate in a taped record of interview.  
        
        
       The applicant admitted that he knew he was importing cocaine within the suitcase. He said he did not know how much cocaine was in the case or how it came to be there. A person named Caesar arranged the importation. A friend of his, Gus, owed some money to another person, so the applicant lent some money to that man who then asked him if he wanted to make some money. The applicant told the Federal Police officer that Gus had been threatened many times. Gus had told him he would be importing drugs and everything would be paid for, that he was told he would get US$12,000 for his role in the scheme. He told the police officers that Caesar contacted him and advised him that a person by the name of Lucas would give him the luggage in Panama. This occurred. 
        
        
       The applicant told the police that Caesar was ""mad"" at him and also at Vergara, because they had spent a lot of money in Miami where they had apparently enjoyed a vacation before going on to Panama and as they could not repay Caesar, they went along with the importation. 
        
       
     5    The first trial commenced on 12 April 1999 and proceeded until the jury was discharged on 28 April 1999. 
      
       
     6    The applicant gave evidence at that trial and whilst he conceded that he imported a suitcase knowing that it contained drugs, he maintained before the jury that he did so as he was acting under duress. He gave evidence that whilst he voluntarily entered into the arrangement with Gus and Caesar to import cocaine into Australia, on 29 July he changed his mind and he told Caesar he would not continue with the importation. This resulted, he told the jury, in threats by Caesar against himself and his girlfriend. 
      
       
     7    The applicant's then girlfriend, Brittnie Simms, was brought out to Australia by the defence and she gave evidence that on about 22 July 1998 her house where she lived with her mother had been shot at. A report of that incident to the police was tendered in the case. She said she had told the applicant about it when she spoke to him on the telephone about 30 July, whilst the applicant was in Panama. 
      
       
     8    The applicant, in cross-examination, said that he had not told the Australian Federal Police following his arrest about that particular matter, that is of Brittnie's house being shot at, because he thought that the police were useless. 
      
       
     9    I understand that following the trial further evidence was obtained relating to Brittnie Simms and it is apparent that that defence would not have been raised at a second trial. 
      
       
     10    This appeal is brought against the severity of the sentence, it being submitted that the judge's discretion miscarried by reason of her failure to make sufficient allowance for the assistance provided by the applicant. 
      
       
     11    The applicant was sentenced by Morgan DCJ. Her Honour also conducted the trial of Vergara who, having pleaded not guilty, was convicted. 
      
       
     12    After allowing a discount for the assistance he gave the authorities, Vergara was sentenced to eight years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years. 
      
       
     13    Before Morgan DCJ the applicant argued that he was entitled to a greater discount for his assistance to the authorities than was given to Vergara. This submission was rejected and the applicant was sentenced to seven and a half years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four and a half years. It is apparent that the applicant received a discount of six months for his plea of guilty. 
      
       
     14    It is submitted on behalf of the applicant that this Court should be guided by the principles set forth in R v Wong & Leung (1999) 108 A Crim R 531. As the quantity of cocaine imported fell within the mid-high range trafficable quantity and the applicant was a courier the appropriate head sentence was accepted before considering any discount to be in the range of six to ten years. 
      
       
     15    It was further submitted that as the applicant was a first offender, and a relatively young man who had entered a plea it was not appropriate to apply a head sentence at the top of the range. As the applicant had pleaded guilty it was submitted this should entitle him to a discount beyond that allowed for the assistance he gave the authorities. 
      
       
     16    Recognising that the discount given by her Honour was not quantified but assuming the calculation commenced at the top of the Wong & Leung range, with only a ten percent discount for the guilty plea, the discount for assistance, said to be in the order of sixteen percent, was submitted to be inadequate. 
      
       
     17    The court's attention was drawn to the decision in R v K, [2000] NSWCCA 200, where Smart AJ said that a discount of forty percent was unexceptional where the convicted person has given assistance. The assistance in that case was similar to that given in the present case. 
      
       
     18    Her Honour delivered the judgment on sentence on 17 December 1999, the day after judgment was delivered by this Court in Wong & Leong. Her Honour made no reference to that decision and it is likely that it was not drawn to her attention. However, it is plain that this Court, when considering the present application, must have regard to that decision. 
      
       
     19    Wong & Leong provided a guideline judgment which, although not binding, is intended to provide a ""sounding board"" or a check against the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion. (see the remarks of Winneke P in R v Ngui & Tiong (2000) 111 A Crim R 593 adopted by Spigelman CJ in R v Karacic, [2001] NSWCCA 12). Further indication of the utility of guideline judgments was given by Wood J in R v Thompson, R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 where he said, agreeing with proposed guidelines in relation to guilty pleas: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Adherence to them in the absence of compelling reason to the contrary, can only assist to secure greater certainty and equity in sentencing practice."" (p 420) 
         
        
       
     20    In the present case her Honour was required to sentence the applicant having already sentenced Vergara for his involvement in the same enterprise to eight years with a four and a half year non parole period. Presumably this sentence was imposed after allowing a discount for the co-operation Vergara gave to the authorities. As she found that the discount on account of assistance given by the applicant should be the same as Vergara presumably she would have imposed an eight year sentence on the applicant but reduced it by six months having regard to his plea of guilty. 
      
       
     21    The Crown submitted that the sentence should be considered by reference to the applicant's likely knowledge that the cocaine he was carrying was in excess of that which was determined by her Honour being in ""the order of one or a little over one kilogram."" It was said that but for difficulties in the laboratory the amount would have been significantly higher. It was suggested that this approach was appropriate having regard to the decisions in R v Derbas (1983) 6 Petty Session Review 2881; R v Chow (1987) 30 A Crim R 103; R v Mai & Tran (1992) 60 A Crim R 49; R v Laurentiu & Becheru (1992) 63 A Crim R 402. 
      
       
     22    In my opinion the present case must be determined by reference to the finding of Morgan DCJ as to the quantity of cocaine imported. Her Honour had the benefit of argument in relation to the amount of cocaine, her finding being consistent with the evidence provided by the Crown. The decision in Derbas and the subsequent cases relates to the circumstance where the amount of the drugs recovered has been reduced by the action of the authorities in the course of a controlled delivery and is quite different to the present case. 
      
       
     23    Morgan DCJ determined that both Vergara and the applicant fell within the caregory of being a ""bare or mere courier"". Acknowledging, as did her Honour, that no particular leniency should be extended to couriers it is important that the sentence imposed have appropriate regard to the guidelines provided in Wong & Leong. 
      
       
     24    There was discussion before this Court as to whether the guidelines provided in Wong & Leong recognised any discount for a plea of guilty. Attention was drawn to the statement by Spigelman CJ, who having identified the utility of providing a range of penalties as a guide to sentencing said 
      
       
        
         
         ""That is not to say that in particular cases, sentences outside the range would not be appropriate. It will frequently be the case, for the reasons already referred to, that a substantial degree of assistance will justify a sentence below the relevant range. There may also be circumstances in which a plea of guilty is entitled to such significant weight as to justify a sentence below the range. The range is not intended to apply to the principal of an organisation responsible for an importation or a person high in the hierarchy of such an organisation, to whom an increment should be applied. These factors are not intended to be exhaustive of the circumstances in which sentences outside the range will not attract the close scrutiny of this Court."" 
         
        
       
     25    It was submitted by the appellant that this passage should be understood as indicating that the sentences suggested as a guide did not have regard to any plea. 
      
       
     26    The Chief Justice has himself commented on this passage indicating that the guidelines which provide a range of appropriate sentences reflect consideration of all relevant factors including pleas of guilty.  
      
       
     27    He made plain that ""the guideline makes no assumption one way or another about such matters as whether there was a plea of guilty."" R v Karacic (2001) NSWCCA 12 at 8. 
      
       
     28    Accordingly the sentencing judge is required to make appropriate allowance for any plea having regard to the range suggested in the guideline. A lower sentence from within the range may be appropriate where a plea is entered. 
      
       
     29    This Court considered the approach which should be adopted to a plea of guilty applicable to state offences in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. The factors of relevance to the sentence imposed arising from the entering of a plea were discussed. In particular the utilitarian benefits of a plea for the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system were recognised as quite separate from any elements of remorse and contrition. (p 411-412). 
      
       
     30    The present case must be determined under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Accordingly the court was required by s 16A(2)(g) to have regard to the fact that the applicant pleaded guilty. The plea was entered on the first day of the second trial and with the knowledge that the defence pursued at the first trial was not available and accordingly in my opinion it warrants less consideration than if it had been entered before the first trial. Nevertheless it had considerable utilitarian benefit which should be recognised in the sentence imposed. 
      
       
     31    This Court has previously considered the appropriate approach to the sentencing of offenders who have given assistance to the authorities. In R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 the majority in this Court indicated that there should be a reward for providing assistance ""if the offender has genuinely cooperated with the authorities whether or not the information supplied objectively turns out in fact to have been effective. The information which he gives must be such as could significantly assist the authorities."" P 253 (Mahoney JA adopted a different view indicating that the sentencing judge should also take into account whether the information given was effective. See also the discussion by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Raz, unreported, 17 December 1992, Court of Criminal Appeal, 
      
       
     32    In determining the benefit arising from assistance the court indicated that regard should be had to whether or not the disclosure has been frank and honest, and said ""the extent of the discount will depend to a large extent upon the willingness with which the disclosure is made. (p 17) Genuine remorse or contrition may in accordance with normal sentencing principles justify greater leniency. 
      
       
     33    Of course, the circumstances of the offender's imprisonment and the need for the sentence to be served in protective custody (as will usually be the case) is also relevant. 
      
       
     34    In the present case the extent of the assistance given by the applicant is set forth in the letter from the Federal Police tendered before Morgan DCJ. It is apparent that he cooperated fully with the police enabling them to obtain evidence which could be used against the person who received the drugs in Australia. 
      
       
     35    The applicant offered to give evidence at this person's trial but as the proceedings against him had not been completed this was not possible. The other person was found not guilty. 
      
       
     36    The police were satisfied that the applicant was honestly attempting to assist police in identifying other persons knowingly concerned in the importation and distribution of cocaine. It is also apparent that the applicant will serve his sentence in protective custody and fears reprisal. 
      
       
     37    In these circumstances I am of the opinion that the applicant was entitled to a considerable reduction in his sentence for the assistance he gave. 
      
       
     38    It is also necessary, as Morgan DCJ did, to have regard to the fact that any sentence would not be subject to remission. (s 16G Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)). 
      
       
     39    I am satisfied that having appropriate regard to the guidelines provided in Wong & Leong the sentence imposed on the applicant was excessive. 
      
       
     40    The range suggested for an offender who is a courier with a trafficable quantity of cocaine between 1 kg - 2 kg is seven to ten years. In my opinion a sentence toward the higher end of the range is appropriate. Although the applicant was only a courier and was found to be carrying in the ""order of one or a little over one kilogram"" he had a significant role in the enterprise certainly greater than Vergara. Only a modest allowance should be made for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty having regard to the fact that it was not entered until the first day of the second trial. 
      
       
     41    In my opinion the degree of assistance provided by the applicant was significant and this should be reflected in the sentence. Without consideration of that assistance but having regard to the plea of guilty an appropriate sentence would have been eight and a half years. Having regard to the assistance the sentence should be reduced to six years. The appropriate non parole period is four years. 
      
       
     42    In my opinion leave to appeal against the sentence should be granted. The sentence quashed and in lieu of the sentence imposed the applicant sentenced to six years commencing on 4 August 1998 with a non parole period of four years commencing on the same day. 
      
       
     43    SMART AJ: I agree with McClellan J.

      REGINA v Brandon Lee VERGARA 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1    WOOD CJ at CL: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of McClelland J. I agree with his reasons and the orders he proposes. 
      
       
     2    McCLELLAN J: The appellant Brandon Lee Vergara was convicted after trial by jury of importing into Australia not less than the trafficable quantity of cocaine in breach of s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901. He was sentenced to imprisonment for eight years with a non parole period of five years. 
      
       
     3    The appellant was arrested when he arrived in Sydney with a friend on a flight from Buenos Aires. When he arrived at Sydney airport he had a black suitcase which was searched by Customs officers and found, upon examination, including x-ray, to contain cocaine. 
      
       
     4    When interviewed the appellant denied any knowledge that the suitcase contained cocaine. He said that he had recently gone to Miami for a holiday where he met his friend who had arranged for payment to a travel agent for airfares and accommodation to South America and then to Australia for the purpose of vacation. He said he had no knowledge of who paid for those tickets and how they were arranged. 
      
       
     5    The appellant also told the police that his travelling partner had a friend called Gus who owed a large sum of money to a person in South America and the appellant and his friend had discussed how they could help Gus pay back the money. The appellant said that he understood that by taking the vacation in Australia they would help Gus to pay back his debt. 
      
       
     6    The appellant said that when in Panama a man came to the hotel room and exchanged the appellant's and his friend's suitcases with the cases each brought into Australia. The appellant said he thought there may be something altered in the suitcase to involve some kind of drugs or money, but that he had checked the suitcases thoroughly and found nothing wrong. 
      
       
     7    The appellant said he did not know of any arrangements to meet anyone in Sydney, had no knowledge that the bags were to be given to someone in Sydney and had no knowledge of there being drugs in the suitcase. 
      
       
     8    In these circumstances the knowledge of the appellant was the significant issue at the trial. The trial judge addressed the matter on a number of occasions. On each occasion her Honour was careful to indicate to the jury that the Crown must prove either actual knowledge that the suitcase contained drugs or that he was aware there was a significant or real chance that it contained drugs. 
      
       
     9    The relevant directions are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         .  
         ""However, within the word of 'importation' the Crown must prove that at the time that the accused bought (sic) that suitcase containing the cocaine into Australia, that he knew the suitcase contained narcotic drugs, or he was aware there was a significant or real chance that that suitcase did contain drugs. I just point out to you that Mr King has said, when he addressed you, that the Crown must prove actual knowledge, that he had to be actually aware that it was in there. I must correct what he said, because in addition to that actual knowledge it is sufficient if the Crown proves that the accused was aware that there was a significant or real chance that the suitcase did contain drugs. 
         
        
        
        
         
          
           
           What the whole case is about is whether the accused had actual knowledge that he was bringing in, in that suitcase, narcotic goods, or whether he was aware that there was a significant or real chance that the suitcase did contain drugs. That is what this whole case is about. Unless the Crown has succeeded in proving beyond reasonable doubt either one of those legs, knowledge, you must, according to your oath, return a verdict of not guilty."" 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         .  
         ""I just remind you that the Crown must prove that at the time that the accused brought that suitcase into Australia he knew that it contained narcotic drugs, or he was aware there was a significant, or real chance, that it did contain drugs."" 
         
        
        
         
         . 
          ""If you believe that it is simply a bizarre story, that he did not know what was in the case, but if you accept that you would find that he certainly had a guilty mind, because of the secondary aspect of the awareness of a real or significant likelihood that narcotic drugs were in there. The Crown says of course that you would accept that he had actual knowledge, but if you do not accept that he had actual knowledge he certainly would fall in[to] that second limb, that he was aware, as I say, of the likelihood of that drug being a narcotic drug being in his suitcase and that you would accordingly find the Crown had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. 
         
        
        
        
         
          
           
           Mr King, on behalf of the accused said that this case really is about whether he knew he had cocaine in his bag. I remind you that there are two legs to that. Either actual knowledge, or the second limb, that he was aware of a real or significant likelihood of the presence of a narcotic drug. Now the Crown can be successful on either of those legs. Mr King referred, in his address to you, simply to the actual knowledge of the accused and said that the Crown had not proved that actual knowledge beyond reasonable doubt. I just want you to be quite certain that the Crown can prove either of those two matters. Mr King did not make any submissions in relation to that aspect of what the Crown can prove. However, he says that you must be very sure when you draw inferences that you must only draw inferences against the accused, …"" 
           
          
         
        
       
     10    In this appeal the appellant describes her Honour's directions as providing a two limb test to prove knowledge. It is submitted that there was a misdirection and the jury should have been told that the Crown must prove that the appellant had knowledge that what was contained in the suitcase was narcotics. 
      
       
     11    It was also submitted that although knowledge might be inferred from the fact that the jury was satisfied that the appellant knew there was a significant or real risk that the suitcase contained cocaine they must also decide whether this was the only rational inference available. 
      
       
     12    Reliance was placed on Pereira v Director of Public Prosecutions (1988) 63 ALJR 1 at 3, where the High Court said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""First, in such cases the question remains one of actual knowledge: Giorgianni v The Queen (1985) 156 CLR 473 at 504-507; He Kaw Teh (1985) 157 CLR 523 at 570. It is never the case that something less than knowledge may be treated as satisfying a requirement of actual knowledge. Secondly, the question is that of the knowledge of the accused and not that which might be postulated of a hypothetical person in the position of the accused, although, of course, that may not be an irrelevant consideration. Finally, where knowledge is inferred from the circumstances surrounding the commission of the alleged offence, knowledge must be the only rational inference available."" 
         
        
       
     13    In my opinion the directions given by the trial judge were correct. They are consistent with the decisions of the High Court and this Court. It must be remembered that the issue which is being considered is whether or not the appellant had the necessary intent to commit the offence. To prove that intent the prosecution must prove knowledge that the prohibited goods were or were likely to be secreted in the suitcase. (See He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 523; Pereira v The Director of Public Prosecutions (1988) 63 ALJR 1 at 3). Contrary to the appellant's submission the prosecution did not have to prove that the appellant had actual knowledge that he was importing prohibited goods. It was sufficient if the prosecution established that the appellant knew or was aware that they were likely to be present in the goods imported. Belief falling short of actual knowledge suffices. 
      
       
     14    In Kural v The Queen (1987) 162 CLR 502 Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in a joint judgment, said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""But that is not to say that actual knowledge or awareness is an essential element in the guilty mind required for the commission of the offence. It is only to say that knowledge or awareness is relevant to the existence of the necessary intent. Belief, falling short of actual knowledge, that the article comprised or contained narcotic drugs would obviously sustain an inference of intention. So also would proof that the forbidden act was done in circumstances where it appears beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was aware of the likelihood, in the sense that there was a significant or real chance, that his conduct involved that act and nevertheless persisted in that conduct."" 
         
        
       
     15    The issue was further considered by this Court with statements to similar effect in Margaret Greatorex (1994) 74 A Crim R 496; R v Karam (1995) 83 A Crim R 416 and in R v Yee Kam Lau, (1998) 105 A Crim R 167. 
      
       
     16    In my opinion the directions given by her Honour were consistent with these decisions. Her Honour was also careful to remind the jury in a conventional manner that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt indicating that the jury should not draw any inference establishing the guilt of the appellant unless it is the only rational inference to draw in the circumstances. 
      
       
     17    The appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     18    SMART AJ: I agree with McClellan J.

      MONDAY 26 MARCH 2001 
      
      REGINA v. WILLIAM JOHN DOLMAN 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   GREG JAMES, J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a sentence imposed on him by his Honour Judge Woods, QC. in the District Court of 30 May 2000. That sentence was imposed upon him for the crime of knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, an offence under s.24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 punishable by a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. 
     2   His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for three years and six months to date from 30 May 2000 and to expire 29 November 2003, with a non-parole period of 18 months to commence 30 May 2000 and to expire 29 November 2001. 
     3   The applicant has no relevant prior record, although he has been convicted of an offence in 1961 which, for present purposes, may be ignored. 
     4   In his remarks on sentence the learned trial judge gave to the applicant the benefit of a plea of guilty, both as indicating contrition and as having a pragmatic benefit. He regarded it as an early plea.  
     5   His Honour referred to the applicant's age, 62, and his prior good character, referred to his long and successful work history in legitimate businesses, he referred to how the applicant had come into association with a criminal named Kidd and, in consequence, with a man named Launt, an industrial chemist, who was involved in supplying materials for the illicit manufacture of drugs. 
     6   His Honour summarised how Kidd and Launt had involvement with a man named Kalache, who became involved in the supply of drugs. 
     7   His Honour referred to the applicant's involvement in Launt's legitimate drug producing activities and to his involvement in those activities of Launt which went beyond the limit of the legitimate. 
     8   In particular, he referred to a record of facts tendered before him and setting out what was said to be a summary of the illegal activities of the applicant. He quoted from that facts document as follows (page 3 his Honour's remarks on sentence):- 
      
       
        
        ""As a result of requests on the criminal network, Launt arranged for a William John Dolman, an industrial chemist, to assist with manufacturing phenylacetic acid and other compounds. 
        
       
       
        
        Launt paid Dolman as a consultant flying into his property, [which I interpolate was in Queensland] in March 1996 where about 100 kilograms of phenylacetic acid was produced on site, along with quantities of other precursor agents to the end drug methylamphetamine"". 
        
       
     9   His Honour found that Dolman had been paid $50 an hour for that work at a scale comparable with that for a chemical industry consultant in legitimate work, the payments totalling some $3,000. 
     10   His Honour referred also to a record of interview between Dolman and the police. He referred to Dolman having, in that document, admitted that which was also referred to in the statement of facts, that is, the teaching of two persons sent by Kalache to Launt's Queensland property of the procedure to convert phenylacetic acid to a precursor of methylamphetamine. This teaching occurred on two separate occasions.  
     11   The teaching was admitted by the applicant and, importantly, in his admission, he set out that he realised that the persons, or at least one of them, that he was teaching was a person who had previously been imprisoned for drug matters. 
     12   His Honour gave particular attention to paragraph 38 of the applicant's interview and quoted it in his remarks on sentence. In that paragraph, the applicant admitted that he knew that the persons he had instructed were intending to manufacture methylamphetamines, using the process he had shown to them. 
     13   His Honour referred to the more expansive answer that the applicant had earlier given and, in particular, to the realisation by the applicant that the quantity of the phenylacetic acid that Launt had asked him about, would produce 100 kilograms of the forbidden substance. 
     14   Although his Honour's reasons in this regard are not entirely clear, it would seem that there his Honour is referring to the process of manufacture occurring in Queensland, to which I had earlier referred. 
     15   That production of the 100 kilograms of phenylacetic acid seems to be referred to by his Honour not so much as an offence that might have shed light upon what was, in fact, produced, but as evidencing the applicant's knowledge of the activities in which he engaged and for which he was prosecuted in New South Wales and his realisation of the illegality of those activities. 
     16   Indeed, his Honour had referred to the state of mind of the applicant in relation to those matters in the context of a suggestion that the applicant equated the precursors of amphetamine manufacture to that of producing the common salt and baking soda. 
     17   In an extensive discussion of the matters to which the applicant adverted, his Honour referred to the applicant's reply that he ""wouldn't have a bar of drugs and that is for sure and I would say that under oath"". 
     18   His Honour did accept the applicant's denial of knowing that Kalache and others were principals in various Sydney operations involved in the illegal production of methylamphetamine. 
     19   After examining Launt's statement, his Honour concluded:- 
      
       
        
        ""Some measure of the same flavour of reality is reflected in my view in Dolman's account of the present matter"". 
        
       
     20   His Honour inferred that the main basis upon which the plea had been entered was what I have referred to as set out in paragraph 38 of the document to which I have already referred, that is, the instruction of the two men in the process and the knowing that that process could conclude in the manufacture of the illegal amphetamine. 
     21   His Honour concluded that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the offender did have a state of mind sufficient to sustain, ""what he says in paragraph 38"". Thus, his actions of educating the two men were, in each case, a knowing step by the offender in the commission of the offence. 
     22   His Honour held that paragraph 38, ""in its context, is the basis for the sentence which I intend to impose"". 
     23   These observations as to the basis for his Honour's sentence are important, having regard to the nature of the challenge to that sentence which is made on this application.  
     24   In particular, it is contended that the sentence passed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances, there had been an error arising by reason of failure to have proper regard for the principle of proportionality, particularly when one has regard to the sentence passed upon others engaged in this wide-ranging operation, which seemed to embrace a number of independent sub-conspiracies to produce and market the drug, and that the applicant's medical circumstances were such that he should not be held responsible to the fullest extent for the role that he performed in this regard. 
     25   Those considerations seemed to underlie all of the five grounds of appeal originally asserted, and the further submission, which particularly brought the matters underlying those grounds to the fore, that the applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance, having regard to his own particular circumstances when the sentence passed upon him was compared to sentences passed upon others who had been involved, more or less directly, in the various sub-conspiracies or the operation. 
     26   The submissions that have been put in that regard seem really to have been put as relevant to the schedule which has been provided to us on the appeal of the various sentences passed upon those others involved. No issue has been taken by the Crown with the correctness of the schedule. 
     27   Nonetheless, although it is extensive, it appears that there were only two matters in that schedule to which our attention was specifically directed as having bearing upon the case now said to be made for the applicant. 
     28   Indeed, even though a most detailed comparison was made with various of the sentences passed either at first instance, or on appeal, against certain of the persons involved, that comparison has tended to disclose, not some common features in consequence of which the applicant had been dealt with more severely than others, but that the applicant's case was peculiar, if not unique, so as to enable little basis of direct comparison with the case for the others. 
     29   His Honour, in his remarks, as I have already said, gave particular attention to the applicant's state of mind and knowledge. This was in the context that his Honour turned from examining that matter directly, as I have set out, to examining the evidence to show that the applicant, as a consequence of repeated exposure to noxious chemicals and as having suffered an industrial accident in which he was exposed to noxious chemicals, sustained brain damage, mildly suggestive of a frontal lobe syndrome. 
     30   His Honour examined the report of Dr. Jolly in that regard. Dr. Jolly's report was a most detailed and extensive report. He summarised at page 7 of that report, the two quite separate types of pathology which may have underlain what he saw as the reasoning difficulty the applicant suffered from, including, organic brain disease, as evidenced by subdural haematoma in a prematurely aged or aging brain. 
     31   Dr. Jolly referred to that as, ""pre-senile dementia"". He was unable to predict what the consequences might be, but was of the view that the diagnostic formulation of the likely cause of the organic damage was that exposure to toxic chemicals, to which I have referred, exacerbated by, ""binge drinking"".  
     32   Dr. Jolly also referred to a cyclothymic personality approaching the boundaries or aegis of frank/manic depressive psychosis and referred to that in the context of the applicant retaining a sharp knowledge and appreciation, as well as a willingness to persevere with research with chemicals, but as a condition producing a proclivity to address things in ways that other people of more conventional disposition, might not, eg., to take risks where others would not. 
     33   The psychiatrist was of the view that, as a consequence, perhaps of those conditions, but undoubtedly, the applicant exhibited a gross deficit in thinking and reasoning such as would effect good judgment and that his organic pathology was not trivial but serious. 
     34   Dr. Jolly did not believe that the applicant, ""ever had a 'guilty mind' in the sense of knowingly contributing to the manufacture of large commercial amounts of illegal amphetamine"", and referred to him as lacking intellectual capacity. He considered that his culpability was very substantially reduced. 
     35   He did find that, in his opinion, the applicant was well aware, when he went to the Queensland property in 1997, something illegal was going on, or had been going on, but was of the view that the applicant could not, because of his intellectual deficits, postulate what the whole consequences would be of his own behaviour notwithstanding that. 
     36   The trial judge, having identified the references to organic problems and an early dementing process, also noted reference to the psychological testing which confirmed quite significant cognitive impairment. He referred to the mood swings the psychiatrist had referred to as accompanying the personality problems. He refers to what the applicant had told the psychiatrist and, in particular, says:- 
      
       
        
        ""The implication is that Mr. Dolman was telling him, as he had said in the December record of interview, that what he was doing was lawful."" 
        
       
     37   His Honour examined that material and concluded it was not suggested there was any ground of insanity or that the plea of guilty should be withdrawn on some mental state basis akin to that which would absolve all criminal responsibility by reason of the doctrines in M'Naghten's case. 
     38   His Honour did conclude that the medical material required him to find that the accused had a limitation on his knowledge and thus the subjective culpability was significantly mitigated by comparison with that with which would otherwise have been the case, because of the peculiarity of this man's mental state, but His Honour held that he did not accept that the applicant lacked the knowledge of the criminality involved in educating others in production of the relevant material. He was of the view that mitigation should be extended to the applicant, but only mitigation to a certain degree. 
     39   Further, his Honour was of the view, and I consider entirely appropriately, that the objective culpability of this man's conduct was quite high. He possessed chemical skills which he made available to those who would produce the drug for illegal purposes and equipped them with the opportunity to disseminate those skills further. 
     40   His Honour moved from making a finding to that effect to conclude that, notwithstanding the regard he had for the medical evidence as mitigating the culpability of the offender, it was necessary to impose the sentence which he did. He found special circumstances, in particular arising from the mental condition of the applicant and, in that regard, varied the proportions between the minimum and additional term. 
     41   Of the challenges presently made to his Honour's sentence, that challenge relating to proportionality, to which I have already referred, should be considered in the light of the submissions later made as to disparity of sentencing. 
     42   The submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive in the circumstances also should await consideration of the other grounds. 
     43   As to the challenge the suggestion that his Honour erred by failing to have any or proper regard for the medical evidence, it is clear from what I have said that that challenge cannot succeed. 
     44   His Honour did have regard for the applicant's medical circumstances and gave him substantially the benefit of those circumstances in mitigating the sentence he would otherwise have imposed. 
     45   It is suggested that his Honour erred in failing to refer to Dr. Jolly's concern that the applicant would be at risk in goal by reason of those circumstances. 
     46   In my view, it cannot be taken that his Honour did not have regard to this matter. That is one matter that is a consequence of the very condition his Honour found. Further, it is plain that his Honour did have regard to the general principles arising from such a finding in mitigating sentence and, in particular, regard to the principle in Scognamiglio v. The Queen (1991) 56 A. Crim R. 81 that persons suffering from significant mental deficit are not appropriate for the whole rigours of personal deterrence or to be made such an example as others might be by way of the application of the doctrine of general deterrence. 
     47   It was suggested that his Honour erred by taking into account matters irrelevant to the sentencing exercise that he found to be aggravating features.  
     48   The reference there appears to be to the relationship with the person Kidd, to whom I have referred, but it is plain that, when one has regard to what his Honour has said, he has not erred, at least not in the sense likely to have borne in any way adversely to the applicant in his Honour's final decision, in referring to the association with Kidd, and certainly not in the way suggested by taking into account offences for which the applicant had not been convicted. 
     49   Indeed, it seems to me that when his Honour adverted to what had occurred in Queensland and what had occurred with Kidd, he did so for the sake of ascertaining the applicant's ability to appreciate the culpability of the conduct the applicant engaged in and for which he was charged and sentenced. 
     50   I turn now to the question of the principle of parity and the issue of proportionality. 
     51   Much that has already been said would indicate that the sentence imposed upon the applicant, whilst a severe one in the context of the applicant's personal circumstances as proved, was nonetheless a sentence which could not be shown to be disproportionate or disparate in the sense referred to in Postiglione v. The Queen (1996) 189 CLR 295, when one has regard to the circumstances involved in each of the individual matters to which the applicant's counsel has drawn attention. 
     52   In that sense, it does not appear that the applicant's peculiar circumstances are such that his Honour should not have regard to his vulnerability, or willingness, to make available to others his knowledge such that the drug might be produced and marketed or others become aware of that knowledge amongst those minded to commit the offence of producing the drug and marketing it. 
     53   Notwithstanding the subjective circumstances which his Honour found were to the applicant's advantage, hence notwithstanding those matters to which this applicant has pointed by way of mitigating features in his case, I am of the view that I am not satisfied his Honour fell into appealable error. I am therefore of the view the sentence is not manifestly excessive. 
     54   In those circumstances, not being satisfied that his Honour's discretion miscarried, it is not open to this court, I consider, to intervene. 
     55   Having regard, however, to the Crown's submission that the appropriate course to take in this case, since it might be that, as a result of appeals or applications for leave to appeal by others involved in this wide-ranging operation, reconsideration might have to be made of the sentence in consequence of some later judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, that the better course would be to leave such reconsideration open by refusing leave to appeal, even accepting that no such leave is likely to be granted, unless the Court of Criminal Appeal were minded to publish a judgment that would afford a basis for it, notwithstanding there has been full argument on the applicant's case and, with a view to reserving his rights in that regard, I propose that, rather than the appeal being dismissed, leave to appeal be refused. That course is acceded to by the applicant's counsel. 
     56   SMART, AJ: I agree. 
     57   GREG JAMES, J: The orders of the court will be leave to appeal refused.

      REGINA v Raymond Grant PEDRANA 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1    IPP AJA: On 21 May 1990 the appellant was charged with one count of armed robbery contrary to s 97 of the Crimes Act 1900. He pleaded not guilty. He was convicted on 24 May 1990 after a trial. He was sentenced by Urquhart DCJ to a minimum term of imprisonment of five years and an additional term of one year and eight months. The minimum term was to commence in January 1992. The sentence was specified to expire on 8 September 1988.  
      
       
     2    The appellant appealed against his conviction but his appeal was dismissed: R v Pedrana, unreported, CCA NSW, 11 June 1992. 
      
       
     3    In April 2000 the appellant applied under s 474D of the Crimes Act for an inquiry into his conviction. On 20 October 2000, James J made an order in terms of s 474E(1) for an inquiry by a prescribed person into the conviction. That inquiry was undertaken by Graham DCJ. After conducting the inquiry his Honour referred the matter to this Court pursuant to s 474H(2)(a) for consideration of the question whether the conviction should be quashed. 
      
       
     4    The sole ground of appeal before this Court is that “there is now available fresh evidence that demonstrates the appellant’s conviction was a miscarriage of justice”. In argument, counsel for the appellant submitted, as her primary position, that the conviction should be quashed and a verdict of acquittal should be entered. In the alternative, she submitted that the conviction should be quashed and there should be an order that no new trial be held, or that there should be no order for a new trial (without a verdict of acquittal being entered). In the final alternative she submitted that the conviction be quashed and a new trial ordered. 
      
       
     5    Counsel for the appellant sought separate relief concerning other sentences imposed on the appellant for various different offences. On 15 May 1992 the appellant was sentenced by Viney DCJ for a series of armed robberies. These offences were unrelated to the offences the subject of this appeal. The learned judge sentenced the appellant to concurrent terms of eight years penal servitude which were divided into minimum and additional terms of four years each. The sentences were directed to commence at the expiry of the five year minimum term for the armed robbery committed on 21 May 1990 (the offence the subject of this appeal). The sentences imposed by Viney DCJ deferred the appellant’s eligibility date for parole to 8 January 2001. 
      
       
     6    Counsel for the appellant submitted that, should the conviction the subject of this appeal be quashed, the date of commencement of the sentences imposed by Viney DCJ should be varied by ordering them to commence in January 1992, that is, on the date that the sentence imposed by Urquhart DCJ was ordered to commence. 
      
       
     7    At the outset, it is to be noted that the respondent did not dispute that the new evidence on which the appellant relied was fresh evidence and the appeal was argued on that basis.  
      
       
     8    As the sole ground of appeal concerns the effect of fresh evidence, the principles laid down Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 510 apply. In that case Barwick CJ (with whom McTiernan, Stephens and Jacobs JJ agreed) said that the use that may be made of fresh evidence differed, depending upon whether the appellant claims a verdict of acquittal as of right, or seeks merely the ordering of a new trial.  
      
       
     9    Barwick CJ referred (at (518) firstly to the situation where an appellant seeks orders that the verdict should be set aside outright, a verdict of acquittal entered, and the appellant discharged. The learned Chief Justice said: 
      
       
        
         
         “If the Court is considering whether the verdict should be set aside outright for the reason that innocence is shown, or the existence of an appropriate doubt established, the Court will consider all the material itself, forming and acting upon its own belief in, or disbelief of, the evidence, and upon its own view of the facts of the case including the evidence at the trial, though, as I have said, taking the facts as proved at the trial in the sense which having regard to its verdict the jury must have taken them. Of course, if it is concluded that there was a miscarriage in the sense that the Court itself is satisfied of innocence or entertains a reasonable doubt as to guilt, there will be no question of a new trial. The verdict of guilty will be quashed and the appellant discharged.” 
         
        
       
     10    Later cases have made it clear that the Court is to have regard to the view which a reasonable jury must have reached, and not the view of the Court itself: see, for example, Whitehorn v R (1983) 152 CLR 657 at 687, Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259 and M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487.  
      
       
     11    Where the Court concludes that, as a result of fresh evidence, it has a reasonable doubt as to guilt, the appellant is entitled to an acquittal as of right: King v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 423 at 427 and cases cited there.  
      
       
     12    In Ratten v The Queen, Barwick CJ went on to deal with the situation where an appeal is brought on the grounds of fresh evidence and the appellant, instead of seeking the quashing of the conviction and the entering of a verdict of acquittal as of right, claims only orders that the conviction be quashed and a new trial be ordered, or, in the alternative to an order that a verdict of acquittal be entered, seeks the ordering of a new trial.  
      
       
     13    In regard to this situation, Barwick CJ (at 519) said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[T]he Court must as before decide the credibility and the cogency of the fresh evidence in order to determine whether, when the fresh evidence, if believed by the jury, is taken with the evidence given at the trial in that sense most favourable to the accused which reasonable men might properly accept, it is likely that a verdict of guilty would not have been returned. In considering the material before it for this purpose, the element of credibility will be satisfied if the Court is of opinion that the evidence is capable of belief and likely to be believed by a jury. The Court in this instance will not be directly acting upon its own view of the evidence but rather upon that view most favourable to an appellant, which in the Court’s view a jury of reasonable men may properly take.” 
         
        
       
     14    Where, on this basis, a Court of Criminal Appeal determines that an appellant is entitled to a new trial, it may then be required to address the discretionary question whether an acquittal should be ordered. This would depend on whether any circumstances exist that might render it unjust to the appellant to make him or her stand trial again (remembering, however, that the public interest in the proper administration of justice must be considered as well as the interests of the individual accused): King v The Queen at 427 and 433; Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v Fowler (1984) 154 CLR 627 at 630. Should the interests of justice require that an appellant not stand trial again, the Court, as a matter of discretion, will enter a verdict of acquittal: Spies v The Queen (2000) 74 ALJR 1263 at 1283 
      
       
     15    In Mickelberg v The Queen at 273 Mason CJ said the following concerning the appropriate test to be applied by an appellate court in deciding whether to set aside a conviction on the ground of fresh evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is established that the proper question is whether the Court considers that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant had the fresh evidence been before it at the trial. This test was endorsed by four of the five justices in  
         Gallagher v The 
           
         Queen 
          (1986) 160 CLR 392. Deane J and I (at 402) considered that the test was best expressed in those terms 
          …” 
         
        
        
       In  
       Gallagher v The Queen 
        (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 402 Mason and Deane JJ were dealing with the second situation referred to by Barwick CJ in  
       Ratten v The Queen 
       , that is, where the issue is whether the conviction should be quashed and a new trial ordered (and not whether a verdict of acquittal should be ordered as of right). This, indeed, was the relief that was sought by the appellants in  
       Mickelberg v The Queen 
       .  
        
       
     16    It is to be borne in mind, therefore, that the comments of Mason CJ in Mickelberg v The Queen (at 273), which have often been cited as the test applicable when an appellant appeals on the ground of fresh evidence, are only applicable when the Court is considering whether or not to order a new trial, and do not apply when the Court is considering whether a verdict of acquittal should be entered as of right. 
      
       
     17    I now turn to the relevant factual circumstances. Those have been fully recorded in the judgment of this Court in R v Pedrana, unreported, CCA NSW, 11 June 1992. They are also fully described in the report of Graham DCJ. There is no need to repeat them in detail once more. I shall refer only to the essential matters. 
      
       
     18    On 12 May 1998 Edward Pracy and Alan Piper were at the home of Glenda Norris in Dharruk. Two men entered the premises armed with flick knives and wearing balaclavas over their heads. They confronted Pracy and Piper and demanded money from them. Pracy gave them his wallet which contained $300 in cash. They demanded more. They made Pracy and Piper lie on the floor and they kicked Pracy about the head and upper body area several times. 
      
       
     19    One of the men said by the prosecution to be the appellant, was dressed in a white padded sloppy joe. He went to the main bedroom where he found Ms Norris. He put the knife to her throat, hit her in the face, threatened to hurt her young children who were asleep in another bedroom and demanded money from her. She took $100 in cash out of her wallet and gave it to him. The man left the room and his co-offender entered. The co-offender also hit Ms Norris in the face, demanded money and made threats towards his children. He then sexually assaulted her. 
      
       
     20    Ms Norris was taken to the lounge room and made to lie on the floor with Pracy and Piper. The offenders then removed coins from a money jar or tin and stole other goods. 
      
       
     21    Fingerprints of the appellant were located on the money tin from which the coins were removed. 
      
       
     22    On 1 June 1988 the appellant was arrested in a motel room. Amongst his property a white padded sloppy joe was found. 
      
       
     23    The appellant was taken to Mt Druitt Police Station and questioned by Detectives Fluke and Mainstone. There he was said to have made an oral admission and he provided the police with a confession, written in his own hand, but which he did not sign.  
      
       
     24    At the commencement of the trial an issue arose as to the admissibility of the admissions allegedly made by the appellant. A voir dire was accordingly held. 
      
       
     25    Fluke testified that the appellant had made and signed three handwritten statements concerning amongst other things a different armed robbery. These statements were not tendered when the officers later gave evidence before the jury. 
      
       
     26    Fluke testified that, when he asked the appellant to comment on the fact that two men had entered the premises, stolen money and other goods and had sexually assaulted Ms Norris, the appellant replied: 
      
       
        
         
         “Yeah, I didn’t sexually assault anyone, anyway she was giving Pracy head”. 
         
        
        
       It was open to the jury to infer from this reply that the appellant was admitting that he was a participant in the armed robbery while denying that he took part in the sexual assault. 
        
       
     27    Fluke testified that the appellant wrote out a statement in his own hand, admitting that he participated in the offences. He was asked to sign the statement but declined to do so, saying that he didn’t sexually assault anyone, that he would speak with his solicitor, and if the latter agreed he would sign it. 
      
       
     28    When cross-examined, Fluke denied any impropriety in regard to the circumstances under which the appellant had made these admissions. It was put to Fluke that he had seen Mainstone assaulting the appellant, that the appellant had stated that he wanted to speak to a solicitor before speaking to the police, that Fluke had dictated the handwritten statements to the appellant, that the appellant had told Fluke that he (the appellant) had been to the house at Dharruk on a number of occasions, that the oral admissions had not been made by the appellant and that the appellant had told Fluke that he could explain his fingerprints on the box where the case was found because he had been to Ms Norris’ residence on a number of occasions. Fluke denied all these propositions. He admitted, however, that he did not, in his official police notebook, record his conversation with the appellant wherein the latter impliedly admitted guilt. 
      
       
     29    Mainstone was the corroborating officer as to the oral admission and the making of the unsigned statement. He gave, in effect, the same evidence as Fluke, and when cross-examined to similar effect as Fluke, gave similar replies. 
      
       
     30    Detective Senior Constable Rupp (who did not give evidence before the jury) testified in the voir dire as to the arrest of the appellant, his placement in an interview room and an occasion when he saw the appellant through the glass in the door, seated on a chair in the interview room. Graham DCJ described the cross-examination of Rupp as “benign”. No allegations were put to him about his conduct or that of any other police involved in the arrest and interview of the appellant. 
      
       
     31    Detective Senior Sergeant O’Connell was the adopting officer for the handwritten statement. He was called on the voir dire and later before the jury. He gave evidence which broadly speaking supported that of Fluke and Mainstone. He testified that the appellant had no complaints about the manner in which he had been interviewed or in the way in which he had been treated. He said that the appellant had agreed that he had made his unsigned statement of his own free will. He denied that when he drew the appellant’s attention to the fact that the statement was unsigned, the appellant told him that he wanted a solicitor present. He denied that the appellant had frequently said that he wanted a solicitor present. 
      
       
     32    The appellant testified in the voir dire. He said that detectives from Penrith assaulted him in the presence of Fluke and Mainstone. He said that his requests for a solicitor were ignored. He said that he was punched and threatened by Fluke. He said the contents of the handwritten statement were dictated to him by the police. He was effectively cross-examined by counsel for the Crown. 
      
       
     33    The issue before the trial judge on the voir dire involved only the voluntariness of the handwritten statement. His Honour held that the statement had been voluntarily made.  
      
       
     34    As Graham DCJ pointed out, the trial judge must have treated the evidence of O’Connell as being reliable and preferred the evidence of O’Connell to that of the appellant. His Honour relied on the veracity of O’Connell in deciding on the credibility of the allegations made by the appellant as to his treatment by the police. 
      
       
     35    At the trial Fluke and Mainstone gave evidence as to the admissions made by the appellant and, as I have mentioned, O’Connell also testified. 
      
       
     36    In R v Pedrana, the first appeal to this Court, the appellant relied on two grounds. The first challenged the trial judge’s directions on the confessional material. The second asserted that the verdict was unsafe. 
      
       
     37    In the course of his reasons, Abadee J held that the trial judge had adequately directed the jury in relation to the principal issues in the matter, including the evidence of the various police witnesses. His Honour noted: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour told the jury that the Crown had presented its case based on two independent bases, firstly, upon admissions and secondly, upon circumstantial evidence.” He said “it is common ground that the Crown case relied substantially and very heavily upon the admissions evidence.” 
         
        
        
       
     38    The second ground of appeal was that the verdict of the jury was unsafe and unsatisfactory. In this regard, Abadee J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It seems to me that unless the appellant can made good his claim in relation to the admissions argument, this ground must fail. 
         
        
        
         
         True, without the admissions the Crown case was perhaps not very strong. With the admissions in evidence the case was a strong one.” 
         
        
       
     39    As Abadee J pointed out, the disputed confessional material was not the only material on which the Crown relied. There were other circumstances that tended to support the inference that the appellant was guilty of the offence. Abadee J noted that these: 
      
       
        
         
         “included the relationship between the appellant and the premises including with Pracy, that the appellant had been to the premises prior to the robbery, the fingerprint on the money tin which was in the bedroom from which a sum had been taken, and in respect of which the jury could find no satisfactory explanation had been given, together with the actual observations and conversations between the appellant and Detective Flood in Maryborough and Detective Flood’s observation at Pialba”. 
         
        
        
       I shall comment on these particular matters. 
        
       
     40    Pracy knew the appellant well enough to regard him as a “sort of a friend”. The appellant had been to Ms Norris’ house on a number of occasions and according to Pracy the appellant had the run of the house and was allowed to remain in the house while Pracy was outside. I do not think that these matters advanced the Crown’s case significantly. Indeed, it may be thought that the appellant would have been recognised, even with a balaclava. He was not. 
      
       
     41    In fact, Pracy admitted that he had told the appellant’s solicitor that, as far as he was concerned, the appellant was not one of the offenders. He said that the taller of the two offenders was taller and bigger than the appellant while the shorter offender was much fatter than the appellant. He said that the offenders called him “Ed” whereas “everybody calls me Eddie”. He said that he would clearly have recognised the voice of the appellant, but did not do so. I would add to this the fact that the Crown witnesses described the sloppy joe worn by the offender as having a distinctive diamond pattern which the appellant’s sloppy joe did not have. 
      
       
     42    As regards the fingerprint on the money tin, Abadee J, in his reasons, noted that at the trial the appellant did not seek to explain “why he would have touched the money tin on any alleged prior visit, irrespective of whether such had been kept by Ms Norris in a kitchen, in the dining room or in her bedroom, where she said it was located at the time of the robbery”. The particular significance of the money tin arose from the fact that money had been taken from it during the robbery. 
      
       
     43    Flood was a detective from Maryborough in Queensland. He gave evidence about a conversation he had with the appellant on 11 May 1988 when the appellant told him that he was leaving that day for Sydney. Later that day he went to a house in Pialba, about thirty five kilometres from Maryborough, where the appellant was apparently living and saw that clothing had been removed from the room. The evidence of Flood was dealt with at trial as establishing an intention on the part of the appellant to be in Sydney on 12 May 1988, and this tended to refute the appellant’s alibi. 
      
       
     44    Abadee J was of the view that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. Clarke JA agreed with Abadee J. 
      
       
     45    Allen J agreed that the appeal should be dismissed but said that he did so with some “misgiving”. His Honour considered that, although he was not persuaded that there had been any substantial risk of miscarriage of justice, Urquhart DCJ should have given the jury greater assistance in evaluating the evidence as to the oral admissions and the unsigned handwritten statement.  
      
       
     46    Allen J did not regard as entirely satisfactory the Crown evidence that the appellant’s explanation for not signing the statement was that he first wanted to see his solicitor as he was concerned with the suggestion that he was involved in a sexual assault. His Honour pointed out that the statement did not refer to any sexual assault.  
      
       
     47    Allen J referred to the descriptions of the offenders given by those in the house that positively excluded the appellant and indicated that he regarded this as evidence that tended to point to the innocence of the appellant.  
      
       
     48    Allen J was of the opinion that the case was one which “comes close to the borderline the crossing of which would have required this Court to interfere”, but nevertheless, in the end, was not persuaded that the court should interfere.  
      
       
     49    Since then, fresh evidence has emerged in relation to O’Connell and Rupp. The fresh new evidence emanates from certain findings by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in connection with O’Connell and the inquiry undertaken by Graham DCJ. It is now necessary to examine the fresh evidence. 
      
       
     50    O’Connell pleaded guilty in the District Court to seven counts of giving false evidence before the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and two of conspiracy to bribe. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment with a minimum term of nine months. The offences involved O’Connell selling confidential information to private inquiry agents. When called to give evidence before ICAC he admitted his own corruption but lied about those to whom he sold information. According to the judge who sentenced O’Connell: 
      
       
        
         
         “In admitting his own corruption he lied about those to whom he had sold this information. Five days later he admitted those lies and told the truth. He subsequently resigned from the Police Force. These are serious matters and deserving of a prison sentence.” 
         
        
       
     51    At the inquiry before Graham DCJ, documents from the Police Internal Affairs were produced. These documents disclosed three other areas of complaint against O’Connell. Two were regarded by Graham DCJ as significant and I shall describe them.  
      
       
     52    The first concerned a complaint by a person who asserted that, when arrested in 1991 for armed robbery, he was assaulted by detectives in an interview room at Mt Druitt Police Station. O’Connell was the adopting officer for his disputed confession. The complainant’s allegation was that O’Connell ignored his complaints of assaults, merely replying, “that’s nice”, when the person assaulted told him what had occurred. As Graham DCJ pointed out, this complaint has a number of features similar to the allegations made by the appellant in this case.  
      
       
     53    The second complaint against O’Connell was that in March and April 1988 he improperly contacted Detective Senior Constable Wilding and asked him to exert pressure on an alleged drug dealer, who had been charged by Wilding, to repay the sum of $28,000 to a friend of O’Connell. Internal investigation found that these allegations were not sustained on the basis that O’Connell denied the communications with Wilding and it was thought that there was insufficient evidence to show that the caller was actually O’Connell. Support, nevertheless, was lent to Wilding by contemporaneous notes taken by him and the fact that he immediately reported those calls to his superior. 
      
       
     54    Unfortunately, Graham DCJ did not, in the course of his inquiry, summons O’Connell to attend before him (pursuant to the powers set out in s 474G of the Crimes Act) so as to question him about the two significant complaints against him. Accordingly, it is not now known whether O’Connell will admit the allegations, the subject of the complaints, or not. Unless they are admitted by O’Connell, they are not likely to be admissible in any new trial: R v Richards, unreported, CCA NSW, 3 April 1998 per Simpson J. 
      
       
     55    Nevertheless, the fact that fresh material exists which could form the basis for cross-examining a witness as to his credibility is of some relevance in determining whether a conviction should be quashed: R v Hasenkamp, unreported, CCA NSW, 24 February 1998 (albeit that the relevance is remote, depending as it does on the prospect of the witness admitting the allegations against him: R v Richards, cf the dissenting judgment of Meagher JA in R v Vastag, unreported, CCA NSW, 20 June 1997). 
      
       
     56    It is to be emphasised that, in a case where there may be a reference to this Court under s 474H(2) on the basis of fresh evidence involving collateral allegations against Crown witnesses, it would ordinarily be desirable for the person conducting the inquiry to ascertain, in the course thereof, the attitude of the Crown witnesses to those allegations. Otherwise, should the matter eventually be referred to the court, the admissibility of the allegations concerned will be left in a state of considerable uncertainty. 
      
       
     57    The other fresh evidence was also produced in the inquiry conducted by Graham DCJ. This evidence concerns Rupp and relates to seven complaints made against him. One, in particular, was regarded by Graham DCJ as being of some significance. These were complaints by the Petrinovic brothers concerning their arrests and interrogations in May 1987. Frank Petrinovic complained that Detective Rudd, with whom Rupp had a close working relationship, acted improperly in many respects. These included denying Petrinovic access to a solicitor, threatening him, allowing him to inject heroin as an inducement to sign certain photographs, assaulting him and forging his signature on the photographs.  
      
       
     58    I accept the submission made on behalf of the Crown that it is highly unlikely, in all the circumstances, that Rupp would admit to any of the Petrinovic complaints. On that basis, I consider that these complaints have little significance, if any, to the present inquiry. This conclusion underlines the consequences of the omission to question Rupp. 
      
       
     59    I turn now to the submission of counsel for the appellant that the appellant is entitled, as of right, to the conviction being quashed and a verdict of not guilty being entered. This requires the application of the principles laid down by Barwick CJ in Ratten v The Queen at 518. 
      
       
     60    The principal evidence against the appellant is that of Fluke and Mainstone. Their evidence is not directly affected by any of the fresh evidence. Only corroborative evidence is tainted. A reasonable jury might readily believe Fluke and Mainstone once more at any new trial. For that reason, when regard is had to all the material, I do not have reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt and I am unable to conclude that a verdict of not guilty should be entered. 
      
       
     61    I now proceed to the next question that arises, namely, did the absence of the fresh evidence result in a miscarriage of justice such that, in the absence of any other discretionary considerations, the Court would order a new trial. This question requires the application of the principles set out in Ratten v The Queen at 519 and Mickelberg v The Queen at 273. 
      
       
     62    There is little doubt that the evidence of O’Connell was of importance in the trial judge’s decision to admit the written statement at the conclusion of the voir dire proceeding. The absence of the fresh evidence at the trial would have made it far easier for the jury to believe O’Connell and, in turn, the other police witnesses. 
      
       
     63    I agree with Abadee J that the admissions allegedly made by the appellant to the police were of considerable significance to the results of the trial. This underlies the serious misgivings of Allen J. The matters that troubled his Honour now loom large in the light of the fresh evidence. In particular, the evidence of identification that excludes the appellant and the failure of Pracy to recognise the appellant gain considerably in weight once doubt is caste on the confessional evidence. Also now of particular importance is the unconvincing evidence as to the explanation given by the appellant (according to the police) for failing to sign the statement. This has to be taken with the fact that the appellant was prepared to sign three other statements but not the incriminating one.  
      
       
     64    I appreciate that the fingerprint testimony must carry some weight. But a jury might consider that the appellant might have handled the money tin in his other visits to the house.  
      
       
     65    Regard must be had to the evidence of Flood, but I do not think that his evidence is conclusive, even when taken with all the other prosecution evidence.  
      
       
     66    It is also necessary to bear in mind that, as I have mentioned, the evidence of Fluke and Mainstone is not directly affected by the fresh evidence. 
      
       
     67    Taking into account all the material, and approaching the evidence in accordance with the principles expressed in Ratten v The Queen at 519, that is, “upon that view most favourable to an appellant”, I consider that the matters tending to establish the appellant’s innocence give rise to a significant possibility that a jury would acquit the appellant. 
      
       
     68    In the circumstances, I consider that the fresh evidence, on its own, entitles the appellant to orders quashing the conviction and granting a new trial. It remains to have regard to any discretionary factors which may establish that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to order a new trial. In that event, as I have explained, the appellant would be entitled to an order for acquittal on discretionary grounds. 
      
       
     69    It is first necessary, however, to deal with the argument raised by counsel for the appellant that it would be open to the Court merely to quash the conviction, not make an order for the entry of a verdict of acquittal, but order that there be no re-trial (or make no order that there be a re-trial). This was put as an alternative submission in the event of the court concluding that the appellant was not entitled to a verdict of acquittal as of right.  
      
       
     70    The starting point in considering this submission is s 6(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “Subject to the special provisions of this Act, the court shall, if it allows an appeal under s 5(1) against conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered”. 
         
        
        
       The relevant “special provision” is s 8(1), which provides: 
        
        
         
         “On an appeal against a conviction on indictment, the court may, either of its own motion, or on the application of the appellant, order a new trial in such a manner as it thinks fit, if the Court considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and, that having regard to all the circumstances, such miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the court is empowered to make”. 
         
        
       
     71    Section 6(2) empowers this Court to quash the conviction, direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered. Section 8(1) empowers this Court, in the alternative, if it considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, to quash the conviction and to order a new trial. In my opinion, the sections do not empower the Court to order that no new trial should be held. Nor do they empower the Court to quash the conviction and make no other order. 
      
       
     72    Counsel for the appellant relied on the following remarks of Grove J (with whom James J agreed) in R v Hasenkamp: 
      
       
        
         
         “It has been a long-standing practice of the Court not to exercise discretion to order a new trial where the sentence imposed as a result of the quashed conviction has been served”. 
         
        
        
       His Honour did not make any reference to the entering of a verdict of acquittal and no order was made to that effect. The Court merely ordered that the verdict of guilty should be quashed and noted that a new trial should not be ordered.  
        
       
     73    In the course of his reasons, Grove J referred to Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v Fowler where the High Court held that the legislation concerned (the Nauru equivalent of s 6(1) and s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act) empowered the Supreme Court of Nauru, if it allowed an appeal against conviction, to quash the conviction and either direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered or, if the interests of justice so required, to order a new trial. Accordingly, the remarks of the High Court in that case were predicated on the assumption that, if the Court allowed an appeal against conviction, quashed the conviction and considered that the interests of justice did not require a new trial, it would “direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered”. The reliance by Grove J on this authority, and his Honour’s conclusion that the interests of justice did not require a new trial, indicate, in my view, that it was implicit in his reasons that a verdict of acquittal was to be the result of the orders made, and the omission to make an express order to that effect was an oversight. In my view, the reference by Grove J to the “long-standing practice of the Court” was solely directed to the discretion to be exercised “where the sentence imposed as a result of the quashed conviction has been served”, namely, in that event, to order that a verdict of acquittal be entered and no new trial ordered.  
      
       
     74    R v Bruno, unreported, CCA NSW, 7 July 1997 is similar to R v Hasenkamp. In this case, the appeal against conviction was allowed, the conviction was quashed, the Court determined that a new trial should not be ordered, and made no order entering a verdict of acquittal. The appeal succeeded because of a defect in the directions to the jury concerning identification evidence. Hence, a miscarriage of justice occurred. The reason why a new trial was not ordered was because of the length of the period the appellant had been in custody and the fact that he had stood trial on the charges in question three times. Thus, on the grounds of the interests of justice, no new trial was ordered. The Court’s reasoning was typical of that exemplified in cases such as King v The Queen at 427, 432 to 433, Gerakiteys v The Queen (1984) 153 CLR 317 at 330 and 331, and Spies v The Queen at 1283. Those cases treat a verdict of acquittal, in effect, as being a corollary to a decision not to order a new trial. Again, it seems to me, with respect, that it was implicit in the reasoning of the Court in R v Bruno that the appellant was entitled to a verdict of acquittal, and it was merely by oversight that an order to that effect was not made. 
      
       
     75    There are many cases where this Court has upheld an appeal against conviction, refused on discretionary grounds to order a new trial, and ordered that a verdict of acquittal be entered. Examples are R v Honeysett (1987) 10 NSWLR 638, R v Gilbert, unreported, CCA NSW, 10 December 1998 and R v Robinson [1999] NSWCCA 172. 
      
       
     76    R v Gilbert, unreported, CCA NSW, 10 December 1998 is a graphic illustration of the correct approach. This Court upheld an appeal against convictions on two counts, described as the second and third counts. Grove J (with whom Levine and Dowd JJ agreed) considered that a new trial should be ordered in respect of the second count, and such an order was made. His Honour came to a different conclusion as to the third count but explained that this was “because the sentence is already served and not because of any finding as to the quality of the verdict”. Thus, he proposed that a verdict and judgment of acquittal be entered on the third count and those were the orders of the Court.  
      
       
     77    Accordingly, I do not uphold the submission that the Court is empowered to uphold an appeal against conviction, quash the conviction, decline to order that a verdict of acquittal be entered, and order that no new trial be held, or decline to order a new trial. 
      
       
     78    I turn now to the question whether, on discretionary grounds, a verdict of acquittal should be entered.  
      
       
     79    It was common cause that, were the conviction, the subject of this appeal, to be quashed, the date of commencement of the overall term of eight years imprisonment imposed by Viney DCJ would have to be varied. That is because that term was directed to commence at the expiry of the five year minimum term for the sentence imposed by Urquhart DCJ. It was also common cause that, were the conviction to be quashed, it would be necessary to direct that the overall sentence imposed by Viney DCJ be regarded as having commenced on the date that the appellant commenced serving the term of imprisonment imposed by Urquhart DCJ. 
      
       
     80    Were the conviction so to be quashed and the overall sentence imposed by Viney DCJ so to be regarded, the appellant would have been eligible for parole in respect thereof in January 1996 and the full term of aggregate imprisonment imposed by Viney DCJ would have expired on 8 January 2000. 
      
       
     81    Accordingly, were the conviction to be quashed and the overall sentence imposed by Viney DCJ to be so varied, it would follow that the appellant would have served some fourteen months in excess of the full term of that sentence and would have lost the opportunity of being released on appeal more than five years earlier than the date on which he would be released by reason of the quashing of the conviction. 
      
       
     82    Were a new trial to be held and the appellant convicted, the sentence that would then have to be imposed would have to take into account the extra period of approximately fourteen months which the appellant has spent in prison and the opportunity for earlier release that he has lost.  
      
       
     83    That being so, it is likely that, were a new trial to be held, and the appellant convicted afresh, the sentence imposed would not involve a further term of imprisonment. Put another way, the appellant has, in effect, served all (or at least a substantial portion) of the sentence likely to be imposed if, at some future time, he were lawfully convicted of the offence the subject of this appeal. In those circumstances, as a matter of discretion, I would not order a new trial and would direct that a verdict of acquittal be entered. 
      
       
     84    In the circumstances, I propose that the appeal be upheld, the conviction quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered. 
      
       
     85    WOOD CJ AT CL: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Ipp AJA. I agree with his reasons and the orders he proposes. 
      
       
     86    SIMPSON J: I agree that the conviction must be quashed. I adhere to the views I expressed in R v Hasenkamp, unreported, NSWCCA, 12 December 1997, that, in the ordinary course it is preferable that the consequential order be for a new trial rather than judgment of acquittal. That view applies where the grounds for quashing the conviction involves some error in the conduct of the trial, or the availability of fresh evidence. It does not, of course, apply where the reason for quashing the conviction is that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction. My views so expressed are reinforced by the passage in the decision of the High Court in Spies v R [2000] HCA 43; 74 ALJR 1263 at para 104, per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. 
      
       
     87    Application of that principle, in the present case, is complicated by the need to adjust the commencement date of the applicant’s subsequent sentence. For that reason I agree that the appropriate order in this case is to enter a verdict of acquittal.

      CORAM: GREG JAMES, J. 
      
       SMART, AJ. 
       
        
      MONDAY 26 MARCH 2001 
      
      REGINA v. CN 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Williams in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney on 10 May 2000. The applicant had pleaded guilty to two offences under s.25(2) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  
     2   Those offences were that he had supplied a prohibited drug of not less than the commercial quantity. The drug in question, as appears from the facts sheet that was before his Honour, on the first charge was heroin, he having supplied bags of that heroin in accordance with a mode of operation which had been adopted some time previously. The drug in question on the second charge was cocaine. 
     3   In addition, there was a matter of goods in custody on a Form 1. 
     4   The quantities involved in the two offences being, on the first charge, some 629 grams and on the second charge, some 400 grams, the commercial quantity of each drug being prescribed as 250 grams. 
     5   The goods in respect of which the goods in custody charge applied, was some $48,000 found in his possession on the same day. 
     6   The offence of supply carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.  
     7   The applicant had pleaded guilty before the magistrate and the matters went forward under s.51A of the Justices Act 1902. On each of them, his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for three years and six months to commence on 27 April 2000 and to expire on 26 October 2003. 
     8   His Honour imposed a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on 27 April 2000 and to expire on 27 October 2001. His Honour directed that the sentences he had imposed be served wholly in a detention centre, the applicant being aged 16 at the time of sentence. 
     9   It has been powerfully argued by Mr. Boulton of counsel on the applicant's behalf that his Honour fell into error. Indeed, it has been argued that his Honour fell into error in that the sentence, notwithstanding that it was directed to be served in a detention centre, particularly having regard to the applicant's vulnerability arising from his deprived home circumstances and his age and naivety, was manifestly excessive. 
     10   It is further argued that his Honour erred in law in the significance his Honour attached to general deterrence, particularly in the context that it was necessary for his Honour to weigh the matter of general deterrence as is appropriate in the case of juveniles as of less significance in the individual sentence than it might be in the case of an adult, having regard to the increased prospects of rehabilitation that a juvenile offender might ordinarily enjoy. 
     11   Further, it is argued that there was, and his Honour noted it, substantial evidence before him of the particular prospects for rehabilitation, this intelligent and otherwise competent applicant, enjoyed. 
     12   His Honour embarked on an extensive review, not only of the personal circumstances of the applicant, and the circumstances whereby he came to commit these offences, having fallen under the deleterious influence of a man variously named John-John or Johnson Su, who had ruthlessly employed him as a courier in the organised dealing with the drugs, but also reviewed the 41 character references that were provided as to those facets of the accused's character at the time, which were plainly highly estimable. 
     13   His Honour found in the applicant's favour that he had assisted the police and, in particular, attempted to assist the identification of the man John-John. 
     14   His Honour had noted, however, that the estimated street value of the drugs seized was some $500,000 and that the applicant had apparently committed the offences, as he said at question 293 in his interview:- 
      
       
        
        ""It was manifestly because they offered me power which was like me - it wasn't really money, I mean money was a bonus, but there was the thrill of being invincible"". 
        
       
     15   Mr. Boulton, in support of his argument that the applicant didn't really understand what it was he was doing, or getting into, has also referred us to various portions of the applicant's interview to similar intent at question and answer 296, 304, 305 and 306, and submitted that what the applicant was doing was not carrying out the offences out of greed, but out of a naive 16-year old's tough-guy stance to assist his being accepted by those who could supply the deficit in his life and home environment arising from the absence of a male parent in those deprived circumstances to which I have referred. 
     16   Whatever be the cause of the applicant embarking on this behaviour, one can only share the trial judge's view that the offending was most serious and was of such a character as would have, had the offender been an adult and in full recognition of what he was doing, attracted a most substantial custodial sentence to be served in an adult prison. 
     17   But the sentences his Honour imposed were sentences that were to be served in a detention centre. It is properly conceded by Mr. Boulton, in my view, that the order directing the sentence be served in a detention centre does operate by way of mitigation of the severity of the nature of the penalty his Honour imposed, but it is accepted by both counsel, and I accept also, that his Honour would have fallen into error were he to have extended the term that he might otherwise have imposed in recognition of his willingness to give such a direction. In that regard, it is not suggested that one can find in his Honour's remarks on sentence any indication that he so fell into that error. 
     18   His Honour did say in respect of the submission made at trial and made by Mr. Boulton here, that he found the applicant knew what he was doing and knew what he was doing was wrong, and his Honour said that, in the context that the appellant had participated in other offences of a similar nature before. So it was difficult for his Honour to accept that this was a first, or isolated, offence. 
     19   It may be that the motive the applicant had for the commission of the offence was not the customary motive of greed. It may be that it was a motive such as might tend to accord with the recklessness of a teenager and it may be that what was done was done by him because he was preyed upon, being significantly disadvantaged by his family circumstances, but nonetheless, one has to agree with his Honour's conclusion that what he did by participating in the trade was extremely reprehensible. 
     20   His Honour concluded (page 17 of his remarks on sentence):- 
      
       
        
        ""Had he not been arrested, it is difficult to believe that he would have stopped behaving in the way that he was. There is nothing in the facts that suggests he was about to alter his behaviour in any way. In my view these offences are too serious to be dealt with under the Children's (Criminal Proceedings) Act and must be dealt with at law. It is also my view that considerations of general deterrence and the protection of the public far outweigh subjective features of the young person and that a custodial sentence is required"". 
        
       
     21   His Honour expressly adverted to the principle that, where young people commit adult offences, as they approach adulthood and adult knowledge, they progressively lose the opportunity of being treated in the more lenient way provided by the legislation dealing with children and the degree of punishment will depend on the severity and the degree of offending. 
     22   It appears that his Honour was there having regard to the objective he had earlier referred to in his remarks concerning those objects of passing sentence upon children as are referred to in s.9 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. Those objectives include that referred to in s.6(b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions:- 
      
       
        
        ""s.6(b) That children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions. Because of their state of dependency and immaturity, they require guidance and assistance."" 
        
       
     23   Because of their state of dependency and maturity, they require guidance and assistance. 
     24   His Honour accepted that the applicant, because of his relative lack of maturity and the deleterious influence of the older person to whom I referred, vulnerable as he was by reason of the lack of appropriate male figures in his life, and at a particularly difficult period of adolescence, did not have the same maturity to resist involvement as an adult might be expected to have had. 
     25   His Honour took into account his age and rehabilitative prospects and the need for a period of rehabilitation within the community. But his Honour had regard, as well, as having regard to what was patent by way of contrition, to the seriousness of the offence which his Honour concluded meant that questions of deterrence were not as much to be put to one side as they might be with other offenders in other circumstances. 
     26   In my view his Honour plainly held that both personal and general deterrence needed to be emphasised in a difficult situation. 
     27   It was contended that his Honour fell into error in doing that. I do not see that he did. Having regard both to personal and general deterrence in the circumstances found by his Honour, I do not conclude the sentence showed such an error as was asserted. 
     28   It was contended that the applicant did not understand the seriousness of what he was doing. His Honour, in my view, properly found that the applicant did. 
     29   Insofar as his Honour discounted the knowledge an adult might have had of the seriousness of the conduct, nonetheless, he was not required to make, nor would the evidence support the making of any finding that the applicant didn't, to a considerable extent, realise how serious his conduct was. 
     30   The submission was made that the total sentence was too long, having regard to the matters his Honour did take into account, in particular the full confession, plea and the assistance. 
     31   His Honour took into account, and expressed, as I understand it and this is conceded to be the case, all matters to which one might properly have regard as relevant for the determination of the appropriate sentence. The submission, it seems, really is a submission that the sentence, even when one takes into account that it be directed to be served wholly in a detention centre, is manifestly excessive. 
     32   Having regard, however, to the totality of the criminality involved in what the applicant did on this occasion, in the context that it cannot be treated as an isolated or first offence, notwithstanding what there is to show the prospects of the applicant for rehabilitation, I am not persuaded that his Honour fell into such an error as would warrant the intervention of the court when one comes to consider that his Honour's decision was a discretionary one and the materials, at the end of the day, do not disclose that the sentence, as his Honour passed it, was outside the range of sentences available to him to select at law. 
     33   I would, therefore, conclude that, although leave to appeal should be granted, the matter having been fully argued, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     34   SMART, AJ: I agree. 
     35   GREG JAMES, J: The order of the court will be leave to appeal is granted. The appeal is dismissed.

      CORAM: GREG JAMES, J. 
      
       SMART, AJ. 
       
        
      MONDAY 26 MARCH 2001 
      
      REGINA v. DUC THUAN PHAM 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   GREG JAMES, J: The applicant, Duc Thuan Pham, seeks leave to appeal from sentences imposed upon him in the District Court of New South Wales on 15 December 1999. 
     2   Those offences were imposed for, firstly, a crime of supply prohibited drug under s.25(1) of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985, an offence punishable by maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment and, secondly, an offence of supply prohibited drug of not less than the commercial quantity under s.25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, an offence punishable by a maximum period of 20 years' imprisonment. 
     3   For the first offence the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of two years' penal servitude to commence on 17 April 1999 and to expire on 16 April 2001. On the second offence the applicant was sentenced to penal servitude for six years to commence on 17 April 1999, to expire on 16 April 2005. His Honour directed a minimum term to commence on the commencement date of the sentences of four years together with an additional term of two years. 
     4   The offences were committed when the applicant had attracted the attention of police as a supplier of heroin. He was approached by undercover police officers and in the course of the first transaction supplied slightly over seven grams of heroin for the sum of $1,900 in cash. During the same conversation he agreed to supply a pound of heroin. 
     5   In later discussions he agreed to supply and arranged for the supply of 10 ounces of heroin for a sum of $68,000. 
     6   He involved his wife in the delivery of the 10 ounces of heroin. She was arrested with that heroin in her possession. 
     7   The trial judge held that he had committed the offence in circumstances where he had an addiction. He rejected the applicant's contention that the applicant had been dealing with suppliers to him whom he knew only by their first names. He was given the utilitarian benefit of a plea and regard was had to his subjective circumstances, in particular, his previous drug problems, his separation from his wife and his express willingness to enter a rehabilitation programme, but his bad record was seen as of no assistance to him, in particular his record for offences against the drug laws.  
     8   His Honour reached the view that the criminality of these matters, having regard to the Judicial Commission's statistics, was more towards the top of the range than the middle of the range by virtue of the quantity of the drug involved alone.  
     9   His Honour imposed the fixed term as it was subsumed within the minimum term imposed on the other count.  
     10   The applicant has contended in writing, he having elected not to attend, that the sentence exceeds what was called for on the basis that he has been deprived of the society of his daughter and son and they cannot come to visit him in the institution at which he is confined at Junee, that he had been the subject of an attack in gaol after sentence and that he had attempted to remain positive about his rehabilitation but because of the attack he has to serve his sentence in protection. He is of the view, he said, that because of his plea of guilty he would receive a discount in sentence. 
     11   As to the last, it is apparent that he has received the discount that his Honour referred to in his remarks on sentence.  
     12   It is also asserted that the sentencing judge had failed to give proper weight to the special circumstances. As noted from the Crown's written submissions, his Honour had found that the applicant would need prolonged and intensive supervision on release, but in the context of sentencing for the two offences had reflected that in the way in which his Honour structured the sentence. 
     13   It is trite law that the minimum term or non-parole period must reflect to some extent the objective seriousness of the offence as well as the head sentence. I see no basis on which his Honour fell into error in that regard. I see no basis on which it can be contended that his Honour fell into error on the other matters put forward as affecting the trial judge's decision, such as the failure to give a sufficient discount or reduction in sentence by reason of plea of guilty, the timing of the plea or for assistance to the police. 
     14   As to the other matter to which the applicant refers, that is the events that have occurred to the applicant after sentence, it is not open to this court to intervene in that regard since those matters do not fall within the well-known exceptions to the rule that the sentence is to be considered in the light of the evidence before the sentencing judge. 
     15   I am of the view that because the applicant is unrepresented and because we have had to deal with the matter as we have, the appropriate course is to dismiss the application for leave to appeal. 
     16   SMART AJ: I agree. 
     17   GREG JAMES J: The order of the court will be as I have indicated.

      ROADS AND TRAFFIC AUTHORITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES v Jeremy Andrew FLETCHER and LEIGHTON CONTRACTORS PTY LIMITED 
      
     FACTSThe first respondent was injured when he rode his motorcycle off the Hume Highway in New South Wales. The appellant, the Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW, owned the highway and had a duty to keep it in repair. At the time of the accident, the appellant had contracted the second respondent, Leighton Contractors, to carry out road work at the area where the accident occurred. A perception that the highway continued straight ahead, rather than curving to the right as it in fact did, caused the first respondent to crash through some orange webbing on the side of the road and into a ditch which was part of the recent road works. The trial judge found both the appellant and second respondent negligent and apportioned liability at 2/3, 1/3 respectively. The first respondent was held to be guilty of contributory negligence to the extent of 10%. The appellant appealed both these findings. HELD(i) There is no reason to disturb the trial Judge’s findings on negligence and contributory negligence. Whilst the first respondent did fail to notice a number of warning signs on the road, in the circumstances, that was not extraordinary. The appellant ought to have realized that a danger existed and taken the precaution of erecting chevron signs to deal with it. (ii) per Meagher JA, (Priestley JA agreeing): The trial Judge’s finding on contribution should not be disturbed. The High Court has affirmed the duty of an appellate court not to disturb the findings of a trial judge on a question of apportionment, except in the most extraordinary circumstances. There is nothing wrong in her Honour’s orders as to apportionment.  
      per Handley JA (dissenting): The apportionment of the trial Judge as between the defendants miscarried and this Court is entitled to intervene. The major responsibility was that of the second respondent in terms of both culpability and causative potency. Accordingly, the appeal should be allowed on this issue and an apportionment of 1/3 to the appellant, 2/3 to the second respondent substituted. (iii) per Meagher JA, (Priestley & Handley JJA agreeing):  On the issue of damages; an error in the amount of $4,860 was conceded by the first respondent in respect of future treatment pharmaceuticals. There is no basis to disturb the assessment of any other item of damages.

      ROADS AND TRAFFIC AUTHORITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES v Jeremy Andrew FLETCHER and LEIGHTON CONTRACTORS PTY LIMITED 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1   MEAGHER JA: On 7 September 1984 the respondent, Mr Fletcher, was travelling South on the Hume Highway on his motorcycle when he sustained severe injuries resulting from his cycle going off the road. The appellant in CA 40039/99 and first respondent in 40059/99, Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales (the “RTA”), was the owner of the road and had a duty to keep it in repair. The first respondent in CA 40039/99 and appellant in CA 40059/99, Leighton Contractors Pty Limited (“Leightons”) was on that day in the middle of doing road work on behalf of the RTA by altering the Highway so as to divert it over the Jugiong Creek. Mr Fletcher sued both the RTA and Leightons. He succeeded against both, obtaining a verdict in his favour from her Honour Acting Judge Bolan in the sum of $765,785.00. Her Honour found that he had been guilty of contributory negligence to the extent of 10%. These two appeals are from those decisions. 
     2   Mr Fletcher was born on 7 May 1962. He was then aged 22 at the time of the accident. He left school half way through year ten, when he enlisted in the Royal Australian Navy. He served in the Navy for many years, indeed until seven years after the accident in respect of which he sued. He seems to have been a particularly fit young man. He swam regularly. He played squash and tennis. He also played rugby league (football) and rugby union (football). He was also an accomplished motor cyclist. 
     3   On 7 September 1984 he and a friend of his called Clarke started to drive their cycles from Nowra, where they were stationed, to Wagga Wagga. They travelled via Kangaroo Valley to the Hume Highway, before Goulburn. They left Nowra at about 3pm, having worked extra hours the previous four days to have Friday afternoon off. Mr Fletcher’s was the “lead” cycle, going about 25m in front of that of Mr Clarke. 
     4   They stopped at McDonald’s Restaurant at Goulburn for a meal. They then proceeded South, without incident, to Yass. There they refuelled, had cigarettes and chips, and donned wet weather gear. Thence they went southwards toward Jugiong. It was on the road from Yass to Jugiong that disaster befell them.  
     5   At the point of the accident, the Hume Highway, instead of continuing straight ahead, took a curve to the right. It was at this point that Leightons, under the supervision of the RTA, was conducting its road works. At this point, there is a road now known as Benangaroo Road which is in alignment with the Highway. In other words, other things being equal, a driver going south towards Jugiong at night, seeing a car coming north on Benangaroo Road, would get the impression that Benangaroo Road was a continuation of the highway. At the very moment Mr Fletcher was approaching the curve, a Mrs Winkler was driving her motor car down Benangaroo Road toward him, her lights on low beam. He then drove his cycle towards her car, instead of following the curve to the right. He drove through some orange webbing on his left (on the side of the road), and then into a ditch (which was part of the recent road works). He woke up in hospital, with no recollection of what happened. Mr Clarke said that, before the accident, he had made the same mistake and assumed that the road on which Mrs Winkler was travelling was the same road as that on which he was travelling.  
     6   In the circumstances it is difficult to see what was the main cause of the accident except the illusion that Benangaroo Road was an extension of the Highway. Her Honour so held, and I cannot see that any alternative was open to her. However, for a person in Mr Fletcher’s position to suffer from that illusion, he had to be oblivious of a number of warning signs. He could not have understood the significance of the line marking the side of the road or of the centre line marking. However, he must have been blind to a “curve” sign on the side of the road, with a speed sign underneath it (indicating that drivers should proceed at a speed of not less than 85 or 95 kph). Further, the significance of the fact that orange webbing on star-picket fencing ran alongside the road to his left must have escaped him. He hardly paid any conscious attention to these signals of danger: he must simply have been so absorbed by the oncoming lights that he forgot to consider what the signs meant, if he noticed them at all. With respect to all the submissions to the contrary, that does not seem to be extraordinary. This is particularly so when none of the signs impacted on Mr Clarke’s consciousness, except that when he noticed his friend crashing through the webbing he noticed the existence of that webbing. 
     7   It was submitted by both counsel for each appellant that Mr Fletcher’s failure to keep a constant look-out must have been so great that it was his conduct which caused the accident. Certainly he did fail to keep a proper look-out, and in his state of fatigue that is hardly to be wondered at; but in any situation it is impossible always to keep a proper look-out, and in his case the vision of an oncoming car fixated him (although hardly dazzled him) to the extent that fulfilling his primary duty of looking straight ahead distracted him from noticing warning signs on his left. The defendant ought to have realized that such an emergency might arise, and taken the precaution of erecting chevron signs (which are normally of sufficient size to seize the attention of the most distracted driver) in order to deal with it. I can see no reason to tamper with her Honour’s 10% figure for contributory negligence. 
     8   On the question of contribution between defendants, her Honour found that the RTA was 2/3 liable, Leightons 1/3. I would not disturb that finding. The High Court has affirmed most emphatically the duty of an appellate Court not to disturb the findings of a trial judge on a question of apportionment, except in the most extraordinary circumstances. The Court of Appeal has laid down the same principles, although it has not always acted in accordance with them. This is no occasion to depart from the High Court injunction. 
     9   The RTA owned the land, it was the repair authority, it had complete control over the relevant road and its environs. It must have had enormous experience of signage. It must have had a duty in the law of tort to erect such signage as was necessary to minimize the risk of accidents. It had an inspector on its staff whose job it was to ride up and down the relevant parts of the Highway at least once a day (he was not called). It also had another inspector whose job it was to do much the same thing (neither was he called). 
     10   On the other hand, Leightons is hardly innocent of blame. In the first place the webbing to which I have referred and which was erected by Leightons, was at the time of the accident left in a dusty state, and was draped over a series of sign posts in such a way that the retro-reflective reflectors on each part were obscured. In the second place, the RTA seems to have endeavoured to contract to assign most of its duties to Leightons. 
     11   Thus, the contract between RTA and Leightons provides, by clause 15,  
      
       
        
        “the contractor shall provide, erect and maintain barricades, guards, fencing, temporary roadways, footpaths, signs and lighting and shall provide and maintain all watching and traffic flagging lawfully required by any public or any authority if necessary for the protection of the work under the contract or of other property or for the safety and convenience of the public and others and shall remove the same when no longer required.” 
        
       
       
      Thus did the RTA attempt to assign its responsibilities. 
       
       
      I can see nothing wrong in her Honour’s orders as to apportionment; no error of law; no mis-statement of fact; no omission to take any relevant fact into consideration; no palpably unjust result. Obviously, she must have considered that the RTA’s superior position and greater knowledge edged its responsibility higher than Leighton’s. 
       
     12   As I have said, the damages which her Honour awarded Mr Fletcher amounted to $765,785. That figure consisted of the following components: 
      
       
        
        1. General damages $180,000. 
         
        2. Out of pocket expenses $ 23,336. 
         
        3. Interest on past general damages $ 22,400. 
         
        4. Past wage loss $ 39.540. 
         
        5. Interest on past wage loss $ 6,174. 
         
        6. Past domestic assistance $ 32,760. 
         
        7. Interest on past domestic assistance $ 18,428. 
         
        8. Past handyman assistance $ 24,024. 
         
        9. Interest on handyman assistance $ 13,514. 
         
        10. Past pharmaceutical expenses $ 3,640. 
         
        11. Interest on past pharmaceutical expenses $ 2,048. 
         
        12. Future treatment pharmaceuticals $ 74,500. 
         
        13. Future handyman and domestic assistance $ 137,629. 
         
        14. Future economic loss  
        $ 272,879. 
        
       
       
        
        TOTAL  
        $ 850,872. 
        
       
       
        
        Less 10% contributory negligence  
        $ 765,785 
        . 
        
       
       
      The correctness of items 2 and 11 is conceded by the appellants. It is conceded by the respondent that item 12 contains a mathematical error of $4,860. 
       
     13   Before I turn to examine the various items in detail, there are, I think, some general observations to make: a) the respondent’s evidence, in its entirety, was accepted by her Honour; b) it was conceded by each appellant that Mr Fletcher had suffered very serious injuries and that fact is reflected in the unusually high figure for out-of-pocket expenses; c) her Honour found that Mr Fletcher had a very stoic attitude to his problems; d) her Honour found that initially Mr Fletcher seemed to have made a remarkable recovery, working at sea for three years without complaint or apparent difficulty, and keeping clear of the medical profession; and e) evidence which her Honour accepted (principally from Dr Searle) shows that the future will not be so rosy. 
     14   Item 1 is general damages in the amount of $180,000. The appellant in each appeal submitted this was too high. I do not think so. The accident led to 14 weeks in hospital. The catalogue of Mr Fletcher’s injuries is as follows: a depressed fracture of the left zygoma; facial bone fractures; injuries to jaw (including dislocation of mandible); fracture to the left clavicle; fractured left ribs; fractured left radius; fractured left femur; fracture to the right pubic ramus; fracture to L5 vertebrae and neighbouring soft tissues; a fractured coccyx; damages to the left hip; diabetes insipidis; head injury, including loss of consciousness; injury to the left knee (probably requiring an operation); laceration to the nose; and restriction of movement to the left eye. Not surprisingly, all these disabilities led to an early retirement from the Navy and caused (and still to some extent causes) a considerable amount of pain. 
     15   Item 3 is interest on past general damages of $22,400. Granted the correctness of her Honour’s figure for general damages, I see nothing wrong with this. 
     16   Item 4: past wage loss $39,540 and interest thereon $6,174: There is no doubt as to the correctness of her Honour’s conclusion that if Mr Fletcher had remained in the Navy he would have been promoted if uninjured, and at the date of the hearing would probably have been a Chief Petty Officer. Her Honour reached the figure of $39,540 by aggregating these amounts: loss of income by reason of missed promotion from the date of the accident, ie 7 September 1984, to 22 September 1995 (the date on which he left the Navy) - $1,000, which seems modest enough; diminution of net weekly income: the average amount of $100 per week for 164 weeks ie. $16,400 which seems to me a trifle on the light side, as the evidence disclosed that the difference between a Chief Petty Officer’s salary and that earned by Mr Fletcher in his present employment for the year ending 30 June 1998 was $348 per week; and loss of service-related benefits @ $135 x 164 weeks - $22,140, which was calculated in a manner I cannot criticize. And, of course, if the figure of $39,540 is correct, as I think it is, the figure of $6,174 must also be correct. 
     17   Items 6 and 7: past domestic assistance of $32,670 and interest thereon of $18,428. The need for domestic assistance was clearly proved, and bearing in mind that no more than the need matters, I can see nothing wrong with either item 6, or the interest thereon in item 7. 
     18   Items 8 and 9: past handyman assistance of $24,024.00 and interest thereon of $13,544. On the face of it this seems excessive. Mr Fletcher claimed three hours per week for 14 years, but such a period would include 3 years at sea, when the need for a handyman’s assistance is scarcely likely. However, her Honour was not misled. Noticing the weakness in his case she extended him only one half of what he sought, 1.5 hours for 14 years. That mode of doing things would remove the discrepancy. I would not interfere. 
     19   Item 12 : future treatment pharmaceuticals, $74,500.00. Apart from the $4,860 mathematical error conceded by the plaintiff, the rest of the figure is acceptable if one accepts, as her Honour did, the gloomy prognostications of Dr. Searle. 
     20   Item 13: future handyman and domestic assistance $137,629. Again, on her Honour’s primary findings of fact this figure seems to me to be unassailable. Her Honour found that most household jobs (like vacuuming and painting) seem to be beyond him, as do gardening jobs, and cooking jobs. Meanwhile his wife, who might normally be expected to do them, is herself incapacitated by some work-related injury. 
     21   Item 14: future economic loss $272,879. Again, on her Honour’s assumptions, I think this figure cannot be attacked. These assumptions are: (a) if uninjured Mr Fletcher would have continued to work in the Navy until he was 55 years old and elsewhere until age 65; (b) as it is, he cannot, in all probability, look forward to being employed by anyone else after age 55; (c) there is a large discrepancy between what he is earning and what he would be earning in the Navy if uninjured; and (d) on Dr. Searle’s report, his chances of continuous employment are rapidly diminishing. 
     22   In my view the appeal should, except for the sum of $4,860, be dismissed with costs. 
     23   PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with Meagher JA’s view of this case and his reasons, except that I doubt that fatigue played any part in the mistake made by Mr Fletcher about the direction of the road. The evidence shows, in my view, that the length of time spent riding the cycles by the two riders in company, and the breaks they took from riding, were sensible and likely to have left them in good condition for riding at the time of the accident. This difference from Meagher JA’s reasons does not affect my overall agreement with his conclusions. 
     24   In my opinion the orders proposed by Meagher JA should be made.25   HANDLEY JA: These reasons need to be read in conjunction with the reasons for judgment of Meagher JA. 
     26   On 7 September 1984 about 7 pm the respondent, Mr Jeremy Fletcher, was injured when he rode his motor cycle off the southbound carriageway of the Hume Highway on a right hand bend near Jugiong. The southbound carriageway immediately before the bend was aligned with Benangaroo Road which had formerly been the site of the Hume Highway but had become a feeder road which served a single property occupied by 4 families with 8 vehicles. Vehicles travelling north along Benangaroo Road at night with their lights on could appear to southbound vehicles on the Highway to be travelling north on the Highway itself. The only artificial lighting on this section of the Highway was that provided by traffic. 
     27   The Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA), or its predecessor, had taken some steps to warn motorists approaching from the north, as Mr Fletcher did, of the presence of the bend. A curve sign and an advisory speed sign had been erected before the start of the bend. The signs were retro-reflective and stood on a post some distance off the left hand side of the carriageway. The post was shown in photographs but its precise location was not established. The bitumen carriageway had a continuous white painted edge or fog line, a few inches in from the edge of the bitumen, and the centre of the carriageway was marked with a broken white line. Both were clearly visible in photographs taken shortly before and shortly after the accident. The trial Judge also found that guide posts had been erected at intervals on the bend with red reflectors facing southbound traffic. The photographs showed that those guide posts were white. 
     28   Fletcher had no recollection of the accident but a companion, Mr Peter Clarke, who was riding a motor cycle about 25 metres behind Fletcher, gave evidence of what had happened. Mr Clarke observed the lights of a car travelling north on Benangaroo Road, and thought that it was travelling towards them on the Hume Highway. He saw Mr Fletcher ride ahead in the direction of the lights of this vehicle without braking or changing direction. Mr Clarke became aware of the bend when he saw the orange coloured plastic webbing illuminated in the headlight of Mr Fletcher’s motor cycle immediately before it went through the webbing. He had not previously been conscious that there was a right hand bend in the Highway at this point. Mr Clarke was able to safely negotiate the bend and bring his motor cycle to a stop before going to render assistance to Fletcher. 
     29   This bend in the Hume Highway and its alignment with Benangaroo Road were the result of work undertaken by the predecessor of the RTA some time between 1960 and 1964. The witnesses at the trial included a Mrs Winkler, the driver of the approaching car, who lived on the property serviced by Benangaroo Road, Mr Reid, the local tow truck operator, and Police Inspector Norton who had been stationed at Jugiong between 1982 and 1986. There was no suggestion from any of these witnesses that there had been any previous accidents of the kind suffered by Fletcher on this part of the Highway during the previous 20 years. 
     30   The trial Judge found that Mr Fletcher had been misled by the lights on Mrs Winkler’s vehicle into believing that the Hume Highway ran straight ahead to the south and that her vehicle was travelling north on the Highway. Northbound traffic on the Highway would have alerted Mr Fletcher to the existence of the bend but there was none. If he had arrived a few seconds later Mrs Winkler’s vehicle would have been moving west as Benangaroo Road turned to enter the Highway at a right angle further along the bend. 
     31   An accident such as that suffered by Mr Fletcher thus required a combination of southbound traffic on the Highway approaching the bend at night, northbound traffic on Benangaroo Road, and the absence of northbound traffic on the Highway. There is no reason for thinking that this combination would not have occurred over the 20 years or so before September 1984 but there was no evidence of any previous accident of this kind. It would be reasonable to suppose that if such accidents had occurred they would have come to the notice of nearby residents, the police and the local tow truck operator. 
     32   In 1984 the Hume Highway was under the control of the RTA. For some time prior to and during September that year Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd (Leighton), under contract with the RTA, had been carrying out earthmoving and road construction works for the conversion of this section of the Highway to dual carriageway. The extensive nature of the earthworks in the vicinity of this bend is shown in the photographs. The work required the construction of a new culvert between Benangaroo Road and the Highway on the southern side of this right hand bend. This had involved the excavation of a pit close to the edge of the carriageway which was 6 feet deep and wide enough to accommodate a utility truck with its driver and passenger doors wide open. 
     33   Leighton had erected webbing along the gravel edge of the southbound lane of the Highway on this section of the curve. The webbing was supported by star pickets erected in front of the white guide posts. It was clearly visible in daylight but was not retro-reflective at night. It appears to have obscured both the guide posts and their red reflectors because neither Mr Fletcher nor Mr Clarke were alerted to the presence of the bend. They also failed to notice either the fog and centre lines on the carriageway, or the curve and advisory speed signs on the post at the side of the Highway. The appellants submitted that the painted lines and signs were sufficient to discharge their duties of care and that the accident was caused by Mr Fletcher’s fatigue and his failure to keep a proper lookout. In the alternative they submitted that his contributory negligence was not properly reflected in the apportionment of 10% made by the trial Judge. 
     34   I have not been persuaded that the trial Judge fell into any error on these issues. A motor cycle rider has to keep a look out for approaching traffic, and Mrs Winkler’s car was not far away. Both riders were acting reasonably in keeping her car under observation, naturally supposing that by doing so they were also keeping their motor cycles on their correct side of the Highway. Mrs Winkler did not say in her evidence that Mr Fletcher’s headlight was on high beam, and the evidence of Mr Clarke that he saw the webbing in Mr Fletcher’s headlight immediately before he crashed through would indicate that his light was on low beam. This would be appropriate in view of the approach of Mrs Winkler’s vehicle. A motor cycle has only a single headlight, and it is not surprising that Mr Fletcher and Mr Clarke failed to notice the curve and advisory speed signs. It appears from the photographs that the post with these signs was some distance from the edge of the gravel verge where the Highway was still straight. It was not established that this post was near the line of sight of a motor cycle rider. 
     35   Before Leighton commenced construction work, drivers approaching this bend at night from the north were warned by the red reflectors on the guide posts in front of them that the Highway made a substantial curve to the right. A driver looking ahead at night and seeing a car approaching along Benangaroo Road also had the reflectors in front of him and was made aware of the right hand bend. Mr Jamieson, the traffic expert called for the plaintiff, whose evidence on most issues was accepted by the Judge, said (Black 158) that these reflectors can be seen at night at long range “much further than 60 metres” and that at night they “define the curve”. This would account for the absence of previous accidents of this type over a long period and explains the occurrence of the present accident within a short time after the guide posts and reflectors had been covered by the webbing. 
     36   I agree therefore that the appeals from the findings of the trial Judge on negligence and contributory negligence should be dismissed. I also agree that the appeals from the Judge’s assessment of damages should fail and substantially for the reasons given by Meagher JA. 
     37   The remaining issue arises on the RTA’s appeal against the contribution ordered as between it and Leighton. The Judge apportioned two thirds of the responsibility for this accident to the RTA and one third to Leighton. Leighton was carrying out the road construction work under a written contract with the RTA dated 16 March 1984 and her Honour reviewed the relevant clauses. 
     38   The RTA employed a Mr Kensit as Works Inspector responsible for supervising Leighton’s performance of the contract over the section 52-57 kms south of Yass. During the period leading up to the accident, he was on duty between 7 am and 5 pm daily while work was in progress and it was his practice to drive the 5 kms length of the Highway adjacent to the works each day. He was available but was not called by the RTA as a witness. The RTA also employed an Inspector at its Maintenance Office Yass, whose duty it was to inspect all the roads in the Yass area, including this part of the Hume Highway, but he was not called either. 
     39   The RTA had decided that the access to Benangaroo Road in its existing configuration should remain open during the carrying out of the works. The Judge found that it then knew or ought to have known that additional signage in the form of retro-reflective chevron markers was necessary at night to prevent a driver being misled by the alignment of Benangaroo Road, particularly when a substantial excavation was to occur in close proximity to the Highway. She found that the webbing on the bend erected by Leighton did not provide adequate warning for southbound motorists, but had obliterated or partially obscured the red reflectors on the guide posts.  
     40   The RTA, as a highway authority which had authorised the carrying out of work on or near the highway, had what has been referred to as a non-delegable duty to users of the highway and could not avoid this duty by delegating its performance to a competent independent contractor. A highway authority is therefore vicariously responsible for the negligence of its independent contractor. See Hardaker v Idle District Council [1896] 1 QB 335 CA. An innocent employer vicariously liable for the negligence of an independent contractor is entitled to be indemnified by the contractor against his liability to a third party. See Lister v Romford Ice & Coal Storage Co Ltd [1957] AC 555; FAI General Insurance Co Ltd v A R Griffiths & Sons Pty Limited (1997) 71 ALJR 651.  
     41   The Judge referred to a number of the clauses in the contract but in my judgment the only relevant provisions were cl 15 “Protection of Persons & Property” and cls 23 and 24 dealing with the authority of the RTA’s Superintendent and his representatives, in the General Conditions of Contract. Clause 15 provided, so far as relevant: 
      
       
        
        “The contractor shall provide, erect and maintain all barricades, guards, fencing, … signs and lighting … … necessary … for the safety and convenience of the public …  
        
       
       
        
        The contractor shall avoid interference with or damage to property on or adjacent to the site …”. 
         
        
       
       
        
       
     42   Clause 23 provided that the work should be executed in accordance with the contract, and any directions from the Superintendent pursuant to its provisions and cl 24 enabled the Superintendent to delegate his powers, duties, discretions and authorities to representatives. 
     43   The Judge referred to special condition 20 which dealt with the opening of works to traffic, cls B4 and B5 in Part B of the Technical Specification “Provision for Traffic” and clauses in the Specification for Control of Traffic at Road and Bridge Works. Special condition 20 was not relevant because no question of opening works to traffic at this bend had arisen before the accident. The scope of Part B of the Technical Specification was defined in cl B 1.01 as covering “the requirements for staging of the works for continuity of traffic flow, the design and construction of sidetracks and the provision of flagmen, sign posting, control devices, lights, barriers and the like to facilitate safe traffic movement and protect persons and property”. It seems that Part B did not apply because the works did not directly affect traffic flow on either the Highway or Benangaroo Road. Clause B4 itself only applied to side roads and private access and was not relevant in any event. Clause B5 gave the Superintendent power to order the contractor to provide “additional traffic control devices”. 
     44   The Specification for Control of Traffic at Road and Bridge Works provided in cl 1 that such works “require the provision of warning and control devices to inform drivers of hazards, to guide traffic safely past temporary obstructions and to protect workmen”. A further provision in this clause specifically directed the Contractor’s attention “to his responsibilities for the protection and regulation of traffic under cl 15 of the General Conditions of Contract”. Clause 11 provided that signs to be used for the warning and guidance of traffic at night shall be reflectorized and the reflecting material should provide a high standard of reflectance and durability. Clause 14 provided that all traffic control devices shall be maintained in good order and in the correct positions day and night and signs shall be clear and legible at all times. This specification appears to have no application as the work near this bend was not being undertaken “on roads or bridges”. 
     45   Clause 39 of the General Conditions conferred a relevant power on the Superintendent to issue directions to Leighton. It provided that if at any time the Superintendent “determines that any remedial, protective … or other like work is urgently necessary … to prevent personal injury to or the death of any person the Superintendent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, notify the contractor of that determination and the contractor shall carry out the work immediately on receipt of that notice …”. 
     46   The Superintendent and his representatives did not exercise this or any other power either to require Leighton to provide additional warning devices on this bend for the protection of southbound traffic or to move the webbing behind the guide posts. The RTA did not rely on the contractual indemnity provided for in cl 18 of the General Conditions or Leighton’s obligation under cl 19 to maintain public risk insurance for the benefit of the RTA as well as itself. 
     47   The RTA’s cross-claim against Leighton which sought contribution or indemnity did not plead the terms of the contract and their breach, but simply sought relief pursuant to the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (the 1946 Act). However at the trial it was permitted, without objection, to tender the contract and rely upon the relevant clauses. 
     48   Clause 15 of the General Conditions made the contractor responsible for the provision of all signs and lighting necessary for the safety of the public, and the contractor was also required to avoid interfering with property on or adjacent to the site. This included the existing white guide posts with red reflectors which faced southbound traffic on this bend. Leighton interfered with these posts by erecting webbing in front of them facing the oncoming traffic. Even if this part of the clause did not apply, the erection of the webbing between the guide posts and the traffic certainly created a need for other signs or lighting to be provided for the protection of southbound traffic at night. 
     49   Her Honour, in finding that the RTA should have known, when letting the contract, that additional signage was required on this bend at this stage of the work, appears to have overlooked the fact that the existing signage and reflectors had proved to be perfectly adequate. In my judgment reasonable care on the part of the RTA did not require that it direct Leighton, at this stage of the work, to provide signage and reflectors in addition to those already in place to warn southbound traffic of the existence of the bend. As Mr Jamieson said the existing reflectors on the guide posts were visible at night at long range and defined the curve for southbound motorists. 
     50   Her Honour was therefore in error in finding that the RTA had been at fault in this respect and that this was the primary cause of the accident. Her Honour found that Leighton had also been at fault in covering the guide posts and reflectors with the webbing and perhaps in demolishing some of the guide posts and failing to replace them. She considered that in this way Leighton had “contributed” to the accident. However in my judgment the covering up of the guide posts was the relevant and critical change in the existing arrangements for warning southbound traffic at night and was the major cause of Mr Fletcher’s accident. 
     51   The Judge did not in terms rely on the failure of RTA’s inspectors to notice that the guide posts and reflectors had been obscured by the webbing and to direct Leighton to make appropriate arrangements to warn southbound traffic either by moving the webbing, or by other means such as the provision of retro-reflective chevron markers. She had however noted that the RTA’s works inspector was available but was not called. This Court should draw the inference that the works inspector could and should have noticed that the guide posts and reflectors had been obscured by the webbing and directed Leighton to do something about it. 
     52   However there was no basis for a further inference that either or both of the RTA’s inspectors had actually noticed that the webbing obscured the reflectors and, although aware of the consequent risk to southbound traffic, had failed to take any action to remove the risk. The RTA was at fault but Leighton were responsible under the contract for providing and maintaining the signs and lighting necessary for the safety of the public and was in breach of its contract. 
     53   As the RTA was not free from personal blame, it was not entitled under the Act to an apportionment from its contractor which indemnified it against all liability to Mr Fletcher. See Voli v Inglewood Shire Council (1963) 110 CLR 74, 110 per Windeyer J. If the RTA had included a claim for breach of contract in its cross-claim, it may well have been entitled to recover damages which would have indemnified it against its liability to Mr Fletcher. Its contributory negligence would not have been a defence in whole or in part to such a claim. See Astley v Austrust Ltd (1999) 197 CLR 1. There is no need to consider the effect of the subsequent legislation which has some retrospective operation. 
     54   A tortfeasor who does not claim damages for breach of contract against a concurrent tortfeasor, but only seeks contribution or indemnity under the Act, is confined to its claim under the Act. See RTA v Scroop & Ors (CA u/r 30/9/98 per Fitzgerald JA at par 14.) However the contract remains relevant in assessing the responsibility of both tortfeasors, as between themselves, for the damage suffered by the plaintiff. In my judgment the responsibility of Leighton was significantly greater than that of the RTA. Leighton was guilty of misfeasance in the form of positive acts which interfered with the existing arrangements for warning southbound traffic. The white guide posts and the reflectors must have been obvious to those involved in the erection of the webbing. The reflectors faced southbound traffic and it should have been obvious that the webbing would prevent southbound motorists seeing the reflectors at night. 
     55   RTA’s negligence was by way of omission in that its inspector failed to notice the negligence of Leighton and do something about it. However he had to supervise road works being carried out by Leighton over a distance of up to 5 kms, and one may infer that he knew that Leighton were contractually responsible for ensuring by signage or otherwise that their activities did not create risks for the public. 
     56   The Judge referred at some length to the decision of this Court in RTA v Scroop (u/r 30/9/98). The RTA had employed Bitupave, an independent contractor, to carry out resurfacing work on the Hume Highway north of Wagga. This created a danger at night for vehicles travelling on the Highway and Bitupave failed to make adequate provision to warn such traffic. The Court found that Bitupave lacked the competence or experience needed for assessing the risks to traffic created by its work, and the measures required for their elimination, that the RTA had this competence and had been directly involved in material decisions and activities. Moreover as Fitzgerald JA said (par 14): “Its culpability was exacerbated by its failure to respond to the police request to improve the markings on the edge of the road following an earlier accident”. The RTA had been told by the police about an accident of the same kind as that later suffered by Mr and Mrs Scroop but had done nothing. The RTA’s culpability was therefore significantly greater than in this case where the RTA received no such warning. The decision in Scroop does not support the Judge’s apportionment. 
     57   In general a party to a contract is entitled to rely on the warranties and other terms included in the contract for his benefit, and the party in breach cannot rely on a breach of duty owed by the innocent party to another. This principle was established in Mowbray v Merryweather [1895] 2 QB 640. The plaintiff employer had purchased tackle from the defendant with the benefit of the warranties of quality implied under the Sale of Goods Act, and had used the tackle in the course of his business. The tackle broke and an employee who was injured recovered damages from the employer. The defect in the tackle could have been discovered by the employer upon reasonable examination but the employer had not taken this precaution and was found liable to his employee for this negligence. The employer sued the supplier for breach of warranty claiming as the damages the amount he had been compelled to pay to his injured employee and recovered. Lord Esher MR said at 643: 
      
       
        
        “It is true that [the worker] could not have recovered unless, as between himself and the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs had been guilty of want of care; but the plaintiffs say that, as between themselves and the defendant, they were not bound to examine the chain because the defendant had warranted it sound, that they had a right to rely on that warranty, and did rely on it, and that the defendant cannot rely on a duty to use due care which was owed, not to him, but to the workman”. 
        
       
       
        
       
     58   This decision was followed by Sugerman J in Mayo v Florida Hotels Pty Ltd (1965) 65 SR (NSW) 41, 49-51, whose dissent was upheld on appeal in Florida Hotels Pty Ltd v Mayo (1965) 113 CLR 588, 597-9 per Barwick CJ, and at 601-2 per Windeyer J. An architect, bound by contract with the building owner to supervise the work of the latter’s employees, no builder having been engaged, was held liable for breach of contract in failing to provide that supervision which resulted in one of the employees suffering personal injuries. The measure of damages were the damages payable by the building owner to the injured worker. 
     59   The decision in Mowbray v Merryweather was approved but distinguished in Lambert v Lewis [1982] AC 225, 275-7. The buyer claimed to be indemnified by the seller against his liability for damages to a third person caused by the breach of a warranty of quality. Lord Diplock held that, although the buyer was prima facie entitled to rely upon the warranty, he could not do so having become aware that the goods were defective. 
     60   The question of contribution between concurrent tortfeasors depends on the responsibility of each for the damage suffered by the plaintiff, and this raises different questions from those which would arise in an action between them for breach of contract. Thus in Florida Hotels Pty Ltd v Mayo the employer who was indemnified by an award of damages for breach of contract against the architect only recovered 20 percent contribution under the 1946 Act. (Noted without comment by Barwick CJ: 113 CLR at 591-2, and by Sugerman J: 65 SR (NSW) at 53.) 
     61   In my judgment, for the reasons I have endeavoured to express, the apportionment of the trial Judge as between these defendants miscarried and this Court is entitled to intervene. The major responsibility was that of Leighton in terms of both culpability and causative potency. It had actively interfered with the existing safety arrangements on this bend, without making any provision for other safety arrangements in their place. It was not shown to have been lacking in relevant expertise, as Bitupave had been in Scroop. It had undertaken a contractual obligation to the RTA to provide whatever precautions were needed to safeguard the travelling public. On the other hand the RTA’s negligence was by omission, it having failed to notice and respond to the obstruction created by the webbing. 
     62   In these circumstances appellate intervention in accordance with the principles applied in The McGregor [1943] AC 197, 198-9, 201; and A V Jennings Construction Pty Ltd v Maumill (1956) 30 ALJ 100 is required. I would allow the appeal by the RTA on this issue and substitute an apportionment of 33 1/3 percent to the RTA and 66 2/3 percent to Leighton accordingly. I would make the following formal orders: 
      
       
      (1) Both appeals against the judgment entered in favour of the plaintiff Jeremy Andrew Fletcher dismissed with costs; 
       
       
      (2) Appeal by the Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales against the apportionment of responsibility as between it and Leighton Contractors Pty Limited allowed with costs; 
       
       
      (3) Apportionment of responsibility by the trial Judge set aside and in lieu thereof substitute an apportionment of 33 1/3 percent to the Roads and Traffic Authority and 66 2/3 percent to Leighton Contractors Pty Limited, such apportionment to include the plaintiff ’s costs of the trial payable by the defendants, but not the costs payable to the plaintiff of their unsuccessful appeals against the judgment in his favour.

      KRUSE v COMMONWEALTH DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS & ORS 
       
     The claimant had been acquitted of an offence involving a breach of the Corporations Law of New South Wales. The claimant sought and was refused a certificate under s2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (Costs Act). Section 2 of the Costs Act enabled the Court to grant a costs certificate “in any proceedings relating to any offence”, but Solomons v District Court of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 321 had established that the “offence” must arise under State rather than Commonwealth law. Section 29(2) of the Corporations (NSW) Act provided that, “for the purposes of a law of New South Wales”, an offence against the provisions of the Corporations Law of New South Wales was to be taken as an offence against the law of the Commonwealth, and was not to be taken as an offence against the laws of New South Wales.On appeal, the claimant argued:(1) the Costs Act conferred an existing right, and as a matter of statutory interpretation, the Corporations (NSW) Act should not be interpreted so as to diminish such a right.(2) the phrase “for the purposes of a law of New South Wales” should be interpreted as meaning “for the purposes of a relevant law of New South Wales”, a relevant law being one which would apply in competition with the imported law of the Commonwealth.Held: per Sheller JA (Spigelman CJ and Heydon JA agreeing):(1) The right conferred on a claimant under the Costs Act was not a fundamental right within the sense discussed in Bropho v State of Western Australia (1990) 171 CLR 1. Nor did s30(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987, which provided that the amendment or repeal of an Act did not affect any rights accrued under that Act before the amendment or repeal, assist the claimant. The Corporations (NSW) Act simultaneously created the offence and provided that it was to be taken as a law of the Commonwealth, and any right the claimant might have had under the Costs Act before the commencement of the Corporations (NSW) Act was not an accrued right. (2) If s29(2) was to be read as applying only to relevant laws of New South Wales, then this restriction would amount to no more than a requirement that the law bears upon the rights of a person charged with an offence against the Corporations (NSW) Act. Since the Costs Act can only be invoked in “proceedings relating to an offence”, which in this case is an offence under the Corporations Law of New South Wales, it is clear that the proceedings under the Costs Act are associated with or connected to that offence.(3)  Section 28(2) of the Corporations (NSW) Act stated that the purposes for which an offence was to be treated as if it were an offence against a law of the Commonwealth included proceedings relating to the trial of offenders. Both the broad nature of the phrase “relating to” and the objects of the Corporations (NSW) Act indicated that proceedings under the Costs Act should be regarded as relating to a trial. (4) For the above reasons, for the purpose of the Costs Act, the offence for which the claimant was acquitted had to be taken to be an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth, and as established by Solomons, a costs certificate could not be granted in relation to such an offence.Solomons v District Court of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 321, applied.Legislation:Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967Corporations (NSW) Act 1990Interpretation Act 1987Cases Cited:Solomons v District Court of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 321R v Kinal (1978) 21 ALR 261R v Hughes [2000] 74 ALJR 802Sargood Bros v The Commonwealth (1910) 11 CLR 258Booker v State Rail Authority of NSW (No 2) (1993) 31 NSWLR 402Bropho v State of Western Australia (1990) 171 CLR 1Abbott v Minister for Lands [1895] AC 425Boyce v Hughes (1970) 72 SR (NSW) 54Tooheys Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) (1961) 105 CLR 602

      JUDGMENT 
       
     1    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Sheller JA. 
      
       
     2    SHELLER JA: The claimant, James Byron Kruse, seeks relief in the nature of certiorari to quash an order Honour Judge O’Reilly QC of the District Court made on 25 January 2000 refusing him a certificate under s2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (the Costs Act). It is not necessary to refer to other relief sought in the summons. At one stage, there were three opponents to the summons; the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the District Court of New South Wales and the State of New South Wales. On 11 December 2000 the claimant discontinued the proceedings against the first opponent. The second opponent has filed a submitting appearance. The State of New South Wales resists the application. 
      
       
     3    The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions prosecuted the claimant on an indictment for an offence under s1311(1)(a) of the Corporations Law of New South Wales alleging a breach of s1002G(2)(a) of the Law. The matter came on for trial on 30 November 1999. At the close of the Crown case on 2 December 1999 the claimant was acquitted by direction. The claimant then made an application for a certificate under s2 of the Costs Act. On 25 January 2000 Judge O’Reilly held that he did not have jurisdiction under the Costs Act to grant a certificate in respect of the offence tried before him and dismissed the application. These proceedings challenge that conclusion. 
      
       
     4    Section 1(2) of the Corporations (NSW) Act 1990 (the NSW Corporations Act) states the purposes of the Act as: 
      
       
        
         
         “(a) to apply certain provisions of the

     5    Section 3 provides that in the Act: · “applicable provision, in relation to a jurisdiction means a provision of:

     · “Commonwealth law means any of the written or unwritten laws of the Commonwealth, including laws about the exercise of prerogative powers, rights and privileges, other than the Corporations Law of the Capital Territory, the ASIC Law of the Commonwealth Territory or provisions prescribed, for the purposes of the definition of Commonwealth law in section 4 of the Corporations Act by regulations under section 73 of the Corporations Act.”

     6    Section 7 of the NSW Corporations Act provides that the Corporations Law set out in s82 of the Commonwealth Corporations Act as in force for the time being applies as a law of New South Wales and as so applying may be referred to as the Corporations Law of New South Wales.

           (1) The object of this Division is to further the object of this Part by providing:

           (1) The Commonwealth laws apply as laws of New South Wales in relation to an offence against the applicable provisions of New South Wales as if those provisions were laws of the Commonwealth and were not laws of New South Wales. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (2) For the purposes of a law of New South Wales, an offence against the applicable provisions of New South Wales: 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (a) is taken to be an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth, in the same way as if those provisions were laws of the Commonwealth, and 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (b) is taken not to be an offence against the laws of New South Wales. 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (3) Subsection (2) has effect for the purposes of a law of New South Wales except as prescribed by regulations under section 80.” 
           
          
         
        
        
       There is no relevant regulatory prescription under s80. 
        
       
     8    Important for the purposes of this application is the object of Div 2 and therefore of ss28 and 29 to ensure that the Corporations Law of the various States are administered and enforced on a national basis in the same way as if those Laws constituted a single law of the Commonwealth. Consistently with this object it might be supposed that for the purposes of a New South Wales statute which gave State specific rights to a person charged with or acquitted of an offence in New South Wales against the Corporations Law of New South Wales and which was not part of a single law of the Commonwealth, the offence would be treated as against the laws of the Commonwealth and not against those of New South Wales. 
      
       
     9    Section 2 of the Costs Act enables the Court or judge “in any proceedings relating to any offence” where a defendant, after a hearing on the merits, is acquitted to grant to that defendant a certificate under the Act. Under s4(2) this certificate enables the person to make application for payment of costs incurred in the proceedings from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The parties accept, and I think there is no doubt, that the word “offence” in the expression “proceedings relating to any offence” refers to an offence under State law. See Solomons v District Court of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 321 at 323 [4], 341 [59] and 343 [70]. 
      
       
     10    In his reasons for judgment, Judge O’Reilly said that the major impediment to the claimant’s argument that the Costs Act applied to prosecutions under the Corporations Law of NSW was s29(2) of the NSW Corporations Act which required the prosecution of a breach of the Corporations Law of New South Wales to be treated as a federal proceeding. His Honour rejected an argument by the claimant based on s56 of the NSW Corporations Act, subs (1) of which relevantly provides that the laws of New South Wales, respecting criminal procedure in New South Wales in relation to offenders or persons charged with offences, apply in New South Wales, so far as they are applicable, to persons who are charged with offences against the Corporations Law. Section 56(4) defines “criminal procedure” in the section to mean: 
      
       
        
         
         “the procedure for:  
         
        
        
         
         (a) the summary conviction, and  
         
        
        
         
         (b) the examination and commitment for trial and indictment, and 
         
        
        
         
          (c) the trial and conviction on indictment, and  
         
        
        
         
         (d) the hearing and determination of appeals arising out of any such trial or conviction or out of any related proceedings.” 
         
        
       
     11    Referring to a decision of Green CJ in R v Kinal (1978) 21 ALR 261 his Honour held that the provision of the Costs Act invoked was not a law relating to procedure but a law which conferred rights upon defendants to recover moneys from the Crown and thus formed part of the substantive, as opposed to the merely adjectival, law of New South Wales. The argument was not pressed in this Court. 
      
       
     12    The argument in this Court was developed in a different way. There were two limbs. First Mr Duncan, who appeared for the claimant, submitted that his client enjoyed an existing, albeit contingent, right under the Costs Act. Unless there were clear words to the contrary, the NSW Corporations Act should not be construed so as to destroy or diminish this right. Secondly, Mr Duncan submitted that the phrase “[f]or the purposes of a law of New South Wales” in s29(2) should be read as meaning “for the purposes of a relevant law of New South Wales”. For this construction he drew some support from para 21 of the Explanatory Note to the Bill which became the NSW Corporations Act. Counsel also referred to the Heads of Agreement formulated at a meeting of representatives of the Executive Governments of the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory at Alice Springs in June 1990. If s29(2) were so read, “relevant law” would mean, according to the argument, New South Wales laws which otherwise applied in competition to the imported law of the Commonwealth such as the relevant New South Wales law empowering the State Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute an offence under the Corporations Law of NSW. Mr Duncan emphasised this submission by reference to the judgment of Kirby J in R v Hughes [2000] 74 ALJR 802 at 821 [89] (a case concerned with the same legislative scheme in Western Australia). Kirby J said that s29(2) was: 
      
       
        
         
         “an interpretive provision designed to carry into effect the administrative and organisational arrangements agreed to in the Heads of Agreement for the prosecution of offences against the WA Corporations Act. Such prosecution is not to be performed by the agency which would ordinarily have the responsibility of performing the prosecution of State criminal law (ie State prosecutors) but by the agency to which that task is assigned under the Heads of Agreement and by the integrated legislation, namely the Commonwealth DPP.” 
         
        
        
       Earlier in his judgment at 820 [87], Kirby J said: 
        
        
         
         “The WA Corporations Act, s29, read in the context of the co-operative legislative scheme, does not purport, in fact or law, to enact a law of the Commonwealth. Instead, out of the legislative powers of the Parliament of Western Australia, it applies certain ‘Commonwealth laws’ in Western Australia. It does so, as twice indicated, by the use of statutory fictions. The first fiction is evident in the statement that such ‘Commonwealth laws’ apply ‘ 
         as 
          laws of Western Australia’. The second is that such laws apply ‘ 
         as if 
          those provisions were laws of the Commonwealth and were not laws of Western Australia’.” 
         
        
       
     13    In a joint judgment Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ put the matter differently. Their Honours said, at 808 [23-24]: 
      
       
        
         
         “[23] .…It is significant that s29(2) is expressed to apply ‘[f]or the purposes of a law of Western Australia’. This indicates that the State legislature is not purporting to dictate to the Commonwealth Parliament what are Commonwealth laws. Rather, it is requiring certain of the laws of Western Australia to be treated as if they were Commonwealth laws for the purposes of Western Australian law. 
         
        
        
         
         [24] The phrases ‘as if’ (in s29(1)) and ‘is taken to be’ (in s29(2)) no doubt appeared to those drawing those provisions to be, in Windeyer J’s words, ( 
         Hunter Douglas Australia Pty Ltd v Perma Blinds 
          (1970) 122 CLR 49 at 65) ‘a convenient device for reducing the verbiage of an enactment’. The terms used in s79 of the  
         Judiciary Act 
          to ‘pick up’ certain State laws as surrogate federal laws also may have given some inspiration. (cf  
         Pedersen v Young 
          (1964) 110 CLR 162 at 165-166;  
         Northern Territory v GPAO 
          (1999) 196 CLR 553.) Perhaps paradoxically, it is to be expected that this very lack of verbiage will give rise to various textual awkwardnesses. Some of these were debated in the course of submissions in the present case. They are distractions from the issues presently before the Full Court.” 
         
        
        
       There is no reason why a law of New South Wales which gives rights inconsistent with the object of a  
       Corporations Law 
        administered and enforced on a national basis or rights said to be generated by the failure of a prosecution under the 
        Corporations Law 
        of New South Wales should be any less “relevant” in this context because the law is said not to “compete” with the imported law of the Commonwealth. 
        
       
     14    To my mind, the meaning of s29(2) is best addressed by first recognising that by s29(1) of the NSW Corporations Act the New South Wales Parliament has legislated that the Commonwealth laws apply as laws of New South Wales in relation to an offence against the Corporations Law of New South Wales as if those provisions were laws of the Commonwealth and were not laws of New South Wales. No question here turns on the exact meaning of that subsection. For present purposes the meaning is clear. To invert the order in which it is expressed, s29(2) provides than an offence against the Corporations Law of New South Wales is taken to be an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth in the same way as if those provisions were laws of the Commonwealth and is taken not to be an offence against the laws of New South Wales, “[f]or the purposes of a law of New South Wales.”  
      
       
     15    Let it be assumed that the clause does not extend to every law of New South Wales and that a useful adjective to describe the laws to which it does refer is “relevant”. This means no more than that the New South Wales law bears upon the rights of a person charged with an offence against the Corporations Law of New South Wales. I am unable to accept that the Costs Act is not a relevant law. The claimant can invoke the Costs Act only, “in..….proceedings relating to an offence” which in this case is an offence under the Corporations Law. The language used is plain. The trial proceedings in which the claimant applies for a certificate relate, that is to say, are associated with or connected to that offence. 
      
       
     16    The claimant submitted that so to construe s29(2) destroyed an existing right of the claimant. Sargood Bros v The Commonwealth (1910) 11 CLR 258 at 279 and Booker v State Rail Authority of New South Wales (No 2) (1993) 31 NSWLR 402 at 410 were referred to. As was pointed out by the Court in Booker at the page referred to, the principle relied on concerns the preservation of important common law rights; see also Bropho v State of Western Australia (1990) 171 CLR 1 at 18. As Mr Duncan acknowledged to the extent that the claimant had a right under the provisions of the Costs Act it was a statutory right and in no sense what was called in Bropho a fundamental right.  
      
       
     17    If the effect of s29(2) was to qualify or limit what would otherwise have been the operation of the Costs Act so far as the claimant’s acquittal for this offence was concerned, the preservation of that right would depend upon s30(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 which provides that the amendment or repeal of an Act does not affect any right acquired, or accrued under the Act before its amendment or repeal. The claimant had no such accrued right. The NSW Corporations Act at the same time created the New South Wales offence for which the claimant was charged and acquitted by applying the Corporations Law as a law of New South Wales and provided that it should be taken to be an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth and not against the laws of New South Wales. Until that time, if the claimant had any right under the Costs Act it was not an accrued right. In the words of the Privy Council in Abbott v Minister for Lands [1895] AC 425 at 431 quoted by Sugarman P in Boyce v Hughes (1970) 72 SR (NSW) 54 at 56: 
      
       
        
         
         “the mere right (assuming it to be properly so called) existing in the members of the community or any class of them to take advantage of an enactment, without any act done by an individual towards availing himself of that right, cannot properly be deemed a ‘right accrued’ within the meaning of the enactment.” 
         
        
        
        In the language of the  
       Interpretation Act 
        no right under the  
       Costs Act 
        had accrued to the claimant before the  
       NSW Corporations Act  
       was enacted.  
       
     18    Any residual doubt about the law of New South Wales, to which s29(2) of the NSW Corporations Act is directed, is dispelled by s28(2). The purposes for which an offence is to be treated as if it were an offence against a law of the Commonwealth include (c) proceedings relating to a matter referred to in para (b) which includes the trial of offenders. Despite the submissions to the contrary, in my opinion, it could not be said that proceedings to obtain the grant of a certificate under s2 of the Costs Act do not relate to the trial of the claimant. Section 2 empowers the Court in any proceedings relating to any offence to grant a certificate to the defendant under the Costs Act. Counsel referred us to Solomons. In that case this Court, by a majority, (Mason P and Foster AJA, Sheller JA dissenting) held that a State court does not have the power to grant a certificate under the Costs Act s2 to a person tried and acquitted on an indictment charging offences under a Commonwealth Act and the Judiciary Act ss68 and 79 did not render the Costs Act applicable. At 325-6 Mason P said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The right of a defendant to apply for a certificate under the  
         Costs in Criminal Cases Act 
          only arises  
         after 
          acquittal or discharge ( 
         Costs in Criminal Cases Act  
         s2(a)) and the subject of inquiry is the information available to the prosecutor  
         before 
          the proceedings were instituted (ibid s3(1)(a)). The application is quite collateral to the trial itself, and its determination (in a lis to which the prosecutor need not be a party) forms no part of the disposition of the trial.” 
         
        
        
       At 352 Foster AJA said: 
        
        
         
         “The jurisdiction to hear and determine an application under the  
         Costs in Criminal Cases Act 
          could not, in my view, be part of the jurisdiction of the State court in respect of the trial and conviction or acquittal of the claimant had these proceedings been brought in respect of a State offence. Accordingly they were not part of the ‘like jurisdiction’ conferred by s68(2) of the  
         Judiciary Act 
          1903 (Cth), with the result that Keleman DCJ was not authorised by that section to hear and determine them. Nor was the application ‘incidental’ to the federal jurisdiction invested in the judge and, accordingly, was not picked up by s79 of the  
         Judiciary Act 
          1903 (Cth).” 
         
        
       
     19    Nothing said in these judgments requires the conclusion that proceedings under the Costs Act should be said not to relate to the trial of the person instituting those proceedings. In Tooheys Limited v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) (1961) 105 CLR 602 at 620 Taylor J observed that the expression “relating to” is both extremely wide and also vague and indefinite. “That being so all that a court can do is to endeavour to seek some precision in the context in which the expression is used.” The language of the Costs Act combined with the objects of the NSW Corporations Act lead me to the conclusion that the claimant’s proceedings under the former should be treated in the latter as related to his trial. 
      
       
     20    For all these reasons, in my opinion, for the purpose of the Costs Act the offence for which the claimant was charged and acquitted must be taken to be an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth and accordingly, on the authority of Solomons not to be proceedings relating to an offence within the meaning of s2 of the Costs Act. For this reason, the trial Judge, O’Reilly DCJ, correctly concluded that he had no power under the Costs Act to grant a certificate. This application should be dismissed with costs.

        JUDGMENT 
        
        
       
     2   KIRBY J: Mr Taarruz Ibrahim (the appellant) was charged with a number of offences said to have occurred on 11 March 1998 The indictment (incorporating certain amendments) was in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         Count 1 
         
        
        
         
         For that he on 11 March 1998, at Liverpool, in the State of New South Wales, did steal a 1978 Toyota Corona sedan Registration No JTW.373 the property of Manual Leon. (s154A(1)(a) Crimes Act, 1900) 
         
        
        
         
         Count 2 
         
        
        
         
         Further that he on 11 March 1998, at Fairfield, in the State of New South Wales, did rob Antonietta Lopresto of one purse, a set of keys, a pair of reading glasses, personal papers, and $1.00 in money, the property of Antonietta Lopresto. (s94 Crimes Act, 1900) 
          
          
         Count 3 
         
        
        
         
         Further that he on 11 March 1998, at Canley Vale, in the State of New South Wales, did rob Danica Saponja of a handbag, a purse, 2 rings, and a sum of cash the property of Danica Saponja, and immediately after the robbery did use corporal violence on her. (s95 Crimes Act, 1900) 
         
        
        
         
         Count 4 
         
        
        
         
         Further that he on 11 March 1998, at Liverpool, in the State of New South Wales, did rob Ivette Ankabibian of a handbag containing personal papers and a sum of cash the property of Ivette Ankabibian. (s94 Crimes Act, 1900) 
         
        
       
     3   The trial proceeded before Payne DCJ and a Jury. Her Honour directed a verdict of “not guilty” in respect of counts 3 and 4. The trial thereafter continued in respect of counts 1 and 2. The Jury ultimately returned a verdict of “guilty” in respect of each of the remaining counts. Mr Ibrahim appeals against each conviction. 
      
       
     4   The grounds of appeal are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         1. There was a miscarriage of justice because trial Counsel failed to seek a discharge of the jury after verdicts by direction were given in relation to two of the four counts in the indictment. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The verdicts of the Jury are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 
         
        
        
       Crown Case 
        
       
     5   It was the Crown case that Mr Ibrahim and an unidentified companion carried out a series of robberies within the space of approximately half an hour, using a stolen vehicle as the means of escape. The companion was alleged to have snatched bags from women at various shopping centres, and then entered a motor vehicle driven by Mr Ibrahim. 
      
       
     6   The first robbery (Count 2) was said to have taken place at Fairfield at approximately midday. Ms Lopresto said that she was walking along Barbara Street, Fairfield, when she heard the sound of a car breaking sharply. Shortly thereafter someone tugged at her bag from behind. A struggle took place in which she was pushed to the ground. She did not get a clear view of her assailant, who escaped by car with her bag. 
      
       
     7   Two men came to her aid. They each took the number of the vehicle (JTW.373). They were able to provide a description of the person who took the bag. They each had an imperfect view of the driver, although he appeared somewhat chubby. It was common ground that Mr Ibrahim, at the time, was thin rather than chubby. 
      
       
     8   The next incident (the subject of Count 3), was described by a witness, Ms Danica Saponja. She said that, at about midday, she was in Derby Street, Canley Vale. She was carrying a bag over her left shoulder. She noticed a car approaching. She saw two people in the car. One of the occupants came up to her and snatched her bag. As she struggled to keep hold of the bag she was struck on the nose. She then released her bag and saw the man enter the vehicle through the open passenger door. The vehicle drove off. She was able to describe her assailant. Her description coincided with the descriptions provided by the witnesses at Fairfield. 
      
       
     9   Ms Ivette Ankabibian gave evidence in relation to Count 4. She said that, shortly after midday on 11 March 1998, she was walking down Scott Street, Liverpool. She also was approached by a man who tugged at her handbag. The strap of the handbag gave way. The man thereafter ran to a vehicle which was nearby. He entered through the front passenger’s door. She heard the driver say, “Come on”, and her assailant say, “Go”. The vehicle sped off. 
      
       
     10   A short time later two police officers, patrolling George Street, Liverpool, noticed a Toyota Corona vehicle, registered number JTW.373. It was the same vehicle that had been seen earlier at Fairfield. The vehicle was being driven erratically. It passed through a red light on the incorrect side of the road. The police therefore gave chase. They activated their siren, but the vehicle failed to stop. Indeed, it accelerated and was driven in the same erratic manner. It was seen to pass onto the incorrect side of the road a further four or five times. Ultimately its path was blocked by other stationery vehicles. Two men were seen to leave the vehicle. A person, whose description conformed to that of the assailant involved in the various incidents, was seen to leave the vehicle on the passenger’s side. He ran off, pursued by Const Stevens. 
      
       
     11   Senior Const Rowe saw Mr Ibrahim in the driver’s seat. He saw him slide across to the passenger’s side, and then exit the vehicle. According to his testimony, Mr Ibrahim ran a short distance before being stopped and arrested. Once stopped, he was cautioned by Snr Const Rowe, whereupon the following conversation took place: (T41) 
      
       
        
         
         ROWE: 
          “Who owns the vehicle?” 
          
         ACCUSED: 
          “I don’t know. I was just getting a lift.” 
         
        
        
         
         ROWE: 
          “But you were driving the car.” 
          
         ACCUSED: 
          “I was a passenger.” 
         
        
       
     12   Mr Ibrahim acknowledged the accuracy of this evidence. He also acknowledged that he had lied, and that he was the driver. When he gave evidence, which I will come to shortly, he said that, being aware of the way in which the vehicle had been driven, he was frightened. 
      
       
     13   The vehicle was searched. Within the vehicle was the handbag of Ms Saponja (Count 3), and that of Ms Ankabibian (Count 4), the latter being the bag with the broken strap. 
      
       
     14   It was common ground that the journey between Barbara Street, Fairfield (Count 2), and the point of arrest (just beyond the location of Count 4), would take 25 to 35 minutes. Mr Ibrahim was arrested at approximately 12.20 pm. 
      
       
        
       The Case for the Accused 
        
       
     15   As mentioned, Mr Ibrahim gave evidence. He said that he left his home in Kingsgrove at about 10.30 am on 11 March 1998. He intended to visit a friend at Mt Pritchard. He caught the train to Cabramatta, intending to walk several kilometres to his friend’s home. However, some distance from the station, as he walked up Hill Street, Cabramatta, he noticed a parked vehicle. He said this: (T.77) 
      
       
        
         
         “When I was crossing the road three quarters of the way up Hill Street I noticed a dark man in a Toyota, you know I was staring at him and I recognised him, so I approached him, I asked him if is name was Ben. He said ‘That’s right’. I told him he didn’t look too healthy, I asked him if he wants me to call him a taxi, I advised him not to drive …” 
         
        
       
     16   He had not seen his friend Ben for about eight years. He knew him from a hotel where they each used to drink. He said that his friend appeared to be affected by drugs. They spoke, and he ascertained that his friend was going to Liverpool. Mr Ibrahim therefore offered to drive. There was nothing in the vehicle to alert him to the fact that it had been stolen. There was a key in the ignition. 
      
       
     17   As they were driving towards Liverpool, his friend directed him to pull over at a Hot Bread Shop. He did so. Soon thereafter he heard a woman screaming. His friend jumped back into the car holding a woman’s handbag. Mr Ibrahim asked his friend why he did not return the bag. His friend then punched him on the chin. He was directed to start the engine. He said he did so because he was scared. He thereafter drove, although his friend took hold of the steering wheel, and placed his leg on the driver’s side so that his foot rested on top of Mr Ibrahim’s right foot, which was then on the accelerator. They drove in this fashion for some time. 
      
       
     18   Mr Ibrahim said that he protested because it was dangerous. He was told to shut up or he would be head butted. Soon thereafter the police began following the vehicle, and he was ultimately arrested. Mr Ibrahim said that he had first entered the vehicle about twenty minutes before his arrest. 
      
       
        
       The Course of the Trial 
        
       
     19   At the end of the Crown case, an application was made by Counsel for Mr Ibrahim for a verdict in respect of Count 4. The application was successful. Her Honour directed the Jury to return a verdict of “Not Guilty” on Count 4. The trial then continued, and the accused gave evidence. At the conclusion of his evidence, there was a discussion concerning the remaining counts. The transcript contains the following summary of that discussion: (p1, 25.10.99) 
      
       
        
         
         IN THE ABSENCE OF THE JURY 
         
        
        
         
         (Her Honour enquired of Mr O’Mullane and Crown - Where is the evidence that shows part of joint enterprise on behalf of accused and driver to use whatever means necessary including a punching to obtain the bag. Discussion ensued.) 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: 
          “In my view there should be a verdict by direction of acquittal on that count.” 
         
        
       
     20   The transcript is obviously incomplete. The discussion relates to Count 3. There is no reference to the Crown having made an application to amend the indictment to remove the reference to their having been corporal violence. Her Honour directed a verdict on Count 3. Counts 1 and 2 remained. Counsel for Mr Ibrahim then sought a discharge of the Jury. That issue was debated, and part way through the debate Counsel withdrew his application. The Crown, in these circumstances, made its own application for a discharge. The transcript is an abbreviated record of what took place, and is in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         (Mr Crown made an application having regard to her Honour’s orders in relation to verdicts by direction for counts 3 and 4 to have jury discharged, as they have heard so much material that is not relevant on basis of fairness to the accused.) 
         
        
        
         
         SHORT ADJOURNMENT 
         
        
        
         
         (Mr O’Mullane indicates that he wished to proceed with trial. He submits that if there were a retrial the Crown would be able to rely on all the evidence that has been presented in this trial, part of surrounding circumstances. The accused wishes to continue with the jury. Further discussion ensued.) 
         
        
       
     21   Her Honour then made the following statement: (p2 25.10.99) 
      
       
        
         
         “What I think I will do Mr Crown is, the jury will come back and they will be given the direction about count three and then I think I will say to them something to the effect that accordingly they should put any of the evidence in connection with counts 3 and 4 including the property found in the car completely out of their minds.” 
         
        
       
     22   The Crown opposed that course. It was the Crown case that a series of robberies had occurred, commencing at Fairfield and culminating at Liverpool. The Crown relied upon each. Counsel for Mr Ibrahim was invited to comment. He said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “I have to confess your Honour I believe the Crown can rely on that evidence because it’s part of the surrounding circumstances, and in all fairness I don’t think I could argue against it.” 
         
        
       
     23   A further discussion then took place. The transcript records the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         HER HONOUR: 
          ‘Can I just have this noted for the record, you’re still not asking for a discharge of the jury.’ 
         
        
        
         
         O’MULLANE: 
          ‘Yes we’re content to proceed your Honour.’ 
         
        
        
         
         (Crown renews application for discharge of Jury.)” 
         
        
        
       Ground 1: The failure to seek a discharge. 
        
       
     24   The first ground of appeal concerns the failure of Counsel to seek a discharge of the Jury after the directed verdicts in respect of Counts 3 and 4. 
      
       
     25   The argument of the appellant was that the evidence in respect of Counts 3 and 4 was highly prejudicial to Mr Ibrahim. Such evidence would be inadmissible at a new trial. Therefore, it would obviously be to the advantage of Mr Ibrahim were the issues arising under Counts 1 and 2 heard by a Jury which had not been contaminated by such prejudicial material. Hence, Counsel ought to have persisted in his application for a discharge of the Jury. A miscarriage of justice has occurred, on the appellant’s argument, through Counsel’s failure to do so (R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685). 
      
       
     26   There are a number of difficulties with that argument. First, I do not believe that the course taken by the accused was the consequence of inexpert legal advice. Rather, it appears to have been the consequence of a forensic choice. Counsel had been successful in persuading her Honour that she should direct a verdict of not guilty in respect of Counts 3 and 4. Whilst I do not entirely understand the basis upon which such rulings were made, nonetheless, the tide appeared to be running in Mr Ibrahim’s favour. It is only with hindsight, the Jury having delivered its verdict, that one can postulate so confidently that the course taken was to Mr Ibrahim’s disadvantage. 
      
       
     27   Secondly, the cornerstone of the appellant’s argument is that the evidence in respect of Counts 3 and 4 (in respect of which her Honour had directed verdicts) would obviously be inadmissible in a new trial. Whether that evidence, or aspects of that evidence, was inadmissible, admits no easy answer (cf Garrett v The Queen (1977) 139 CLR 437, esp Barwick CJ at 444-445; The Queen v Storey (1978) 140 CLR 364). The issue of admissibility was complicated by the introduction by the accused of an explanation which involved the Liverpool robberies (Count 4), which had occurred a short time before his arrest. That explanation was given shortly after her Honour had directed a verdict in respect of that count. The Crown asserted, before her Honour (when the issue of a discharge was debated), that evidence in respect of the Canley Vale and Liverpool robberies (Counts 3 and 4) would be admissible in a new trial. Counsel then appearing for Mr Ibrahim shared that view. Counsel for the Crown on this appeal urged the same view. The appellant submitted that the evidence was inadmissible. Whilst I am prepared to assume that the evidence in respect of Count 3 would probably be rejected at a new trial (whether because it is inadmissible, or as a matter of discretion), it cannot be said that the forensic choice made by Mr Ibrahim’s counsel, and his view of admissibility, were so obviously wrong as to bring about a miscarriage of justice. In my view, the circumstances were not such as to meet the criteria identified by Gleeson CJ in R v Birks (supra) at 685. 
      
       
        
       The Direction in Respect of Counts 3 and 4 
        
       
     28   Having directed the jury to return verdicts of not guilty in respect of Counts 3 and 4, her Honour made the following statement to the jury: (T.3, 25.10.99) 
      
       
        
         
         “Now ladies and gentlemen of the jury as we proceed it’s very important that you bear in mind that the trial is proceeding only in relations to count one and count two in the indictment and that you put any of the evidence in relation to counts three and four in the indictment out of your minds. The accused has been acquitted of those two robberies and I don’t think it was ever in dispute that the robberies took place. The dispute was whether this accused was the driver of the vehicle in any event. He has been acquitted of those and you should put the evidence in connection with them completely out of your minds and focus only on counts one and two.” 
         
        
       
     29   Subsequently, in the course of her summing up, her Honour repeated that direction. She said this: (S/U.2, 25.10.99) 
      
       
        
         
         “He has been acquitted by direction in relation to counts 3 and 4 and accordingly you must put the evidence of Miss Danica Saponja and Miss Ankabibian completely out of your minds.” 
         
        
       
     30   That direction in respect of Count 3 may be unexceptional. However, I do not believe, with respect, that her Honour’s direction to ignore the evidence of Mrs Ankabibian (the complainant in respect of Count 4) was adequate to meet the complex situation that then arose. The accused’s case presupposed the robbery at Liverpool. Mrs Ankabibian furnished corroboration of aspects of his account. The robbery had been perpetrated by someone other than the accused. It had taken place at the location described by Mr Ibrahim. The handbag later found in the vehicle was that of Mrs Ankabibian. 
      
       
     31   On the other hand, aspects of Mrs Ankabibian’s evidence were starkly at odds with that given by Mr Ibrahim. Whereas Mrs Ankabibian said that the vehicle was close by, door open, engine running, Mr Ibrahim said the engine was switched off. It was only switched on after an altercation between Mr Ibrahim and the passenger. Mr Ibrahim demanded that the robber return the bag, whereupon the passenger hit him and threatened him. 
      
       
     32   Mrs Ankabibian also gave evidence that the driver said, “Come on”, because the lights were about to change. Once the passenger was safely inside the vehicle he said, according to the complainant, “Go”, whereupon the vehicle sped off. In cross examination, it was put to Mrs Ankabibian that she was mistaken, and that these words were not said. She was insistent, however, that they were said. She was one hundred percent sure. 
      
       
     33   Notwithstanding the theory that juries follow a Judge’s directions (McHugh J in Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15 at para 31), I believe it was inevitable that the jury would have had regard to the account given by Mrs Ankabibian when evaluating Mr Ibrahim’s evidence. Indeed, as mentioned, in some respects, from his viewpoint, it was important that they do so. Moreover, having been acquitted of the robbery at Liverpool, the accused was entitled to “the full benefit of that finding” (Jacobs J in The Queen v Storey (supra) at 408). He was to be taken as “entirely innocent of the offence” (Gibbs J in The Queen v Storey (supra) at 387). It was, therefore, necessary to state with some care the implications of the acquittal in respect of the issues which remained for the jury to address. I believe, therefore, that there was error, such that (subject to Ground 2) there must be a new trial. 
      
       
        
       The Verdict was Unreasonable. 
        
       
     34   It is convenient to restate Ground 2, which was in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “2. The verdicts of the Jury are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.” 
         
        
       
     35   In respect of the first count, the larceny of the motor vehicle, the Crown proved that the vehicle was owned by Mr Manual Leon. On 11 March 1998, Mr Leon parked the vehicle at the Fairfield Railway Station at 4.30 a.m. He gave no-one permission to take the vehicle. The arrest of Mr Ibrahim occurred shortly after midday the same day. The vehicle, therefore, at the time it was in Mr Ibrahim’s possession, had been recently stolen. By s154A of the Crimes Act, 1900, (“the Act”) a person who “takes and drives” a vehicle without consent is deemed guilty of larceny. The police officer saw Mr Ibrahim in the driver’s seat of the vehicle. Although Mr Ibrahim at first denied having driven the vehicle, he later acknowledged that he had done so, and that his denial was a lie. For the purposes of s154A of the Act, the least movement of the vehicle constitutes driving (R v Brogacki (1973) 1 QB 832). There is evidence, in my view, from which it can be inferred that Mr Ibrahim was driving without the consent of the owner, knowing that he did not have that consent. The Crown could call in aid the doctrine of recent possession. It was open to the jury to regard Mr Ibrahim’s explanation as fanciful. It could therefore infer that Mr Ibrahim either stole the vehicle, or drove it knowing that he did not have the consent of the owner. 
      
       
     36   It will be remembered that the police pursued the vehicle using their siren. However, the vehicle did not stop. Being impeded by other vehicles, the vehicle was then abandoned, and Mr Ibrahim and the other occupant endeavoured to escape on foot. When arrested, as stated already, Mr Ibrahim at first lied to the police. The attempt made to outrun the police was capable of being viewed as flight. His flight, and that lie, were capable, in my opinion, of being regarded as referable to the whole enterprise, that is, the use of a stolen vehicle for the purposes of committing robbery. 
      
       
     37   Turning to the second count, concerned with the robbery at Fairfield, Mr Ibrahim was not identified by those at the scene. The car was, however, identified by registration number. The only evidence to connect Mr Ibrahim with the crime was his arrest, twenty or thirty minutes later, at Liverpool, driving the same vehicle. 
      
       
     38   The directed acquittals in respect of the robberies at Canley Vale (Count 3) and Liverpool (Count 4) significantly weakened the Crown case against Mr Ibrahim. As originally presented, the Crown could account for the movements of the vehicle between Fairfield and the point of arrest near Liverpool. The inference of joint enterprise, and Mr Ibrahim’s complicity in that enterprise, was also stronger. The robberies at each location employed recognisably the same modus operandi. 
      
       
     39   Confining one’s attention to the evidence in respect of the robbery at Fairfield, was there evidence capable of implicating Mr Ibrahim in a joint enterprise with the person who snatched the bag? I believe that there was. First, one can infer, in my view, that Mr Ibrahim was the driver at Fairfield from the fact that he was the driver at Liverpool when arrested. The time between the incident and the arrest was relatively short, and the geography made it quite feasible. 
      
       
     40   Secondly, the inference could the more readily be drawn because Mr Ibrahim, as part of his explanation, acknowledged that he had been driving the vehicle for about twenty minutes. The Crown case was that a car journey between Fairfield and the point of arrest would take between 25 and 35 minutes, according to a police officer. The discrepancy between the police estimate and that of Mr Ibrahim was not large in the context of a car journey through traffic. 
      
       
     41   Thirdly, there was evidence of the complicity of the driver in the joint enterprise, and therefore of Mr Ibrahim. The vehicle was seen to slow down as it entered Barbara Street, Fairfield. It braked suddenly. The person who snatched the bag was then seen to alight. The vehicle remained close by with the driver “slouched down”. The bag having been stolen, the driver opened the passenger door. The robber then entered, and the vehicle sped off. 
      
       
     42   I believe that, in respect of both Counts 1 and 2, there was evidence capable of supporting the convictions. I would therefore reject the second ground of appeal. 
      
       
     43   I would therefore propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       1. The appeal be allowed. 
        
        
       2. The convictions be set aside. 
        
        
       3. There be a new trial in respect of Counts 1 and 2.

       SMART, AJ. 
       
        
      WEDNESDAY 28 MARCH 2001 
      
      REGINA v. CHRISTINE COUPE 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed in the District Court of New South Wales on the applicant for the crime of aggravated break, enter and steal, the circumstance of aggravation being that the crime was accompanied by the infliction of corporal violence. The maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment. The applicant was sentenced for that crime to four and a half years imprisonment commencing on 22 October 1999 and expiring on 21 April 2004. A non-parole period was imposed of three years commencing on 22 October 1999 and expiring on 21 October 2002. 
     2   The facts fell within a quite narrow compass and were succinctly referred to by the learned trial judge in his remarks on sentence. He also referred to three further break, enter and stealing matters that the applicant sought to have taken into account on a Form 1, and which his Honour did take into account. 
     3   The applicant went to the home of the victim, entered it and was rifling through the possessions of the family when she was approached by the householder and her daughter. There was a scuffle. In the process of that scuffle, the applicant came to cause to the victim some minor bruising, lacerations and, what his Honour described as, a minor wound which occasioned, what might be described as, a sore cheek. The applicant had, whilst in the dwelling, assembled from the various places in the house some $50 in cash, a Tag watch, a pair of Ray Ban sunglasses, $US1 note, and a Maglite torch. 
     4   The applicant was restrained by the family at the scene until the police arrived and took her away. She pleaded guilty. His Honour gave the applicant full discount for that plea but, of course, as his Honour pointed out, the plea was in the context of her being caught, absolutely red-handed. 
     5   Before passing to the other matters his Honour noted, I should record that we have received from the applicant very full and detailed written submissions. Those submissions advert to the events that apparently followed the applicant and the householder being in the scuffle to which I have referred. They relate to, in particular, the son of the householder attending at the scene and releasing two pit bull terriers into the yard, apparently to assist in detaining her. 
     6   There was, in the materials provided by the applicant, reference by her to the use of a screwdriver or the asserted use of a screwdriver towards those animals and a suggestion that it might have been thought by his Honour that she had threatened the householders. 
     7   An examination of his Honour's remarks on sentence dissipates entirely any such concern. There is no suggestion in any findings of his Honour of any finding of that kind adverse to the applicant, nor indeed would it have been open to his Honour on that charge to have had regard to such matters as aggravating the offence absent proof beyond reasonable doubt of those matters or admission of them by the applicant. 
     8   His Honour, when he came to pass sentence, did have regard to the applicant's prior criminal record. That record is, on any view of it, appalling. His Honour expressed the content of it this way:- 
      
       
        
        ""I note that her record stretches over many, many pages. In the time that has been available to me I have counted 82 matters where there has been a finding of guilt or she has been convicted. The present matters add an extra four to that list, making it 86. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        Amongst the matters in the past have been 17 breaking, entering and stealing offences and the present four (which) make 21."" 
        
       
     9   His Honour was of the view that the record precluded the extension of leniency to the applicant. However, he noted that whilst in prison her behaviour and conduct had been satisfactory and she had been productive. He noted also that her prior personal circumstances had been tragic, leading to her having commenced to use illegal drugs at the age of 12. He further noted she had attempted from time to time to achieve rehabilitation but, coming forward for sentence at the age of 34 years, had never been able to maintain a drug free existence for any lengthy period. Although, in this regard, his Honour noted, and I summarise his views, that, from the material in the Probation and Parole report and the two psychiatric reports before him, there was a genuine willingness on the applicant's part to seek to put aside her drug dependency. 
     10   In regard to the tragic circumstances of her earlier life, to which his Honour had referred, he found that she had had a very bad life. In that regard I apprehend that his Honour was talking about the way life had treated the applicant, rather than how she had treated others. He referred to the abusive treatment of her when she was a child by men, the death of her husband in tragic circumstances, and the, then, impending death of her mother. He found in her favour that she had probably turned to drugs because of the problems of her background. 
     11   His Honour was of the view that she would require a great deal of professional help to put her drug-ridden background behind her, but his Honour was also of the view that notwithstanding the strong desire quite honestly held by her to put drugs behind her by going into a residential rehabilitation program, that it would be impossible for him, in the light of her record in particular, and in the light of the fact that the offence for which she came forward for sentence was a more serious offence, incorporating an element of violence, compared to those she previously had on her record, to avoid passing a substantial custodial sentence, and permitting her immediately to enter a rehabilitation programme. 
     12   His Honour found, it appears, special circumstances. Although there was no express finding to that effect in his Honour's remarks, there was reference in argument to varying the proportion provided for in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. His Honour imposed the sentence in a way that suggested she had been given the benefit of special circumstances since he altered the customary statutory proportions. 
     13   His Honour recommended to the Parole Board that she be placed under conditions, including conditions that she enter into a full-time rehabilitation institution on her release on parole and noted his expectation that she would be released immediately following the end of the non-parole period. 
     14   In the written submissions that the applicant has filed, there are extensive arguments put in support of a number of individual grounds. These include, under ground one, that his Honour erred in failing to structure a sentence recognising the existence of special circumstances and the report of the psychiatrists. To that ground I will return in a moment. 
     15   Ground two asserted that his Honour failed to take into account mitigating circumstances. The mitigating circumstances there referred to seem to suggest that the applicant would not have acted with violence had the two dogs not been released into the yard. 
     16   That ground appears to mistake the violence that was the nub of this offence. It was not the threat to the dogs or the wielding of the screwdriver that was the aggravating circumstance in this charge, but the scuffle with the householder. Of course, that does mean that the objective criminality involved was considerably less than if the applicant had threatened either the persons there, or the dogs present with actual physical harm from the use of the screwdriver. 
     17   The applicant, in particular, under that ground further drew attention to the fact that her prior offences did not contain such elements of violence, so that what occurred on this occasion should be treated as exceptional. Nonetheless, I am of the view that his Honour did take into account the mitigating circumstances and, as I have said, he did not make any finding adverse to the applicant in respect of the use of the screwdriver or the making of threats. 
     18   It was also asserted that his Honour described the charges of break, enter and steal with aggravation in terms bearing comparison with offences of armed robbery and home invasion. Shortly, although reference was made to statistics supplied by the Judicial Commission, it is to be noted that the passage in his Honour's reasons does not fall into the error the applicant asserted, in his Honour's description of the offence in argument. In that passage his Honour, in an exchange with the applicant's solicitor, referred to the matters of armed robbery, and home invasion, and said:- 
      
       
        
        ""In reference to what might have occurred if she hit that woman just a little bit harder, 25. If she had done her serious physical injury as a result of that blow, and that is not hard, it would have been 25 years, so they equated it to the most serious robberies in the State. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        MR WHITBY: Robbery with aggravation. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Armed robbery, yes, it has been equated now with armed robbery. This kind of home invasion and fighting the householder is regarded by the Legislature to be so serious as to warrant 25 years penal servitude, which, if you do not take any discount with a record like hers, could expect 14 or 15 years,  
        but it is not that one, it is the one down from that which is 20 years, but even so it is a very serious offence 
        ."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
     19   The highlighted words make it very clear that his Honour was placing the offence with which the applicant was charged in its proper context in the hierarchy of criminal offences. I see in that passage, and in his Honour's assessment of the objective facts, having regard to what I had said earlier concerning no finding adverse to the applicant relating to the use of the screwdriver, and the making of threats, no sign of his Honour falling into appellable error. 
     20   I now return to the first ground of appeal. In respect of that ground, the applicant referred to the psychologist's report and to decisions of the court in somewhat similar circumstances, emphasising where rehabilitation might be in prospect, the importance of that rehabilitation. It seems that his Honour must have accepted something to that effect, in finding that the proportion of non-parole period to total sentence should be varied. His Honour made reference to her willingness to undergo rehabilitation and in his recommendation gave effect to that willingness in recognising that full-time rehabilitation would appear to offer some prospect. 
     21   Having regard to that matter, and having regard to the effect of the total sentence in the light of the non-parole period his Honour imposed, I have concluded that in that limited respect this ground of appeal is made out. It seems that in the light of all the circumstances to which I have referred, the non-parole period his Honour imposed exceeded that which was appropriate in the circumstances he found and that the appropriate course would be to maintain the recommendations that his Honour made, but to vary the non-parole period he imposed by reducing that period by a period of six months so as to expire on 21 April 2002. Otherwise I consider that the sentence should stand. 
     22   The orders that I would propose therefore are:- 
      
       
        
        1. The application for leave to appeal be granted. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The appeal be upheld. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The applicant be sentenced to four and a half years imprisonment to commence on 22 October 1999 and to expire on 21 April 2004 
        
       
       
        
        4. There be in respect of that period of imprisonment a non-parole period of two and a half years commencing on 22 October 1999 and expiring on 21 April 2002. 
        
       
     23   As was made by the trial judge, there should be a recommendation to the Parole Board that the applicant be placed under conditions one to nine, which are the general conditions of good behaviour, employment and residency; and also conditions 14 and 16, which relate to giving power to the parole officer to order that the applicant enter into a full-time rehabilitation institution for her drug addiction problems during her parole period, should that be required. 
     24   SMART, J: I agree. 
     25   GREG JAMES, J: The orders and recommendations will be as I proposed.

     STATE RAIL AUTHORITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES v WORKCOVER AUTHORITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES (INSPECTOR RODNEY DUBOIS) 
      
     Appeal by the State Rail Authority of New South Wales against a decision of Mr Justice Maidment given on 27 October 1999 in Matter No IRC 2697 of 1998. 
      
      JUDGMENT OF THE COURT 
       
      [2000] NSWIRComm 261 
      
      
       
      
     1     
     This is an appeal by the State Rail Authority of New South Wales against a decision of  
     Maidment 
      J given on 27 October 1999 in which his Honour fined the appellant an amount of $420,000 for a breach of s 15(1) of the  
     Occupational Health and Safety Act 
      1983. The appeal is against the severity of the penalty imposed. The proceedings before his Honour were initiated by Rodney Dubois, as an inspector of the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales, and concerned an alleged failure by the appellant on 1 June 1996 to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of two of its employees, Albert Franklin and Jurgen Graf, in that it ""failed to provide and maintain systems of access to railway areas to undertake painting maintenance work that was safe and without risk to health""; as a result of the said failure, it was alleged Mr Franklin suffered injuries and Mr Graf was placed at risk of injury. The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge. 
      
       
      
     2     
     By the operation of s 196 of the  
     Industrial Relations Act 
      1996, the appeal was brought as of right pursuant to s 5AA of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
      1912. That latter Act applies, and the other provisions in Pt 7 - Appeals and References to Commission in Ch 4 of the  
     Industrial Relations Act 
      do not apply, to appeals in respect of criminal proceedings before a judicial member of the Commission: see s 196(1) of the  
     Industrial Relations Act 
      and s 5AA(1) of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
     . The relevant legislative provisions and the consequent approach to be adopted on such an appeal were authoritatively reviewed by a Full Bench ( 
     Wright 
      J, President,  
     Walton 
      J, Vice-President and  
     Kavanagh 
      J) of the Court in  
     Capral Aluminium Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Mayo-Ramsay) 
      (2000) 99 IR 29 at pp 37-39 and it is unnecessary to be further examined here.  
      
       
      
     3     
     Suffice it to emphasise for present purposes, by way of summary, that the appeal shall be by way of rehearing on the evidence given at first instance: s 5AA(3); the issue on appeal is not whether the trial judge fell into error but rather whether the appellate court is independently of the same opinion:  
     NSW Sugar Milling Co-operative Ltd v Environment Protection Authority 
      (1992) 59 A Crim R 6 at p 11 per  
     Enderby 
      J, with whom  
     Hunt 
      CJ at CL and  
     Allen  
     J agreed; the appeal is not a hearing  
     de novo  
     and new evidence may be adduced only with leave of the court: s 5AA(3A); the appeal court must consider afresh the ultimate issue to be determined:  
     Camilleri's Stock Feeds Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority 
      (1993) 32 NSWLR 683 at p 692; nevertheless, that does not mean the appeal bench will of necessity come to a conclusion in relation to penalty different from the sentencing judge but only that it must exercise the sentencing discretion:  
     Warman International Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Ankucic) 
      (1998) 80 IR 326 at p 338; and, in independently determining an appropriate sentence, the appeal court nevertheless has regard to the way in which the matter was approached at first instance as a useful analytic device:  
     Fletcher Construction Australia Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Fisher) 
      (1999) 91 IR 66 at p 81. In short, and as the Full Bench observed in  
     Capral Aluminium 
      (99 IR at p 37) - ""The approach to be adopted in an appeal under those provisions (s 196 and s 5AA) is now settled"". We agree. 
      
       
      
     4     
     An early question arose in the hearing of the appeal as Mr J V  
     Agius 
      SC, who appeared with Mr A J  
     Tudehope 
      of counsel for the appellant, proceeded to develop his submissions. That question was whether the maximum penalty provided for a breach of s 15 was $500,000 or $750,000 in the case of a corporation by reason of s 51A of the  
     Occupational Health and Safety Act 
      as it was amended by the  
     WorkCover Legislation Amendment Act 
      1995 which commenced on 1 February 1996. Mr  
     Agius 
      submitted that  
     Maidment 
      J erred in applying the increased penalty of $750,000 and that the correct amount was $500,000; on the other hand, the respondent, represented by Ms P E  
     McDonald 
      of counsel, submitted that the amount was properly $750,000. The issue here was whether s 51A, where a defendant had previously been convicted of an offence against the  
     Occupational Health and Safety Act 
     , made the maximum penalty $750,000 or $500,000 with a discretion in the sentencing judge to increase it by $250,000 depending upon the circumstances.  
     Maidment 
      J approached the assessment of penalty on the basis that the maximum was $750,000 because his Honour reached ""the view that the nature of this offence and the recent antecedents of [the appellant] are such that the provisions of s 51A should be activated, assuming I have a discretion in the matter"". Mr  
     Agius 
      submitted that the discretion in this case should be exercised in the appellant's favour to make the maximum penalty $500,000. 
      
       
      
     5     
     However, and very properly if we may say so, Mr  
     Agius 
      accepted that a Full Bench of the Court in  
     Capral Aluminium 
      had reserved this very question as to the operation of s 51A and, as he said, ""if the Full Court decides in Capral that [our] approach to 51A is wrong and there is no discretion, then it will not be necessary for this Court … to have regard to what we say about the way in which his Honour Justice Maidment exercised his discretion"". As it happened, and after judgment was reserved in this matter, the Full Bench gave judgment in  
     Capral Aluminium 
      on 21 July 2000 and, after extensively considering the position (99 IR at pp 40-51), concluded that in such cases the maximum penalty was $750,000 with no separate discretion as to the additional penalty provided under s 51A. We propose to follow the approach so recently decided in  
     Capral Aluminium 
     , an approach in any event with which we agree, so that the maximum penalty for present purposes is $750,000. 
      
       
      
     6     
     In challenging the severity of the sentence imposed by  
     Maidment 
      J and in seeking a reduction thereof, the grounds of appeal relied upon were : 
      
       
        
         
         (1) The penalty was harsh and manifestly excessive. 
          
          
         (2) His Honour Mr Justice Maidment, when determining the penalty, failed to give sufficient weight to the evidence and in particular to the following: 
          
          
           
           (i) that the Appellant pleaded guilty at an early stage; 
           
          
          
           
           (ii) that the Appellant co-operated with the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales; 
           
          
          
           
           (iii) the Appellant carried out it's ( 
           sic 
           ) own investigation of the accident; 
           
          
          
           
           (iv) the Appellant's commitment to a safe working environment; 
           
          
          
           
           (v) the improvements implemented by the appellant; 
           
          
          
           
           (vi) the size and nature of the appellant's workforce and its numerous work sites; 
           
          
          
           
           (vii) the inherent risks involved in the occupation carried on by the appellant; 
           
          
          
           
           (viii) the Appellant's commitment to maintaining and improving workplace safety. 
           
          
          
         (3) His Honour Mr Justice Maidment erred when he determined that the Appellant retains responsibilities to employees of Rail Services of Australia who now perform the painting function as a consequence of ss 16 and 17 of the Occupational Health & Safety Act 1983 as:- 
          
          
           
           (i) such a determination was not available on the evidence before the Court. 
           
          
          
           
           (ii) the finding was ultra vires. 
           
          
          
         (4) His Honour Mr Justice Maidment erred when he determined that the Joint Investigation Report had concluded that management was not responsible for the deficiencies in the warning system that was in place. 
          
          
         (5) His Honour Mr Justice Maidment erred in failing to give sufficient weight to his finding that the statement of the train driver concerning the signal made by Mr Franklin ought to be accepted in preference to the statement of Mr Franklin. 
          
          
         (6) His Honour Mr Justice Maidment erred in failing to give sufficient weight to evidence including evidence of paint stains on the side and not the front of the train carriage which indicated that Mr Franklin had moved from a safe position to an unsafe position as the train passed him. 
          
          
         (7) His Honour Mr Justice Maidment erred in applying the increased penalty provided for in s 51A of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1983. 
         
        
       
      
     7     
     The challenged judgment set out in detail a statement of agreed facts, together with further agreed facts, and it is convenient to repeat them for present purposes, as follows : 
      
       
        
         
         1. At all material times the Informant was an Inspector duly appointed and empowered by Section 48 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 to institute proceedings in the within matter. 
          
           
          
         2. At all material times the defendant, STATE RAIL AUTHORITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES, was a statutory body corporate pursuant to the provisions of the Transport Administration Act, 1988, with its head office situated at 11-31 York Street, Sydney, in the State of New South Wales. 
          
          
         3. At all material times, the defendant was responsible for the provision and maintenance of the rail transport service in New South Wales. 
          
          
         4. At all material times, the defendant employed Jurgen Graf and Albert Franklin as painters. Albert Franklin had been employed with the State Rail Authority for 39 years and 8 months as a painter. 
          
          
         5. On the Saturday, the 1st of June 1996, at about 8.25am, Albert Franklin was walking along railway tracks undertaking sign painting duties when he was struck by a train under the bridge near Erskineville Station. Albert suffered a fractured pelvis, fractured leg and internal injuries. 
          
          
         6. An inspection of the scene of this accident was undertaken on the 18 June 1996. An inspection report was prepared and photographs taken. The investigation revealed that a road bridge extended over the railway lines near Erskineville Station. 
          
          
         7. The investigation revealed that Franklin was working with another person, Jurgen Graf painting the kilometre and half kilometre signs. On arrival to Erskineville station they were looking for the signs. They walked to the northern end of the station where there were stairs onto the tracks. 
          
          
         8. As this point, a warning light is positioned adjacent to the railway line, facing in the opposite direction of their travel, which when illuminated, indicates that no train is approaching and they can walk under the bridge. After walking past the light, it is unable to see if the light is still illuminated. 
          
           
          
         9. Franklin stated that the light was on and therefore it was clear to walk onto the track. They walked onto the track and had to pass under a bridge which is approximately 30 metres in length. As they reached the end of the bridge a train came around the bend. Franklin placed his body face to wall and Graf was approximately three metres behind him.  
          
          
         10. Graf phoned for an ambulance and to have the trains stopped from the next signal phone. 
          
          
         11. The State Rail Authority of NSW has conducted a Joint Investigation report which reveals several points. 
          
          
           
           a) the warning system was found to be inadequate 
            
           b) poor positioning of the warning lights 
            
           c) the variation of the time spans for the warning lights 
            
           d) the limited space between the wall of the bridge and the oncoming trains 
            
           
          
         12. The time to walk unhurried from one side of the bridge to the other is stated to be about 30 seconds by Mr J Rasborske, (Signal Service Engineer), he also states that the average warning time of 30 seconds is only adequate to pass under the bridge. The warning times when tests were conducted on 14 June 1996 varied from 26.4 seconds to well over 30 seconds. The warning times vary depending upon the speed of the approaching train. 
          
           
          
         13. New signs warning people of the restricted clearance were erected under the bridge. 
          
          
         14. On the day of the accident, Franklin and Graf received their work instructions from Civil Track Inspector, Geoff Brown. The men were directed to paint all kilometre pegs between 10.5 kms and 2.5 kms on the up and down Illawarra Lines, East Hills lines and Bankstown lines under the control of Geoff Brown. 
          
          
         15. The two men commenced work on the city end of Sydenham and had to walk approximately 5 km along the railway lines painting the kilometre signs. 
          
          
         16. Following the accident, warning signs were erected under the railway bridge warning of restricted space when trains are passing, and the warning light was found to not give sufficient warning. Circuit alterations were made, as well as the installation of an additional warning light. 
          
          
         17. It is alleged that the defendant has breached Section 15(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, on the 1 June 1996, at railway tracks at Erskineville Railway bridge, Erskineville, in the State of New South Wales, being an employer, did fail to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all its employees, in particular Albert Franklin and Jurgen Graf, in failing to provide and maintain systems of work, to wit, systems in undertaking maintenance work, that was safe and without risk to health, in that: 
          
          
           
           a) At all material times, the defendant employed Albert Franklin and Jurgen Graf. 
            
            
           b) The defendant failed to provide and maintain systems of access to railway areas to undertake painting maintenance work that was safe and without risk to health. 
            
            
           c) As a result of the said failure, Albert Franklin suffered a fractured pelvis and leg and internal injuries, and Jurgen Graf was placed at risk of injury. 
            
           
          
         Additionally it is agreed that SRA entered an early plea, co-operated fully with WCA and, at the time of the accident, employed more than 22,000 persons at over 1,000 separate work sites many of whom worked in inherently dangerous occupations involving proximity to moving trains. 
          
          
         The accident occurred on 1 June 1996 and, from 1 July of that year, SRA was divested of certain of its functions which are now performed by employees taken up by Rail Services Australia, Freight Corporation and Rail Access Corporation. The works upon which Messrs Franklin and Graf were engaged upon now fall within the activities of Rail Services Australia. 
          
          
         Since the restructuring the number of employees of SRA has fallen from 22,000 to about 8,500 and an Organisational Development Division, which employs 12 full time persons in the Safety Improvement Division, has been instituted by SRA. A further 16 persons are employed in the Safety Standards and Compliance Division. The two Divisions have responsibility for health and safety within SRA. A statement by John Harper, Manager of the Safety Improvement Division, which was tendered, evidences a significant SRA commitment to the maintenance and improvement of workplace safety.

     Following the accident, the appellant established a Board of Inquiry (comprised of four representatives from management, signal engineering, civil engineering and occupational health and safety areas) to enquire into the circumstances concerning Mr Franklin being struck by the train and injured.  
     Maidment 
      J developed his reasoning on the gravity of the offence by reference to the Board's views as to the evidence it obtained; those views were set out in the Board's report as follows : 
      
       
        
         
         The Boards  
         (sic) 
          considers from the evidence presented that Mr Franklin and Mr Graf along with the inadequate warning light system were responsible for the incident occurring at Erskineville on Saturday 1 June 1996. 
          
          
         The Board refutes the statement given by Mr Franklin that the warning light was still on when he was struck by run 3B-D as all visual tests carried out on the day by staff proved that the warning light extinguished prior to the arrival of trains. 
          
          
         The warning light system was checked by Signal Engineering staff, hand tracing all relevant circuit wiring with no irregularities being evident. 
          
          
         The signal Engineer placed monitoring equipment on the warning light for a 24 hour period which also included all train running over the period in question of a Saturday morning and no irregularities were in evidence. 
          
          
         The driver of run 3B-D has stated that the employee gave his train an all clear hand signal indicating to the driver he was clear of the running line when he was not. 
          
          
         The Board investigated the warning light at length and found that a track was missing from the circuit. This would have had an effect on the operation of the warning light for trains under 4 carriages but had no effect in this instance. This circuit has now been modified to include the missing track. 
          
          
         The Board has conducted tests on walking time for this area and has found that the warning times are only just adequate for a staff member to walk from one side to the other and to be clear for the passage of a train. 
          
          
         The Board also considers from the evidence presented that the warning light is poorly positioned for staff to be able to monitor its operation when walking under the bridge as staff are required to continually look back thus taking their attention away from approaching trains. 
         
        
       
      
     10     
     His Honour then cited the conclusions reached by the Board in relation to each of its terms of reference; those conclusions were : 
      
       
        
         
         1. Examine and report on how the incident occurred 
          
          
         The Board finds that Albert Franklin and Jurgen Graf, while relying on an ( 
         sic 
         ) warning system found to be indequate ( 
         sic 
         ) by the Board placed themselves in a position with restricted train sighting and limited safe refuge but failed to keep a clear lookout for approaching trains. 
          
          
         2. Establish who or what was responsible for the incident and identify any irregularities 
          
          
         The Board finds that Mr. A Franklin and Mr J. Graf were responsible for the incident along with the inadequacy of the warning light's positioning. 
          
          
         3. Examine and report on the adequacy of the warning light/s 
          
          
         The Board finds the warning light inadequate due to the poor positioning of the light and also the duration of the warning by the light of an approaching train. 
          
          
         4. Examine and report on any shortcomings or failure in the management process that contributed to, or failed, to prevent the incident 
          
          
         The Board finds no shortcomings or failure of Management process that contributed to this incident. 
         
        
        
         
         5. Review and make recommendations on management responsibility and accountabilities, including lines of communication, authority, delegation etc. 
          
          
         The Board finds that the Management is responsible to improve the warning system in this area. 
          
          
         6. Examine and report on the extent of Compliance the System Safety Plan applicable to the cause determined by the Board 
          
          
         The Board has identified Hazard D 32 - 109 Strike by Train/Coach as the appropriate safety plan. The Board has found no evidence of failure to comply with the System Safety Plan as both staff have been trained in PW 11 and Mr. Franklin has been trained in PW31 worksite duties. 
          
          
         7. Make any recommendation/s (If Required) to prevent a similar occurrence 
          
          
         1) The Board recommends the repositioning of the warning light or positioning of additional warning light/s for staff walking or working under the bridge and if repositioning occurs that all relevant disciplines be requested for comments on the proposed location. 
          
          
         2) The Board recommends that the approach time from the Down Illawarra Relief line be increased to a minimum of 35 seconds. 
          
          
         3) The standard signage of Light out indicates train approaching be affixed adjacent to the warning light. 
          
          
         4) The Board recommends that a standard sign be developed informing all staff of limited clearances in tunnels on bridges etc where limited clearances exist and no refuges exist. 
         
        
       
      
     11     
     After commenting that those conclusions were not criticised by the parties during the proceedings, his Honour expressed disquiet as to three aspects thereof: first, that the two employees, Mr Franklin and Mr Graf, were responsible for the incident in that they failed to keep a clear lookout for approaching trains; second, that no shortcomings or failure of management process had contributed to the incident; and, third, that the Board was confined in its recommendations to the particular area where the incident occurred and did not identify similar deficiencies at other locations. Specifically in relation to each of those concerns, his Honour made the following respective comments : 
      
       
      
     ·  
     The train came around a curve, and, as I understand the driver's statement, it was doing at least 25 kph and was only 30 metres from Mr Franklin when the driver saw him. The statement of Mr Rasborsek, Signal Services Engineer Illawarra, is that: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ""The sighting of approaching trains is severely limited by the curvature of the track and bridge structure. A reasonable sighting of the down Illawarra relief is only possible after the bridge is passed."" 
            
           
          
          
          The evidence is that, before they walked under the bridge, Messrs Franklin and Graf ensured that the warning light was illuminated which indicated that no train was approaching, Mr Franklin said ""lets go"", they set off and the train arrived before Mr Graf had reached the end of the bridge, Mr Franklin being a short distance in front of him. It is not suggested that they were tardy. Bearing in mind the fact that ""the sighting of approaching trains is severely limited"" it is difficult to understand the criticism of the two employees. 
          
         
        
       
      
     ·  
     Management had the clear responsibility to ensure that the warning system was adequate. It failed in that responsibility. I fail to see, on the material contained in the report, any basis upon which the Board could conclude that management was innocent whilst, at the same time, it expressed the view that the inadequacy of the warning system contributed to the accident. It seems to me that those in management responsible for not having detected and remedied this deficiency should be identified and made aware of their failings, as should their superior officers. 
      
       
        
         
          
          If management is cocooned from its responsibility for accidents which arise from systems deficiencies it is less likely that safety standards will be met and maintained. 
          
         
        
       
      
     ·  
     If the warning system at Erskineville was deficient the cause of that deficiency should be investigated. The fact of the deficiency was identified, the circumstances which created it were not. Identification of those circumstances might indicate the presence of such deficiencies at other locations. No attention appears to have been afforded by the Board to such a possibility. 
      
       
      
     12     
     His Honour noted that the inquiry by the Board resulted in ""a longer warning time is now provided at the location, additional warning lights have been installed and signs warning of the restricted space under the bridge have been posted"". 
      
       
      
     13     
     His Honour then succinctly stated the essential nature of what occurred in the incident on 1 June 1996 in the following way : 
      
       
        
         
         The fact is that two employees were required to walk along a rail track, underneath a bridge with limited clearance between the wall and the rail, in circumstances in which the warning system as to oncoming trains was inadequate. As was submitted by Mr  
         Tudehope 
         , the job was inherently dangerous, that being so it seems to me that SRA should have been especially vigilant to ensure the existence of an adequate warning system. 
          
          
         As Mr Franklin did not give evidence I am prepared to accept the statement by the train driver that he saw what he understood to be an all clear hand signal being given by the first of the two employees he saw at the site of the accident. I also accept that that person must have been Mr Franklin. Whatever the position Mr Franklin was in it turned out that he was not in a safe situation and, as is seen from the photographs of the scene, there was little space between the track and a retaining wall. Piping and ducting make the space narrower and loose stones underfoot would not have made it any easier for him. He received serious injuries. Mr Graf was luckier as, although he had not reached the end of the bridge, he was able to flatten himself against the wall and was uninjured. 
         
        
       
      
     14     
     Features of the offence subjective to the appellant in mitigation of penalty were taken into account by his Honour who, after describing the offence as ""serious"", referred to the appellant's co-operation with the investigating authorities, the early plea of guilty and the fact that it carried out its own investigation of the accident. Specific reference was made by his Honour to the appellant's commitment in maintaining and improving workplace safety and to the large size and nature of the appellant's undertaking as then involving some 22,000 employees at more than 1,000 sites with a requirement to work in proximity to railway lines throughout the network as relevant in considering the appellant's industrial safety record. 
      
       
      
     15     
     In relation to a submission put for the appellant at first instance, to the effect that it was inappropriate to include deterrence from similar conduct as a component of any penalty imposed because it had been divested of many functions and was no longer responsible for the type of duties performed by Mr Franklin and Mr Graf, his Honour found that the appellant retained responsibility for the safety of any such employees of Rail Services Australia which now performed the painting functions as a consequence of ss 16 and 17 of the  
     Occupational Health and Safety Act 
     . The appellant put also to his Honour that any convictions recorded against it as from 1 July 1996, the date the appellant was restructured and various functions divested to other authorities, had no relevance against the appellant in its current form unless it related to an activity retained by the appellant in its restructured form. His Honour did not accept that proposition but rather, as he said, ""the antecedents of SRA must be considered against the perspective of its then scale of operations"". 
      
       
      
     16     
     In the result, his Honour imposed the penalty of $420,000 by concluding in all the circumstances : 
      
       
        
         
         This serious offence arises from a failure to ensure the safety of employees who were known to be subjected to an obvious hazard. The deficiency in the warning system should never have existed and, once it did exist, it should have been identified and remedied. The remedial steps were simple and straightforward. 
         
        
       
      
     17     
     We have been much assisted in our consideration of this matter by the comprehensive written submissions provided by counsel for the parties as supplemented orally by them at the hearing. We have reviewed those submissions in light of the evidence in the proceedings and have concluded that although his Honour made no perceptible error in reasoning he nevertheless fixed a penalty which, in our independent opinion, was manifestly excessive having in mind the nature and quality of the present offence; we reach that view after making due allowance for the features subjective to the appellant, particularly its early plea of guilty and its co-operation with the investigation conducted by the WorkCover Authority. We have approached our task in that respect in a manner consistent with the general principles in sentencing referred to by  
     Kirby 
      P, as his Honour then was, in  
     Camilleri's Stock Feeds v Environment Protection Authority  
     (32 NSWLR at pp 698-699) as follows : 
      
       
        
         
         1. While it is the function of the Court itself to assess the seriousness of the offence in question, the maximum penalty available for an offence reflects the ""public expression"" by parliament of the seriousness of the offence:  
         R v H 
          (1980) 3 A Crim R 53 at 65. Here, the maximum penalty is $125,000. Such a large penalty indicates the gravity of the offence as perceived by the community: see also the comments of the Hon T J Moore in  
         New South Wales Parliamentary Debates 
          (Legislative Assembly), 20 November 1990, 10037 at 10038. The task of a court is to assess the relative seriousness of the offender's particular offence in relation to a worst case for which the maximum penalty is provided. Having determined the relative seriousness of the offence, the penalty to be imposed is that which approximately correlates upon the scale of penalty set by the legislature from zero to the maximum. 
          
          
         2. A maximum penalty is to be imposed where the case falls within the worst category of cases for which the penalty is prescribed. This is to be determined on the facts of the case:  
         Ibbs v The Queen 
          (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 452. However, ""that does not mean that a lesser penalty must be imposed if it be possible to envisage a worse case; ingenuity can always conjure up a case of greater heinousness. A sentence which imposes the maximum penalty offends this principle only if the case is recognisably outside the worst category"":  
         Veen v The Queen [No 2] 
          (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 478. 
          
          
         3. The Court must keep in mind not only the facts which establish the seriousness of the offence but also those which tend to mitigate that seriousness or exculpate the offender. In this process, where a relevant fact is the subject of conflicting evidence, and where that evidence is of like probability, the Court should resolve the conflict of fact in favour of the offender: see  
         R v O'Neill 
          [1979] 2 NSWLR 582 at 588. 
          
          
         4. While the offender can only be sentenced for the offence for which it has been convicted, the court is ""bound to take into consideration the circumstances surrounding the offence of which the prisoner has been convicted, so long as those circumstances are not inconsistent with the plea or verdict"":  
         R v De Simoni 
          (1981) 147 CLR 383 at 396. Such an approach is consistent with the Court's proper evaluation of an offender's antecedent history where it does not lead to the imposition of a penalty disproportionate to the gravity of the particular offence(s) charged: see  
         Veen v The Queen [No 2] 
          (at 477). 
         
        
       
      
     18     
     In submitting that the penalty imposed by  
     Maidment 
      J was harsh and manifestly excessive, Mr  
     Agius 
      developed the grounds of appeal by focusing on three areas of alleged error by his Honour. The third of those areas concerned the s 51A point as to the level of the maximum penalty. We have dealt with that last-mentioned aspect already and confirm that the scale of penalty available in this case is from zero to $750,000 and within which range the relative seriousness of the subject offence is to be assessed. The first aspect referred to by Mr  
     Agius 
      concerned his Honour's approach to the report of the Board of Inquiry and his Honour's findings in relation thereto; and the second aspect was his Honour's finding that the appellant retained responsibility for employees of Rail Services Australia performing painting functions on the rail network after 1 July 1996.  
      
       
      
     19     
     The particular challenge to his Honour's approach to the Board of Inquiry's finding was contained within ground (4) of the notice of appeal and claimed his Honour ""erred when he determined that [the Board] had concluded that management was not responsible for the deficiencies in the warning system that was in place"". The written submission for the appellant put that : 
      
       
        
         
         … his Honour was mistaken in his interpretation of the findings of the report. In the very next paragraph of the joint investigation report, there is a finding that, ""the board finds that management is responsible to improve the warning system in this area"". … Clearly management accepted responsibility for the accident. … there is a clear difference between a finding that there were no shortcomings in the management process and finding that management was responsible for the accident. 
          
          
         His Honour failed to recognise this difference and sought … to bring the matter to the attention of management by the imposition of a heavy penalty. In so doing, his Honour fell into appellable error. 
         
        
        
       In his oral submissions, Mr  
       Agius 
        said : 
        
        
         
         … his Honour fell into error in interpreting what the Board said about management's responsibility and role in this matter and in particular there was no finding by the Board that management was innocent. Quite to the contrary, the Board found that management has responsibility and the Board drew attention to management processes which were distinguished entirely from responsibility from the incident itself which the Board squarely placed at the foot of management. The extent to which his Honour took that into account again we suggest his Honour fell into error. 
         
        
       
      
     20     
     We see no error in his Honour's reasoning. Indeed, we find the disquiet expressed by his Honour as to certain of the Board's conclusions understandable and we share it. A finding, as made by the Board, that ""no shortcomings or failure of Management process that contributed to this incident"" is difficult to reconcile with its finding ""that the Management is responsible to improve the warning system in this area"". And, as referred to by his Honour, those findings are to be seen in light of the other finding by the Board that the two employees concerned ""were responsible for the incident along with the inadequacy of the warning light's positioning"". If there be any error, then, in our view, it related to the somewhat equivocal findings of the Board in what were perhaps imprecisely drawn terms of reference which it endeavoured to address. In any event, howsoever one views those findings the conclusion by his Honour, earlier expressed, to the effect that the two employees were required to be in an area with limited clearance in circumstances where the warning system as to oncoming trains was inadequate, was demonstrably well established; in fact, it was admitted by the appellant. 
      
       
      
     21     
     Mr  
     Agius' 
      submission in drawing a distinction between ""management process"" in not contributing to this incident and ""management responsibility to improve the warning system"" led to senior counsel's eventual submission that ""the cause of this accident was not the lack of sufficient warning by the warning light, the cause of this accident was Mr Franklin moving from the position of safety in which he was in to a position which was not safe"" contrary to ""the rail safety awareness rules"" put in place by the appellant. In other words, as senior counsel put, ""all I am addressing is the real cause of this accident"" which does not support the findings made by  
     Maidment 
      J. As senior counsel added, ""we are guilty, we are culpable, but to a degree less than that which has been found against us … in terms of penalty"". Senior counsel went so far as to submit that ""Mr Franklin was in a position of safety … he moved to a position which was not a position of safety; he should never have been permitted to do that; he should have been warned; something should have told him not to move there, but it didn't and that is our culpability, but it is a lot less than the culpability that his Honour found against us"". 
      
       
      
     22     
     It is timely, in view of Mr  
     Agius' 
      submission in qualitatively attempting to assess the appellant's real culpability, to emphasise by repeating the offence charged - it was, in terms, that the appellant ""failed to provide and maintain systems of access to railway areas to undertake painting maintenance work that was safe and without risk to health"".  
     Maidment 
      J certainly found that it was ""difficult to understand the criticism of the two employees"", but, his Honour's essential finding was the seriousness of the offence arising from, as he concluded, ""a failure to ensure the safety of employees who were known to be subjected to an obvious hazard. The deficiency in the warning system should never have existed and, once it did exist, it should have been identified and remedied"". There is nothing in that finding, in our understanding of it, which conflicted with the disquiet expressed by his Honour in light of the seeming inconsistencies in the Board's findings. It is to be borne in mind also that the statement of agreed facts disclosed the appellant accepted that ""the warning system was found to be inadequate"", ""poor positioning of the warning lights"", ""the variation of the time spans for the warning lights"" and ""the limited space between the wall of the bridge and the oncoming trains"". It may well be that his Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offence in an excessive amount, as claimed by ground (1) in the notice of appeal, but, in our view, it cannot be said his Honour mis-stated or misunderstood the essential nature of the offence itself. Ground (4) must fail. 
      
       
      
     23     
     It is apt while considering the nature of the obligation cast on an employer to maintain a safe workplace to repeat the words of  
     Hill 
      J, with which we agree, in  
     WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Egan) v Atco Controls Pty Ltd 
      (1998) 82 IR 80 at p 85, that is : 
      
       
        
         
         This case is yet another illustration of the need for employers to exercise abundant caution, maintain constant vigilance and take all practicable precautions to ensure safety in the workplace. It is essential that the approach should be a pro-active and not a re-active one; employers should be on the offensive to search for, detect and eliminate, so far as is reasonably practicable, any possible areas of risk to safety, health and welfare which may exist or occur from time to time in the workplace. 
         
        
       
      
     24     
     It has been said repeatedly in this Court that the general approach to sentencing under the  
     Occupational Health and Safety Act 
      is now settled in that the primary factor to look at is the objective seriousness of the offence: see  
     Lawrenson Diecasting Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Ch'ng) 
      (1999) 90 IR 464 at p 475;  
     Fletcher Construction 
      (91 IR at pp 77-78); and  
     Warman International 
      (80 IR at p 339). However, it seems to us, in order for the Court to perform that task the offence charged needs to be accurately identified. Here, it may well be, and as Mr  
     Agius 
      submitted, that the real or direct cause of the accident was Mr Franklin moving to an unsafe position underneath the overhead bridge as a result of which he sustained injury. That is to be seen, however, and as  
     Maidment 
      J found, where there was ""limited clearance between the wall and the rail, in circumstances in which the warning system as to oncoming trains was inadequate"". One is reminded in such a situation of the relevant distinction for sentencing purposes between the immediate cause and the prior steps being the detriment to safety enabling the cause to operate and to which the charge is essentially directed. In  
     WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector McMartin) v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd 
      (1999) 96 IR 32 at pp 43-44,  
     Hungerford 
      J commented on the distinction as follows : 
      
       
        
         
         I accept [senior counsel's] submission that the  
         causa causans 
          of the accident was the use of the industrial hammer to strike the legs of the structure. However, that was only the immediate cause of the collapse and which cause could not have become operative without the defendant's failure to assess the stability of the structure on the day it was to be demolished and to provide adequate supervision to ensure the planned system was followed. Put another way, although the  
         causa causans 
          may seem innocuous enough, and as not involving very much culpability on the part of the defendant itself, the real failure here by the defendant to provide or maintain a safe system of work was the  
         causa sine qua non 
          being the preceding link in the chain of causation in failing to assess the structure's stability by adequate supervision at the time it was to be demolished; the failure to ensure work was not performed on the structure prior to the arrival of the mobile crane was contrary to the proposed method as originally planned. 
         
        
       
      
     25     
     It is relevant also in the present case to repeat the proposition that inattention or mere inadvertence of an employee serves to show only the need for an employer to be astute in ensuring safety and in meeting all reasonable contingencies: see  
     WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Chadwick) v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd 
      (2000) 98 IR 122 at p 135 per

      J in  
     WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Twynam-Perkins) v Maine Lighting Pty Ltd 
      (unreported, CT94/1037, 13 April 1995) correctly and forcefully emphasised (at p 18) that ""the Act was designed to protect against human errors including inadvertence, inattention, haste and even foolish disregard of personal safety as well as the foreseeable technical risks in industry"".

     Ground (3) of the appeal alleged  
     Maidment 
      J erred in finding that the appellant retained responsibilities for employees of Rail Services Australia who now performed the painting functions following the restructure of the appellant as from 1 July 1996. This point, as the argument went, involved the appellant's submission that his Honour overly allowed for the deterrence component of penalty whereas because of the actual loss of such a responsibility the defendant should not have incurred a higher penalty for specific deterrence from similar conduct in the future. In finding difficulty with that proposition, his Honour observed the appellant retained responsibilities for employees of Rail Services Australia performing painting functions as a consequence of ss 16 and 17 of the  
     Occupational Health and Safety Act 
     . However, a consideration of this ground must proceed in the context of the whole of his Honour's reasoning and, in particular, the appellant's submission at first instance that convictions of the appellant prior to being divested of many of its functions and responsibilities as from 1 July 1996 had no relevance against the appellant in its current form unless they related to an activity retained by it in its restructured form. His Honour rejected that proposition but nevertheless accepted that the appellant's antecedents were to be seen against the perspective of its then scale of operations. Mr  
     Agius 
      conceded the evidence before his Honour did not make it absolutely plain whether the two employees were no longer employed by the appellant or that their functions had passed to Rail Services Australia or that the appellant no longer had control of the track, signals and warning systems; even so, senior counsel submitted that without evidence of a continuing control in the appellant no adverse finding on this point could be made against it.  
      
       
      
     27     
     The place of deterrence in fixing an appropriate penalty was considered extensively by the Full Bench in  
     Capral Aluminium  
     (99 IR at pp 59-62). Their Honours found a useful starting point to be what was said by  
     Street 
      CJ in  
     R v Rushby 
      [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 at p 597 in which the Chief Justice adopted the decision of the Court of Appeal in New Zealand in  
     R v Radich 
      [1954] NZLR 86 at p 87 for the proposition that ""one of the main purposes of punishment … is to protect the public from the commission of such crimes by making it clear to the offender and to other persons with similar impulses that, if they yield to them, they will meet with severe punishment"". Although recognising that general deterrence and specific deterrence have differing purposes or aims, of relevance here where the painting operations on the rail network were the responsibility of either the appellant or Rail Services Australia is the express endorsement by their Honours in  
     Capral Aluminium 
      (99 IR at p 60) of the following extract from the judgment of  
     Hungerford  
     J in  
     Fisher v Samaras Industries Pty Ltd 
      (1996) 82 IR 384 at p 388 as accurately stating the approach to be adopted in relation to the issue of deterrence, both general and personal or specific, when sentencing an offender for a serious breach of the legislation : 
      
       
        
         
         … the fundamental duty of the Court in this important area of public concern … [is] to ensure a level of penalty for a breach as will compel attention to occupational health and safety issues so that persons are not exposed to risks to their health and safety at the workplace. 
         
        
       
      
     28     
     After reviewing the authorities on deterrence, their Honours in  
     Capral Aluminium 
      (99 IR at p 61) referred to the need to encourage a sufficient level of diligence by the offender in the future, particularly where it conducts a large enterprise involving inherent risks to safety, and then observed : 
      
       
        
         
         We would have considered that this approach was appropriate even before the significant increase in levels of penalty were legislatively imposed effective from 1996. However, that legislative step is itself relevant to this question. As Spigelman CJ held (with the concurrence of Wood CJ at CL and McInerney J) in  
         R v Howland  
         (1999) 104 A Crim R 273 at pars 41 and 43: 
          
          
           
           ""41 … the community has indicated that it wishes to denounce this conduct in the strongest terms. … By the increases in the maximum sentences, the community, acting through the Parliament, has indicated that this is a crime which it wishes to denounce and deter. It is the duty of the judges to reflect this community concern. 
            
            
           … 
            
            
           43 Sentencing has always been based on the acceptance of the proposition that condign punishment of offenders will have deterrent effect on others."" 
            
           
          
         We conclude, in the light of the extract from the judgment in  
         R v Howland 
          that the significant increases in penalty which occurred from 1996 are of considerable significance in emphasising the importance of both particular and general deterrence in the sentencing process for offences against the Act and that the approach exemplified by the judgment of Hungerford J in  
         Fisher v Samaras Industries Pty Ltd 
          is decisively confirmed by that legislative intervention. It follows that we do not accept the appellant's submissions in relation to the question of deterrence, although the precise weight to be given to that issue is inevitably within the sentencing judge's discretion:  
         Director of Public Prosecutions v El Karhani 
          (1990) 21 NSWLR 370 at 378. We conclude that in this case, although deterrence in both of its relevant respects is pertinent here, weight should also be given to the particular circumstances of the appellant. 
         
        
       
      
     29     
     In the present case, of course, the State's rail network requires maintenance in the future, whether by the appellant or Rail Services Australia, and it does not seem to us having in mind the above comments in  
     R v Howland 
      (1999) 104 A Crim R 273 that the circumstances here are sufficient to remove or even minimise the personal or specific deterrence of the appellant in a consideration of penalty for the subject offence. The approach in terms of principle stated by the Full Bench in  
     Capral Aluminium 
      is, in our view, consistent with the approach adopted by  
     Maidment 
      J in this case and all the more so where his Honour expressly took into account on this aspect the then size and scale of the appellant's operations. Ground (3), therefore, has not been established. 
      
       
      
     30     
     Grounds (5) and (6) of the appeal concerned errors allegedly made by  
     Maidment 
      J as to insufficient weight given by his Honour to the location of Mr Franklin under the bridge in terms of its degree of safety and whether he thereby himself contributed to the accident by moving from a safe to an unsafe position. We have dealt earlier with this aspect in considering ground (4) and content ourselves by saying that there was no or no sufficiently relevant connection with the detriment to safety the subject of the charge. We reject the appellant's submission on this ground which was that the only conclusion open to his Honour was consistent with the Board's report that Mr Franklin had some responsibility for his injuries. The admitted fact remains, as found by his Honour, that the two employees were under a bridge with limited clearance between the wall and the rail tracks in a situation where the warning system was inadequate; in that circumstance, any conduct by Mr Franklin, as we have said, was understandable and we find a submission that he contributed to what occurred as simply untenable. Grounds (5) and (6) have not been made out. 
      
       
      
     31     
     Before turning to grounds (1) and (2) in the notice of appeal, which dealt with the proper assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence as reduced by the subjective features in mitigation, we should advert to the submissions put by Ms  
     McDonald 
      for the respondent. It is unnecessary, in light of our conclusions otherwise on the appellant's submissions, to repeat in detail what counsel put. However, we should say that the substance of our earlier comments on Mr  
     Agius' 
      submissions was conditioned by what Ms  
     McDonald 
      said. 
      
       
      
     32     
     Although we have found no error by his Honour in the terms of grounds (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) in the notice of appeal, the primary function remains on appeal to individually assess in objective terms the nature and quality of the offence charged. This requires attention to grounds (1) and (2) with which we now deal. 
      
       
      
     33     
     Ms  
     McDonald 
      in her written submissions outlined the circumstances of the incident and then identified the following objective factors which were said to support the imposition of a substantial penalty : 
      
       
        
         
         (i) There were obvious risks involved in the type of work in that it involved employees being required to walk along operating train lines to complete painting of signs. 
          
          
         (ii) The risks involved were foreseeable. The risk of employees not being able to clear the bridge was foreseeable. The appellant's breach of its statutory duty would lead to serious consequences for its employees. 
          
          
         (iii) The warning system for approaching trains was clearly inadequate. The warning light was poorly positioned so that once an employee passed the light he/she had to continually look back to check the light. This took the employee's attention away from looking for incoming trains. 
          
          
         (iv) The positioning of the warning lights became more hazardous as the sighting of trains was blocked because of the curving of the train tracks and the bridge structure. 
          
          
         (v) The warning time given to employees was dependent upon the speed of the approaching train. The speed of the trains varied. If a train exceeded the line speeds then the warning time was greatly reduced. 
          
          
         (vi) The warning time activated by the approaching trains was inadequate and varied according to the speed of train. It takes about 30 seconds to walk from the end of the platform no 4 at Erskineville to clear the bridge. However Mr Rasborsek Signal Services Engineer found that the length of the warning time for when a train approached the bridge was well over 30 seconds. Based on his observations on 15 June 1996 the fastest train measured on that day would have resulted in a warning time of 23.2 seconds. 
          
          
         (vii) The average warning time of 30 seconds was described as ""only adequate"" to pass under the bridge. 
          
          
         (viii) There was a lack of safe refuge under the bridge. 
          
          
         (ix) The appellant was able to implement after the accident simple and straight forward steps to remedy the defects in the system. These steps included the positioning of additional warning lights; an increase in the warning time for trains on the Down Illawarra relief line to ensure that employees can safely clear the bridge; warning signs were erected indicating the limited clearance in the tunnel. 
         
        
       
      
     34     
     We agree from our review of the agreed facts and the other evidence that all of those factors existed in this case. However, and even though we agree with  
     Maidment 
      J that this offence was serious and in which the deficiency of the warning system never should have occurred and was easily remedied, we do not accept Ms  
     McDonald's 
      consequent submission that the size of the penalty imposed by his Honour reflected those findings. 
      
       
      
     35     
     The key to the assessment by  
     Maidment 
      J in qualitative terms of the degree of seriousness of this offence emerges from the acceptance by his Honour that ""the job was inherently dangerous"" and the fact as found ""that two employees were required to walk along a rail track, underneath a bridge with limited clearance between the wall and the rail, in circumstances in which the warning system as to oncoming trains was inadequate"". His Honour then described the risk to safety as ""a serious offence"" and proceeded to quantify an appropriate penalty. In that respect, his Honour made direct reference to the decision of  
     Kavanagh 
      J in  
     WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Milligan) v State Rail Authority of New South Wales  
     (unreported, IRC97/7032 to 7036, 13 October 1999) in which her Honour imposed a total penalty of $200,000 for five breaches of the  
     Occupational Health and Safety Act 
      by the appellant on 17 December 1995; at the time, the maximum penalty for each breach was $250,000. His Honour here remarked as to that decision - ""The penalties amounting to $200,000 there imposed by her Honour, in which the principle of totality was applied, is indicative of the seriousness considered to have been disclosed by the circumstances, the maximum penalty as to an offence under s 15(1) having been $250,000 at the time at which those offences were committed"". His Honour then fixed the penalty in the instant case at $420,000, and where the maximum was $750,000. Clearly, it seems to us, his Honour in attending to the objective seriousness of the offence placed considerable weight on the penalty imposed by  
     Kavanagh 
      J. In our view, that approach by his Honour in quantifying an appropriate penalty for this case was erroneous in that his Honour misunderstood the circumstances faced by  
     Kavanagh 
      J in that earlier case and so imposed an inflated penalty in this case. 
      
       
      
     36     
     Maidment 
      J, from the approach disclosed in the decision, clearly seemed to have considered the penalty of $200,000 fixed by  
     Kavanagh 
      J by reference to the then maximum of $250,000. However, what in fact her Honour did in relation to the five offences was to fix a penalty for each offence ranging from $20,000 to $110,000 (a total or cumulative penalty of $200,000) where the cumulative maximum penalty for the five offences was $1.25 million. It follows, in our view, that the reliance by his Honour on the decision of  
     Kavanagh  
     J as being ""indicative of the seriousness considered to have been disclosed by the circumstances"" resulted in the present case in a penalty which was manifestly excessive. 
      
       
      
     37     
     Whilst we have no doubt the offence here was indeed of a most serious nature, we are unable in our own separate assessment to place it at the level fixed by his Honour. 
      
       
      
     38     
     We conclude that, in objective terms and in all the circumstances, the nature and quality of the subject offence should properly be placed at around the mid-point of the available range in relation to what could be expected in a worst case. That is, an amount to the order of $375,000. 
      
       
      
     39     
     In mitigation of what the penalty might otherwise be, Mr  
     Agius 
      identified five factors subjective to the appellant, namely, co-operation with the WorkCover Authority in investigating the accident, an early plea of guilty, the appellant's own investigation of the incident, its commitment to maintaining and improving workplace safety and the nature and size of the appellant's undertaking. Senior counsel submitted, however, ""that although his Honour said that he had taken these matters into account, he either had not done so or, more likely, did not give them the weight which was due"". Further, senior counsel put that ""the fact of the plea alone, on principles ordinarily applicable in circumstances involving the infliction of a penalty, required a significant discount … where the plea both recognised contrition and avoided what would have been a long and protracted hearing"". 
      
       
      
     40     
     Ms  
     McDonald 
      emphasised that  
     Maidment 
      J took these subjective factors into account when determining penalty to an appropriate degree and, so, his Honour's assessment should be affirmed. 
      
       
      
     41     
     Mr  
     Agius 
      summarised the appellant's position in this way : 
      
       
        
         
         When one takes all of that into account and one takes account of the early plea of guilty, all of the matters which are set out in the additional agreed statement of facts, the real time that was saved by a plea of guilty in this case given the very complicated facts, the huge commitment to occupational health and safety which is demonstrated on the evidence by the SRA, the fact that there were two safety systems in operation on this day at this time - admittedly neither of them, as it turned out, proved to be adequate - but this is not a case where the problem has never been the case, when one takes into account all of those subjective features and puts them together with the submissions which we put, a penalty of $420,000 was manifestly excessive … 
         
        
       
      
     42     
     As to the role in the sentencing process of subjective factors, the Full Bench in  
     Lawrenson Diecasting 
      (90 IR at p 474) said that ""it has been observed on a number of occasions that subjective factors which mitigate the seriousness of the offence or exculpate the accused must be secondary to consideration of the nature and quality of the offence"". After citing with approval various authorities for that proposition, their Honours observed (90 IR at p 475) that ""the presence of the subjective factors referred to should not be permitted to produce a sentence which fails to adequately reflect the seriousness of the offence"". We too are of the same view. 
      
       
      
     43     
     The submission of Mr  
     Agius 
      in seeking a significant discount solely for the early plea of guilty is to be approached in the context of other circumstances. For instance, in  
     Winchester  
     (1992) 58 A Crim R 345 at p 350  
     Hunt 
      CJ at CL, with whom  
     Smart 
      J and  
     Grove 
      J agreed, said : 
      
       
        
         
         A plea of guilty is always a matter which must be taken into account when imposing sentence. The degree of leniency to be afforded will depend upon many different factors. The plea may in some cases be an indication of contrition, or of some other quality or attribute, which is regarded as relevant for sentencing purposes independently of the mere fact that the prisoner has pleaded guilty. The extent to which leniency will be afforded upon this ground will depend to a large degree upon whether or not the plea resulted from a recognition of the inevitable:  
         Shannon 
          (1979) 21 SASR 442 at 452;  
         Ellis 
          (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604. The plea of guilty may also be taken into account as a factor in its own right independently of such contrition, as mitigation for the co-operation in saving the time and cost involved in a trial. 
         
        
        
       This passage from  
       Winchester 
        was referred to with approval by the Full Bench in  
       Alcatel Australia Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Clyant)  
       (1996) 70 IR 99 at pp 102-103 as to prosecutions under the  
       Occupational Health and Safety Act 
       . 
        
       
      
     44     
     Having in mind the elements of the charge in this case, the report of the Board of Inquiry and the admitted facts, it is our opinion that Mr  
     Agius 
      overstated the degree of leniency which should be afforded to the subjective factors here, including the early plea of guilty. Much of the appellant's argument on appeal by reference to various pieces of evidence centered upon the assertion that the accident was caused by Mr Franklin and, subject to the appellant modifying its warning systems, management had no real responsibility for what occurred. Our earlier analysis on this aspect will make it clear we reject that approach. 
      
       
      
     45     
     In  
     R v Thomson; R v Houlton 
      [2000] NSWCCA 309, the Court of Criminal Appeal promulgated a guideline judgment with respect to the discount for a plea of guilty in relation to offences and referred to other matters of a subjective nature in mitigation of penalty. That guideline judgment has been applied since by this Court in prosecutions under the  
     Occupational Health and Safety Act 
      and the appellant submitted it should apply in this case. We agree and propose to do so. For completeness, the guideline adopted is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         (i) A sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account. Failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight. 
          
          
         (ii) Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant - contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value - but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last mentioned matter. Where other matters are regarded as appropriate to be quantified in a particular case, e.g. assistance to authorities, a single combined quantification will often be appropriate. 
          
          
         (iii) The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 per cent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge. 
          
          
         (iv) In some cases the plea, in combination with other relevant factors, will change the nature of the sentence imposed. In some cases a plea will not lead to any discount. 
         
        
        
       In the reasons in  
       Thomson 
       ,  
       Spigelman 
        CJ (with whom  
       Wood 
        CJ at CL,  
       Foster 
        AJA,  
       Grove  
       and  
       James  
       JJ agreed) added (at para 162) : 
        
        
         
         The discount range propounded for a guilty plea based on utilitarian considerations is not intended to result in any change in the level of sentences generally. Nothing in these reasons should be construed as indicating an opinion that trial judges have not in fact been giving appropriate consideration and weight to pleas in such a way as to distort the general level of sentences. The purpose of identifying a discount range is to improve the transparency of the process and to alter the widespread perception that there is no benefit from an early plea. Insofar as existing sentencing practice has been to allow discounts for pleas up to 35 percent, encompassing all relevant matters, such a practice remains appropriate. 
         
        
       
      
     46     
     Mr  
     Agius 
      submitted by applying the guideline judgment ""that the Appellant is entitled to have the utilitarian value of its early plea assessed at the very highest end of the discount range proposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal and should receive the benefit of a further significant discount when the other factors noted by his Honour and recorded in our earlier submissions are taken into account"". In support of that submission, senior counsel added that the appellant ""had an arguable defence"" and that ""the early plea of guilty avoided the preparation and running of what would have been a long and complex prosecution … a high utilitarian value to be placed upon the early plea … at the highest level … [the appellant] is entitled to the benefit that flows from the contrition which the early plea indicated"". As indicated above, we consider senior counsel placed the position far too highly in the circumstances. We expressly take into account the early plea of guilty, together with the other subjective features referred to.  
      
       
      
     47     
     We propose to allow, consistent with the guideline judgment, a discount of 20 per cent encompassing all relevant matters subjective to the appellant. In the result, we consider an appropriate penalty in this case to be $300,000 in lieu of $420,000 as imposed by  
     Maidment 
      J. As to costs, we propose to allow the appellant an appropriate amount relative to our consideration of the degree of success it had in relation to its grounds of appeal and with regard to the reduction in penalty found to be appropriate. 
      
       
      
     48     
     We make the following orders - 
      
       
        
         
         1. The appeal is allowed. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The penalty of $420,000 imposed by  
         Maidment 
          J is vacated and a penalty of $300,000 is substituted, with a moiety thereof to the respondent. 
         
        
        
         
         3. The stay order made on 30 November 1999 is lifted. 
         
        
        
         
         4. One-half of the appellant's costs of the appeal to be paid by the respondent in an amount as agreed or assessed.

      70104/97 - REGINA v Sunil Dhiraj HEMRAJ 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: Mr Hemraj Dhiraj Hemraj was charged with the murder of Michelle Danieletto, it being alleged by the Crown that he repeatedly struck the deceased with a hammer at the flat which they shared at Macquarie Place, Mortdale on 23 October 1996. 
     
      
    2   On 27 February 2001 Mr Hemraj was arraigned for murder and a plea was taken. He pleaded not guilty to murder. He indicated at the time of entering that plea that he was guilty of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility. The matter proceeded upon that basis. 
     
      
    3   The Crown having opened, Mr Toner SC, on behalf of Mr Hemraj, gave a short opening to the jury in which he repeated that Mr Hemraj accepted that he had carried out the act which led to the death of the deceased, but that he had no recollection of having done so. 
     
      
    4   Mr Toner outlined that it would be the defence's contention that at the relevant time he was suffering from an abnormality of mind which substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his actions and that the jury should therefore ultimately return a verdict of guilty of manslaughter. The trial proceeded for a number of days. Various witnesses were examined by Mr Toner. In the course of cross examination, Mr Toner repeated the nature of the defence which the accused made to the charge, including the accused’s acceptance that he had perpetrated the act which caused the death of the deceased. 
     
      
    5   The last witness for the Crown was Dr Wong. Dr Wong acknowledged that the behaviour of Mr Hemraj in the period between July and 2 October 1996 was, in some respects, bizarre. He, nonetheless, offered the view that at the relevant time (namely, 23 October 1996) Mr Hemraj was not suffering from an abnormality of mind and that the partial defence was not available to him. Specifically, Mr Hemraj was not, in his view, suffering from schizophrenia at that time, although it was likely that he later developed that disease. The Crown case then closed. 
     
      
    6   A medical witness was called on behalf of Mr Hemraj. He was called before Mr Hemraj gave evidence, simply because that witness came from New Zealand and was required to return to New Zealand at once. 
     
      
    7   On Sunday, 11 March 2001 the legal representatives of Mr Hemraj saw him in gaol. They did so for the purposes of preparing him to give evidence the following day. I gather from the affidavit provided by Mr Gourlie that it was evident to him that there had been some deterioration in Mr Hemraj's mental state. So far as he could discern, there had also been some change in Mr Hemraj’s instructions. Whereas previously Mr Hemraj was prepared to accept that he had slain Michelle Danieletto, although he had no recollection of having done so, that was no longer his position. He believed rather, that if Dr Wong was right in the views that he expressed when giving evidence, then he truly was the victim of some conspiracy, as was Michelle. His statements to his solicitor suggested that he believed himself not guilty. 
     
      
    8   When the matter resumed on Monday, 12 March, counsel for Mr Hemraj tendered an affidavit from his instructing solicitor identifying remarks by Mr Hemraj which altered the instructions which had previously been given. Cousel indicated that an issue had arisen as to Mr Hemraj's mental state (cf s10(1) Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, 1900) (“the Act”). A request was made that the matter stand down for the day so that Mr Hemraj could be examined by Dr Westmore. Dr Westmore had previously seen Mr Hemraj at the Bankstown Hospital Psychiatric Unit in 1998. He had subsequently provided a report on which the defence relied in respect of this trial. 
     
      
    9   Dr Westmore saw Mr Hemraj, as arranged, and provided a short report which included the following views: 
     
      
       
        
        ”He is insightless into the fact that he suffers a mental illness and is unable to consider the possibility of a mental illness defence being available to him. He states that he is not guilty of the charge and that he did not kill his girlfriend, Michelle, but then states that he would plead guilty to manslaughter on the basis that the police claim he did it. He states that the police interfered with evidence by placing blood on his clothes and that he is the victim of an elaborate conspiracy involving wealthy and influential people. Mr Hemraj continues to suffer auditory hallucinations of a persecutory type."" 
        
       
      
    10   Dr Westmore continued: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He is not able, in my view, to provide consistent instructions to his solicitor, particularly in regard to the question of what plea should be entered. His understanding of the  
        Presser 
         issues is otherwise unimpaired."" 
        
       
      
    11   Dr Westmore subsequently provided a more elaborate report on his examination amplifying that view. 
     
      
    12   In these circumstances when the court assembled yesterday, Tuesday, 13 March 2001, the jury was again sent away. Arrangements were made for Dr Milton to examine Mr Hemraj on behalf of the Crown. 
     
      
    13   Dr Milton provided a helpful report of 13 March 2001 in which he records his observations whilst interviewing Mr Hemraj. He ultimately reached the same view as Dr Westmore, that is that in many respects Mr Hemraj satisfied the test laid down by Smith J in Regina v Presser [1958] VR 45. However, in one important respect, namely the respect identified by Dr Westmore, Dr Milton likewise found that Mr Hemraj did not satisfy that test. The relevant portion of Dr Milton's report is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I agree with Dr Westmore's views as expressed in the letter of 12 March 2000. Mr Hemraj fulfils all but the last of the  
        Presser 
         criteria. I, too, considered he was unfit to provide instructions to counsel in regard to his defence and hence there is doubt about his fitness to continue his trial. 
        
       
       
        
        My perusal of the document suggests there is overwhelming evidence he was responsible for the death, but he is determined to disregard that and to instruct his solicitor to change the defence to one of not guilty, even if this means having another trial. I believe this to be irrational, a product of his psychosis."" 
        
       
      
    14   The Court assembled today. Mr Hemraj, on advice, consents to my dealing with the issue of fitness as a Judge sitting alone (s11A Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, 1990). The Crown also consents to that course. I have before me the affidavit of Mr Gourlie, as well as a number of medical reports, including the reports of Drs Westmore and Milton.  
     
      
    15   Accordingly it is plain, applying the test of unfitness, which the Act establishes, namely whether Mr Hemraj is unfit to stand trial on the balance of probabilities, that I must find that he is so unfit. 
     
      
    16   I, therefore, order that Mr Hemraj be referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. I must also discharge the jury which, of course, I will do tomorrow. I refuse bail and remand Mr Hemraj in custody for the time being, pending the execution of the order that I have made.

     2    SPERLING J: On 15 November 1999 the appellant was indicted in the District Court on one count of deemed supply of a prohibited drug, heroin, in that he had possession of a quantity of the drug which was not less than the trafficable amount. 
      
       
        
       
     3    On 18 November 1999 a jury returned a verdict of guilty. The Crown case was that the appellant was the lessee of a home unit at Yagoona, that he was living there until at least 11 November 1998 and that the drugs were found on the premises in the course of a police raid on that day. 
      
       
        
       
     4    There was evidence that the appellant leased the unit from the Department of Housing. The Crown case was that the appellant was in occupation of the unit was fortified by evidence of documents found on the premises, being a passport, an airline ticket, a bank cheque and telephone bills, all in the appellant’s name. 
      
       
        
       
     5    The accused gave evidence. He said that he had been living apart from his wife in the unit but that, shortly before 11 November, they had become reconciled. He said his wife had returned from overseas on 7 November and that, between that date and 11 November, he had been living with her at premises in Ryde. He said the drugs were not his and he had no knowledge of whose they were or who had brought them to the Yagoona unit and placed them there. 
      
       
        
       
     6    The accused’s case went further than a mere denial. He also sought to raise alternative explanations for the presence of the drugs on the premises. First, there was a suggestion that the police could have corruptly planted the drugs on the premises. In that regard, the appellant relied on evidence adduced in cross-examination of police witnesses that the search had been carried out in his absence and in the absence of any independent person, and that the video record of the search made by the police did not commence until some 25 minutes after the search began. 
      
       
        
       
     7    Secondly, the appellant gave evidence designed to raise the possibility that the drugs could have been the property of others who, he said, had access to the premises. He said that his brother, Ahmed Zreika, and a nephew, Nasser Zreika, had keys to the unit. He said that he had told Nasser that he would not be at the unit as from 7 November, that he would be living with his wife elsewhere, and that he would be giving up the unit. 
      
       
        
       
     8    The appellant went to the unit on 11 November and it was then that he was apprehended by police and arrested. He declined to be interviewed by police. He said in his evidence he had gone to the unit only to pick up his mail. He said he did not have a key to the unit with him on that occasion. The police acknowledge that he was searched but could not remember if a key to the unit had been found on him. So there was no evidence contradicting the appellant’s evidence in that regard. 
      
       
        
       
     9    Then there was evidence adduced from the police witnesses in cross-examination that documents in the names of other persons were found in the unit. The appellant said most of those persons were unknown to him. There was no evidence to the contrary. He said he did not know who was living in the unit as at 11 November. 
      
       
        
       
     10    Having been found guilty by the jury, the appellant was sentenced on 8 March 2000. He has appealed against conviction and sentence.  
      
       
        
       
     11    There are two grounds of appeal against conviction: (1) Her Honour erred in failing to direct the jury the onus was on and remained on the prosecution to negate possession in others. (2) Her Honour erred in the directions to the jury about the failure of the appellant to call his brother and nephew. 
      
       
        
       
     12    It is convenient to deal with the grounds of appeal in reverse order. In the course of her summing-up the trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “The Crown says that it has discharged the onus of establishing that the accused had in his possession the heroin because it has proved beyond reasonable doubt that he was the occupier of those premises at 1/89 Glassop Street, Yagoona.” 
          
         
        
       
     13    Her Honour went on to review the accused’s evidence, including his evidence that he was living elsewhere on 11 November 1998, that his brother and nephew had keys to the premises at the time and that, when he went to the unit on that date, he did not have a key to the unit with him.  
      
       
        
       
     14    Her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “You have also heard evidence that the accused was not the only person who had keys to the unit, his brother and his nephew also had access to the unit. You have not heard from either of these two gentlemen. Where it appears there is a witness who could be expected to have been able to give relevant evidence but has not been called, you are not entitled to speculate about what that person might or might not have said, but where that witness is a person who in the ordinary course you would expect to have been called and no satisfactory explanation for the failure to call this witness has been given, you are entitled to draw the inference that their evidence would not have assisted the accused’s case.” 
          
         
         
        The direction was from  
        Jones v Dunkel 
         (1959) 101 CLR 298. Nothing further of relevance was said in relation to the appellant’s failure to call the brother and nephew. 
         
        
       
     15    The giving of a Jones v Dunkel direction in criminal trials was approved by this court in Buckland (1977) 2 NSWLR 452. The implications in relation to absent witnesses were reviewed by Carruthers AJ in Taufua [1999] NSW CCA 205. 
      
       
        
       
     16    It is to be noted that, in Buckland, Street CJ put an important rider on the use of the direction (at 459): 
      
       
        
         
          
          “In criminal proceedings, however, the making of a comment or the indication of the available inference will be attended by a marked degree of caution, inasmuch as in many cases the absence of a witness either for the Crown or the accused might well be explicable upon grounds not readily capable of proof. If it is suspected that there may be some valid reason for a witness not being called, then, in a criminal trial in particular, a careful appraisal is requisite before commenting on the absence of that witness either in address or in the summing up.” 
          
         
        
       
     17    As occurred in the case of Taufua, the jury received no such assistance in this case. The jury should have been informed, at a minimum, in the present case, that, if the relevant witnesses were in a position to give truthful evidence which would have assisted the appellant, the evidence would necessarily have involved them in having access to premises where a large cache of illicit drugs had been found. They would, accordingly, have been entitled to claim privilege against self-incrimination. The question of a certificate would then have arisen with uncertain outcome. At a minimum, the jury should have been informed of this complication in evaluating whether the appellant should have been expected to call the witnesses. 
      
       
        
       
     18    If the direction was to be given, the jury should also have been warned to consider the possibility that, if called, these witnesses might have chosen to lie rather than either to tell the truth or claim privilege in order to deflect suspicion from themselves; and that this would or might occur, if they were called, may have been known to the appellant. 
      
       
        
       
     19    That is but one feasible explanation for not calling the absent witnesses in a case such as this. There were other possible explanations. There may have been threats if the accused sought to call the witness, or fear of retaliation if he did. If that was the case the accused may have thought it unwise to disclose the explanation for not calling the witnesses. 
      
       
        
       
     20    In such a case as this, if the direction is to be given, the jury would have to be warned, without necessarily being over-specific, that there may be an explanation that has not been disclosed because the accused has reasons for not disclosing it. That is even more so where the absent witnesses are members of the accused’s family. One cannot know what under-currents might have come to bear on a decision not to require relatives to testify in such circumstances. 
      
       
        
       
     21    In Scott [2000] NSW CCA 187, (2000) 112 A Crim R 543, an appeal was allowed in a case where an unqualified Jones v Dunkel direction was given. The witnesses not called by the accused were alleged by the Crown to be accomplices. Greg James J said (at [34]) as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “To suggest it was open to conclude that the evidence of those persons would not have assisted the case of the appellant was such as to divert the jury. To suggest that they might consider that the appellant should have called those witnesses was entirely wrong. On the Crown case, the witnesses were criminally complicit with the appellant. On the defence case, they, if they were heroin suppliers, had manipulated and deceived the appellant. The Crown’s reluctance or inability to call them was not elucidated but the explanation for their absence in the Crown case may have been reasonable. It was not reasonable to suggest that in any way those witnesses should have been called in the appellant’s case. The prospect that the jury might, from their absence, think that their evidence might not have assisted the accused’s case was, at the least, seriously confusing if not inevitable.” 
          
         
         
        His Honour demonstrated an abundance of support for this approach in his review of the authorities from  
        Buckland 
         onwards. 
         
        
       
     22    It may be doubted that it will ever be appropriate, in a criminal trial, for a judge to give a Jones v Dunkel direction against an accused in relation to absent witnesses, where the witnesses are themselves open to suspicion on the Crown case or on the accused’s account of events. If it is to be done in such a case, the direction must be hedged in the appropriate information concerning self-incrimination privilege and appropriate instruction concerning the kind of further considerations which moderate the force of direction in such a case. 
      
       
        
       
     23    At a minimum, the absence of information and assistance to the jury along the lines I have mentioned, rather than the direction standing alone, as it did in the present case, is erroneous. 
      
       
        
       
     24    There is a serious possibility that the unqualified direction may have affected the result. That is a miscarriage of justice. The proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1912 does not therefore apply.  
      
       
        
       
     25    Rule 4 applies, but the error was fundamental to the way the jury was to evaluate the evidence in relation to an important aspect in the case. In its unqualified form the direction was a powerful and unwarranted determination delivered with the force of judicial authority. I would, accordingly, grant leave pursuant to r 4 to rely on this ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       
     26    It is unnecessary for me to decide the first ground of appeal in view of what I have said in relation to the second ground. 
      
       
        
       
     27    My conclusion is as follows. I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and order a new trial. 
      
       
        
       
     28    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree. 
      
       
        
       
     29    CARRUTHERS AJ: I also agree.

        REGINA v Fatih Rustu BOZKUS 
         
         
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    SPIGELMAN CJ: On 11 October 1999, the Appellant was indicted before his Honour Judge Bellear at Parramatta District court on five counts of sexual assault, alleging that he had sexual intercourse with Tania Wallace without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting thereto. There was a verdict by direction on one count. He was convicted on the other four counts. 
      
       
     2    The Crown case was that the victim was a sex worker who had agreed to have sexual intercourse for reward with the Appellant and this occurred. Thereafter, however, the Crown case alleged that he used force to engage in a number of other acts of sexual intercourse, without her consent. 
      
       
     3    The Appellant admitted that he did have sexual intercourse with the victim. His case was that the acts were consensual and that he had not sexually assaulted her. Accordingly, the primary issue in the case was consent. 
      
       
     4    The Complainant gave evidence with respect to each of the four counts. It was her failure to give evidence with respect to a fifth count that led to a verdict by direction in that respect. The Appellant did not give evidence. 
      
       
     5    In submissions on behalf of the Appellant made to this Court, it was conceded that Judge Bellear’s summing up was comprehensive and addressed all relevant issues of law and fact. The sole ground of appeal was based on his Honour’s directions to the jury with respect to the failure by the Appellant to give evidence.  
      
       
     6    His Honour’s directions were in the form customarily made in this State, pursuant to the authority of Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217 and R v OGD (1997) 45 NSWLR 744. His Honour’s directions were in accordance with the authorities binding on him at the time he made the directions. Subsequent to the trial in this matter, the High Court gave judgment in the case of RPS v The Queen (2000) 199 CLR 620.  
      
       
     7    RPS did not overrule Weissensteiner. This Court is bound by both judgments. There are difficulties in reconciling these judgments as this Court has noted in R v Fowler (2000) NSWCCA 142 and R v Hannes (2000) NSWCCA 503. The High Court has heard argument in two cases which raise the difficulties of reconciling Weissensteiner and RPS. The decisions in those cases have not been handed down as at the date of this appeal. 
      
       
     8    The relevant direction by Bellear DCJ was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The next direction I give you ladies and gentlemen relates to the accused not giving evidence. The accused has not given evidence and there are a number of important directions which I must give you in relation to that fact. An accused may always give evidence in his trial but he is under no obligation to do so. As I have already pointed out the Crown bears the onus of satisfying you beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty of the offences with which he has been charged. 
         
        
        
         
         The accused bears no onus. He is presumed to be innocent until you have been satisfied by the Crown that he is guilty. The accused is entitled to elect to say nothing and to make the Crown prove his guilt. 
         
        
        
         
         You will recall the caution administered by the police officers when questioning the accused following his arrest. They informed the accused that he was not obliged to answer their questions. That is the law. A person who is questioned by the police has the right to remain silent. He retains that right to remain silent even when he is on trial. That is the right which the accused has exercised here. 
         
        
        
         
         Because the accused has merely exercised the right which belongs to every citizen, you must not conclude that he has elected not to give evidence because he is guilty of the offences charged against him. Such a conclusion from the exercise by the accused of that right to remain silent would be completely wrong. The silence must not be viewed by you as an admission of guilt on his part. 
         
        
        
         
         There are many reasons why any accused person may not want to give evidence. He may fear that he will be confused by cross-examination, or he may simply be content to rely upon the witnesses which exist in the Crown case. There are, no doubt, other valid reasons. You must not speculate why the accused has not given evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         In the present case, however, you may, when judging the value or weight of the evidence which has been put forward by the Crown as establishing its case against the accused, take into account the accused’s election not to deny or contradict the matters about which he could have given direct evidence from his personal knowledge. 
         
        
        
         
         You may think that it is only common sense that in a situation where a Crown witness and the accused are directly involved in a particular incident so that they are two persons best able to give evidence of what happened in that incident and where the evidence of the Crown witnesses left undenied or uncontradicted by the accused, any doubts which may otherwise have been cast upon the evidence of the Crown witness may more readily be discounted and the evidence of the Crown witness may more readily be accepted as the truth. This is the approach which you may take in relation to the evidence of Ms Wallace with respect to these events or incidents.” 
         
        
       
     9    The basis of the Crown case was the evidence of the complainant. There was some material, particularly of complaint and medical examination, which corroborated her testimony in some respects. Nevertheless, her evidence was central to the issue posed for consideration as the primary issue for this trial, namely the issue of consent.  
      
       
     10    In this circumstance, his Honour’s direction - entirely exemplary on the state of the law prior to RPS - invited the jury to take the failure of the Appellant to give evidence into account on this central issue in the trial. To repeat the critical words in the direction: 
      
       
        
         
         “…any doubts which may otherwise have been cast upon the evidence of the Crown witness may more readily be discounted in the evidence of the Crown witness and may more readily be accepted as the truth”. 
         
        
       
     11    The majority joint judgment in RPS acknowledged that there are circumstances in which a direction of this character is appropriate in a criminal trial. However, the circumstances are to be more narrowly confined than was the practice in this State prior to RPS. 
      
       
     12    In a joint judgment, Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said at [27]: 
      
       
        
         
         “… It will seldom, if ever, be reasonable to conclude that an accused in a criminal trial would be expected to give evidence. The most that can be said in criminal matters is that there are some cases in which evidence (or an explanation) contradicting and apparently damming inference be drawn from proven facts would come only from the accused. In the absence of such evidence or explanation the jury may more readily draw the conclusion the prosecution seeks.” 
         
        
       
     13    The decision in Weissensteiner had been applied by this Court in R v OGD supra. In RPS at [30] the High Court doubted that OGD stood for a “general proposition” that a direction should be given “in cases like the present”, which encompasses a sexual assault case in which the accused does not respond to the complainant’s evidence. The joint judgment in RPS expressly rejected any such “general proposition”, referring, with approval, to Gleeson CJ’s emphasis in OGD at [752], on the need for caution in giving such directions. The factual situation in OGD, in which there was a significant difference between one charge and ten other charges, does not exist on the facts of this case. There is no basis for any differentiation amongst the four separate charges in this case in any relevant respect. 
      
       
     14    The situation in the present case is not like that in Weissensteiner where there was evidence that could come only from the accused.  
      
       
     15    The substantive issue in this trial was, as I have said, consent. The complainant gave evidence of absence of consent. The Appellant’s evidence in chief, if he had given any evidence, would no doubt have been directed to contradicting the complainant’s evidence of absence of consent, by giving, no doubt, positive evidence of consent. 
      
       
     16    However, this is not an exceptional case of the character to which the High Court was referring in RPS. It is not in the same category of case as Weissensteiner where evidence could only come from an accused. 
      
       
     17    In accordance with the approach of the High Court in RPS, there was no sufficient basis for a direction to the jury to the effect that the absence of evidence by the Appellant entitled the jury to reason in a manner which reinforced the evidence of the complainant. 
      
       
     18    The Crown in its written submissions made reference to the proviso. This is not an appropriate case for the application of the proviso. As the Crown indicated there was other evidence arising from the physical examination of the complainant which tended to support the absence of consent. Nevertheless, the manner in which the jury could treat the evidence by the complainant given in Court goes to the heart of the critical issue in the trial. It is not a case in which the proviso should be applied. 
      
       
     19    In my opinion the appeal should be allowed and there should be an order for a new trial. 
      
       
     20    SPERLING J: I agree. 
      
       
     21    CARRUTHERS AJ: I also agree.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
       
     1    SPIGELMAN CJ: I invite Carruthers AJ to deliver the first judgment. 
      
       
     2    CARRUTHERS AJ: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Hosking QC at the District Court Lismore on 3 November 2000 upon the respondent, Kevin Anthony Barton. 
      
       
     3    The respondent had earlier pleaded guilty to two charges on separate indictments. The first charge was that on 5 September 1999 at Ruthven in this State, the respondent did use a weapon, that is to say, a Mitsubishi motor vehicle registered number MNV-693, with intent to prevent his lawful apprehension contrary to s 33B(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (to which I shall hereinafter refer as ""the Act""). This offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twelve years. 
      
       
     4    The second charge was that the respondent, between 27 and 28 August 1999 at Broadwater, did break and enter the Broadwater Bowling Club and steal from that club various items contrary to s 112(1) of the Act. This offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for fourteen years. 
      
       
     5    His Honour was asked to take into account twenty-seven charges on a Form 1. Those charges were:  
      
       
        
         
         Goods in custody (2 charges) s 527C  
         Crimes Act 
          1900. Maximum: 6 months imprisonment or fine of 5 penalty units.  
         
        
        
         
         Receiving stolen property (2 charges) s 188  
         Crimes Act 
          1900. 
          
         maximum: 10 years imprisonment. 
         
        
        
         
         Assault (4 charges) s 61  
         Crimes Act 
          1900. 
          
         Maximum: 2 years imprisonment. 
         
        
        
         
         Assault occasioning actual bodily harm (3 charges) s 59  
         Crimes Act 
          1900. 
          
         Maximum: 5 years imprisonment. 
         
        
        
         
         Larceny (3 charges) s 117

     6    Taking into account the twenty-seven charges on the Form 1, his Honour sentenced the respondent on the first charge to imprisonment for four years to commence on 5 September 1999, (the date on which he was taken into custody), and to expire on 4 September 2003. His Honour fixed a non-parole period of two years to commence on 5 September 1999 and to expire on 4 September 2001, his Honour having determined that there were special circumstances. 
      
       
     7    With regard to the second charge, his Honour sentenced the respondent to a fixed term of imprisonment for two years to commence on 5 September 1999 and to expire on 4 September 2001. Thus, the respondent was required to serve the sentences concurrently. 
      
       
     8    Before I turn to the relevant facts, the respondent's background should be briefly noted. He was born on 19 January 1967 in the Lismore area. Mr Allan Andreasen, a Consulting Clinical Psychologist, recorded in a report dated 15 August 2000 that testing of the respondent's intellectual functioning and social comprehension demonstrated that the respondent suffers from quite marked intellectual limitations. The respondent has an appalling prior criminal record, starting in September 1982 when he was fifteen years of age. Prior to the commission of the subject offences he was continually before the Tamworth Local Court or the Lismore Local Court on a variety of serious offences and others less serious. 
      
       
     9    On 27 May 1996 he was convicted before the Lismore District Court on a charge of harbouring a felon, for which he was sentenced to a minimum term of twelve months. 
      
       
     10    After he had served this sentence he went to Queensland. There he committed various offences and was dealt with by the Toowoomba Circuit Court on 9 November 1998 on a number of serious offences and was sentenced to a variety of custodial sentences, with a probation order for three years. Having served those sentences, the respondent returned to New South Wales and, in particular, to the Tamworth/Lismore area. Thereupon he resumed his criminal career. 
      
       
     11    One can see by reference to the Form 1, that he committed the offence of goods in custody between 1 and 2 March 1999 and, thereafter, a number of offences in the period up to and including September 1999. Thus it was that in September 1999 the local police were seeking to locate the respondent. At about 6am on Sunday 5 September 1999, police received information that the respondent was at an address in Woodburn. Woodburn police attended that address and saw the respondent leaving those premises in a Mitsubishi utility. The police followed that vehicle from Woodburn to Coraki. The responded was observed to stop the vehicle to make a telephone call.  
      
       
     12    When he resumed driving, police continued to follow him along the Lismore/Coraki Road towards Lismore. At a point near Pelican Creek Road at Ruthven, the respondent turned off the road into a driveway to the east. He then turned around and started to drive his vehicle back along the Lismore/Coraki Road towards Coraki. At that time there was a marked police vehicle driving towards Lismore and the police occupants attempted to stop the respondent in the Mitsubishi utility by activating their blue/red strobe light.  
      
       
     13    This police vehicle was obviously clearly visible to the respondent who was proceeding in the opposite direction. However, instead of stopping his vehicle or attempting to avoid the police vehicle, the respondent drove his utility directly towards the police vehicle. This caused the police vehicle to brake heavily and move so that it straddled the centre line. At that stage the Mitsubishi was still about eighty metres distant. It was still open to the respondent to brake and stop or swerve off the road on to the grass verge in an attempt to continue his southward path. However, the respondent continued to drive the utility towards the police vehicle making no attempt to deviate, thus causing the utility to collide with the front of the police vehicle which, at that stage, was being driven at about thirty to forty kilometres an hour and braking heavily. 
      
       
     14    At the point of impact the respondent's vehicle was estimated to be travelling at about eighty kilometres per hour.  
      
       
     15    The utility crashed into the front of the police vehicle with such velocity that the front of the police vehicle was totally destroyed. Somewhat remarkably, the respondent was not injured as a result of the collision. At the most he appears to have displayed some temporary lack of consciousness.  
      
       
     16    Again, somewhat remarkably, neither of the two occupants of the police car were seriously injured. However, one of them sustained a whiplash injury which required his attendance at the Lismore Base Hospital and with some absence from work and continuing physiotherapy. 
      
       
     17    I turn then to the facts of the break, enter and steal charge. Between 27 and 28 August 1999, the respondent and two other persons entered the Broadwater Bowling Club through a hole in the front wall of the club. They smashed the push-button pad of the club's alarm system and opened the front door. They then removed eighteen bottles of spirits, ransacked the bar area, smashed an alarm on a cigarette dispenser and removed money from it. They also ransacked the office and stole a large free-standing Ajax safe containing $3860 cash, keys to the club and to the poker machines. Later that morning the respondent and a co-offender drove in the respondent's station wagon to a property owned by a third man. The safe was eventually opened by the use of power tools and grinders and the respondent was seen leaving the property holding a calico bag which contained the stolen money and keys. 
      
       
     18    Having been arrested on 5 September 1999, following the commission of the s 33B offence, the respondent remained in custody until sentenced by Judge Hosking. 
      
       
     19    His Honour had before him a summary of the agreed facts in relation to each of the offences listed in the Form 1. As the Crown has pointed out, these facts show a multitude of serious offences committed over a relatively short period of time, involving violence in many cases and numerous instances of stealing and associated offences, as well as several firearm offences. 
      
       
     20    With respect to an argument in the careful and forceful address on behalf of the respondent by Ms Kluss, it is important to note that of the twenty-seven charges on the Form 1, specifically one assault occasioning actual bodily harm under s 59 of the Act was the subject of a committal for trial in the District Court, with no election by the Crown to proceed in the Local Court. In respect of two assaults under the same section, there were committals to the District Court, but in both cases the Crown elected to proceed in the Local Court. There was one break, enter and steal charge under s 112 of the Act which was the subject of committal to the District Court with no election by the Crown to proceed in the Local Court, and there was one threaten injury with intent to prevent lawful apprehension under s 33B(b) of the Act in which there was a committal to the District Court, with no election by the Crown to proceed in the Local Court.  
      
       
     21    Thus, in the absence of pleas of guilty, there were three matters which would have been heard in the District Court and a number of serious matters which would have been heard in the Local Court. 
      
       
     22    In their written submissions, the Crown focused on seven of the offences in the Form 1 which acutely demonstrated how prone the respondent is to violent behaviour. Brief details of these offences should be noted. 
      
       
     23    With regard to charge 3, the facts are that on 14 March 1999 at Lismore, the respondent attended the home of his estranged wife and during an argument placed his hand around her throat. Later he kicked her. Later again, he produced a pocket knife and threatened that he would cut her throat should she try to leave. His violence against his wife, and those associated with her, flared up again in 1999 when he assaulted her by punching her in the face (charge 12). The respondent then went to her home and, after refusing to leave, threatened to kill her if she called the police (charge 14). About that time he also struck a male friend of hers on the back of his head, causing actual bodily harm (charge 13).  
      
       
     24    With regard to charge 11 the facts are that on 23 July 1999 the respondent held a machete towards his then ex-girlfriend. Charge 18 concerned a threat to kill his ex-girlfriend on 23 August 1999 if she did not return keys to him within forty-eight hours.  
      
       
     25    Charge 19 relates to a second break, enter and steal on the Broadwater Bowling Club (two days after the offence on the indictment) in which the respondent opened the bar safe and stole $5043. 
      
       
     26    It is convenient to note at this stage certain further aspects of the report by Mr Andreasen. 
      
       
     27    Mr Andreasen found that on a test of intellectual capacity in terms of verbal reasoning, verbal concept formation and the capacity for logical and abstract thinking, the respondent scored in the intellectually handicapped range of less than percentile 1, that is to say, he did worse than more than 99 per cent of his age peers. He scored slightly higher in the borderline intellectually handicapped range with percentile 2 on a test of comprehension of social realities, understanding of causal effect relationships, commonsense and the capacity for the evaluation and use of past experience. There were, however, no indications of psychosis or thought disorder. There was little anxiety and no indication of distress or depression. 
      
       
     28    Mr Andreasen recorded the following conclusions and implications for sentencing: 
      
       
        
         
         ""This is a man with very limited intellectual capacity who is poorly socialised and has considerable and widespread immaturity and distortion of personality development. His background is one of considerable rural isolation and poverty. He had an alcoholic and violent father and he both witnessed and received considerable violent treatment in his childhood. This man in his adult life, particularly whilst intoxicated with alcohol, repeats his father's pattern of solving his difficulties and frustrations through violence. He is impulsive and he is not given to considering the problematic outcomes of his impulsive acts and violent behaviour. 
         
        
        
         
         The rehabilitation for this man will be difficult because of his intellectual limitations and because he tends to see other people (particularly his wife Michelle) as being the cause of his problems and other people again (his new girlfriend Lauren) as being the solution to his problems. He has been unable to accept participation in an anger management course in custody and, given his intellectual limitations, it is not hopeful that any such courses would be acceptable to him. This man claims that he does not drink often but when he does he drinks to get drunk and is then prone to reactive violence and this is a most difficult pattern of behaviour to change. I should recommend that there be a long period of supervision with attendance at anger management and alcohol counselling despite the limited prognosis after he has finished his custodial sentencing. His new relationship appears to be the one hopeful factor in his life.” 
         
        
       
     29    In sentencing the respondent, Judge Hosking stated that he proposed to discount the sentence that the respondent would otherwise have received because of the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty, notwithstanding the apparent strength of the Crown case. His Honour took into account, to a limited degree, expressions of remorse on the respondent's part. 
      
       
     30    His Honour accepted that general deterrence was of lesser significance in a case where the offender has serious intellectual limitations: see Letteri (CCA, 18 March 1992 unreported). Nevertheless, his Honour took the view that the sentence should reflect some degree of general deterrence.  
      
       
     31    His Honour concluded there were special circumstances because the respondent had, for a long time, been unable to restrain himself from committing serious criminal offences and needed extended supervision and guidance upon his release. Such guidance was necessary in an attempt to try and stop the root cause of his continuing offending in terms of anger management, alcohol counselling and such other programs as may be suitable for him. 
      
       
     32    His Honour acknowledged, with regard to the twenty-seven matters on the Form 1, that the sentence with regard to the s 33B(a) matter required that there be some inbuilt consideration of the criminality involved in those twenty-seven matters in addition to the criminality in the s 33B offence itself. 
      
       
     33    Turning to the s 33B(a) matter, this Court has stressed in numerous authorities that the use of weapons to prevent lawful apprehension, where the lives and safety of police officers discharging their duty are put in danger, is to be regarded as an extremely serious matter by the criminal law for a reason so obvious it does not need to be stated. Hamilton (1993) 66 A Crim R 575 is authority for that proposition. It will be recalled that at p 581, Gleeson CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""In that regard I should make it clear that offences against s 33B which make it unlawful to use an offensive weapon or instrument with intent to prevent lawful apprehension are regarded by the Court extremely seriously. It is incumbent upon the Court in dealing with offences of this nature to show an appropriate measure of support for police officers who undertake a difficult, dangerous and usually thankless task."" 
         
        
       
     34    Reference should also be made to Perez (CCA, unreported, 11 December 1991) in which Kirby P made remarks to a similar effect.  
      
       
     35    It is also important to recall that in Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371-372 Hunt CJ at CL emphasised that when dealing with matters on a Form 1 an otherwise appropriate sentence for the foundation offence should not be only slightly increased when the offences to be taken into account in the Form 1 are serious in their own right.  
      
       
     36    The Crown in the instant case argues that his Honour appears to have had insufficient regard to this statement of principle in Morgan. It was submitted his Honour gave far too much weight to the respondent's prospect's of rehabilitation, such as they were. These errors, it was argued, led to a manifestly inadequate overall sentence and a manifestly inadequate non-parole period.  
      
       
     37    It was further submitted that his Honour appears to have ignored the respondent's appalling record when he considered the respondent's prospects of rehabilitation. Further, his Honour appears to have ignored the respondent's many failed attempts at rehabilitation, as demonstrated by numerous breaches of recognisances and other similar orders recorded on his criminal record. Further, his Honour apparently overlooked that the commission of the subject offences, was in violation of the probation granted in respect of the Queensland offences. In accepting, of course, that his Honour could not revoke the probation order made outside the jurisdiction, nevertheless Andrew Skillan Jones (CCA, unreported 30 June 1994) is authority for the proposition that the breach is a matter which should have been taken into account.  
      
       
     38    Both in the submissions of the Crown and Ms Kluss on behalf of the respondent, the history of these proceedings was traced. The Crown relies upon such history in support of the contention that his Honour made excessive allowances for pleas of guilty. Ms Kluss relies upon the history, however, in support of her argument that his Honour in fact recognised that the respondent had pleaded guilty to the two indictable matters at the earliest possible time. It is not necessary for this Court, in my view, to trace and record the history of the matters for present purposes, albeit both submissions require consideration.  
      
       
     39    The Crown submitted that, in all the circumstances, this is one of those cases where the sentencing regime was so inadequate as to indicate error on the part of the Judge to such an extent that the Crown is entitled to have this Court intervene. 
      
       
     40    Counsel for the respondent has relied upon the well-established line of authority to the effect that Crown appeals should be rare and subject to very considerable restraints.  
      
       
     41    For a number of reasons, which are all recorded in the written submissions, the respondent submitted that the sentences were not manifestly inadequate and his Honour was not in error in his finding of special circumstances. 
      
       
     42    One particular matter which requires attention is that during the course of argument before his Honour, reference was made to the fact that the respondent had given assistance to the authorities. During the course of his remarks on sentence his Honour did not, however, make specific reference to that fact. I find it difficult to conclude, nevertheless, that it was overlooked by his Honour. In any event, this Court now has the benefit of an affidavit by a police officer which details specifically the significant assistance which the respondent has rendered to the authorities. This is important, Ms Kluss stresses, because it indicates, in a dramatic way, a change of attitude on the part of the respondent which augers well for his rehabilitation. It is a specific matter, she submits, which justifies his Honour's finding of special circumstances. 
      
       
     43    Having given due consideration to the competing arguments I am persuaded that in the circumstances of this case his Honour has, giving full weight to the relevant principles associated with Crown appeals, imposed sentences which were outside the sentencing discretion available to him. With respect to his Honour, the sentences failed to give due consideration, in particular, to the seriousness of the two indictable matters and the serious nature of so many of the matters on the Form 1. In my view, therefore, it is necessary for this Court to intervene and re-sentence the Respondent. It is appropriate that the sentences be served concurrently. The serious nature of the break, enter and steal matter necessarily requires that the fixed term for that sentence be increased.  
      
       
     44    There are two factors that are relevant to the re-sentencing in relation to the s 33B matter. The first is the serious nature of the offence itself, which could well have resulted in a loss of life or serious injury, to the police officers. Further, there is the serious nature of many of the Form 1 matters, to which, if I may respectfully say so, his Honour did not give sufficient weight. 
      
       
     45    I would propose that the appeal be allowed, and that the sentences imposed by his Honour be set aside. In lieu thereof I would propose, with regard to the break, enter and steal matter, that there be a sentence of a fixed term of three years imprisonment, to commence on 5 September 1999 and to expire on 4 September 2002. This sentence would, in my view, take into account the plea of guilty, the assistance rendered to the authorities, and the principle of double jeopardy. 
      
       
     46    In relation to the s 33B(a) matter and the Form 1 matters, I would have fixed an overall term of seven years but, taking into account the plea of guilty, I would reduce that to six years. Thus in relation to the s 33B(a) matter and the Form 1 matters I would propose the respondent be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years to date from 5 September 1999 and to expire on 4 September 2005. I would propose a non-parole period of three years, commencing on 5 September 1999 and concluding on 4 September 2002. This sentence would, in my view also take into account the assistance rendered to the authorities and the principle of double jeopardy. 
      
       
     47    I would merely conclude by saying that the special circumstances in my view are the extraordinary limited intellectual capacity of the respondent, his prior history and the need for a longer period of supervision upon his release. He is eligible to apply for release on parole on 4 September 2002. 
      
       
     48    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree for the reasons Carruthers AJ has given that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. I also agree with the order his Honour proposes for the reasons his Honour has given. I would however, wish to state some additional reasons with respect to the limited weight Hosking DCJ appears to have given to the twenty-seven offences listed on the Form 1. 
      
       
     49    His Honour outlined the list of offences and gave some detail of their scope and variety. Over a course of many months during 1999 the Respondent committed a series of criminal offences involving violence to persons and appropriation of property of others of a character which caused considerable anxiety to the victims and was also significantly detrimental to the peace of the community as a whole. 
      
       
     50    The list of matters included assaults, possession of stolen vehicles, possession of weapons, theft and some acts of violence occasioning actual bodily harm. They were taken into account on the Form 1 but, in my opinion, the ultimate result of the sentencing exercise indicated that together with the seriousness of the s33B offence itself, they were not given appropriate weight. 
      
       
     51    A submission was made to the effect that the Court should give consideration to the fact that many, albeit not all, of the matters on the Form 1 would be dealt with in the Local Court and subject to the jurisdictional limits of that Court. As Carruthers AJ has indicated, there were some matters on the Form 1 for which there had been no consent to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Local Court which would make them subject to the jurisdictional limits of that Court. Those limits are now contained in s58 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I note that by force of s58(3) the section does not apply if the old sentence was imposed by a court other than a Local Court. 
      
       
     52    The Local Court may not impose a sentence to extend beyond three years save in a case in which there is a sentence imposed by a court other than a Local Court. In that regard the offences presently before this Court, and those matters on the Form 1 in which the consent to the exercise of discretion by the Local Court had not been forthcoming, mean that a Local Court could have sentenced for a period of an additional period of three years for the range of offences which were within its jurisdiction. 
      
       
     53    It must be remembered that the provisions of s58 are a jurisdictional maximum. They are not a maximum penalty in any sense. This was recently confirmed in R v Doan [2000] NSWCCA 317. In that case the Court set out the authorities, especially at paras 38-41, which indicate that it was relevant to take into consideration the fact that offences were of a character which could be with a Local Court and subject to its jurisdictional limits. For those same reasons it is relevant to consider this restraint in this case. However, by reason of the fact that there remain offences both before this Court and on the Form 1 that have and would otherwise proceed by way of presentation of an indictment, this consideration is of limited significance in the present case. 
      
       
     54    The provisions for “taking” other offences “into account” are now found in Part 3 Division 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in a form which has existed for some years. Previously they were found in s21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The position has not changed from that which Fox J indicated in Murrell v The Queen (1985) 4 FCR 168 at 175. His Honour, in a judgment with which Bowen CJ and Blackburn J agreed in this respect, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “No real guidance is offered by the authorities as to the effect on sentence which offences to be taken into account should have. It is clear that one is only sentencing for the offence for which there has been a conviction, on plea, or verdict, of guilty (448 (1) and (7) and see  
         R v Hobson 
          (1942) 29 CrAppR 30). The fact that the maximum sentence is that provided for the particular offence (see subs (4)) is evidence of this. The other matters are to be “taken into account”.” 
         
        
       
     55    By reason of a reference in that judgment, it was submitted subsequently in this Court that the matters taken into account upon a schedule should require that “there be little addition to penalty”. That submission was made and rejected in R v Vougdis (1989) 41 ACrimR 125 at 128-129. That position was affirmed in this Court in the case to which Carruthers AJ has referred, R v Morgan (1993) 70 ACrimR 368 at 371-372. 
      
       
     56    The structure of the legislative scheme in Part 3 Division 3 makes provision for a prosecutor to file a list of additional charges (s32), and authorises the Court to take further offences into account (s33). Those offences, however, must bear the following characteristics: first, that the offender admits guilt to the further offences (subparagraph 33(2)(a)(i)); second, that the offender indicates to the Court that he or she wishes that those further offences be taken into account (subparagraph 33(2)(a)(ii)); finally, that the Court does consider it appropriate to so take these matters into account (paragraph 33(2)(b)). 
      
       
     57    By subs 33(3) the fact that the Court is still sentencing for the particular offence is confirmed by the imposition of a restriction on the ability of the Court to sentence by reference to the Form 1 offences, in an express provision that the sentence must not exceed the maximum penalty for the principal offence. 
      
       
     58    The Court is empowered to make ancillary orders of a character such as restitution, compensation, costs, forfeiture and loss of licences or privileges (s34). However, subs 34(1) makes it plain that the Court may not impose a separate penalty for the offences taken into account on the Form 1. 
      
       
     59    The position is also indicated by subs 35(4) which states that the fact that an offence is taken into account for purposes of sentencing does not have the consequence that it is to be regarded, for any other purpose, as an offence for which the offender has been convicted. 
      
       
     60    These provisions are a specific statutory regime to which the Court must give effect. Nevertheless, it does so in a context in which the basic principle of the common law is that no-one should be punished for an offence for which he or she has not been convicted (The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 at 389; The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [18]). 
      
       
     61    This Court has recently considered the position of representative counts and their compatibility with this principle. By representative counts I am referring to the presentation of an indictment covering a range of criminal conduct with reference being made to the fact that some of the charges represent a number of other offences. In that context there is a very real issue as to whether or not the uncharged offences are matters of aggravation or whether or not they are simply taken into account as the absence of matters of mitigation. (See R v JCW (2000) 112 ACrimR 466. 
      
       
     62    In the present context it is clear that the provisions of the statutory regime to which I have referred must have the effect of resulting in a longer sentence or greater penalty than would have been the case if one was dealing only with what is referred to as the primary offence. This has frequently been acknowledged in the authorities (R v Bachelor (1952) 36 CAR 64 at 67-68; R v White (1981) 28 SASR 9 at 12-14; and R v J (1992) 59 SASR 145 at 152). 
      
       
     63    It would not be correct to say that when one takes into account matters on the Form 1 that the matters of which guilt has been admitted are in the same position as previous convictions. The reason for that, as Wells J emphasised in White (supra) p12, is that these matters, unlike previous convictions, have not been the subject of any punishment. 
      
       
     64    The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express position in subs 33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another. 
      
       
     65    In the present circumstances, for the reasons given by Carruthers AJ, I agree with the sentences his Honour proposes.66    SPERLING J: I also agree for the reasons stated by the Chief Justice and Carruthers AJ.67    SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as pronounced by Carruthers AJ.

      REGINA v ANDREA ROCCO 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
     1   MEAGHER JA: The appellant, Mr Andrea Rocco, was found guilty by a jury on 30 March 2000 of a charge under s 233B (1) (d) of the Customs Act (1901) in that he was knowingly concerned in the importation into this country of a commercial quantity of MDMA or ecstasy. The maximum sentence for such an offence is life imprisonment. The commercial quantity applicable to MDMA is 0.5 kilograms. The gross weight of the tablets involved was 17.224 kilograms (approximately 70,135 tablets). The net weight was calculated to be 4.027 kilograms. 
     2   On 14 April 2000 the appellant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Shillington QC to thirteen years imprisonment with a non-parole period of nine years, both to date from 21 October 1998. An order was also made under the Proceeds of Crime Act (1987) that $US3,100 in his possession was an asset to be forfeited. 
     3   The appellant arrived in Australia on 13 October 1998. On 15 October 1998 he and one Mordechai Cohen visited Control Customs at Mascot, a suburb of Sydney, and showed them paperwork in respect of a shipment of water pumps which were consigned from France to a firm at Mona Vale. The crates containing two boxes, each of which had a water pump, arrived on 18 October and were loaded at the Ansett Bond Store. 
     4   On 17 October the appellant went to a storage unit at Hornsby. On 19 October he and Mordechai Cohen attended the Thrifty Car Rental office at Hornsby and hired a Mitsubishi van in the appellant’s name.  
     5   On 20 October the crate was inspected by customs officers, who located inside the water pumps 17.2224 kilograms of MDMA tablets. They were replaced with substitute tablets in a small controlled delivery sample. On 21 October the crates containing the two boxes of pumps were taken from Ansett to Control Customs. The appellant went there and loaded the crates onto the Thrifty van. 
     6   At about 11.15 am the appellant drove the rented van to the storage unit at Hornsby, followed by Mr Mordechai Cohen in his Tarago and, unbeknownst to both of them, the police. They then unloaded the crate and left it at Hornsby. They then travelled to Mona Vale in the Tarago, having returned the Thrifty van. 
     7   They returned to Hornsby at 2.09 pm, in the meantime having engaged in a route which I cannot understand through suburbs which I have never heard of. At 2.09 they loaded the two pumps into the hired van and continued in the Tarago, then continued their wandering until eventually, at St. Ives, this vehicle was stopped by the police. There, evidence indicative of the imported goods was discovered. 
     8   This was a case in which the appellant, Mr Rocco, gave evidence. He is South African. In that country he operated a clothing and jewellery box importing business. He was a friend for a while of a man named Margolit, with whom he subsequently had a dispute, and he then resumed his friendship with that man in 1997, by which time Mr Margolit had AIDS. He, Mr Rocco, knew that Mr Margolit had previously travelled to the united States and to Australia in 1998 with a friend called Steinway. Mr Rocco went into partnership in South Africa with a man called Barbaglia. 
     9   In June/July 1998 Mr Margolit introduced Mr Rocco to Mr Mordechai Cohen. In September 1998 Mr Margolit, being too ill to do so himself, asked the appellant to take his place in assisting Mr Cohen to smuggle diamonds into Australia. In doing so he was to receive the sum of $8,000. 
     10   He then went to Amsterdam, where Mr Cohen was temporarily situate and he gave Mr Cohen $75,000. Both the appellant and Mr Cohen then returned to Sydney separately and the rest is history, the appellant believing, according to him, that the pumps in question contained diamonds.  
     11   In cross-examination Mr Rocco said that in the travelling between Mascot and Hornsby Mr Cohen was always visible throughout the whole proceedings. He also seemed to agree that his role as assistant to Mr Cohen could have been performed by a courier company. He also toyed with assenting to the proposition that there was no need for him to come to Australia at all. 
     12   In these circumstances, the court has to deal with three grounds of appeal. 
     13   The first ground of appeal emerges from a question which was asked by the jury. The question asked by the jury was put this way: 
      
       
        
        “Please explain why the jury have not heard evidence from Cohen, then Margolit, Steinway, Barbaglia or persons associated with Group Hefna to substantiate Rocco’s testimony of no knowledge of MDMA in the pumps?” 
        
       
     14   Whilst the question itself looked at in isolation has a certain internal logic, the fact is, as everyone agrees, Mr Rocco was under no obligation to substantiate his story at all. He was under no obligation to call any of those gentlemen or anybody else. He had given his story and it was a question for the jury whether they believed it or not. In the process of disbelieving it they could not as a matter of law have placed any reliance on the fact that none of those gentlemen had given evidence. 
     15   Indeed, his Honour had in effect directed them to this extent, not once, not twice, but about eight times, and told them that the Crown had the onus of proof, which was a heavy onus and involved proof beyond reasonable doubt. He also, at least inferentially, told them that that being so there was no obligation on Mr Rocco either to give evidence or to call anyone else to give evidence. 
     16   In answer to the question which the jury transmitted to his Honour, his Honour said in effect he would not deal with it, but they must not speculate. They would be speculating if they tried to work out the reasons for not calling these people and he also told them they were obliged to deal with the case on the evidence as it stood. 
     17   All those directions were correct. There was no objection to the original directions his Honour gave and what his Honour was doing when he received the note was simply saying to them in effect, “Go back and make your decision in accordance with the directions I have already given you.”18   In those circumstances, and viewed in that light, I cannot see that the ground has any chance of success.  
     19   The second ground was it was not put sufficiently clearly to the jury that the story espoused by the accused, the story of imported diamonds, was of such a kind that it must have raised a reasonable doubt when the jury was considering the guilt or otherwise of Mr Rocco on the charge of importing ecstasy. 
     20   In my view, this ground must fail. The plain fact of the matter is that the Crown put forward evidence which made a strong circumstantial case for the involvement of Mr Rocco in the importation of the ecstasy. In answer to that, Mr Rocco put forward a very curious and not inherently credible story about how his involvement arose. It was the jury’s province to agree or disagree with Mr Rocco’s story. 
     21   Plainly they rejected it. Plainly they were entitled to and I should have thought on the evidence they were almost bound to. However, once they had rejected it, it cannot be said that the jury misdirected itself in accepting the Crown case, circumstantial though it may be.22   Brennan J said in Chamberlain v R (1984) 153 CLR 521 at 606-7: 
      
       
        
        “Whether the jury has too readily rejected innocent inferences is not demonstrable in a case where a jury, impartially applying its critical judgment of men and affairs, could have drawn the guilty inference.” 
        
       
     23   The third ground of appeal relates to sentence. In this regard Mr Cohen, who was tried, was sentenced by his Honour Judge Howie to ten years imprisonment with a six year non-parole period. Judge Shillington sentenced Mr Rocco to thirteen years imprisonment with a nine year non-parole period.24   It has been put to us by Mr Drake in a very able argument that there is a significant disparity between the two sentences.  
     25   With respect, there does not seem to me to be a disparity of sufficient importance to entitle this Court to intervene. The great difference between the two criminals was that in Mr Cohen’s case there was a plea of guilty, and the fact there was a plea of guilty must account for a significant part of the disparity. The balance of the disparity is accounted for by differing views between the two judges as to the comparative fault of the two parties. It is simply not true that his Honour Judge Shillington disregarded any doctrine of parity, or disregarded any High Court decision on that point. He obviously gave the most patient attention to everything that could be said or thought of in this regard.26   In my opinion, the application should be dismissed both as to sentence and as to conviction. 
     27   HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed and, subject to one matter, with the reasons advanced. 
     28   In relation to the second ground I would prefer to express the matter, albeit shortly, in my own words. 
     29   The appellant’s activities related to what was in fact ecstasy. That fact and the extent of his activities clearly justified the inference that he knew that it was ecstasy he was dealing with. The fact that he provided an alternate explanation, which the jury were fairly entitled to reject, does not remove their entitlement to act upon the basis of the simple fact that what he dealt with was ecstasy and to draw the appropriate inference of guilt therefrom.30   SMART AJ: I agree with the reasons given by the Presiding Judge and I also agree that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed and the appeal against sentence should also be dismissed. 
     31   MEAGHER JA: Those are the orders of the Court.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
       
     1    SHELLER JA: Pursuant to s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, Philip Giovannone seeks leave to appeal against two interlocutory judgments and orders of Acting Judge Flannery, one given on 7 November 2000 and the other on 8 and 9 November 2000.  
      
       
     2    The applicant stood trial in the District Court in May 2000 on an indictment containing three counts that on 16 November 1994 at Sydney he: 
      
       
        
       (a) “did an act, namely did ask Trevor Haken to speak with a person at the Australian Federal Police with a view to removing Giovannone’s name from an Australian Federal Police brief with an intent thereby to pervert the course of justice” (referred to as the ‘Rubber Count’); 
        
        
       (b) did an act, namely did ask Trevor Haken to provide protection from arrest for a drug dealer named ‘Rocky’ with intent to pervert the course of justice (referred to as the ‘Rocky Count’); and 
        
        
       (c) did corruptly give Trevor Haken, an agent of the Crown, a benefit namely, $200 as an inducement on account of Trevor Haken showing favour to Giovannone in relations (sic) to the affairs of the Crown (referred to as the ‘Corrupt Reward Count’).” 
        
        
       These charges have been referred to as the “bribery type charges”. 
        
       
     3    The jury were unable to agree on a verdict and were discharged. The Crown has directed that there should be a re-trial.  
      
       
     4    On a separate indictment the applicant was charged that on 12 July 1995 at Sydney, being a person giving evidence on oath at a hearing before the Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service, he gave false evidence that was to his knowledge false in a material particular, namely that he had never given money to a police officer (referred to as the “false testimony charge”). It is not clear on the evidence what was the precise form of either indictment at any given time. Amendments said by the applicant to be significant were made at various times. 
      
       
     5    On or about 26 June 1998 the applicant had been charged by way of information and summons with four counts of which the first mirrored the false testimony charge except that added at the end were the words “whereas Giovannone had given the sum of $200 to Trevor Haken on 16 November 1994”. Apparently the original intended indictment to be presented by the Crown had the four counts on the one form and used words identical to the information and summons presented to the magistrate presiding at committal proceedings. There are some slight changes between the Rubber count and the Rocky count in the indictment presented at the trial from the form in the original counts 2 and 3 in the intended indictment presented to the magistrate. 
      
       
     6    On 11 May 2000 a Crown prosecutor sent a notice of particulars relied on by the Crown saying that the matters if they proceeded to trial would do so by two separate trials. “The first trial will comprise the three counts presently numbered 2, 3 and 4 on the current indictment. The proposed second trial would be in respect of count 1 on the current indictment.” The form of the three bribery type charges in this revised indictment was set out and the first and second “perverting the course of justice” differed from the forms I have set out above. Particulars were given. The Crown said that it relied principally on the evidence of the witness Haken and the tape recordings of discussions between Haken and agent Kieran Miller and the accused on 15 and 16 November 1994 to establish them. The notice of 11 May concluded under the heading “The Second Trial”. 
      
       
        
         
         “The evidence on this single count of ‘giving false evidence at a hearing before the Royal Commission’, will depend partly on the result of count 3 in the first trial, ‘the $200 payment’. 
         
        
        
         
         At present, it would be the Crown’s intention to lead: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) the admissible evidence on count 3; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) the relevant parts of the accused’s evidence at the Royal Commission on 12 and 13 July 1995.” 
         
        
       
     7    Significant for the applicant’s argument was the statement that the proposed trial on this count would take place after the proposed trial of the other three counts. The applicant believed, so it is said, that if the Crown did not secure a conviction on the corrupt reward count, the false testimony count would not be proceeded with and would be no billed. On 18 August 2000 when the matters came before the Chief Judge of the District Court, the Crown indicated an intention of reversing the order of trials and of seeking to have the false testimony trial heard before the re-trial. This was confirmed by a letter from the Crown dated 5 October 2000. 
      
       
     8    The applicant made two applications by notices of motion dated 20 October 2000. One was for an order that the trial of the indictment on the three charges should be first conducted and the trial on the indictment for the false testimony charge be relegated to the second and subsequent trial. The other was that the criminal proceedings against the applicant as the accused be permanently stayed. In support of the first of these applications an affidavit by the applicant’s solicitor, Mr Rea, sworn on 25 October 2000, was filed in which it was said that since the inception of substantive proceedings in the matter it had always been agreed between the Crown and the accused and approved by the presiding judicial officers that there would be two separate trials running “back to back” with the trial of the bribery trials preceding the trial of the false testimony charges. The rationalisation of the two trials was said to be obvious from the fact that the bribery type charges alleged to have occurred on 16 November 1994 stood alone and pre-dated the false testimony charge. The false testimony charge, which was alleged to have occurred during proceedings of the Royal Commission into Police Corruption on 12 and 13 July 1995, as a matter of fact and law depended and could only be brought if and when it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused paid the sum of $200 to Trevor Haken on 16 November 1994 to induce him in the way suggested by the bribery charges. In para 6 of his affidavit Mr Rea deposed: 
      
       
        
         
         “Therefore as a matter of logical sequence it follows that the Bribery charges should precede the False Testimony charge.” 
         
        
       
     9    The affidavit went on to refer to the listing of the matter before the Chief Judge of the District Court on 18 August 2000 when it was indicated that it was the Crown’s intention to proceed to a further trial and that the Crown intended to reverse the order of the trials so that the false testimony charge was to proceed to trial before the trial of the bribery type charges. It was said that as a matter of strict chronology there was no reason forthcoming from the Crown as to why the order of the trials should be reversed, that as a matter of fairness to the accused in terms of the due process of law and the particular circumstances of the matter there was no plausible reason why there had been a decision by the Crown to reverse the order of trials and that the use of such a discretion by the Crown at that point of time in the history of the matter was tantamount to an abuse of process. There appeared to be no grounds for reversing the order of the trials except unfairly to prejudice the accused and put him at a disadvantage as to his understanding of the charges and proceedings against him. The affidavit continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “15. From a strict factual point of view, before the Crown has to prove that $200 was paid by the accused to Trevor Haken in support of its allegation in the False Testimony trial that the accused lied about the fact and is therefore guilty of giving false testimony, the proof of that critical fact can only come from a conviction by a Jury on the Bribery Type charges, or absurd as it may seem if the false testimony trial runs first, if Trevor Haken gives evidence about that fact in the False Testimony trial. Such a procedure would effectively defeat the purpose of having two separate trials because of the prejudice that the False Testimony charge causes the accused in his first trial. 
         
        
        
         
         16. Further the issues raised in the proceedings before the Royal Commission into Police Corruption cannot be used in evidence against the accused in any other matters, including the Bribery Type charges except to prove the false testimony charge. Thus by reversing the order and conducting the trial of the False Testimony charge first, all issues of credibility that could be in that trial could be used in the Bribery Type charges trial, which is exactly what the Royal Commission into Police Corruption said should not be done.” 
         
        
       
     10    The grounds for the stay application were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. There has already taken place a previous trial which concluded in the Jury not being able to reach a unanimous verdict on any of the three charges heard. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The proceedings against the accused are oppressive, vexatious and unfair. 
         
        
        
         
         3. The decision of the office of the DPP not to discontinue the proceedings against the accused is erroneous in that the discretionary guidelines of whether or not a prosecution should be continued has not been followed. 
         
        
        
         
         4. As a matter of public and economic policy, the continuation of these proceedings is an ‘affront to the Public Conscience’. 
         
        
        
         
         5. The matters set out in the previous stay of proceedings are herein re-instated and relied upon in particular: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) The delay in bringing the proceedings. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) The conduct of the solicitor of the DPP initially handling the matter, from the point of view of the unfairness and hardship it caused and created for the Accused. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) The personal stress and medical detriment to the Accused which he is experiencing because of these proceedings and their continuation and conduct. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) The entrapment-type situation created against the Accused. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         6. That there is and has been an Abuse of Process on all and/or each or any of the above grounds and reasons entitling the Accused to a Permanent Stay of Proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         7. For any other reason and/or grounds which may arise or which this Honourable Court deems appropriate.” 
         
        
       
     11    On 7 November 2000 Acting Judge Flannery refused the motion that the false testimony trial take place after the conclusion of the trial of the bribery type offences. 
      
       
     12    On 9 November 2000 Acting Judge Flannery refused the stay of proceedings on all counts on both indictments giving reasons for judgment which began on 8 November 2000. 
      
       
     13    The applicant seeks leave to appeal from both these decisions. In doing so, he sought to rely on a further affidavit of Mr Rea, sworn on 8 December 2000 to which the Crown objected on the basis that if leave were granted the appeal to this Court under s5F was not a re-hearing and accordingly, it was not open to put before the Court new or fresh evidence. A substantial part of the affidavit was in the form of a history of the matter including a section headed “Uncontested facts”, paras 17-30. Paragraph 25 and substantial parts of what followed under the heading “The Background”, paras 31-79, sought to introduce or refer to material not before Acting Judge Flannery. On that basis, we rejected the paragraphs containing such material.  
      
       
     14    In BWM (1997) 91 A CrimR 260 at 265 Hunt CJ at CL said: 
      
       
        
         
         “In my opinion, an appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order pursuant to s5F is not by way of rehearing. This Court, unless specifically empowered to act otherwise, acts as a court of error, not as a court of rehearing. The basis upon which it does so pursuant to s5 of the  
         Criminal Appeal Act,  
         on an appeal against conviction on indictment, was discussed in detail by this Court in  
         Kurtic 
          (1996) 85 A CrimR 57 at 59-60, and it is unnecessary to repeat here what was said there. In hearing appeals from such convictions, even where the trial was by judge alone without a jury, this Court has no power to rehear the issues at the trial or to make any finding which could have been made in the court of trial.” 
         
        
       
     15    Gleeson CJ at 261 agreed with Hunt CJ at CL’s reasons subject to one qualification. The Chief Justice said: 
      
       
        
         
         “As at present advised, I am not convinced that the key to the understanding of the nature of the appeal is to be found in the application, or rejection, of the description ‘rehearing’. On any view of the matter, the present appeal, if leave were granted, would be an appeal against a decision that was both interlocutory and discretionary. Quite apart from the absence in s5F of the  
         Criminal Appeal Act 
          1912 (NSW) of any reference to a rehearing, those aspects of the appeal have significant consequences as to its character. 
         
        
        
         
         The nature of an appeal by way of rehearing was explained by Mason J in  
         Builders Licensing Board v Sperway Constructions (Sydney) Pty Ltd 
          (1976) 135 CLR 616 at 619. The question whether an appeal is by way of rehearing is not identical with the question whether, on an appeal from a discretionary judgment, the appellate court is either entitled or obliged to exercise its own discretion afresh, even in the absence of demonstrated error by the trial judge:  
         House 
          (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505.” 
         
        
       
     16    At 268 Hidden J said that he saw the force in the analysis of the nature of an appeal under s5F in Hunt CJ at CL’s reasons and in particular his view that the court should not interfere with the exercise of a discretion by a trial judge unless error was shown. However, his Honour said that he preferred to express no concluded view. 
      
       
     17    It would not be going too far to say that counsel for the applicant in the course of submissions ranged widely over factual material and at the least came close to inviting the Court to re-consider it. Accordingly, it is not out of place to refer to what was said in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 and to those cases which had been concerned with stay applications. In House v The King at 504-5 Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be determined is governed by established principles. It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the position of the primary judge, they would have taken a different course. It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide of affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.” 
         
        
       
     18    In R v Tolmie (unreported) NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 7 December 1994, Hunt CJ at CL, with whom McInerney and Bruce JJ agreed, examined the basis upon which a permanent stay will be granted. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “To justify such a stay, there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial of such a nature that nothing which the trial judge could do in the conduct of the trial could relieve the applicant against its unfair consequences:  
         Barton v The Queen 
          (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 111;  
         Jago v District Court 
          (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 34, 75;  
         The Queen v Glennon 
          (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 615-616. The right to a fair trial is entrenched in the criminal justice system, to ensure that innocent people are not convicted of criminal offences, and a stay of proceedings may be granted to prevent an unfair trial:  
         Jago v District Court 
          ( at 29, 56, 72). But that right must be balanced against the right of the community to expect that persons charged with serious criminal offences are brought to trial  
         ibid 
          (at 33, 72). In that sense, fairness to the accused is not the sole criterion when a court decides whether a criminal trial should proceed:  
         ibid 
          (at 30). The grant of a stay of proceedings is discretionary, and the circumstances will usually have to be extreme for such relief to be given:  
         ibid 
          (at 31, 60, 75);  
         The Queen v Glennon 
          (at 605, 615-616). The onus lies on the applicant for a stay to demonstrate that the disadvantage or prejudice which he would suffer by the refusal of a stay is in the relevant sense unacceptable, to the extent that the trial would be unfair:  
         Barron v AG 
          (1987) 10 NSWLR 215 at 219, 233;  
         Regina v Basha 
          (1989) 39 A CrimR 337 at 338;  
         Regina v Laurie Peter Helmling 
          (CCA, 11 November 1993, unreported) at 4).” 
         
        
       
     19    Later in his judgment, the Chief Judge pointed out that a likelihood that the prosecution will fail is not the same thing as saying that it is doomed to failure.  
      
       
        
         
         “There is a very real distinction to be drawn between the power of the courts to stay proceedings permanently and the discretion of the prosecutor to file a no bill; cf  
          R v Maxwell 
          (1994) 34 NSWLR 606 at 608F-G, where reference is made to  
         Connelly v DPP 
          [1964] AC 1254.” 
         
        
       
     20    The decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Maxwell was reversed by the High Court; Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501. At 512 Dawson and McHugh JJ said: “Our courts do not purport to exercise control over the institution or continuation of criminal proceedings, save where it is necessary to do so to prevent an abuse of process or to ensure a fair trial; see Barton v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 90-91, 96.” After referring to R v Brown (1989) 17 NSWLR 472, Dawson and McHugh JJ said at 514:  
      
       
        
         
         “The court rightly observed that the most important sanctions governing the proper performance of a prosecuting authority’s functions are likely to be political rather than legal. Nevertheless, the court concluded that in an appropriate case a court may need to give effect to its own right to prevent an abuse of its process. That conclusion is undoubtedly correct, but the need for a court to exercise its inherent power to protect its own process should in this context rarely, if ever, arise.” 
         
        
       
     21    At 534 Gaudron and Gummow JJ, speaking of the “prosecutorial discretion” said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The integrity of the judicial process - particularly, its independence and impartiality and the public perception thereof - would be compromised if the courts were to decide or were to be in any way concerned with decisions as to who is to be prosecuted and for what;  
         Barton v The Queen 
          at 94-95;  
         Jago  
         at 38-39, 54, 77-78;  
         Williams v Spautz 
          (1992) 174 CLR 509 at 548;  
         Ridgeway v The Queen 
          (1995) 184 CLR 19 at 74-75.” 
         
        
        
         
        
        
       Judgment on Application to Reverse Order of Trials 
        
       
     22    In his reasons for judgment delivered on 7 November 2000, Acting Judge Flannery said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown proposes in the false testimony charge to rely on the evidence given by the accused before the Royal Commission into the Police Service conducted by Mr Justice Wood. I do not agree with what Mr Rea swore in paragraph six of his affidavit, therefore as a matter of logical sequence it follows that the bribery charges should proceed the false testimony charge. 
         
        
        
         
         In paragraph thirteen Mr Rea avers to, there is no plausible reason why the decision to reverse the order was made. To my mind, there is a plausible reason which, to my mind, is legitimate. There are probably a number of plausible reasons but one is that it seems to me to be beyond serious dispute that the false testimony trial will be a shorter trial than the bribery type charges. One does not have to be imaginative to assert that proposition because the previous trial of those matters took approximately two months. The Crown proposes to prove its false testimony charge by reference to certain passages in the evidence given by the accused at the Royal Commission plus some evidence that Mr Haken at the relevant time or times was a police officer. 
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted in the affidavit in paragraph fourteen that to commence with the false testimony trial is tantamount to an abuse of process. Although many words have been spoken about this subject in this proceeding I do not propose to add to those words, it is sufficient for me to say that I do not think that the exercise of such a discretion by the Crown amounts to an abuse of process nor do I think that such a reversal would unfairly prejudice the accused.” 
         
        
        
       It is useful to observe that ordinarily, though perhaps not exclusively, abuse of process would connote bad faith or oppression.  
        
       
     23    Counsel for the applicant criticised this passage in the reasons for judgment. He submitted that a large part of the two months spent in the hearing of the previous trial was taken up with the voir dire and arguments about the admissibility of evidence. The bribery type charges re-trial would be considerably shorter. Even so, the nub of Judge Flannery’s comment was that beyond serious dispute the false testimony trial would be shorter than the bribery type charges trial. 
      
       
     24    After the passage which I have quoted, Judge Flannery said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The law on the subject is probably nil when one considers the precise subject with which we are dealing….” 
         
        
       
     25    In some way it was suggested that the learned judge had overlooked or not taken account of the law about abuse of process and unfair prejudice. This is not what his Honour meant and what he said discloses no error. The nub of the applicant’s argument was that a trial on the false testimony count would expose the applicant, if he gave evidence which he might be bound to do in order to defend the charge, to cross-examination about the events of 16 November 1994 which could then be used by the Crown at the re-trial of the bribery type charges. 
      
       
     26    There is no principle that, where an accused person faces separate trials, he is entitled to have the trial of the more serious offence concluded before facing trial on the other charge; Regina v Van Phu Ho (unreported) NSWCCA, 18 July 1994; R v Pirrottina (unreported) NSWCCA, 27 September 1996 at 9. In Ho the appellant was charged with a State offence of supplying heroin and a Federal offence of importing heroin. The trial date for the State offence was fixed first. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the prosecution of the relatively more minor State offence before the trial of the more serious importation offence constituted a procedural irregularity and that the Federal prosecutor intended to adduce the same evidence as that put forward in the State matter as an overt act in its prosecution. At 5 in his judgment, Mahoney JA, with whom Gleeson CJ and Dunford J agreed, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “As Mr Drake has pointed out, his Honour was conscious of the fact that, as he said in his judgment, the sale of the heroin which is the substance of the State charge ‘represents an overt act relied upon by the Commonwealth DPP in its case’. His Honour took that into account in deciding what he should do. Whether his Honour was right or wrong in the exercise of his discretion, there was no error of principle involved. But taking the matter beyond that, I do not think that if there was any irregularity it is one which would warrant this Court’s intervention. 
         
        
        
         
         The two trials are to proceed at different times. Having regard to what has been said about them, I do not think there would be any prejudice warranting the grant of leave to appeal or the upholding of an appeal in a case such as this because of the sequence of them.” 
         
        
       
     27    In Jago which concerned an application for a stay of a prosecution on grounds of unreasonable delay, Brennan J observed at 49-50: 
      
       
        
         
         “By the flexible use of the power to control procedure and by the giving of forthright directions to a jury, a judge can eliminate or virtually eliminate unfairness. The judge’s responsibilities are heavy but they are not discharged by abdication of the court’s duty to try the case. If it be said that judicial measures cannot always secure perfect justice to an accused, we should ask whether the ideal of perfect justice has not sounded in rhetoric rather than in law and whether the legal right of an accused, truly stated, is a right to a trial as fair as the courts can make it. Were it otherwise, trials would be prevented and convictions would be set aside when circumstances outside judicial control impair absolute fairness …… 
         
        
        
         
         Moreover, although our system of litigation adopts the adversary method in both the criminal and civil jurisdiction, interests other than those of the litigants are involved in litigation, especially criminal litigation. The community has an immediate interest in the administration of criminal justice to guarantee peace and order in society. The victims of crime, who are not ordinarily parties to prosecutions on indictment and whose interests have generally gone unacknowledged until recent times, must be able to see that justice is done if they are not to be driven to self-help to rectify their grievances. If a power to grant a permanent stay were to be exercised whenever a judge came to the conclusion that prejudice might or would be suffered by an accused because of delay in the prosecution, delay in law enforcement would defeat the enforcement of the law absolutely and prejudice resulting from the delay would become a not unwelcome passport to immunity from prosecution. Refusal by a court to try a criminal case does not undo the anxiety and disability which the pendency of a criminal charge produces, but it leaves the accused with an irremovable cloud of suspicion over his head. It is likely to engender a festering sense of injustice on the part of the community and the victim. The reasons for granting stay orders, which are as good as certificates of immunity, would be difficult of explanation for there would be largely discretionary. If permanent stay orders were to become common place, it would not be long before courts would forfeit public confidence. The granting of orders for permanent stays would inspire cynicism, if not suspicion, in the public mind.” 
         
        
       
     28    In my opinion it was entirely in the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide in which order the trial on the false testimony and the re-trial should take place. Nor do I think a change, if there was one, once the trial on the three counts had finished with a hung jury can be validly criticised. In my opinion, no ground was shown which required Judge Flannery to exercise his discretion in a way favourable to the applicant. Judge Flannery referred to R v Brown, which the High Court approved in Maxwell. His Honour quoted the following passage at 481: 
      
       
        
         
         “It can be said, however, that although the discretion of the prosecuting authorities in this regard is not absolute and unfettered in the sense that the court is powerless to intervene, the discretion is very wide and in its exercise the authorities are entitled to take account of practical considerations including matters relating to the availability of resources. To describe a bona fide decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions as an abuse of the process of the court is no light matter, and courts should pay due regard to the consideration that it is the executive which is entrusted with the primary responsibility of making decisions of this character.” 
         
        
       
     29    I am quite satisfied that Acting Judge Flannery properly took account of the arguments that were put to him and no ground is shown for interfering with his Honour’s conclusion that the discretion exercised by the prosecutor was a correct exercise of discretion and a sensible exercise of discretion. It was not, in any relevant sense, so prejudicial to the applicant that nothing the trial judge could do in the conduct of the trial could relieve the applicant against its unfair consequences so that this Court was called upon to intervene. 
      
       
        
       Judgment on the Stay Application 
        
       
     30    Acting Judge Flannery observed that the stay grounds were numerous and referred to the factual background as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “In relation to what has been called by others the bribery type offences that allegedly occurred on 16 November 1994, they occurred in a hotel called Hart’s Hotel. The meeting, appears to have been initiated by Trevor Haken and he certainly had with him a tape recorder and the conversation was taped. 
         
        
        
         
         The tape initially of the conversation I just adverted to was, to my mind, substantially unintelligible but the Crown managed to obtain a CD and I did not think that the CD was unintelligible The Crown also proposes to tender a transcript of that CD. 
         
        
        
         
         It was not until 26 June 1998 that these proceedings were commenced and I mean all the charges were laid. That was a considerable time after the bribery offences are alleged to have occurred, between three and four years, and a considerable time after the alleged false testimony occurred, nearly three years. The Royal Commissioner reported on 26 May 1997. 
         
        
        
         
         There were, of course, committal proceedings and there was a problem at the committal proceedings, as not infrequently happens, where more than one person from the prosecution side was involved in the matter. Without identifying anybody (I do not think it is necessary) the first person I do not think had carriage of the matter and it was indicated that Mr Haken would be available for cross-examination. When the person who had the carriage of the matter, returned to the forensic arena she took the view, and persuaded the Magistrate of the efficacy of it, that Haken be not called at the committal. That led to consideration of an appeal to the Supreme Court and that, without going into great detail about it (I think it is unnecessary) did not proceed but there were negotiations about the matter which almost came to fruition but ultimately agreement could not be reached. 
         
        
        
         
         Prior to the first trial which was of the bribery counts, it being common ground that the perjury count should be dealt with separately and as a back-up trial, the accused had a Basha inquiry of Mr Haken, which opportunity was availed of, and he was also cross-examined at the trial. So the problem of him not being cross-examined at the committal, I would have thought, was solved by the permission given by his Honour Judge Coorey, quite properly with the utmost respect, to allow the accused a Basha cross-examination of the principal Crown witness, Mr Trevor Haken. 
         
        
        
         
         The trial before Judge Coorey in all took approximately two months, approximately half of the period was voir dire time and the balance was trial time. On all counts the jury were unable to agree upon a verdict. The back-up trial of perjury or what might be safer to describe as false testimony, a charge not under the  
         Crimes Act 
         , but under the  
         Royal Commission Act 
         , s21. This did not commence shortly thereafter the disagreement was announced, in fact it remained in the Registry and the arrangement to have it heard second was made prior to the Judge Coorey trial. 
         
        
        
         
         On or about 18 August 2000 the Chief Judge was advised by the Crown that he was proposing to commence the false testimony trial and finalise the false testimony trial prior to the commencement of the trial for the other three counts. That communication was put into writing on 5 October 2000. 
         
        
        
         
         The particulars have been the subject of some complaint by the accused. Particulars were given on 11 May 2000 and those particulars are contained in exhibit 5 on the voir dire.” 
         
        
       
     31    Acting Judge Flannery said the grounds in support of the application were that it was likely that the second trial of the three bribery type charges would produce the same result or an acquittal. His Honour continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is stated, in the affidavit in support, that all indications are that a second or subsequent trial would produce the same result as the first trial. Not only did the jury disagree but they had an opportunity prior to summing-up to consider the matter because his Honour gave what is called a Prasad direction and they deliberated on the Prasad direction for about an hour and a half and decided they would hear more. 
         
        
        
         
         For completeness it is not unworthy of note to state that the accused did not give evidence at the trial. 
         
        
        
         
         The accused relies on the jury disagreeing and the fact that his Honour gave a Prasad direction as part of the basis for a stay. The next basis is that Mr Haken, who on the previous trial was the principal witness, had been discredited and that it would be unlikely for any jury of twelve to agree to convict on his evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         The next ground is that the cases on the bribery type counts are not merely weak but they are non-existent. On the first count it is put that the accused’s name was never, currently in any event, or proximately to the commencement of these proceedings, on any Australian Federal Police brief. 
         
        
        
         
         As regards the second count the accused, through his counsel, submits that there was no course of justice, Rocky had been imprisoned and was on parole but there was no current matter, no current charge, no current arrest, no current proceeding. It follows that Mr Bonnici says that in both counts one and two there is no case. 
         
        
        
         
         As regards the third count, as I understand it and I do not pretend to completely state Mr Bonnici’s submissions, but he points to difficulties for the Crown in relation to that count, the use of the words ‘in relation to the affairs of the Crown’, the weakness, which I will come to later, as to the proof of the payment of two hundred dollars and of course the previous weak case, this is in counts one and two, which I have adverted to, so he submits in effect, as I understand it, that there really is not a case, it is not just a matter of them being a weak case.” 
         
        
       
     32    His Honour said that he did not regard the application as frivolous but he had three problems with it. He stated these as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “One is, and I am not suggesting I am bound by his decision on this, but one is that my predecessor, his Honour Judge Coorey, allowed these matters to go to the jury. My second difficulty is that it is my view, and I am not overly confident that I am correct, but it is my view that it has to be a hopeless prosecution before a stay is granted when the proper course would be to hear some evidence and if the submission is sound direct a verdict. It has to be a case which is plainly hopeless. 
         
        
        
         
         My third concern is that since 1990 the law on this subject of perverting the course of justice has altered somewhat and I know of no authority on it and counsel have been most assiduous, and I use that word in the plural, I use the word counsel in the plural, have not taken me to any authority on the subject. I refer to s312 of the  
         Crimes Act 
         . ‘A reference in this part to perverting the course of justice is a reference to obstructing, preventing, perverting, or defeating the course of justice or the administration of the law.’ Now we have this addendum to that crime, formerly a common law crime, of the words ‘or the administration of the law.’ Now I do not know what is comprised in the administration of the law, I doubt that anybody could say that they know, and for that reason I do not think it is appropriate (in addition to the other two reasons I have given) to deal with the matter on an interlocutory application and stay proceedings. It is a matter which ultimately may have to be resolved by the Court of Criminal Appeal, or indeed the High Court, maybe not in this case but on some other occasion. 
         
        
        
         
         The accused correctly said about the first tape that was played that it was bad and plainly ambiguous. I do not think that is the case in respect to the CD which is now being played. As regards the transcript it may be, and I say no more than that at this stage, that the person who transcribed it may have to be called. 
         
        
        
         
         It seems to me on my reading of the majority judgments in  
         Butera 
         , I am not referring to the dissenting judgment of her Honour Justice Gaudron, that the transcript, if proved, would be admissible.” 
         
        
       
     33    His Honour then referred to passages in the decision in Butera v Director of Public Prosecutions for the State of Victoria (1987) 164 CLR 180 and the approval in the joint judgment of a statement by Cooke J in R v Menzies [1982] 1 NZLR 40 at 49.  
      
       
     34    Acting Judge Flannery continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “A further argument of the accused is that entrapment occurred relying of course on the popular case of  
         Ridgeway 
          (1995) 184 CLR 19.” 
         
        
        
       His Honour cited the judgment of Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ and came to the conclusion that in the dichotomy between cases in which the police conduct has induced an accused person to commit the offence which he or she has committed where the public interest in the conviction and punishment of those guilty of crime is likely to prevail over other considerations and the case where illegal police conduct is itself the principal offence to which the charged offence is ancillary or creates or itself constitutes and essential ingredient of the charged offence. His Honour said: 
        
        
         
         “I think that assuming inducement that public interest in the conviction and punishment of those guilty of crime prevails, however, it seems to me that it has not been established that Haken’s conduct, or Miller’s conduct, has induced the accused to commit any crime if he has committed any crime. True it is Haken, on the evidence so far anyhow, initiated the meeting. True it is he brought along a tape recorder, but it does not seem to my mind, on reading the transcript here, that the accused has satisfied me that he has been induced to commit these offences.” 
         
        
       
     35    Next the judge dealt with reliance placed upon cost and medical evidence and observed that counsel indicated that he did not rely on one single matter which would warrant the stay but the totality of events which had occurred. His Honour observed: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is also criticism of the fact that in the tape and in the video of course nobody ever says money passed over on the tape and it is not visible on the video and whilst I only know this from the no bill application made by Mr Bonnici in 1999, neither surveillance officer can say they actually saw the actual money at the time Haken picked up the cigarette packet. 
         
        
        
         
         The remarks I have made so far, although purporting to be general, have been dealing more particularly with the three bribery type counts. The application for a stay also relates to the perjury count and as I understand it, although the written submission on the subject was put with more vigour, in respect to what happened at the Royal Commission, what Mr Bonnici put to me here was not that the Commissioner, or counsel assisting, did anything improper in their questioning of the accused at the Royal Commission, it is that the ambit of what is appropriate at a Royal Commission is a wider ambit than the ambit of what is appropriate in a trial in this Court, particularly in a jury trial and that without being in any way critical in his submissions orally as to the conduct of the Royal Commissioner and counsel assisting he says that if this tape is played or if the transcript is shown to the jury as an exhibit or otherwise then that presents a different picture and if that is the way the Crown is proposing to present its case on that count, and it is, that the proceedings should be stayed. 
         
        
        
         
         In addition to that the accused submits that the reality was not that he deliberately gave false testimony but that by reason of his state of health, activities the night before, his injuries sustained when he was a boxer, and his general psychiatric condition was such that he was not in a position to do himself justice in the somewhat difficult climate of being called as a witness in a Royal Commission in these circumstances and that whereas he did not acquit himself as one would expect of an experienced witness, he did not commit perjury.” 
         
        
       
     36    Acting Judge Flannery expressed his interim conclusion on those matters as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “I think all those matters are not matters warranting a stay but they are certainly matters of fact, they are matters of weight, they are matters that are properly to be considered by the jury.” 
         
        
       
     37    The judge then continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “There was reference to the imperfections in the bribery count indictment and that have occurred from time to time. Mr Bonnici submits that particularly in relation to counts one and two that they are in general terms and that the pleader should set out the conversation. Well I have anxiously looked at what I have always regarded as the authority on these subjects, Archbold, and I have not found anything and counsel have not referred me to anything which would suggest that it is inappropriate, or wrong, or unfair, to aver as has been averred. The averments, as I see them, asking Haken to speak with a person at the AFP with a view to removing Giovannone’s name from an Australian Federal Police brief and ask Trevor Haken to provide protection from arrest for a drug dealer named Rocky, to my mind adequately set out the case sought to be made against Mr Giovannone. 
         
        
        
         
         No motion has been taken out to quash the indictment, no demurrer has been taken and I think that was a proper decision. I do not think it is unfair to ask an accused to deal with the indictment in the manner in which it has been averred.” 
         
        
       
     38    At that point the trial judge indicated that he proposed to refuse the application but said that he would conclude his remarks on the following day. On 9 November 2000 he turned to consider the District Court decision in DPP v Hardas (unreported) 2 September 1999. In that case, which also involved Haken, Judge Viney had, pursuant to s138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) excluded evidence of conversations between Haken and the accused. As the result of his doing so, Judge Viney concluded that there had to be an acquittal. Judge Viney said to the jury: “This man is charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice and you will see from that evidence that all the movement about getting money came from Haken and Fowler”. Acting Judge Flannery considered there was a point of distinction between this case and that of Hardas. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I have read the listening device transcript of the conversation at Hart’s Hotel between Haken and the accused, exhibit 7 on the  
         voir dire 
         , and it seems to me that the comment made by his Honour Judge Viney, which I have just quoted, is not applicable to this case. I might say so with respect, even Mr Bonnici who does not miss any arguments which are possibly in his favour, concedes that the Rocky count, the Rocky element, was introduced by his client. There can be some argument as to whether the Rubber element or the Rubber count was initially introduced by Mr Giovannone or Haken. I say that by reason of the strange banter which nearly always is the situation in this type of case between police, undercover people and the accused. 
         
        
        
         
         The situation is not sufficiently clear to me to warrant the granting of a stay on the Rubber count. For those reasons, whilst I do not in any way suggest that I disagree with the decision of his Honour in the case he was dealing with, my view is the case is distinguishable. A few other matters of less importance on that subject, one is that his Honour did not grant a stay of proceedings in that case. The other of course is that another distinguished brother, Judge Coorey, was asked to stay the proceedings in this matter and his attention was drawn later in the case when at the stage where it was appropriate to apply for a direct verdict, to wit the end of the Crown case. The accused counsel referred to the  
         Hardas 
          case then. 
         
        
        
         
         So if one is talking about judicial comity, I do not see it as the case but it could be that I have two persons who may have come to different decisions. But I do not think that is the case. I think Judge Viney was dealing with a different factual situation from that which Judge Coorey and I are dealing with in this case. For those reasons I distinguish  
         Hardas’s 
          case from the present. 
         
        
        
         
         Finally unless something has happened unbeknown to me,  
         Jago 
          is still the law. The then Chief Justice Sir Anthony Mason says in  
         Jago 
         , at 31 that the power to stay should be used only in most exceptional circumstances. His Honour also said at 34 on this occasion, ‘To justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial “of such a nature that nothing a trial judge can do in the conduct of a trial can relieve against its unfair consequences”.’ Citing I might add Mr Justice Wilson in  
         Barton 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         Despite the accumulation of matters adverted to by Mr Bonnici I do not see any prejudice to the accused in commencing this trial. Tapes and transcript are available. It is only a conversation in relation to all matters between Haken and the accused. It is not as if there has been any dead, ill, overseas witness or any other reasons which might warrant further consideration for a stay. And for all those reasons, including of course what I said yesterday, the application for a stay of proceedings on all counts on both indictments, is refused.” 
         
        
       
     39    As I indicated during argument, I have some difficulty with the proposition that in the exercise of discretion to stay the proceedings in the present case it was relevant to compare another different case and examine how the discretion was exercised by another judge in that case. 
      
       
     40    The material put before Judge Flannery was again in some detail rehearsed before this Court. What, to my mind, was not demonstrated was error. It was not suggested that Acting Judge Flannery had not taken into account the material put before him and I do not think that it can be said that the conclusion he reached was so unreasonable or plainly unjust that we should infer that there had been a failure properly to exercise the discretion.  
      
       
     41    Mr Bonnici, who appeared for the applicant, with force and skill went over a good deal of the material that was relied upon before Acting Judge Flannery in both applications. In light of my view that no error was demonstrated, there is no purpose in dealing with this review of the material in detail. Some time was spent looking at the transcript of the taped meeting between Mr Haken and the applicant. Nothing that we were taken to seemed to me to indicate that this material could not be admitted or if admitted would not have supported the bribery type charges. These are matters eminently for the trial judge and the jury and not for this Court. Similarly, submissions put about the form of the indictments are submissions to be put to the trial judge. Under both heads it is significant that the Crown case as alleged was thought appropriate to put to the jury. Moreover, at least one member of the jury apparently was not prepared to acquit. As part of the argument that the continuance of these prosecutions was an affront to the public conscience we were referred to the indemnity from prosecution granted to Mr Haken on 21 August 1995 and an imposing list of offences of corruption and dishonesty by Mr Haken beginning in the early 1970s and continuing to the early 1990s. By contrast the applicant was being brought to trial on four less serious offences without any significant criminal history. This submission is misconceived. It may be that if Mr Haken had not been granted immunity or if the immunity had been granted other than for proper reason the failure to prosecute him would be an affront to the public conscience. But whether that is so or not it does not to my mind mean that that affront carries over to or affects the propriety of prosecuting the applicant. 
      
       
     42    Acting Judge Flannery carefully and conscientiously reviewed and dealt with the material put before him in the application for the stay. His Honour rightly recognised that he should only grant the stay in the most exceptional circumstances and cited the passage from Jago which is restated, as I have already quoted it, in Tolmie. Acting Judge Flannery properly instructed himself. There is no error and no reason for us to interfere with the result that he reached in the exercise of his discretion.  
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
     43    The result is that, in my opinion, leave should be granted on both applications to this Court but that in each case the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     44    GROVE J: I agree with Sheller JA. 
      
       
     45    KIRBY J: I agree with Sheller JA.

     REGINA v Geoffrey Warwick FOWLER 
     
     
     SENTENCE 
      
     
      
      HER HONOUR:  
       
      
    1    On 20 February 2001 a jury found Warwick Geoffrey Fowler guilty of the murder of Trevor Climpson. He now appears for sentence on that conviction. The murder was committed on 8 January 1988. 
     
      
    2    The reason for the apparently extraordinary delay is that the prisoner has twice previously been convicted on the same charge but each time successfully appealed against the conviction. 
     
      
    3    In one sense those facts simplify the sentencing exercise. Newman J presided over the first trial which took place between 29 September and 3 November 1993. His Honour imposed a sentence of a total term of 20 years made up of a minimum term of 15 years and an additional term of five years. 
     
      
    4    The prisoner, having been on bail at that time, was taken into custody on 28 October 1993 during the course of the trial. Following sentence he remained in custody until 15 November 1995 when he was granted bail after the Court of Criminal Appeal had quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial. He remained at liberty until 4 June 1997, the date he was next convicted and when he was again taken into custody. 
     
      
    5    On this occasion he remained incarcerated until 31 May 2000, when he was again released on bail after the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the second conviction and again ordered a new trial. 
     
      
    6    Following his arrest in 1990 the prisoner was in custody for a little over a month before being granted bail. All told he spent five years, one month and 16 days in custody. 
     
      
    7    The sentence imposed by Dowd J following the second conviction was significantly less than that imposed by Newman J. This was partly accounted for by slightly over two years served as a result of the first conviction for which the prisoner was given credit, and partly accounted for by the view of the facts taken by Dowd J which was apparently different in some respects from the view taken by Newman J. 
     
      
    8    The sentence Dowd J imposed was of a total term of 13 years and 10 months, made up of a minimum term of nine years and 10 months and an additional term of four years. Had it not been for the time spent in custody following the first conviction Dowd J would have sentenced the prisoner to a term of 16 years made up of a minimum term of 12 years and an additional term of four years. 
     
      
    9    A recognised convention, although non-binding and subject to exceptions and discretions in sentencing following reconviction after a successful appeal, is that the second judge ordinarily does not impose a sentence more severe than was previously imposed. I consider it appropriate in this instance to observe that convention. The Crown has not argued to the contrary. 
     
      
    10    Although counsel for the prisoner has noted that the prisoner has undergone the undoubted stress of three trials and has, whilst at liberty, endured and complied with relatively onerous bail conditions, including regular reporting, he has not argued that the sentence now to be imposed should be any less than the sentence selected by Dowd J, other than to take account of almost three years of that sentence served before the prisoner was released on bail.  
     
      
    11    I am satisfied that the prisoner is not entitled to any other reductions. Notwithstanding my intention to impose a sentence that will conform with convention and with the sentence imposed by Dowd J, it is necessary that I state briefly the facts I find as the basis for the sentence. 
     
      
    12    Trevor Climpson died of three gunshot wounds, one to the head and two to the body, on 8 January 1988. Any of the three wounds would have caused death, two instantly and the third more slowly but, nevertheless, surely. 
     
      
    13    He was murdered between 9.45pm and 11pm. He was in the yard of his home at Cecil Park although, being estranged from his wife, he had not been living at that address in the previous five weeks. I am satisfied that two of the fatal shots were fired from one gun, a .357 Magnum found in the prisoner's possession at his home in Moree on execution of a search warrant in 1990. 
     
      
    14    The remaining bullet was fired by a gun which belonged to Trevor Climpson but which was also found during the same search of the prisoner's home in Moree. 
     
      
    15    The Crown case, which was entirely circumstantial, was presented by way of two alternatives. 
     
      
    16    Firstly, it was contended that the prisoner was the actual killer and that he fired at least one, possibly more, of the fatal bullets. The alternative was that the evidence established that the prisoner was present aiding and abetting another person who did the act or acts causing death. 
     
      
    17    Having regard to the evidence before him Dowd J was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner was the principal offender. In this respect he appears to have differed from Newman J whose findings of fact were, of course, made on the basis of the evidence before him. Dowd J accordingly sentenced on the basis that the prisoner was an accessory and this explains in part the lesser sentence he ultimately imposed. 
     
      
    18    Since any of the three shots would have caused Mr Climpson's death, if I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner fired any of them, then it would be legitimate to sentence him as a principal in the first degree. I consider it most likely that the prisoner fired the two shots from the Magnum but I am, in any event, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he fired one of the two guns and that he is, accordingly, a principal in the first degree. I record that finding of fact although, having regard to what I have earlier said, it is not my intention to sentence more severely than Dowd J who sentenced on the basis that the prisoner was proved to have been no more than an accessory. 
     
      
    19    Like Newman J and Dowd J I am of the view that the killing was premeditated, deliberately and carefully planned. It was committed because the prisoner believed that Mr Climpson was mistreating his wife who was the prisoner's sister. 
     
      
    20    A modest amount of material was put before me for sentencing purposes. This included a victim impact statement from Mr Climpson's brother, Robert Climpson, which I treat, as did Dowd J, in the only way permissible as the law stands (see R v Previtera [1997] 96 ACrimR 76.) I note the effect his brother's murder has had upon Mr Robert Climpson, and I share the sympathy that Dowd J extended, but the statement can have no effect for sentencing purposes. 
     
      
    21    The prisoner was born on 8 March 1947. He was 40 years of age at the time of the crime, but is now almost 54. His criminal record is of no significance and is to be disregarded for present purposes. He has been a successful businessman in Moree and his good and non-violent character was attested to, in sentencing proceedings only, by a number of witnesses. He has been married twice and has a son, Adam, from the first marriage, who was a Crown witness. He has two younger sons from his second marriage whom he has seen only once since they and their mother left the prisoner in 1990. 
     
      
    22    The evidence which was accepted by both Newman J and Dowd J, and now also by me, establishes that the prisoner committed the murder because of his belief that the victim was mistreating the prisoner's sister. I do not regard that as a mitigating feature. 
     
      
    23    The prisoner suffers some medical problems, although that was put before me only in the remarks on sentence of Dowd J and this is no evidence of his current medical condition. 
     
      
    24    All these circumstances were taken into account by Dowd J and are reflected in the sentence that I am about to adopt and adapt. 
     
      
    25    On this occasion, unlike the previous occasions, the prisoner is to be sentenced under the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. By s 44 the court is firstly to set the term of the sentence and, secondly, to set a non-parole period. The non-parole period must be not less than three quarters of the term of the sentence unless the court decides there are special circumstances justifying such a sentence. 
     
      
    26    A parallel provision applied when Dowd J sentenced the prisoner, s 5 of the Sentencing Act 1989. His Honour considered the question of special circumstances but found none, other than such as would entitle him to adjust the sentence to take account of the time already served and that was what he did. I agree with his Honour's reasoning and propose to follow it. 
     
      
    27    The sentence I impose will therefore be one of imprisonment for 10 years and 10 months, with a non-parole period of six years and 10 months. I am conscious that such a sentence would, to a person uninformed of the history I have accounted, appear inadequate for a murder conviction, particularly a premeditated, cold-blooded murder as this one was. The sentence, however, must be seen in the light of more than five years the prisoner has already spent in custody as a direct result of this crime. It is, in truth, an effective sentence of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years, of which part has already been served. 
     
      
    28    Warwick Geoffrey Fowler, will you stand up please? You are convicted of the murder of Trevor Climpson. You are sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years and 10 months commencing on 20 February 2001, with a non-parole period of six years and 10 months.

       REGINA v DAVID WALSH 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    MASON P: After a trial in the District Court before Judge Nield and a jury, the appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm . He was sentenced on the first count to a period of imprisonment of five years comprising a non-parole period of two years and six months, and on the second count a fixed term of imprisonment of six months. 
     2    The verdicts are challenged as unreasonable having regard to the evidence. There is also a challenge to the directions in relation to complaint. 
      
       
       
      Facts 
       
     3    The complainant and the appellant had been fellow workers at a university in Sydney. At the time of the alleged offences (the evening of 30 October 1998) the appellant was aged 35 and the complainant was aged 21. A sexual relationship between the two had developed by about July 1998. One or two times a week the complainant returned with the appellant to his home at Strathfield. Intercourse took place in the granny flat he occupied at the rear of his mother's home there. 
     4    A fairly trivial incident involving the family dog on 16 October 1998 contributed to a cooling of the relationship. However, the couple agreed to meet for a drink in a city hotel on the evening of Friday 30 October. Others were meant to join them, but they did not arrive. Versions of what happened at the hotel differ in minor degrees as to the level of tension between the couple while they were there. Considerable quantities of alcohol were consumed. The complainant spent her taxi fare and so the appellant agreed to drive her home to Menai, as he had done previously. They took the train to Strathfield to pick up his car. 
     5    The complainant’s evidence was that the events of the fortnight after 16 October and the discussion at the hotel made it clear that the intimate relationship was over. There were arguments on the train and she told him that she did not have to settle for this. The appellant agreed that things were strained, but his version of events had the couple acting affectionately on the train journey to Strathfield.  
     6    The complainant’s evidence was that, when they got to the flat (at about one o’clock), the appellant invited her in while he changed out of his work clothes before driving her home. She was tired, so she curled up on the lounge fully dressed. She was wearing a long black skirt, black stockings, a red blouse and a black jacket.  
     7    She said that while she was half asleep on the lounge she felt a hand at the front of her skirt. She then saw the appellant trying to pull her skirt down. He tried to force himself on top of her. She asked him to stop as she did not want to do this. She told him that she wanted to go home. She tried to push the appellant away but since she was on an awkward angle she fell off the lounge. She said that the appellant grabbed her right calf, dragged her and put pressure on her stomach. She felt she could not move and she cried. She said that her underwear was pulled down with her stockings. She said that she believed the appellant had penetrated her vagina with his penis. She did not know whether he had ejaculated. After that the appellant threw her shoes at her legs and said “Now you can get in the car”. She said she picked up her stockings, put them in her bag and went very quickly into the appellant’s car. She said the appellant told her that she brought everything upon herself and everything she did was her own fault. She was a bitch and nobody would believe her against him. 
     8    The complainant’s version of the encounter was unequivocally that of forced and unwelcome sexual assault in which the appellant penetrated her vaginally with his penis, despite her protestations and knowing that she did not consent. 
     9    The second charge arose out of an incident during the drive home. The complainant said that there was initially silence between the two of them. However they got to arguing. It was common ground at trial that unpleasant words were exchanged. They got to near the complainant’s home. The complainant said that the appellant told her at one stage: “You came from nothing. You are nothing and you are always going to be nothing” , whereupon she “saw red” and hit him with her soft satin clutch bag. It knocked out a lens of his glasses. What then happened was described by her in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        Q. You told us about the conversation at that point. What happened after that? 
         
        A. After that, basically he grabbed me by the neck. I think I angered him with what I said. He grabbed me by the neck. I could breathe still – he just grabbed me and he hit me several times. I covered – put my hands up to cover my head. He pulled me down so that my chest was nearly touching my knees, he hit me several times on the left ear and mostly my arms ‘cause I had my arms up. 
         
         
        Q. You say he hit you several times on your left ear? 
         
        A. Mm. 
         
         
        Q. Do you know if those blows connected with anywhere else on your person. 
         
        A. I think mostly my arms copped it, and my head really, the back of my head. 
         
         
        Q. Did he say anything to you at this point? 
         
        A. I don’t recall that he said anything to me at that point. 
         
         
        Q. Did you see him do something? 
         
        A. Just after that he just shoved me aside and he said, ‘Get out’. Just like that. 
         
         
        Q. What did he do after he said, ‘get out’? 
         
        A. Well I wasn’t quick enough. He got out of the driver’s side, he came around to my side of the door, he opened the door, basically threw my shoes out which were on the floor - no he threw me out first. He got me and he pulled me straight out of his car and then he threw my shoes at me.” 
         
        
       
     10    When she went back to the appellant’s flat that evening the complainant had another, larger bag, containing personal possessions including books. When standing outside his car after the beating she asked the appellant: “Can I get my bag?” He told her, on her version, to “fuck off” and then drove off. (In his own evidence, the appellant said that she had left the bag back at the flat, that during the argument he had said he would “mail it” and that he never returned it to her. Instead he dumped it by the roadside.) 
     11    According to the complainant, when she got home in the early hours of the Saturday morning she was feeling sick, scared and sore. Her mother was up and asked her what was going on. The complainant’s evidence was: 
      
       
        
        I went out and my mother was up and she asked me: ‘What’s going on? What’s going on’ because I was obviously crying and really distressed and she said, ‘Just tell me what happened’ and she started to get panicky and I couldn’t tell my mother. I did not want to tell my mother. I think I said ‘He hurt me’ or ‘he hit me’ and then I said, ‘I just want to go’ and I went into the bathroom and I vomited several times and basically I just went to bed to think about it because I didn’t know what to do. 
         
         
        Q. Did you talk to your mother any further about it that you can remember? 
         
        A. Basically she said, ‘There’s nothing you can do about it.’ That’s basically what she said to me and I didn’t want to push the issue because I’d promised her that I would not see the defendant again and I felt very guilty because I had broken my promise and since she believed all he did was hit me, she said basically all I can do is learn a lesson –  
         
         
        PORTER: All you can do – 
         
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I’m not pressing this, your Honour. 
         
         
        PORTER: She was saying something, her mother said, ‘All you can do is to learn – ‘ 
         
         
        WITNESS: Basically what she said is ‘There’s not much you can do.’ I took that to mean, knowing my mother that you have to learn your lesson, don’t go near him again. 
        
       
       
     12    The following Monday the complainant returned to work. Her work colleague Martha Walkowsky asked her about her apparent distress. There was a conversation to whose details I shall return. The upshot was that Ms Walkowsky persuaded the complainant to report the matter to the police and the complainant did so by telephoning the police at 4.45pm that day. Arrangements were made for her to be examined medically the next day and to give a statement to the police the day thereafter. There was no suggestion that the statement differed in any material way from the evidence given at trial. 
     13    The complainant later retrieved her ripped pantyhose stockings and they were tendered into evidence. There is a vertical tear in the fabric beneath the waistband, consistent with the complainant’s account of the sexual assault. 
     14    On the other hand, the appellant denied that these were the stockings she was wearing on the night. He said that she was wearing a black bra, black underwear and white stockings. He denied “absolutely” that she was wearing the dark tights put into evidence (Tr p5, 17/4/00). It is however interesting that he volunteered during cross-examination that, after she had removed her outer garments, he removed “her black underwear and her bra” (Tr p97 14/4/00). 
     15    In cross examination the complainant adhered to her testimony about the two assaults. 
     16    The appellant called character evidence from several associates. He has no criminal antecedents and has always been employed in positions of responsibility. 
     17    The defence case was that consensual intercourse took place at the flat and that no blow was struck by the appellant in the car. 
     18    As to the alleged assault in the car, it was put to the complainant in cross-examination that “there was never any blow by him to you” (Tr p78, 13/4/00). 
     19    In his evidence, the appellant agreed that there had been some estrangement between 16 and 30 October following the dog escape incident. However, the couple had arranged to meet at the hotel with fellow employees. The appellant’s version of events in the hotel did not differ materially from that of the complainant. He agreed that he offered to drive her home after she first mentioned herself catching a taxi. They went to Strathfield by train, according to him kissing each other three or four times en route. 
     20    The appellant swore that when the couple got back to the flat the complainant removed her outer garments and her white stockings which went to mid-thigh. He then removed her underclothing. The appellant then went upstairs and had a shower. He came back and there was then entirely consensual intercourse.  
     21    In cross-examination, the appellant said that after the complainant was undressed, there was affectionate foreplay including digital penetration of her vagina. He then went up for his shower. He returned, dressed in a T shirt, underpants, tracksuit pants and tracksuit top and slippers. Then intercourse took place. The probabilities of this account being accurate were challenged in cross examination. In my view the jury were entitled to be sceptical. 
     22    According to the appellant, nothing really was said in the car until the couple got to Bankstown. The complainant then chided him with “do you always wake up people after having sex?”. There were other niggling comments. She then lit up a cigarette, something she had not previously done in his car. He grabbed the cigarette and threw it out of the window. The discussion started to get angrier, although the appellant denied having told her that she was “nothing”. She alluded to the fact that he had inherited his car from his late father. This admittedly stung him. Initially he said that “I was pretty angry and I reached over and grabbed her here(sic:? hair) and I said ‘if you don’t shut up I am going to move from a win/win to a win/lose situation in a minute’” (Tr p27 14/4/00). (As the trial judge pointed out at that stage, none of this had been put to the complainant.) 
     23    The appellant said that he called her a “stupid little bitch”. She retorted with a jibe about him still living with his mother. According to the appellant, what happened next was: 
      
       
        
        Q. What happened then? 
         
        A. I hit the brakes, the car was still in gear. I was pretty angry. I wanted her out of the car. She opened the door up. She had a seatbelt off. The light was on. She was sort of bending over like this, gathering up her shoes and bags, whatever else and I said, ‘Get up’. I pushed her again and she ended up sitting with her feet outside the car on the ground. She had her stuff between her legs and she was looking over her shoulder at me like that and I was sort of looking over at her. Then she had a red handbag. She swung it round and hit me in the face with it. 
        
       
       
     24    The appellant said that the complainant then hit him with her bag, knocking the lens of his glasses out. She got out of the car and he followed. He then“poked her in the shoulder a couple of times” (Tr p29 14/4/00). He denied hitting her, grabbing her in the neck or punching her as she had contended.  
     25    One matter upon which the appellant was cross-examined, and which would not have impressed the jury, concerned the complainant’s handbag with a strap containing her personal belongings. She had left it in the flat when the couple drove off to her home. On his evidence, he had promised to mail it to her. When the appellant returned from Menai he saw it at the bottom of the stairs inside the front entrance of the house. He put it in a cupboard upstairs in his room and later threw it away, something which he admitted was a stupid thing to do. This had been the subject of a third count in the indictment, but a verdict of not guilty was directed at the close of the Crown case, ie before the appellant gave this evidence about what he had done with the bag. 
      
      Ground Three 
       
     26    It is convenient to address this ground first. 
     27    The evidence of Ms Martha Walkowsky was given without objection. She saw the complainant at work on the Monday morning. The complainant was quite distressed, nervous and upset, and just not herself. Ms Walkowsky gave the following evidence:  
      
       
        
        Q. Did you speak to her? 
         
        A. Yes, I did. I was a bit concerned as I would be with anybody, and I asked her what was wrong. 
         
         
        Q. What did she say?  
         
         A. She said that something bad had happened and she felt really stupid. 
         
         
        Q. What did you say?  
         
         A. I said ‘What, tell me’ and I wanted her to tell me so that I could try and help her, and I said that ‘I can only help you if you tell me what’s wrong.’ 
         
         
        Q. What did she say?  
         
         A. She said that she’d been assaulted and I asked her how, ‘How had you been assaulted?’ and she said ‘Sexually’ and I said ‘Rape?’ and she said ‘Yes.’ 
         
         
        Q. When she said that how did she appear?  
         
         A. Very, yeah, she was on the point of crying. 
         
         
        Q. Was there mention of anyone’s name.  
         
        A. It did came up and David Walsh’s name came up, yes. 
         
         
        Q. Did you give her some advice?  
         
        A. I told her that she should go to the police because it was a very serious offence. 
         
         
        Q. What did she say to you?  
         
        A. She said she didn’t want to cause trouble and I said ‘You’re not causing trouble.’ I said ‘This is really serious’, and I said ‘You have to tell, you have to tell someone, you have to tell you mother, you have to tell the police.’ 
         
         
        Q. Did you notice, apart from the distress and the upset you told us about, did you notice anything physically about her body.  
         
         A. Bruising, no I didn’t at the time, I was actually more concerned with her going to the police and reporting it, I don’t remember taking note of bruises, no. 
         
         
        Q. At some later stage did you become aware of bruises? 
         
         A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. When was that? 
         
         A. Someone else pointed it out to me and then yes, I did. 
         
         
        Q. When was that?  
         
         A. Later that day. 
         
         
        Q. Whereabouts on her person or on body did you see the bruises?  
         
        A. I think they were on her arms and she was wearing, I think she was wearing pants that day so I think I only saw the ones on her arms. 
         
         
        Q. Did she say about anything happening in his car, did she tell you anything about that?  
         
        A. She – I didn’t want to ask her too many questions because I didn’t really want her to have to relive the whole thing. She told me that, I think, this is a while ago, they were in the car and I think they had an argument, something and he snapped, she said he snapped and it was like he was a different person and she said that she became really scared. 
         
        
       
     28    Her evidence was unchallenged in cross-examination. Indeed, she was effectively asked to confirm that there had been a complaint of rape and that she had urged the complainant to tell her mother about it and report it to the police straight away. All that was asked in cross-examination about the detail of the conversation was: 
      
       
        
        Q. What she told you was that they were in the car and something happened and he snapped?  
         
         A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. She didn’t tell you what had happened?  
         
        A. I think she may have but I don’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
       
     29    Somewhat surprisingly, the Crown Prosecutor re-entered the fray in re-examination and the following evidence was given: 
      
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Yes, what was the conversation that she said about the car, what happened in the car?  
         
        A. What was the conversation, she just said that he snapped, I didn’t want to ask her details, I didn’t, I don’t really know a lot about what happened, I just know that he snapped and then that was the beginning of what happened.  
         
         
        Q. What was the conversation about the sexual assault?  
         
        A. I don’t remember, I just know that she said that – she told me what happened and to me the only thing that mattered –  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Q. You tell us what she told you about what happened.  
         
        A. Okay, she said that they were in the car, I think they had, I’m not sure, I think they had an argument, she said he snapped and then he raped her. That’s what it came down to.  
         
          
         
        Q. Did you make a note of that at the time?  
         
        A. What do you mean a note?  
         
         
        Q. Were you asking her questions about this?  
         
        A. No I didn’t, I didn’t. I wasn’t really concerned with the details.”  
         
        
       
     30    The complainant’s version of this conversation had been as follows: 
      
       
        
        Q. On the Monday did you go to work?  
         
        A. Yeah and I couldn’t handle it. 
         
         
        Q. When you say you couldn’t handle it what do you mean?  
         
        A. I couldn’t work. I just kept bursting into tears and running into the bathroom. I couldn’t cope with it. My body was very sore and Martha knew that something was the matter with me and she badgered – basically she talked and talked and talked at me until I told her what happened.  
         
         
        Q. This is Martha Walkowsky is that correct?  
         
         A. It is that's correct.  
         
         
        Q. What did you say to her? Do you remember what the conversation was between yourself and Martha Walkowski? A. She saw a bruise on me I believe and asked what it was. I told her that David attacked me. I told her when also, I believe, that it happened and she then spoke to me about my responsibilities about going to the police, about doing the right thing and her talk convinced me to ring the police.  
         
         
         Q. Did you in fact ring the police?  
         
        A. I called the police after I spoke with her and I spoke to a Constable Christine Powers. Over the talk we had on the phone she convinced me it was not too late, I can go down there, I can do something about this but just to get down there as soon as possible and make a statement. 
        
       
       
        
       
     31    In his summing up the learned trial judge told the jury that they were entitled to use the fact of complaint to Ms Walkowsky to show “some consistency” in the complainant’s conduct and as proof of the thing complained of. The jury were reminded at this stage that the complainant did not complain of rape to her mother or other members of her family.  
     32    In final address, senior counsel for the appellant relied upon the complainant’s evidence that all the complainant told her mother was that the appellant had hit her. He also relied considerably upon Ms Walkowsky’s version of the complaint as destructive of the complainant’s credibility. He argued that Ms Walkowsky emerged with the “clear impression” that the alleged rape happened after the quarrel in the car, and after the appellant “snapped” in the car. Counsel continued: 
      
       
        
        Well, ladies gentlemen, it’s all very well for the Crown to say Martha might have made a mistake or something, but you'll remember that Martha was the person that was pressing and pressing and pressing her to get the story and finally persuaded her to go to the police right away. Would she have persuaded her to go to the police right away if she didn’t even know where the rape took place or what was the nature of the allegation. Is not this story she told to Martha a sort of dry-run allegation which was later changed to what she thought would be a better allegation? 
        
       
       
     33    The learned trial judge adverted to this argument of defence counsel three times in the summing up. 
     34    In this Court, the appellant submitted that the directions given about the evidence of complaint to Ms Walkowsky were erroneous and inadequate. At its highest, the submission was that the evidence was inadmissible as evidence of the fact, with the consequence that the trial judge erred in so instructing the jury. The submission does not depend upon any lack of “freshness” in the sense discussed in Graham v The Queen (1988) 195 CLR 606. After all, the time lapse between the alleged sexual assault and conversation with Ms Walkowsky was only about 55 hours. The nub of the challenge is what is said to be the “significantly different assault” reported to Ms Walkowsky compared to that given by the complainant in her statement to the police and her evidence at trial. In these circumstances, Ms Walkowsky’s evidence is said to have been incapable of demonstrating either the consistency of the complainant’s account or the fact of sexual assault having occurred. Alternatively, the discrepancy is said to have enlivened a need for very careful directions by the trial judge. Reliance is placed upon BRS v The Queen (1994) 191 CLR 275. 
     35    I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     36    The appellant submitted that the jury should not have been told that they could use the conversation with Ms Walkowsky as evidence of the facts complained of. It was submitted that, since Ms Walkowsky gave what was described as an unequivocal and unqualified account of the complaint, being an account which involved an allegation of rape occurring in the car after the appellant had “snapped” there, the trial judge should not have directed the jury as he did. 
     37    The ground of appeal is not and could not be that the evidence of the discussion with Ms Walkowsky was inadmissible. The ultimate question is whether a miscarriage occurred by reason of the directions given to the jury about it. In this context, it is significant, but not determinative that no redirection was ever sought.  
     38    Alternatively, this material is one of the matters at the forefront of the appellant’s challenge to the verdicts on the basis that they were unreasonable, having regard to the evidence. 
     39    Not every discrepancy between evidence of complaint and evidence at trial precludes a jury from being instructed that they can make the conventional dual use of the complaint as going to (1) the consistency of the complainant’s position and (2) the truth of the matters alleged. It must be open for a jury to go to the essence of a complaint and (provided they accept that it was made in its essential terms) to use it in what I have termed the conventional manner. There will be cases where the matter alleged in a complaint is so different in time, place and detail to the substantive case at trial that the judge should hold that it is incapable of being used to support the Crown case. But the present was not such a case, nor was it seen to be by the appellant’s very experienced senior counsel at trial, who sought no redirection. 
     40    The present submission has to be analysed in its context, ie in the context of the issues joined at trial and in the context of the evidence given by the two women about the conversation said to involve the critical complaint. 
     41    As to the issues joined, it was common ground that intercourse occurred at the flat, and there was never a suggestion of intercourse occurring in the car. 
     42    I think it important to observe that the complainant was never asked to give a full or verbatim account of what she said to Ms Walkowsky. It is obvious that the complainant’s version of the conversation given in the passage set out above is the barest of summaries. For understandable tactical reasons cross examining counsel did not probe more deeply. But neither did he challenge the complainant’s account in substance or detail. In these circumstances I would reject as entirely unrealistic the submission that “I told her that David attacked me” was not a summary of an allegation of rape. It was clearly understood to be such by Ms Walkowsky and so it was reported later that day when, at Ms Walkowsky’s prompting, the complainant contacted the police. 
     43    Ms Walkowsky’s version of the conversation has also been set out above. She too was not asked to give a verbatim report of the conversation or conversations she had with the complainant. 
     44    There is much in common between the two truncated accounts, namely the complainant’s visible distress, the complainant’s reluctance to talk about details, a charge of rape, identification of the appellant and implicit indication that the attack occurred in the preceding weekend. 
     45    On the complainant’s version of what happened in the car it is quite understandable that she would have referred to the appellant as having “snapped”. This suggests the possibility that Ms Walkowsky may have elided two separate events.  
     46    Nevertheless, Ms Walkowsky’s impression or memory of what she was told was that the rape occurred in the car, after the appellant “snapped”. In my view this did not preclude the jury from using Ms Walkowsky’s evidence for the dual purpose they were told they could, to the extent that they were satisfied that a complaint of rape against the appellant had been made. They were certainly entitled to reach such satisfaction in view of the absence of any challenge to the existence of the conversation, any probing of the discrepancy between the two versions and the list of matters in common to the two versions which I have already recorded. 
     47    In the directions which the learned judge gave concerning the Walkowsky conversation, the jury were correctly instructed about their entitlement to use “the fact of the complaint to Ms Walkowsky” (emphasis added), a direction that left them with the task of working out the content of that complaint. Indeed, on the matter of present relevance (ie Ms Walkowsky’s attribution of the rape being said to have occurred in the car) the jury were thrice reminded of the discrepancy between the two versions and of the use which senior counsel for the appellant sought to make of that discrepancy. They were also reminded of the Crown’s submission seeking to explain how Ms Walkowsky could have been wrong on this point (see Summing up p16 17/4/00, p11 18/4/00, p14 18/4/00). The third of such directions also concluded with a direction that whether or not the jury used “the fact of the complainant’s complaint in the two ways indicated” was for the jury to decide “because you are the judges of the facts in this trial”. 
     48    I would also accept the Crown submission that this is not a proper case to grant leave in accordance with r4. The appellant’s counsel at trial embraced and sought to use the discrepancy between the two versions of the account, as the jury were repeatedly reminded. There was no application for a redirection, even though the first of the directions complained of occurred on 17 April 2000 and the summing-up continued on 18 April 2000. 
     49    I would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
       
      Unreasonable verdicts 
       
     50    The verdict on each count is challenged on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 establishes that the test is whether the appellate court thinks that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was “open to the jury” to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Commenting on M, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 451:  
      
       
        
        The majority emphasised, however, that it was not the function of the court to answer that question merely by examining the transcript of evidence and the exhibits. Their Honours said that (29): 
         
          
          in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
         
        The majority judges explained (30) the application of the test as follows: 
         
          
          In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal, that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. 
          
         
        
       
      See also  
      Knight v The Queen 
       (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 511, where Brennan and Gaudron JJ said: 
       
        
        The deference which is due to a jury’s verdict, both by reason of the jury’s presence at the trial and by reason of its function as the constitutional arbiter of the facts, precludes an appellate court from simply substituting its view of the evidence for the view formed by the jury under proper direction. It is only when an appellate court, giving the verdict appropriate deference, concludes that it was not open to the jury to convict that it is right to set aside a verdict of guilty. 
         
        
       
     51    The appellant submits that the Court must assess the quality or probative value of the evidence taken as a whole. I agree. Eight matters of significance are raised as to the reliability of the complainant’s evidence upon which the Crown case necessarily depended. 
     52    Before addressing them, it bears recording that the mere fact that the Crown case depended upon the evidence of the complainant does not mean that the jury were incapable of being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, or that this Court should overturn the verdict on the basis alleged.  
     53    A reading of the evidence as a whole does not convey to me that it was not open to the jury in the present case to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the two charges on which he was convicted. 
     54    The complainant was consistent in her evidence. There was no suggestion that it varied from that asserted in her detailed statement to the police given four days after the night in question. 
     55    Furthermore, the Crown case was supported by two bodies of additional material. First is the evidence of bruising and bodily injuries which are entirely consistent with the complainant’s evidence of the particular circumstances of the two assaults charged. The complainant swore that the injuries occurred in those assaults. There was no evidence, indeed no suggestion, to the contrary. Dr Warwick examined the complainant at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on 3 November 1998. He observed bruising on the left wrist, right forearm, left thigh and right breast. Photos were taken. Bruising was also observed by Martha Walkowsky on the Monday and Constable Gregory on the Wednesday of the week in question. The appellant did not challenge this evidence. It is true that the evidence does not point incontrovertibly to guilt on the offences charged, but it does not need to do so before it can have probative effect. While the appellant bore no onus of proof on the matter, he did not at trial suggest any explanation for the injuries, which were real and significant. 
     56    Secondly, there is the evidence of distress and complaint. When the complainant got home in the early hours of Saturday morning she spoke briefly to her mother before going to the bathroom and vomiting and then going to bed. The mother corroborated her distressed state. The complainant swore that she told her mother that the appellant had “hurt” or “hit” her. Her mother’s evidence did not refer to this particular statement, but it is clear that the mother saw visible signs of distress and she was not challenged or questioned further about the discussion. I have already observed that defence counsel was content to embrace the complainant’s version in his address to the jury. The complainant gave a plausible reason for not telling her mother that she had been raped. She felt guilty about having disregarded the promise made to her mother that she not see the appellant again. 
     57    Dr Warwick, and the police officers to whom the complainant spoke at 4.45pm on 2 November and 9.15 on 4 November were given complaints consistent with the complainant’s sworn evidence. They observed her distress, interpreting it to be genuine. The jury were given proper directions about the assessment of this evidence. 
     58    Martha Walkowsky also attested to distress and complaint of rape. I have already explained why, in my view, the jury were entitled to regard that evidence as significant and probative, notwithstanding Ms Walkowsky’s understanding or recollection that she had been told that the rape had occurred in the car. 
     59    I consider the evidence of the ripped pantyhose to have probative value. It figured significantly in final addresses, with the Crown Prosecutor challenging the appellant’s “absolute” certainty that the complainant was wearing white stockings and not dark pantyhose. It is true that the complainant’s credibility was involved in acceptance that the ripped pantyhose that went into evidence was what she was wearing on the night in question. The jury were well positioned to make that assessment and they would have been assisted in it by the complainant’s mother’s evidence identifying the exhibit as having been that which she found with the complainant’s clothes on her bedroom floor and which she put in a garbage bag because of its then ripped state.  
     60    It is appropriate at this stage to address the eight features of the case relied upon by the appellant as bearing adversely upon the reliability of the complainant’s evidence. But before doing so, I reiterate that these need to be placed side by side with the totality of the evidence. Taken individually and as a whole they do not persuade me that the verdicts are unsafe. 
     61    The first point relates to the location of the rape as Ms Walkowsky understood or remembered it to have been reported to her by the complainant. I have already addressed this matter and sought to explain why elision or confusion could easily have occurred in the course of discussion taking place at the work place between a distressed complainant reluctant to go into details and a listener who on her own evidence was not concerned about details. To my mind the important thing is that there was a clear allegation of rape which resulted in the complainant being persuaded to report the charge to the police. It is also relevant in understanding the possible confusion that, on any version of the complainant’s case, the appellant “snapped” in the car. There was never any suggestion of sexual assault having taken place in the car and in those circumstances Ms Walkowsky’s confusion (however arising) does not undermine the general credibility of the Crown case. 
     62    The second and third points relate to discrepancy in detail about two matters of the complainant’s evidence. She said that Ms Walkowsky initiated the discussion at the workplace after having seen bruising, contrary to Ms Walkowsky’s recollection. The complainant also said that she rang the police immediately after her being advised by Ms Walkowsky to do so, whereas the police evidence was that the phone call occurred at about 4.45pm in the afternoon. These strike me as minor discrepancies. It is not clear who was in error as to the bruising. The complainant was wrong about the timing of the phone call to the police. But her errors do not undercut her credibility to any material degree. 
     63    The fourth point concerns the absence of complaint of rape to the complainant’s mother. I have indicated that there was a plausible reason for this which the jury were quite entitled to accept. The fact that the complainant’s mother did not give evidence of having been told that “he hit me” loses most of its significance in light of the complainant’s distressed condition and her conceded unwillingness to go into detail with her mother. The mother may have been mistaken on the point, rather than the complainant. 
     64    The fifth point seeks to draw out a discrepancy between the complainant’s evidence that her relationship with the appellant had broken down well before 30 October and the evidence that e-mails had been exchanged on 26 October 1998 leading up to the decision to have drinks on the Friday evening. The complainant never went beyond asserting that she had decided to break off the relationship. The fact that she would have agreed to go out for drinks at a hotel with other workmates tagging along undermines the Crown case in no way. It was always common ground that the couple went back to the appellant’s flat on the night in question. It was also common ground that the complainant had first intended to go directly home from the hotel by taxi. 
     65    The sixth point has no merit. The complainant always believed that the appellant had stolen her handbag. All that happened was that the complainant’s own evidence was unable to substantiate her allegation because it rose no higher than asserting that she may have left the bag in the appellant’s car or at his house. 
     66    The seventh point was that there was no evidence of any bruising to the head, ear or neck apart from the complainant’s own evidence. Dr Warwick referred to various bruises, but not to these parts of the body. There may not have been visible injuries there. The important matter is that those injuries which were visible were consistent with the Crown case. 
     67    The eighth point carries no weight. It is said that the fact that the complainant agreed to travel with the appellant in his car after the events in the granny flat as she recounted them was surprising. I content myself with saying that it was at least understandable, given that the complainant did not have the money for a taxi ride home and was not offered the fare. She may well have perceived that no further incident would occur in the circumstances. 
     68    I have already stated my conclusion based upon the evidence as a whole. These grounds of appeal fail. 
     69    The appeal should be dismissed. 
     70    WHEALY J: I agree. 
     71    HOWIE J: I agree. 
     72    MASON P: The appeal is dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
         
         
        
       
     1    GROVE J: This is an application by John White seeking leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed upon him in the District Court by his Honour Judge Howie (as he then was). 
      
       
        
       
     2    The applicant is an aboriginal Australian and a person of some note as a manufacturer and player of the didgeridoo. He conducts such activities under his tribal name of Jarwin Jugurmurra. He is aged forty-six years having been born on 26 May 1954.  
      
       
        
       
     3    Following trial before Howie DCJ and a jury, he was convicted on three counts, respectively, of robbery in company, stealing from a person in circumstances of aggravation and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The first charge related to one incident and the second and third charges related to an immediately following incident. All of these occurred on 8 December 1998 in the central business district of Sydney. 
      
       
        
       
     4    The applicant had been busking with his didgeridoo and had encountered a man called Curley, who was tried with him. Curley was apparently an old acquaintance of his. Regrettably, their encounter led to the consumption of a considerable amount of intoxicating liquor. 
      
       
        
       
     5    The busking took place at or near the Sydney Town Hall. Thereafter the applicant, in company with Mr Curley, headed up Park Street towards the Kings Cross area. The first incident occurred when they encountered a young man called Hardy. It was after midnight and Mr Hardy was a young man who had been playing that night in a band in a nearby restaurant. The facts were elaborated in considerable detail by the learned sentencing judge and I do not propose to repeat all that detail, but I would respectfully adopt what he has said. It suffices for present purposes to say that the applicant and Curley approached the young man Hardy and eventually took a small sum of money out of his pocket. 
      
       
        
       
     6    There was no particular violence executed upon Mr Hardy, although his Honour found that there was a threat in terms that the applicant had said to his co-offender, ""Are you going to smash him or will I?"" This did not occur and in fact what did take place is that after taking the money the applicant thanked Mr Hardy and hugged him.  
      
       
        
       
     7    Mr Hardy was actually awaiting the arrival of his brother, who was scheduled to take him home. The brother did arrive and they were observers of what I would describe as the second incident arising out of which the second and third counts in the indictment came to be charged. 
      
       
        
       
     8    The learned sentencing judge found that the first offence, which I have briefly described, was serious but that it was considerably overshadowed by the offences arising out of the second incident. Two young men were sitting near the fence which surrounds Hyde Park. These young men, named Mr Booth and Mr Francis, had been celebrating at a Christmas function. His Honour, who had seen the witnesses at the trial, remarked that Mr Francis was a young man of small stature and very slight physique. He was, so his Honour found, something in the order of half the size of the applicant's co-offender Curley. 
      
       
        
       
     9    The applicant was still carrying his didgeridoo and the offences which became the second and third counts arose out of a struggle in which the four men at various times became involved. One of the incidents was that the applicant struck Mr Booth over the head with his didgeridoo, rendering him momentarily unconscious. Observers saw both the applicant and his co-offender attacking Mr Francis with kicks and punches. The victims required some medical treatment. 
      
       
        
       
     10    In the event, taking into account one month of pre-sentence custody, Howie DCJ sentenced the applicant for the attack upon Mr Hardy to a fixed term of imprisonment for fourteen months commencing upon 15 July 1999 (when he was placed in custody following the trial), and on the second and third counts to concurrent sentences but cumulative upon the fourteen months, which effectively added a further two years minimum together with an additional term of one year and nine months during which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole. 
      
       
        
       
     11    The effect of the encompassing sentences therefore can be seen as a period of three years and two months, or three years and three months if one allows for pre-sentence custody, minimum term, together with the additional term which I have specified. 
      
       
        
       
     12    The applicant has appeared for himself before this court. He has articulated a number of matters orally and earlier, in response to the Registrar's direction, he had sent in written submissions, to which I will shortly turn. It has been explained to the applicant - and I should confirm - that the nature of the jurisdiction of this court is to correct error which has occurred in the court below and not to act as a court of review or a re-sentencing court acting upon findings originally made here. 
      
       
        
       
     13    The applicant has referred to his general background, to the circumstance that he has come from the Northern Territory originally and that he has done a lot of good in and about the areas in which he has lived. These matters were known to the sentencing judge and indeed he made express reference to them. The applicant has also mentioned to us that he is having no problems in gaol in Grafton where he is presently held. He works as a maintenance man and there is no complaint about his activity there.  
      
       
        
       
     14    I should also mention that his de facto wife has had a child born to her since he was committed to prison and he is anxious to be able to join her and to support his family. These are not matters which the court can take into account on a primary basis in order to analyse whether or not there has been error in the court below. 
      
       
        
       
     15    It will be convenient to turn to the various points which the applicant set out in his written submissions and upon which he elaborated early this morning. He pointed out he had been drinking heavily on the evening. This was undoubtedly so and his Honour was well aware that these offences arose out of the applicant and his co-offender being markedly affected by their prior ingestion of intoxicating liquor. The applicant expressed sorrow for what he has done and challenged the remark by his Honour that he had shown no contrition for what he had done. 
      
       
        
       
     16    It is apparent that in his remark to that effect his Honour was referring to the circumstance that the applicant had declined, as was his right, to plead guilty to any of the charges against him and, indeed, as at the time he appeared for sentence, he was still maintaining his innocence. His Honour's reference therefore can clearly be understood as being to the absence of any acknowledgment of his guilt for the crimes upon which he was found guilty by the jury. 
      
       
        
       
     17    The next matter to which the applicant referred was a disagreement with some evidence by Mr Hardy, the victim in relation to the first incident. There was evidence that the applicant was feeling through his pockets. In his written submission he challenged the physical capability of this occurring. The fact of the matter is that Mr Hardy gave evidence to this effect and it was for the jury to consider it and it was not outside the scope of his Honour's fact-finding jurisdiction also to find to that effect. 
      
       
        
       
     18    The applicant made reference to his intoxication and the fact that Mr Hardy apparently had a musical instrument with him and the applicant has said it is not unusual for a musician to obtain a loan overnight from a fellow musician. This was not an occasion of the obtaining a loan but rather the man Hardy was overborne by the two offenders who approached him. 
      
       
        
       
     19    The applicant refers to his unusual action in thanking and hugging Mr Hardy after the offence had been committed. The sentencing judge made express reference to this situation. He observed that there was no actual violence used on Mr Hardy and he accepted that that offence seemed to have arisen on the spur of the moment. However, he found that the applicant's reaction, his suggestion that Mr Hardy should be violently assaulted by Mr Curley in the language that I have already mentioned and then hugging him showed, in his Honour's expressed view, that the applicant had contempt for Mr Hardy's feelings. That was a matter of fact for his Honour to find. It has not been demonstrated to this court that that finding was wrong. 
      
       
        
       
     20    The applicant refers to the relatively small outcome of the robbery and that he obtained about $7. The amount of money is, of course, not the scale by which the seriousness of the offence of robbery is necessarily to be measured. Further, the applicant suggested that he did not believe that the trial judge gave enough consideration to the traditional ways of aboriginal people and the absence of violence in their culture generally.  
      
       
        
       
     21    The answer to that submission can be found in his Honour's recorded remarks on sentence. He gave express consideration to the applicant's aboriginality and said that he would take it into account and, indeed, specified how he would take it into account to the advantage of the applicant. 
      
       
        
       
     22    Next in his written submissions the applicant made reference to some evidence of Mr Hardy following him and his co-offender leading up to the second incident. The references are to matters of fact which were for the trial court to determine. 
      
       
        
       
     23    The striking of Mr Booth with the didgeridoo did not cause any damage to that instrument. Therefore the applicant invites a conclusion that there must not have been a great deal of force involved. Whether that logically follows or not would be a matter for a trial court. What is before this court is a finding by his Honour that there was an attack which involved the use of that instrument to strike Mr Booth. 
      
       
        
       
     24    Following that submission the applicant makes reference to his assertion that he had no recollection of kicking anyone and he points out he was not wearing shoes or anything on his feet at the time. The latter again was something which was a matter of observation. As to the issue of whether or not the applicant was involved in kicking, this is a matter of evidence and, as Howie DCJ observed, there was evidence from eye witnesses which showed that both the applicant and his co-offender were involved in the kicking of Mr Francis.  
      
       
        
       
     25    The applicant observes that the incident between himself and his co-offender and Mr Francis and Mr Booth was a contest between grown males. The significance of this is not immediately apparent. His Honour observed that there was no doubt that, having been importuned by the applicant and his co-offender, Mr Francis was the first to seek to involve himself with Mr Curley. Given the respective differences in their sizes, this may be regarded as a particularly foolish election on his part. Nevertheless, his Honour carefully analysed the facts in the context of the finding of the jury and came to the conclusions which he has expressed concerning the reactions of the applicant and his co-offender and in particular their using their feet to kick a man who was then on the ground. 
      
       
        
       
     26    The applicant himself indicates some understanding of the issues when he says candidly in his submissions that he realises he should not have used excessive force in rebutting Mr Francis' initial attack. 
      
       
        
       
     27    The applicant challenges a finding by his Honour that he was motivated by a criminal intent to rob any person whom he found to be a suitable victim. This is a matter not only set out in the written submissions, but one which he has repeated in the oral submissions before the Court today. The applicant has contended that the learned sentencing judge had no evidence before him of any such intent.  
      
       
        
       
     28    It is true that there was no specific evidence of that intent, but it is also true that being within the mind of an individual, one cannot know what somebody else's intent is unless that person chooses to say so or you can infer it from circumstances. The applicant had not said to anybody what his intent was. His Honour drew the inference from all the surrounding circumstances and for my part I perceive no error in the inference which he drew. 
      
       
        
       
     29    In his written submissions the applicant repeats some matters which I have already touched upon concerning his age and the arrival of his new baby. He also remarks upon his desire to support his family and to work usefully in the community once he is released from prison. 
      
       
        
       
     30    The applicant impressed me today as a man of some sincerity. I cannot but have sympathy for him in his plight. He perceives that after he has served his sentence and his parole period he would be happy to leave the city environment and return to his origins in the Northern Territory. However, my function is to determine whether or not there is error in the court below and whether or not the sentences imposed were in some way outside the range of sound exercise of the discretion which is reposed in the sentencing judge. I cannot find any such error. 
      
       
        
       
     31    In my view, the sentence was well within appropriate range and the remarks on sentence by his Honour do not bespeak any error on his part. Accordingly, I would grant the application for leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal 
      
       
        
       
     32    HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by the presiding judge and with his Honour's reasons. 
      
       
        
       
     33    GROVE J: The orders of the Court therefore are, application for leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

     1    GROVE J :  This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Nader A/DCJ in the East Maitland District Court. The applicant pleaded guilty to a single count of armed robbery with an offensive weapon. 
      
       
        
       
     2    The facts were that the applicant and three other young men discussed acquiring some money, and it was decided that this would be obtained unlawfully from the operators of the Black Hill service station at Muswellbrook. The four young men travelled by car to the vicinity of that business, but in the event only the applicant entered the premises where he brandished a knife and obtained a few hundred dollars from the operators. The persons present in the service station at the time were Mrs Polyxeni Kyriakopoulos and her son. When the applicant egressed the service station with his loot he discovered that the other three had abandoned him and it was necessary for him to flee on foot. He was able to escape pursuers. 
      
       
        
       
     3    Somewhat surprisingly, I would comment, he nevertheless continued to associate with the other three, whom he caught up with at some premises in Muswellbrook where there was a division of the stolen money. This happened in May 1997. The applicant used his share of the money to relieve the pressure of current debt. He was separated from his de facto wife with whom he had two children. I might mention that he was but twenty years of age at the time. He was not approached by police until, as a result of inquiries, he was interviewed on 7 August 1998. 
      
       
        
       
     4    It suffices for present purposes to observe that he was candid with police and he frankly not only confessed his own involvement but nominated those who were apparently his co-offenders. I say apparently, because although the applicant was charged and convicted as I have mentioned, the other three were placed before a court and released upon recognizance after pleading guilty to concealing a serious offence. Two of the co-offenders were twins, and we are informed that they also received a sentence of community service for an unrelated offence. The learned sentencing judge imposed upon the applicant a total sentence of four years imprisonment, which he divided into minimum and additional terms of two years each respectively. 
      
       
        
       
     5    The matter can be dealt with relatively briefly thanks to the helpful and candid approach of the learned Crown Prosecutor, who observed that there was a complete omission by the sentencing judge to refer to the assistance offered and given by the applicant to law enforcement authorities, and it was conceded that he was entitled to some reduction of sentence, as it was put, “in order to reward him for assisting the authorities”. Whilst that is not quite the way I would express it, the sentiment is appropriate. 
      
       
        
       
     6    The court, having reached the situation that it is conceded that it was erroneous for his Honour to fail to have regard to that matter, should proceed to resentence. For that purpose we have received up-to-date information in the form of affidavits from the applicant and from his stepfather. The applicant is presently performing well as a prisoner at the Cessnock Correctional Centre, and it can be observed that he has the support of his family which will continue not only during his incarceration but upon his release. We have been informed that the separation between the applicant and his de facto has in a sense now concluded. They are of course separated whilst he is in prison, but she has moved to Cessnock and he is in contact with her and their two children. The whole of the circumstances should be taken to be promising. 
      
       
        
       
     7    The value of the information he gave can be assessed from the annexure to the affidavit of his solicitor, Ms Clare Joanne Farnan, which is before the court. It is not necessary for me to specify exactly the content of the information, but it can be observed that the participation of the other offenders would not be known to the extent that it was nor, indeed, would two of them be identified but for the candour of the applicant on the occasion that he was spoken to first by police. It has been pointed out that the proceedings were protracted in the sense that not only was it over a year before he was spoken to by police, but another year passed before he was brought before the court and, indeed, longer than a year before he was actually sentenced. 
      
       
        
       
     8    The applicant pleaded guilty to the offence, and whilst it may be taken that the learned sentencing judge took into account the value of the plea of guilty, he omitted, as I have said, to take into account the assistance given. This court should take into account both those matters, together with the other subjective matters which were both before the court below and which have been supplemented in the additional material before this court. 
      
       
        
       
     9    Since the case of Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 it is appropriate to give some indication of the evaluation of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty. In this particular case I do not think it necessary to engage in mathematical extrapolations and the evaluation will be evident in the order which I propose, which is as follows, that the application for leave to appeal be granted and the appeal be allowed, that the sentence in the court below be quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced as follows, to imprisonment for two years and six months to date from 2 December 1999 with a non-parole period specified of one year and four months to commence also on 2 December 1999 and to expire on 1 April 2001. Given the length of sentence, the court orders that the applicant be released to parole on 1 April 2001. 
      
       
        
       
     10    SIMPSON J: I agree. 
      
       
        
       
     11    GROVE J: The orders of the court will be therefore as I have proposed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
       
     1    GROVE J: David Armanios seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed upon him at the Campbelltown District Court by his Honour Acting Judge Ford. The applicant appeared before his Honour for sentence in respect of crimes which were specified in two indictments, together with a Form 1 which contained two further offences. Although there were slight differences, the essential offences were all for armed robbery or robbery in company and allied offences. His Honour imposed a series of sentences, the effect of the encompassing sentence amounting to a total of eight years with a minimum term component of some six years imprisonment. 
      
       
        
       
     2    It is not necessary for the purposes of this appeal to relate all the facts and circumstances of the offences. They followed more or less the same pattern. The victim in each case was a retail trader of one sort or another. The crimes were inspired by a drug habit which the applicant needed to feed. He is a young man aged about twenty-four now. He was born on 29 May 1976. 
      
       
        
       
     3    There is one unusual procedural circumstance to which reference might be made, and it is this. The first of the total of six offences comprised in the indictment and the Form 1 occurred in 1998. The other offences occurred much later. He was on bail when the second group of offences took place. What had happened is that the applicant appeared before the District Court and pleaded guilty to the first offence, that is, the one on the first indictment committed on 24 June 1998. Although that was a charge of robbery in company, the learned presiding judge determined that the matter appeared appropriate for referral to the Drug Court, although he had noted the limitations upon the availability of the scheme under the appropriate statute, particularly the limitation concerning crimes which involved violent conduct. 
      
       
        
       
     4    It appeared that the applicant was encouraged by this reference and there was some evidence before Ford A/DCJ that he showed some promise shortly after the referral to the drug court. However, in the event he was refused participation in the scheme under the appropriate statute, and later there was the outbreak of the further offences to which I have made reference. I do not see his disappointment as a matter of excuse, but it is a matter that can be taken into account as one of the overall circumstances touching the applicant. 
      
       
        
       
     5    Leaving to one side a complaint concerning the division of the total term into minimum and additional elements, counsel for the appellant in this court has relied upon three bases of attack to the sentence below. These can shortly be described as the absence of reference by his Honour in his remarks as to how he took into account the pleas of guilty of the applicant; second, the absence of reference to the circumstance that it appeared that it was likely that the applicant would spend his time in custody in protection and thereby serving his sentence in more onerous conditions than usually; and, third, it was claimed that he was suffering from an intellectual disability of such a nature as it would make him an unsuitable vehicle for the significant manifestation of any element of general deterrence. 
      
       
        
       
     6    Senior Counsel for the crown has very candidly indicated to the court in relation to the first two matters, that is to say the absence to reference as to how the plea of guilty was taken into account and the absence of reference to protection, that it would have been better if his Honour had exposed the processes of his reasoning and indicated how these matters were taken into account. For my part, the absence accumulates into what this court should determine is an error in the sentencing process thus involving this court exercising its jurisdiction and coming to the issue of resentence. 
      
       
        
       
     7    Before doing so, however, I should make reference to the third ground pursued on behalf of the appellant, the claim that the applicant was intellectually handicapped. There was evidence that at one time whilst the applicant was on a methadone programme his test results indicated that he was in the bottom two per cent of the population so far as intellectual functioning was concerned. There are other indications that this may not be a permanent and accurate estimate. For my part I am unable to reach any final conclusion on the matter, but it seems to me that proper guidance can be obtained by reference to seeing how the applicant can conduct himself. This is manifest in his ability to respond appropriately to questioning by police and, in particular, to see to his own interests during such interviews. I am unpersuaded that the applicant falls into that category of person as described in cases such as the R v Letteri unreported CCA 18 March 1992 and R v Scognamiglio 56 A Crim R 81. Nevertheless, his relatively low position in the overall average of the population so far as intellectual ability is concerned is a matter which, combined with his youth and the promise which he showed after the reference to the drug court, can be used in determining the length of time during which the applicant should be in prison before being eligible for parole. 
      
       
        
       
     8    Since this matter was dealt with at Campbelltown District Court this court has delivered judgment in R v Thomson & Anor  (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 indicating that it is appropriate in some such circumstances not only that a plea of guilty be recognised but there be an indication by a sentencing court as to how at least the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty has been taken into account. I mention of course that at the time s 439 of the Crimes Act was in operation and that only required his Honour to state reasons in the event that he was not granting any discount on account of the pleas of guilty. It cannot, in my view, be effectively argued that his Honour was unaware that pleas of guilty had been entered. Indeed, it is said in the opening remarks of the sentencing proceedings. Nevertheless, as I have said, it would have been appropriate for there to be some indication as to how that was taken into account. 
      
       
        
       
     9    As I have already said, I believe that this court should allow the appeal and proceed to resentence. In so doing I would regard the encompassing term of eight years as appropriate for all six offences, but I would make a reduction in the overall term of about 25 per cent in order to evaluate the pleas of guilty that were made. The pleas seemed to have been both timely and useful in all the circumstances. I would also conclude that given the youth of the offender, such intellectual handicap as he has and the promise which at least on one occasion he showed, that it is appropriate that his non-parole period should be less than three-quarters of the overall term which I would assess for the majority of offences at six years. I would also note and accept the affidavit material showing that the applicant remains in the more onerous form of custody on protection and that it is predictable that he will substantially remain in that form of custody. 
      
       
        
       
     10    I am conscious that I am required on resentence to pay heed to the authority of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen 1998 194 CLR 610. This is always difficult to apply in circumstances such as this. I have mentioned that there are two indictments, together with matters to be taken into account. Nevertheless, I am certain that in the particular circumstances of this case the important sentence will be the overall encompassing imposition. 
      
       
        
       
     11    Accordingly, I would propose that the following orders be made. That the application for leave to appeal be granted, the appeal be allowed and the sentences below quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentences be imposed. On the first indictment the applicant be sentenced to four years imprisonment to date from 9 May 1999. That sentence is to take into account two matters on the Form 1. I do not specify a non-parole period by reason of the further sentences which I am about to impose on the second indictment. 
      
       
        
       
     12    On the second indictment on each of counts 1, 2 and 3 I would sentence the applicant to six years imprisonment to date from 9 May 1999. I would specify a non-parole period of four years, also dating from 9 May 1999, and therefore indicate that the applicant is eligible for parole on and from 8 May 2003. I note that the non-parole period is but two-thirds of the full term of the encompassing sentence. On this resentence I have varied the statutory ratio for the reasons I have already given. 
      
       
        
       
     13    SIMPSON J: I agree. 
      
       
        
       
     14    GROVE J: The orders of the court therefore will be as I have proposed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
       
     1    GILES JA: On 13 September 1999 the appellant was indicted in the District Court on a charge of manslaughter. He pleaded not guilty. On 17 September 1999 the jury returned with a verdict of guilty. On 5 November 1999 the appellant was sentenced to penal servitude for three years to be served by way of periodic detention commencing on 27 November 1999, with a minimum term of eighteen months and an additional term of eighteen months.  
      
       
        
       
     2    The appellant appealed against the conviction and sentence. Only the appeal against conviction has been maintained, and only on the stated ground that it was not on the whole of the evidence open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. 
      
       
        
       
     3    The charge in the indictment was that on 9 March 1997 at Marrickville in New South Wales the appellant did feloniously slay Chau Thai Le. Mr Le died when a shotgun held by the appellant discharged into his chest and he was fatally wounded. There is manslaughter where the accused causes the death of a person by criminal negligence, and the Crown case was left to the jury on that basis. 
      
       
        
       
     4    The appellant and one Thai Ha Nguyen visited Mr Le on the night of 8 March 1997. Mr Le lived in Marrickville with his parents and sister. In Mr Le's room the three men drank beer, smoked heroin and took Rohypnol. A pump action shotgun was produced, it seems a shotgun owned by Mr Le which the appellant had been shown some days earlier, and for about twenty minutes to half an hour they played with the pump action. Mr Le showed the other two how the shotgun was loaded and how the safety slide or switch operated. At one stage Mr Le pointed the shotgun at Mr Nguyen's head and Mr Nguyen pushed it away. Mr Nguyen and the appellant told Mr Le not to ""muck around with it"". The appellant then put the shotgun away in a cupboard in the room. 
      
       
        
       
     5    In the early hours of the morning of 9 March 1997 the three men went to McDonalds to get something to eat, and later Mr Le and the appellant went out again to get more beer. One or more of them slept for some period or periods. At 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning Mr Le showed Mr Nguyen some cartridges and how to load the shotgun without actually loading it. The cartridges were put into a drawer in the cupboard. The appellant was with them at this time. 
      
       
        
       
     6    At about 8 o'clock in the morning there occurred the discharge which caused the death of Mr Le. The evidence came from Mr Nguyen, from police officers who then attended the scene, and from the videos of a walk-through interview and an ERISP interview later conducted by the police with the appellant. 
      
       
        
       
     7    Mr Nguyen was asleep. He woke to what he thought was a firecracker. Mr Le fell on him and he saw a wound under Mr Le's left armpit. The police and ambulance were called, and Mr Nguyen and the appellant sought to staunch the flow of blood from the wound and resuscitate Mr Le, but he was dead. Mr Nguyen saw the appellant put the shotgun back in the cupboard. 
      
       
        
       
     8    After the police arrived the appellant took the shotgun from the cupboard and handed it to one of the police, saying ""here's the gun, man"". He was asked what happened, and he said ""I was mucking around with it and it went boom"" and that Mr Le was hit in the chest. He said of Mr Nguyen, ""Don't get him, he did nothing, he was sleeping"". 
      
       
        
       
     9    At a later time the walk-through interview was conducted and later again the ERISP interview. What I now refer to in the interviews comes from the transcript provided to the jury as an aide memoire, with an addition brought out in oral evidence to fill one of the gaps in the transcript of the walk-through interview, it having gaps through difficulty with transcription. It was not suggested that seeing the videos would materially add to what appeared in the transcripts. 
      
       
        
       
     10    The appellant's initial description in the walk-through interview of what happened was -: 
      
       
        
         
          
          ""V.3 We were mucking around -- 
           
           
          V.2 I beg your pardon? 
           
           
          V.3 We were mucking around. 
           
           
          V.2 You were mucking around? 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah, go to the cupboard ... get a gun out, like, you know, unloaded -- 
           
           
          V.2 Unloaded? 
           
           
          V.3 It was unloaded, no bullet in there. 
           
           
          V.2 Right, OK. 
           
           
          V.3 And, and you muck around and say, and you ... 'Don't get smart ... ', I said that, and then we got some bullet in here. 
           
           
          V.2 Right. 
           
           
          V.3 Took ... out, took one out ... took one in, put it in, load up, load it up, and put it on safety -- 
           
           
          V.2 Put it on safety, is that correct? 
           
           
          V.3 Unsafety. 
           
           
          V.2 Unsafety? 
           
           
          V.3 ... and then, like, I pretend, I pretend to, like, you know, I, I don't intend to shoot him, and I, I click ... Back to safety, and then I click it, and then, you know, I, and I pout it unsafety again, and ... to scared him again, and then it put on safety again, I click it again, and ... somehow, somehow I accidentally put it on unsafety, and then, boom.""

          V.2 So you knew a gun was in there? 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah.

          V.3 Yeah, just, like, a couple of days ago ... 
           
           
          V.2 A couple of days ago, OK. So you've opened this, this cupboard was previously closed, was it? 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah, it's always closed. 
           
           
          V.2 I'll close it now. It's been fingerprinted so --

          V.3 Head. 
           
           
          V.2 You put it against his head? 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah, and -- 
           
           
          V.2 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.3 -- then ... like, pretend, and then I put it on, put it on safety again, and then click, you know, I pull the trigger -- 
           
           
          V.2 And, what, it just went click when you pull the trigger then? 
           
           
          V.3 I pull the trigger, no, no, that's ... it was on safety -- 
           
           
          V.2 Yea. 
           
           
          V.3 -- I did it about two, two, two, three times. 
           
           
          V.2 All right. So you had -- 
           
           
          V.2 And then the, the last time that, I didn't realist it was on, on, it was, like -- 
           
           
          V.2 It wasn't on safety, is that -- 
           
           
          V.3 It wasn't on safety, yeah. And then I just, I just, like, it wasn't on against his head, I just, like, you know, walk towards him like this, book ... 
           
           
          V.2 Right. So -- 
           
           
          V.3 'Cause most, most of the time I stick it in his head. 
           
           
          V.2 Right. 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 And that's when you trying clicking that, and what have you, several times you clicked it with the safety on? 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah, safety on. 
           
           
          V.2 But this time you actually pulled the trigger and it went off? 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah, it went and I didn't know it was on unsafety.""

          ""V.2 OK then. Just, you mentioned before that you, you knew where the gun was -- 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah.

          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 Do you know much about rifles or guns? 
           
           
          V.3 Not really, until, like, you know, he showed me a couple of times and he showed me how to load it, and things like that, so ... -- 
           
           
          V.2 OK. 
           
           
          V.3 -- I know quite a bit then. 
           
           
          V.2 Yeah. Have you, you knew that, you mentioned that you put the safety on, and pulled the trigger sometimes? 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 Sometimes you took the safety off but you didn't pull the trigger? 
           
           
          V.3 No, yes, yes, he knows that I'm, I'm just, like mucking around with him, you know -- 
           
           
          V.2 OK. 
           
           
          V.3 -- He's laughing ... he said, 'Come on, shoot me, shoot me' ... you know ... and, and, all right, I, I put a safety on, click ... pull the trigger -- 
           
           
          V.2 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.3 -- you know, a couple of times ... it on, like the last time, I don't know somehow the safety wasn't on, and then I just walk close to him, like this, boom. 
           
           
          V.2 OK. But you, had, have you, since the first time you saw the, the, the rifle, or the shotgun -- 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 - and that was about, I think you said a couple of weeks ago? 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah, about, a few days ago, about a week ago -- 
           
           
          V.2 Right. 
           
           
          V.3 -- yeah, a couple of days ago -- 
           
           
          V.2 A couple of days ago, all right-- 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 -- sorry, a couple of days ago. 
           
           
          V.3 Couple of days ago, a week ago or something like that ... 
           
           
          V.2 OK. Or maybe a week ago? 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 Since you first saw the shotgun -- 
           
           
          V.3 -- have you played with it before like that? Have you -- 
           
           
          V.3 No, no, no, never, never. 
           
           
          v.2 Never? That's the first time you've actually put a gun, well, played with it, and put the safety on and off and all that? 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah, yeah ... The only time I played with it is just, like, no bullet, just, like, you know. ... you know, like -- 
           
           
          V.2 You did do that before without any bullets? 
           
           
          V.3 There were no bullet, and you pump it, and you pump it up and ... 
           
           
          V.2 When did you do that? 
           
           
          V.3 It's like, you know, when he first showed me. 
           
           
          V.2 When he first, OK. 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 So you did actually use it and pump it and -- 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 -- and pull the trigger, but on those, that occasion, there wasn't any bullets in it? 
           
           
          v.3 No bullet, yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 Did he, was there bullets here? 
           
           
          V.3 Were there bullets there? 
           
           
          V.2 Yea. I mean, on that occasion you're talking about -- 
           
           
          V.3 Well, I'm, I'm not sure if the bullets here ... and I know is the gun is there -- 
           
           
          V.2 OK. 
           
           
          V.3 -- but the last couple of days he show me the bullets. 
           
           
          V.2 OK. All right. So -- 
           
           
          V.3 ... 
           
           
          V.2 All right, then. How many bullets did you actually put in the shotgun? 
           
           
          V.3 One. There's only three. See, there's only two left ... 
           
           
          V.2 So, OK. Just leave them on top of that thing there. 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 So when you were first shown those cartridges, the shotgun cartridge -- 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 -- a couple of days ago -- 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 -- there were three? 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 And, and did he tell you that's all he had? 
           
           
          V.3 Well -- 
           
           
          V.2 That's all you saw? 
           
           
          V.3 -- he, he, he didn't say ... that's all he's got, he just show me what -- 
           
           
          V.2 Right. OK. He showed you those and there was three of them? 
           
           
          v.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          v.2 And when you went to that drawer this morning, you saw that there were three? 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 And you took one? 
           
           
          V.3 I took one, yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 And put it in the shotgun. 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 And cocked it? 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 OK. and then you went through what you said before -- 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah. 
           
           
          V.2 You ... OK. Until, unfortunately it went off and fatally injured your -- 
           
           
          V.3 ... 
           
           
          V.2 -- friend? 
           
           
          V.3 Yeah.""  
           
          
         
        
        
       
     13    In the ERISP interview the appellant's description of what happened was as follows - 
      
       
        
         
          
          ""A. Yeah. Well, well, we were drinking and we were talking and mucking around and then, you know, then I was, I was, I, I were, you know, I was joking to him, said, Oh, don't get smart, you know, cunt, you know, I, I'll pull the pump, pump, pump you all right, you know. And, you know, and he said, he said, Go ahead then, yeah -- 
           
           
          ... 
           
           
          Q.53 So you're mucking about and joking? 
           
           
          A. Yeah. 
           
           
          Q.54 All right. 
           
           
          A. And then I, I said to him, Don't be a smart cunt or I'll pull the pump out, I'll pump you, but that's normally like, you know, that's what, what we do anyway here, sometimes ... 
           
           
          Q.55 OK.  
           
           
          A. And, and then, and he say, he say, Go ahead then. And I took, took the, you know, the pump out and, you know, I, I, I grabbed one bullet, I put it in, I load it up but I put on the safety and I pulled the trigger and he laughed and I say, All right. I said, All right, I'll, I'll put it on, on safety, and then, and then I pretend, you know, and then I put it on, you know, I, the clip back on safety again and it click again, I pull the trigger again and then, you know, and then he laughed again and then I don't, I don't, I don't know how many times I did it, about three, just three time maximum and then the last time that, you know, and then suddenly I, you know, I somehow I, I forgot to put it on safety and he was, you know sitting there reciting a psalm, the other guy was sleeping and then I pulled the trigger and then got him on the side in the ribs.""  
           
          
         
        
        
       
     14    Later in the interview the appellant described how he took the shotgun out of the cupboard and the cartridge, which he called a bullet, out of the drawer, and said this - 
      
       
        
         
          
          ""A. I, I, I put it in the gun, the pump action, and I loaded it up, but on safety. 
           
           
          Q.93 How did you load it up? 
           
           
          A. Well, he, he, he show me before, you know. 
           
           
          Q.94 Right. 
           
           
          A. ... click it. 
           
           
          Q.95 So you're indicating that you actually pumped it? 
           
           
          A. Yeah, pumped it. 
           
           
          Q.96 And that puts it up into the chamber, does it? 
           
           
          A. Into the chamber, yeah. 
           
           
          Q.97 OK. 
           
           
          A. But it's on safety, you know. 
           
           
          Q.98 And it had the safety on. 
           
           
          A. Yeah. 
           
           
          Q.99 OK. 
           
           
          A. Yeah. 
           
           
          Q.100 All right. What happened then?  
           
           
          A. And then I put it next to his face but not like right close but like, oh, half a metre away and he's a very smart cunt, you know, and I, I blow your head away, you know. And then, then he laughed, you know, Go, go blow my head away. And I, I pulled the trigger and then he laughed and he knows he was, you know, I, I wouldn't shoot him, you know. And then, O yeah, I say, O yeah, really. I put it back to safety and then I, like, you know, try to scare him, you know and he, Pull it, you know, and then I did about two or three times. 
           
           
          Q.101 That's with the safety on? 
           
           
          A. Yeah, with the safety on. 
           
           
          Q.102 OK. 
           
           
          A. And then the last time I, I dunno how, I dunno how, I forgot to put the safety on and he goes, like, Well, it wasn't on his face, I, I put it down a bit, somehow my, my finger pull the trigger and shot him right near the ribs, under his armpit.""  
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
       
     15    Expert evidence was given in relation to the shotgun. It had a safety slide or switch such that when the safety was fully forward the shotgun would not discharge when the trigger was pulled and when the safety was fully back the shotgun would discharge when the trigger was pulled. The point of change between not discharging and discharging was approximately at the middle of the travel of the slide or switch. A red dot warned that pulling the trigger would discharge the shotgun, and the point of change occurred when about eighty per cent of the red dot was exposed. Further, when the safety slide or switch was at the approximately mid point of its travel from fully forward to fully back but not quite to the point of change, pressure on the trigger could itself cause the safety slide or switch to move slightly, so that the first pressure the first few pressures on the trigger would not bring discharge of the shotgun but a second or later pressure on the trigger would do so. This was not a defect in the operation of the shotgun; it was the way it was designed to operate. 
      
       
        
       
     16    According to the expert evidence there was a spring loaded detent ball, that is, a ball bearing held in place under spring tension which engaged in holes in the detent plate and held the safety slide or switch firmly in either the rearward or forward position, and when it was moved to the rear the detent ball failed to engage the hole in the detent plate. This meant that the safety slide or switch was easier to push forward than normal. Although not the subject of evidence at the trial, it was agreed in the appeal that it also meant that a click would not be heard when the safety slide or switch was moved to the rear to the position where the detent ball should have engaged, but a click would be heard when it was moved forward and engaged. 
      
       
        
       
     17    It was not in dispute in the conduct of the trial that Mr Le had died and that his death was caused by the act of the appellant. The question was one of criminal negligence. In Nydam v The Queen (1977) VR 430 at 445 it was said that - 
      
       
        
         
          
          ""In order to establish manslaughter by criminal negligence it is sufficient if the prosecution shows that the act which caused the death was done by the accused consciously and voluntarily without any intention of causing death or grievous bodily harm but in circumstances which involved such a great falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable man would have exercised and which involved such a high risk that death or grievous bodily harm would follow that the doing of the act merited criminal punishment"".  
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
       
     18    The reference to a high risk that death or grievous bodily harm would follow was taken up in the High Court in Wilson v The Queen (1992) 174 CLR 313 at 333. The directions to the jury were in accordance with this test, and no objection was taken at the trial or on appeal to those or any other directions. 
      
       
        
       
     19    The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. At the trial the appellant's solicitor referred to the explanations given in the walk-through interview and the ERISP interview, and put to the jury that there was a dreadful game which went wrong but that there was not criminal negligence. He said that, unknown to the appellant, the shotgun had the characteristic that it would discharge when the safety was partly off or only partly on, and that the explanation for what happened was that the appellant thought he had put the shotgun on safety but he had not fully done so, so that this characteristic caused it to discharge when he pulled the trigger. 
      
       
        
       
     20    The submissions on appeal took a similar approach. The appellant submitted that there was a miscarriage of justice, not because this was a case in which the evidence could be said to lack credibility in the manner described in the well-known passage in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494, but because the verdict was unsafe or unsatisfactory for reasons lying outside the formula requiring that it not be unreasonable or incapable of being supported having regard to the evidence. He referred to M v The Queen at 492-3, and submitted in accordance with what was there said that the question to be asked was whether upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty.  
      
       
        
       
     21    The evidence from Mr Nguyen and the police officers was not challenged, and what appeared from the interviews was available to the jury without any qualification by reason of evidence from the appellant. In my opinion it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant's act constituted criminal negligence.  
      
       
        
       
     22    The appellant was clearly enough aware of the danger of pointing a loaded weapon at someone. He was not particularly familiar with the shotgun but knew of the operation of the safety slide or switch and employed the safety slide or switch. He loaded the shotgun and moved the safety on and off as he tried to scare Mr Le. He squeezed the trigger several times. This was not a case in which a loaded firearm was pointed at someone with the catch on safety, but a case in which there was movement of the safety on and off with the inevitable possibility in the circumstances as described in the evidence that it would not be properly moved to a position in which the shotgun would not discharge. If the appellant did not take proper care to ensure that the shotgun did not discharge the risk to Mr Le was extreme; if the shotgun did discharge Mr Le would almost certainly be killed. The need for care was obvious to a person in the appellant's position, and could hardly have been higher because it would have been plain to any reasonable person in his position that at some point in the operation of the safety slide or switch it would pass from safety to unsafety and that if the safety slide or switch were to be moved on and off in conjunction with pulling the trigger the utmost attention was necessary to ensuring that the safety was properly engaged when the trigger was pulled. That the jury should have concluded with satisfaction to the criminal standard that the appellant had failed to take that care was, in my view, quite unremarkable. 
      
       
        
       
     23    In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       
     24    JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of the presiding Judge and the order proposed by his Honour. 
      
       
        
       
     25    HULME J: The deliberate pointing of a loaded and cocked shotgun at someone and the pulling of the trigger is as gross an example of criminal negligence as I can imagine. Had the jury not reached the conclusion that they did, I would have regarded their decision as perverse.  
      
       
        
       
     26    When those actions are performed by someone who has spent the night participating in alcohol, smoking heroin and eating Rohypnol tablets, all of which activities are calculated not to improve the fine senses, the matter becomes worse. 
      
       
        
       
     27    I agree with the orders proposed by the presiding Judge and with his reasons.28    GILES JA: The order will be that the appeal is dismissed.

      REGINA v Toby William KING 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
       
     1    SHELLER JA: On 17 August 2000 the respondent, Toby William King, pleaded guilty to a charge of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm; s52A(4) of the Crimes Act 1900. The circumstance of aggravation was the presence in the respondent’s blood of the prescribed concentration of alcohol. The maximum penalty for this offence is eleven years imprisonment. 
      
       
     2    The respondent came up for sentence before Moore DCJ on 31 August 2000. His Honour sentenced the respondent to two years imprisonment, to be served by way of periodic detention. On 3 October 2000 the Crown appealed against the sentence on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate. The sentencing Judge also imposed a period of disqualification of driving licence of three years from 2 November 1998. 
      
       
     3    Judge Moore stated the facts as follows. The respondent was driving his station sedan south across the Martin Bridge at Taree at about fifty kilometres per hour. The speed limit in the area was sixty kilometres per hour. The traffic was described as medium. Martin Bridge is a narrow bridge. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “That is an indication that there is a risk of danger in driving across the bridge if there is any inattention because of its narrowness and the proximity of oncoming traffic.” 
         
        
       
     4    As he drove across the bridge, the respondent dropped a lighted cigarette onto the floor. He bent down to pick it up. In consequence, his eyes went below the level of his dashboard. The passenger side wheels hit the kerb. That caused the car to veer to its right and collide head-on with a car coming in the opposite direction. The passenger in that oncoming car suffered severe injuries, which will have a lasting effect upon her. The driver of the oncoming car was also injured, but to a lesser extent. 
      
       
     5    This incident occurred at about 10.20 am on Monday 2 November 1998. At 11.25 am on that morning a blood alcohol reading of the respondent showed .273. At 3.45pm on that afternoon a reading showed .196. Both readings are well in the high range of the prescribed concentration of alcohol. 
      
       
     6    The applicant had consumed a large amount of alcoholic liquor on the Sunday, the day before these events. He went to work that night on the dog shift; that is, from midnight to 8 o’clock on the Monday morning. He then had four more drinks of full strength alcohol (two stubbies and two middies) before setting off from his place of work for his home. It was on that journey that the collision occurred. The estimated distance between the point of departure and his home was about fifteen kilometres. 
      
       
     7    In his remarks on sentence, Judge Moore described the respondent’s driving as the type of driving referred to in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209, the guideline case for crimes of this nature, as momentary inattention or misjudgment. His Honour went on to say: 
      
       
        
         
         “Of course that means such inattention or misjudgment as is dangerous and it was clearly dangerous on a bridge of the dimensions of the Martin Bridge.” 
         
        
        
       His Honour said: 
        
         
         “It is also clear that the alcohol which was in his bloodstream - and he must have been clearly aware that whatever the reading might have been it was a substantial amount - was such as would contribute to his misjudgment, in turn leading to the motor vehicle colliding with the kerb and the immediate consequence of a collision with Miss Rudman's oncoming car.” 
         
        
       
     8    The sentencing Judge went on to state background and subjective matters. The respondent was born on 3 August 1964 and was aged thirty-four years at the time of the accident and thirty-six at the date of sentencing. He had a good life history. However, he had two previous convictions for drink driving, one in 1988 and one in 1989. On both occasions the alcohol reading was in the mid range. Thereafter he had had no further convictions for drink driving offences. Judge Moore described that “as a good indication that he has reformed his driving in the meantime and there were exceptional circumstances which applied to his driving on this occasion.” 
      
       
     9    His Honour referred to a report by a registered nurse, Mr Berry, who spoke of a range of abnormal stresses in the respondent’s life at the time. Mr Berry had examined those stresses, which his Honour said in summary: 
      
       
        
         
         “ ... led to [the respondent's] state of mind at the time that he had no purpose in life. He was not being permitted to be a proper father to his children and his life was empty.” 
         
        
        
       Mr Berry’s assessment was that the respondent’s history did not give an indication of a person who regularly abused alcohol or who was alcohol dependent.  
        
       
     10    On 1 September 1999 the respondent had submitted himself to a two-week course at Kirkwood House which dealt with problem drinking. That was an intensive course and it was undertaken on a voluntary basis. The respondent had tendered excellent references, both direct and mentioned in the professional reports, about his employment history. He was highly regarded in his present job. His employer gave evidence that he was an exceptionally hard worker. For much of his life he had worked at two jobs. 
      
       
     11    Judge Moore said there was a great volume of evidence which indicated that the respondent had a deep remorse for the injury caused to his victims and that he felt a responsibility to make sure that nothing like this ever happened again. 
      
       
     12    The sentencing Judge observed that the fact that the respondent was a young man who had never had any previous convictions involving gaol did not count as much in crimes of the nature here in question where so frequently the offenders are young persons. He observed that the respondent had then been estranged for some years from his wife and had two children.  
      
       
     13    The sentencing Judge then made reference to the principles expressed in Jurisic. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “As was said in the leading judgment of Spigelman CJ in that matter, a non-custodial sentence for offences of this nature should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or misjudgment. That statement, of course, does not mean in all cases where there is a momentary inattention or misjudgment there will not be a full-time custodial sentence. In view of the features of this case, I thought it necessary to give the matter very careful consideration. It is a matter where my mind has wavered, I must also frankly admit, on both sides of the watershed.” 
         
        
       
     14    His Honour referred to R v Tomson [1999] NSWCCA 308 and R v Pelho (unreported) NSWCCA 1 August 1997. His Honour expressed his conclusions as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Cases which are at the watershed are ones which are frequently difficult of decision and this case is one of those. I have come to the view that whilst there must be a sentence of imprisonment, it should be one served by way of periodic detention. It will impose particular hardship on Mr King because of the distance he has to travel each weekend to the Periodic Detention Centre at Tomago, but nevertheless he has been found fit by the Probation and Parole Service to perform that sentence.” 
         
        
       
     15    On this appeal the Crown submitted that, given the grave nature of the offence and the serious aggravating features, the sentence imposed was inadequate and so inadequate as to imply error. The point was made that in imposing the periodic detention sentence his Honour failed to comply with what has been called the two-stage process: see R v Wegener [1999] NSWCCA 405. It is not necessary to deal further with that part of the appeal. 
      
       
     16    The Crown submitted that his Honour erred in treating this case as one of momentary inattention or misjudgment. A number of cases were referred to, in particular R v Guilfoyle (1973) 57 Cr AppR 549, a passage from which was quoted in the Chief Justice's decision in Jurisic at 223. In that case the English Court of Appeal pointed out that cases of a kind where the offence is of causing death by dangerous driving - 
      
       
        
         
         “ ... fall into two broad categories: first, those in which the accident has arisen through momentary inattention or misjudgment and, secondly, those in which the accused has driven in a manner which has shown a selfish disregard for the safety of other road users or of his passengers, or with a degree of recklessness. A sub-division of this category is provided by the cases in which an accident has been caused or contributed to by the accused’s consumption of alcohol or drugs.” 
         
        
       
     17    It was submitted that it was a misapplication of the principles stated in Jurisic to classify the respondent's driving in this case at the time of the collision as one of momentary inattention or misjudgment. It was submitted that the respondent had abandoned responsibility for his actions. He had ingested alcohol to the point where his bloodstream contained a high range concentration. There was a finding by the trial Judge that the drinking of a substantial amount of alcohol had contributed to his misjudgment. 
      
       
     18    He had conceded in the course of an interview that he was feeling fairly tired at the time when he set off to drive to his home. He was driving in traffic of medium density on a narrow bridge at fifty kilometres per hour and bent down to pick up a cigarette. This, it was submitted, was not a case of momentary inattention. 
      
       
     19    In the course of the interview the respondent had been asked whether he would agree that it was a very dangerous thing to do, to take his eyes off the road “when you are travelling across such a narrow bridge” and he had said that he did agree. 
      
       
     20    The Crown submitted that his Honour's reference to time having shown since the earlier convictions that the respondent had reformed his driving was a demonstration of misplaced confidence. It was pointed out that in Jurisic, in the passage at 231, it was said: 
      
       
        
         
         “With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) and less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional.” 
         
        
        
       The Chief Justice went on to say: 
        
         
         “The period of two years, once the threshold of abandoning responsibility has been reached, is a starting point.” 
         
        
       
     21    It was submitted that the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to public deterrence. The substance of the offence was dangerous driving in association with occasioning grievous bodily harm aggravated by the prescribed concentration of alcohol in the respondent's blood. 
      
       
     22    Mr Strickland, who appeared for the respondent, furnished both written and oral submissions. The argument was broken up into effectively three sections. First, that the finding of momentary inattention was open to the sentencing Judge and appropriate. Secondly, that there was, demonstrated in the remarks on sentence, the particular risk of danger in driving across this narrow bridge if there was any inattention because of its narrowness and the proximity of oncoming traffic. Thirdly, the cause of the accident was the dropping of the cigarette and the respondent’s taking his eyes of the road. 
      
       
     23    We were referred by Mr Strickland to two recent decisions of this Court: R v Khatter [2000] NSWCCA 32 and, particularly, the judgment of one member of the majority, Sully J, paras 4, 5 and 6, where his Honour referred to the dissenting judgment of Simpson J. Her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “These Courts deal with human beings with all their human weaknesses and while the Courts cannot condone any act of driving whilst there is present in the blood more than the prescribed concentration of alcohol, it is not necessary to characterise every instance of the offence as an abandonment of personal responsibility. There are shades and gradations of moral culpability in different instances of the offence and it is proper for the Courts to recognise a continuum rather than a dichotomy when assessing moral culpability.” 
         
        
        
       Sully J said he agreed with those observations. He accepted it would not be fair to say of the respondent in that case that a particular moral culpability was to be assessed in terms of a simple and comprehensive abandonment of his relevant personal responsibility. His Honour continued: 
        
         
         “I do think, however, that there is no escaping the simple fact that the respondent on his own version of the relevant facts deliberately drove a motor vehicle on a public street when he realised that he was, by reason of the effects of alcohol previously ingested, in no fit state to do so. That entails, in my opinion, a real degree of moral culpability in the respondent.” 
         
        
       
     24    In his judgment in Jurisic the Chief Justice set a guideline - and I accept no more than that - for cases of this type unless there are circumstances which are described as exceptional. The Chief Justice said that what is exceptional is almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or misjudgment. However, his Honour also made mention when describing the appropriate guideline that the context was that there was present “to a material degree” an aggravating factor. What in any particular case may be the material degree and the extent of that materiality is no doubt a matter to be taken into account. 
      
       
     25    In the course of both written and oral submissions reference was made to the recent decision of the High Court in Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 74 ALJR 1538 and, in the judgment of Kirby J at para 63, to the proposition that where the Crown appeals it is clearly obliged to demonstrate very clearly the error of which it complains.  
      
       
     26    It was submitted that in this case the sentencing judge had taken account of all the relevant facts and had applied correctly the principles in Jurisic. 
      
       
     27    Mr Strickland emphasised that this Court may not, of course, simply substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because it may have exercised the discretion differently. Mr Strickland drew our attention to the principle of double jeopardy (Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295) and again referred to the judgment of Kirby J in Dinsdale at para 62. 
      
       
     28    In the next stage of his argument Mr Strickland submitted that even if this Court were satisfied that there was an error, as a matter of discretion, it should not quash the sentence and re-sentence. The respondent had suffered a degree of hardship by serving, since 8 September 2000, the sentence of periodic detention. This involved him in travelling for some two or three hours back and forth between the detention centre and where he lives. 
      
       
     29    The subjective features that were referred to by the trial Judge were emphasised. It was pointed out that the respondent has made, and continues to make, attempts to overcome his alcohol problem. Emphasis was placed upon the fact that he had pleaded guilty when the matter was brought up for trial in August 2000. It was accepted that this may not have been a plea at the earliest point of time but it was not a plea, as it were, at the last moment. Finally, it was said - and in this regard we were taken to the decision of this Court in Howland (1999) 104 A Crim R 273 - that any full-time custodial sentence to be imposed should be effectively for no more than three months beyond this date. The submission stressed that while serving periodic detention the respondent had resumed a normal life. 
      
       
     30    Howland, a case in which the accused had gone through a red light and as a result impacted with a motor cyclist who had died, was a case in which there was no suggestion of the presence of alcohol. In the course of his judgment, Spigelman CJ said at 278-279: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour’s express finding that the car in front did not suddenly brake puts the respondent's version in a completely different light. The combined effect of this finding and the finding that the motorcyclist proceeded slowly after his lights had turned green indicate that this was not a case of momentary inattention of a character which can happen to any driver on the road. Rather it was a case in which the driver took a calculated risk to run the red light. In view of the action taken by the respondent in changing lanes and then accelerating, on his own version of the facts, he took the risk of running the light.” 
         
        
       
     31    In my opinion, the Crown has demonstrated that the sentence imposed in this case was manifestly inadequate. The extent of that inadequacy demonstrates, in accordance with the principles stated by the High Court in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499, that there was error in the sentencing procedure. I am not persuaded that it was correct to classify this as a case of momentary inattention as that expression is used in Jurisic. No doubt the particular circumstances described, however defined, have to be taken into account in determining the seriousness of the offence. Such expressions have to be understood in that context. 
      
       
     32    In this case the respondent set out to drive home when he was aware that he had had a large amount of alcohol to drink the previous day between about 11am and 4pm. Apparently the amount was about twenty-four stubbies full strength. He then went to work after about four or five hours sleep. When he finished work he consumed more alcoholic liquor, as it was described in the remarks on sentence. The respondent described himself at that stage as fairly tired.  
      
       
     33    He set out to drive a distance of about fifteen kilometres. While driving across a narrow bridge he dropped a lighted cigarette on the floor of the vehicle. In that situation, driving at fifty kilometres per hour on a narrow bridge in medium density traffic, he bent down in a way which meant that his eyes were beneath the dashboard and he could not see the road. It was at that point that the vehicle reacted in the way that it did and the collision occurred. 
      
       
     34    The respondent accepted it was a very dangerous thing to do, to take his eyes off the road when driving across a narrow bridge. In my opinion, the respondent, in setting out to drive home and continuing on his way with a concentration of alcohol well above the lower limit of the high range and while tired, had undertaken quite deliberately and recklessly a dangerous enterprise. 
      
       
     35    In my opinion, the sentence, as explained by the sentencing Judge, failed properly to take into account the seriousness of the offence as charged. In particular, it seems to me that no proper account was taken of the part to be played by and the need for public or general deterrence. 
      
       
     36    These factors lead me to the conclusion, bearing in mind the amount of the sentence imposed, that his Honour erred in the sentencing procedure. The question is whether this Court should, as a matter of discretion, exercise its power to revisit the sentence. 
      
       
     37    In my opinion, it should. I reiterate the gravity of the offence with a maximum penalty of eleven years imprisonment. I have taken careful account of the subjective matters set out in the remarks on sentence. 
      
       
     38    There was filed in court today an affidavit by the respondent, which I have read. I take account particularly of the respondent’s employment history and I take account of the evidence that he gives about his attempts to deal with his alcohol problem. 
      
       
     39    In determining what should now be done, I also take account of the fact that the respondent, having been already sentenced for the offences to which he has pleaded guilty, is now brought up for sentence again and therefore suffers double jeopardy. It is, of course, also important to bear in mind that the respondent pleaded guilty as early as he did. As I have said, in my opinion, this is a case in which the sentence imposed by Judge Moore should be set aside and this Court itself should re-sentence. 
      
       
     40    Judge Moore made no reference in his remarks on sentence to special circumstances. In my opinion, there are special circumstances. The respondent has never been to gaol before. He has, over a period of some five months, attended and served the sentence of periodic detention. He is undergoing treatment to deal with his alcohol problem. It seems to me that in determining what the non-parole period should be, there is benefit in an extension of the period of rehabilitation. 
      
       
     41    In my opinion, the appeal should be allowed, the sentence below quashed. In lieu thereof the respondent should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years, to commence on 8 September 2000. There should be a non-parole period of twelve months. 
      
       
     42    Accordingly, the Court should order that the respondent be released on parole on 7 September 2001. The order for disqualification made by the sentencing Judge should be affirmed. 
      
       
     43    GROVE J: I agree with Sheller JA. 
      
       
     44    KIRBY J: I also agree with the reasons of the presiding Judge and the orders proposed. 
      
       
     45    SHELLER JA: The order of the Court will therefore be as I have proposed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
       
     1    SHELLER JA: I will ask Grove J to give the first judgment. 
      
       
        
       
     2    GROVE J: The applicant was tried at Lismore District Court before Ducker DCJ and a jury upon counts of supplying traffickable quantities of cocaine and cannabis. Following conviction, on the count of supplying cocaine he was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of five years divided into minimum and additional terms of two years and six months each and minimum and additional terms of nine months in respect of the conviction for supplying cannabis. The latter sentence was to be served concurrently with the longer term. 
      
       
        
       
     3    The facts can be briefly sketched. It is apparent that law enforcement authorities were in possession of some information as a result of which the applicant was intercepted whilst driving a car just south of Ballina. He was accompanied by a woman Jodie Owens, with whom he was at the time participating in a relationship. A police search (with the assistance of trained dogs) located the cocaine, which was analysed to consist of approximately 160 grams of pure drug, $24,000 in cash and some cannabis which was boxed and gift wrapped. 
      
       
        
       
     4    As the learned sentencing Judge observed, the issue at trial had been whether the applicant himself was in possession of the drugs, and in order to prove its case the woman Jodie Owens was called to testify. The applicant has abandoned an appeal against conviction which was lodged shortly after the proceedings below. 
      
       
        
       
     5    A notice of grounds of appeal asserted that the sentence was manifestly excessive and that Ducker DCJ erred in finding that the applicant was deeply involved in the supply of drugs in the Far North Coast region. 
      
       
        
       
     6    It is convenient to deal with the latter assertion. The applicant is a married man born in Baghdad, Iraq in 1948. At the time of the offence he was separated from his wife and in the relationship with Miss Owens which I have mentioned. That relationship has terminated and it appears that there has been reconciliation between the applicant and his wife. The applicant has been in receipt of sickness benefits from the Commonwealth since 1992. His earlier employment, as related to a probation and parole officer who prepared a pre-sentence report, involved working as a driving instructor, a hire car driver, and operating a coffee lounge business, as well as employment in an ink manufacturing company. The applicant is not a user of the illicit drugs of which he was in possession. The presence of the large cash sum remains unexplained, but given the applicant's working and general financial background and status as a pensioner, I see no error in his Honour's conclusion. The applicant was not feeding any drug habit of his own and the possession of the cocaine, in particular, had no apparent purpose other than unlawful commercial activity. The applicant produced no evidence to the contrary of such an inference. In my view, it was open to his Honour to find that a non-addicted person in possession of a traffickable quantity of drugs and a very substantial amount of money in the circumstances relevant to the applicant was deeply involved in the supply of drugs in the area. 
      
       
        
       
     7    The maximum prescribed penalty for the offence is fifteen years imprisonment and although the applicant can be treated as a person without prior record of any significance, the imposition of a total term of one-third of the prescribed maximum cannot of itself be assessed as manifestly excessive. 
      
       
        
       
     8    The principal thrust of the argument on behalf of the applicant was focussed upon evidence before his Honour that the applicant was not in a robust state of health. A report from a cardiologist, Dr Day, was tendered. It revealed that the applicant had been seen as a patient in 1992 with severe angina. Tests and treatment ultimately included coronary artery bypass surgery. In relation to vein grafts Dr Day reported: 
      
       
        
         
          
          ""Considering he had bypass surgery seven years ago, it is highly probable that the vein grafts will start to fail some time in the next two or three years, given the limited life span of vein grafts. He is totally dependent on his grafts, his native coronary circulation is occluded in many places. Once the grafts begin to occlude then he is likely to have major problems. As mentioned it is by no means certain that he will be suitable for further procedures such as surgery or angioplasty. He would then have a very limited exercise capacity and quite possibly be symptomatic, despite treatment, at rest. Taking all factors into account, I would suggest that his prognosis is no more than five years."" 
          
         
        
        
       
     9    The learned trial Judge was sensitive to this material and referred to Dr Day's report, reciting larger extracts than I have done. The contention of the applicant is that his Honour did not properly apply correct principle in relation to the issue of the applicant's ill health. It is plain that his Honour did not overlook the circumstance, as he scarcely would have made the extensive references that he did if he regarded the matter as irrelevant. It can be observed that there was no specific evidence before his Honour that imprisonment would be a greater burden on the applicant or that of itself it would gravely adversely affect his health.  
      
       
        
       
     10    We were referred to the judgment of King CJ in R v. Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 589, in particular the Chief Justice's remark: 
      
       
        
         
          
          ""Generally speaking ill health will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment only when it appears that imprisonment will be a greater burden on the offender by reason of his state of health or when there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse effect on the offender's health."" 
          
         
        
       
     11    We were also referred to the decision of this Court in R v. McDonald (1988) 38 A Crim R 470. In that case Roden J, who delivered the leading judgment, quoted from Smith. He observed that in that case it seemed: 
      
       
        
         
          
          ""... that the circumstances of the appellant's imprisonment, by reason of his condition of health, will necessarily impose upon him stress, which medical evidence suggests can itself in turn cause a significant deterioration in the appellant's condition."" 
          
         
        
        
       
     12    In the present case it is true that Dr Day referred in terms to the stress of prison, but that is something which is common to all persons who are punished in that fashion for crime. The very incidents of life necessarily give rise to stresses. As I have said, there was no specific evidence focussed upon the test set out in the references that I have mentioned. 
      
       
        
       
     13    Even though there was no specific reference to the matter under discussion, the learned trial Judge in finding special circumstances (which resulted in the extension of the additional term component of sentence during which the applicant may be released to parole) said that from time to time the applicant's general condition was, he suspected, likely to make his imprisonment more onerous than that of most other prisoners. This operated to the benefit of the applicant. 
      
       
        
       
     14    The challenge made before this court was expressed in terms of a failure by his Honour to give sufficient weight to the principles that have been adumbrated. The position of the applicant, in my view, parallels observations which were made by this court of the convict in R v L, unreported 17 June 1996, where it was said: 
      
       
        
         
          
          ""The history and current state of the respondent's heart condition are probably not uncommon amongst men of his age, and no doubt there are a variety of events which could precipitate a further attack. Equally, there can be no doubt that imprisonment for a man of his age and background ... would be stressful."" 
          
         
        
        
       
     15    We were referred to statistics from the Judicial Commission which indicated that the sentence imposed appears to be towards the top of the range of general impositions for this crime. It can be observed there was little subjective material to assist the applicant. I have referred to the unexplained possession of a huge amount of money by a pensioner. When seen by the probation and parole officer for the purpose of the preparation of a pre-sentence report, he reported that the offender impressed as less than frank in some of his answers This was the material that was before his Honour. 
      
       
        
       
     16    The applicant showed no remorse or contrition by way of acknowledgment by a plea of guilty, and indeed when seen by the probation officer he continued to assert his innocence. 
      
       
        
       
     17    In my view, the overall sentence imposed was well within the range of the sound exercise of his discretion and I am unpersuaded that any error has been demonstrated. I am further unpersuaded, in the terms of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act that any sentence less severe was warranted or should have been passed. 
      
       
        
       
     18    I propose that the application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       
     19    SHELLER JA: I agree. 
      
       
        
       
     20    KIRBY J: I also agree. 
      
       
        
       
     21    SHELLER JA: The order of the court will be as Grove J has proposed.1 **********

     R v Sandor CIKOS 
      
       SENTENCE 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR. The prisoner, Sandor Cikos, has on arraignment pleaded guilty to the murder on 6 December 1999 of his defacto wife, Allison Penrose & their two sons, Jake aged 4 years and Travis aged 18 months.  
    2    The deaths were discovered when the prisoner contacted police on his return from work, shortly after 6 pm on that day and informed them that he had found the three deceased dead in their beds at the family home at 2 Benares Court, West Dapto. The wife had two wounds at the rear left side of her head, consistent with the use of a blunt instrument and all three had plastic bags over their faces, suggesting suffocation. Some jewellery regularly worn by the wife was missing, suggesting that the motive for the killings might have been robbery, but there was no sign of forced entry, such jewellery was later discovered in the prisoner's lunchbox and one of the bracelets was blood stained with blood later identified as that of the deceased. Fibres and hairs were observed adhering to the wife's hands and these fibres matched the shorts worn by the prisoner that day, while fingernail clippings from her were later identified as containing the prisoner's DNA, during a later interview, police also observed what appeared to be fresh scratches on the prisoner's body, and the deceased's blood was also located on the shorts worn by the prisoner; all these matters indicating a struggle. 
    3    The pathologist's report identified the causes of death in the case of the wife as the combined effect of suffocation and a blunt force head injury, and of the two boys as suffocation. 
    4    In a recorded interview later that evening, the prisoner told police that he and his family had enjoyed a good evening the previous night which included a visit from a neighbour, that he and his wife subsequently watched a video together, that after it finished at about 12 to 12.30 am the deceased made a snack for both of them, following which they went to bed, watched a movie on television beginning at about 1 am, and that he gave the deceased a back rub after which they both fell asleep watching the movie. He said he went to work the following morning in the usual way whilst everyone was still asleep, but that when he returned from work at about 5 to 6 he noticed that everything was unusually dark inside the house, he went upstairs and noticed Jake in his bed, he checked his pulse, found there was none and then went to his wife's room and found her there, lying on her back with a pillow over her face and red marks all over her body, so he covered her up with a doona which was lying on the bed. 
    5    He also mentioned the incident involving his wife and one of her girlfriends in about February 1999 to which I will shortly refer, and said that his wife was having difficulty coming to terms with that incident and that she had subsequently assaulted him, but he claimed that their relationship was good and that they were working things out. Following further investigations by police, the prisoner was arrested on 28 January 2000 and has been in custody since that date. 
    6    As his Senior Counsel frankly conceded, the killings cannot be excused and there is no acceptable explanation for them; but to understand the circumstances in which they occurred it is necessary to consider the prisoner's background and his relationship with his deceased wife.  
    7    The prisoner is one of three children and was born in Yugoslavia near the Hungarian border on 20 December 1960. He migrated to this country with his family when 4 years old and there is nothing significant in the family background. His father was a fitter and turner in regular employment and the prisoner went to school in the Wollongong area where he was an average student, left school after completing the School Certificate and began an apprenticeship as a fitter and turner. When he was 19 he married the 17 year old sister of his brother's wife and although the relationship was good at first, as time went on it deteriorated. The wife seems to have been the dominant person in the marriage and incurred a number of debts with the result that they separated after 13 years, when he was aged 32. There were three children of the marriage. Initially after the separation he continued to see them but after he met Allison, his former wife created problems, and he has virtually lost regular contact with them.  
    8    He met Allison at line dancing in about 1993 and they formed a relationship shortly afterwards. They intended to marry but the prisoner suffered multiple fractures to his right lower limb in a crane accident at work in 1994 and they put those plans aside. Jake was born in 1995 and Travis in 1997. The deceased appears to have been a person with a strong, assertive character who enjoyed a social life and on occasions drank to excess when at times she became somewhat uninhibited such as by displaying her breasts and on one occasion jumping into a swimming pool wearing only her underpants. 
    9    Apart from the period following his accident the prisoner has been in regular employment. As a result of the accident he recovered compensation in the sum of $140,000 and this was used to purchase the family home at Benares Court, West Dapto where the deaths occurred.  
    10    In February 1999 an incident occurred which appears to have had a profound effect on the family and on the relationship between the deceased and the prisoner. A number of friends, including the prisoner and the deceased, went to a club and stayed until it closed. They were all drinking except for the prisoner who was driving. After leaving the club they all returned to the prisoner's home where he went to bed and went to sleep whilst the others continued drinking and partying. At one stage the deceased and one of her girlfriends went to another room where another male member of the group had gone to sleep. They woke him up, the deceased straddled him and had sexual intercourse with him, with the girlfriend present and also participating.  
    11    After that the deceased told the girlfriend that it had always been one of her ""fantasies"" to watch whilst the prisoner had sexual intercourse with one of her girlfriends; and she invited the girlfriend to go with her to the prisoner's bedroom. When they got there the deceased aroused the prisoner and began to have sex with him for a short time. She then got off and told the girlfriend that it was her turn, and she watched whilst the girlfriend and the deceased had sex together; but once her fantasy had become a reality, she apparently did not like what she saw.  
    12    Almost immediately, she commenced to abuse and berate the prisoner for having had intercourse with the girlfriend in front of her, and she struck the prisoner and ordered him out of the house, and also the girlfriend. It seems this tirade of abuse continued in the days and months following, and led to the deceased selling the furniture from the room where the incident occurred, and when he returned home shortly afterwards, the deceased and the prisoner moved into another bedroom. 
    13    The deceased in her arguments with the prisoner appears to have taken the position that although she initiated the sexual activity with her girlfriend, the prisoner was nevertheless to blame because she and the girlfriend were drunk and he was sober, and so notwithstanding the provocation, he should not have succumbed.  
    14    The deceased told a number of her friends about the incident but although the versions she gave to different persons varied, they were generally to the effect that she had found her husband in bed with her best friend. No-one was told that she had invited the girlfriend to do it, or that she had initiated the arousal of the prisoner; and no-one, not even the prisoner, was told that she had sex with another man earlier that evening in the other room. The prisoner said, and I accept, that he was not aware of this fact until he received the police brief following his arrest.  
    15    The incident seems to have had an all consuming effect on the deceased. She kept a diary on her computer where she related discussions with the prisoner about it and her own thoughts on the matter. She attempted to set him up for a meeting with the woman involved, so that she could then accuse him of being unfaithful, but the prisoner did not attend any meeting with the other woman and had nothing further to do with her. Both parties attended counselling sessions where the prisoner was told to expect more of the same for about 12 months. She assaulted him a number of times, and on one occasion during an argument about the matter slashed at his elbow with a knife, with the result that he required 8 stitches for the laceration at Wollongong Hospital and the police obtained an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order against the deceased on his behalf. She also was meticulous about her fingernails and was frequently having them repaired, and told the beautician that she was constantly breaking them assaulting the prisoner, and that she hit him whenever she could. 
    16    The deceased was obsessive about the matter and would not let it rest. She told one of her friends that she was going to let the prisoner think that the matter was settling down, but that when things seemed better she would drop him like a bag and find another man. In the 6 weeks leading up to the killings, it appeared to a number of neighbours and others, that the situation was somewhat better between them; but the prisoner gave evidence and told the psychiatrist and psychologist who interviewed him that the deceased had threatened him that if he did not arrange to have the woman involved killed, she would have him killed, and in due course she gave him an ultimatum that the other woman had to be killed by February 2000.  
    17    He said that she told him if he went to the authorities or left home, she would arrange for something to happen to him. He told Dr Milton that February was fast approaching, he thought of leaving but felt she would pursue him, and that if he went to the authorities, she was more likely to be believed. He felt he had to do something and killing her seemed to be the only thing he could do. 
    18    There is of course no other evidence of this latest threat and the prisoner's evidence on this matter cannot be tested, but Dr Milton who examined the prisoner considered that it was probably true as the prisoner is not an imaginative person and would be unlikely to make up such a story. The prisoner made no attempt to speak to anyone about these threats, he did not attempt to speak to the psychologist whom he had previously seen with his wife, and he made no attempt to speak to his father or his sister, to both of whom he was close. He said that he could not just leave the deceased, as he was afraid that no matter what he did she would come after him. He appears to have been more aggressive at work in the couple of weeks leading up to the deaths.  
    19    Dr Milton, an experienced psychiatrist who examined the police statements before the prisoner's arrest and expressed a profiler type opinion, and after his pleas interviewed the prisoner and furnished a report to the prisoner's solicitors, considered that whereas the deceased was of a turbulent, aggressive, demanding nature, prone to sexual jealousy, with a poor self-concept and a tendency to drink to excess, the prisoner was a passive and unassertive man with no past history of violence, no enjoyment of alcohol and not one given to attending parties or expressing himself, or talking about himself or his feelings, being hardworking and skilled in his trade. He was of the opinion that after the incident in February 1999 the prisoner continued to take a passive attitude to putting up with a lot of verbal and physical aggression against him, to which was added the threat that the other woman was to be killed by February 2000 or the deceased would take action against him; and he believed she was capable of it. Dr Milton considered that what led to the wife's death was her overwhelming jealousy and the prisoner's inability to cope with her reaction to his sexual encounter with her friend. He still found the deaths of the two boys perplexing. He found no indications of any cognitive defect or serious mental disorder. 
    20    The prisoner in evidence said that he had thought of killing his wife for some time, but had always decided against it, and there was nothing different this particular night except that the time limit that she had imposed for causing the death of the other woman was getting closer. He said that although he had thought about killing her as an option, he had not actually made up his mind to take that option before the night in question, but after she went to sleep he watched the end of the movie and decided to do it. 
    21    He said he went downstairs and obtained a piece of pipe, returned to the bedroom, struck her over the head with the pipe, she turned over and he grabbed her by the throat and choked her. He later put the pillow over her face but did not apply pressure. He then went and choked the two boys; although he put a plastic bag over the head of each of them, they were choked and not suffocated.  
    22    The only reason he could give for killing the boys was that he could not bear the thought of them going through life with the pain of having lost their mother, and knowing that their father had done it. This line of reasoning, although it may have a certain perverse logic to it, overlooks the fact that two innocent lives have been taken by one of the persons who brought them into the world and from whom, most of all, they were entitled to expect security and protection. Similarly, however unreasonable the conduct and reaction of his wife to the situation which, as I am satisfied, she initiated, he was under no immediate physical threat and he had plenty of opportunities to seek advice and to pursue other options. Three people, two of them his own innocent children, have been killed without any justification and the law must take its course. 
    23    It seems that notwithstanding the front he put up to the police in the days following the deaths, the prisoner almost immediately regretted, and was remorseful and sorry for, what he had done. He has expressed such sorrow and remorse, not only to the Court, but also to Dr Milton and to a psychologist who interviewed him (Mr Terry Kesby-Smith); and like them, I am satisfied that his remorse is genuine.  
    24    I have read the Victim Impact Statements and observe that Allison's parents have lost not only their daughter, but also their grandchildren, and I express the Court's sympathy to them; but these matters are not relevant to the issue of sentencing in this case. 
    25    The prisoner has no previous convictions, has been in regular employment all his life and has been a good provider. He is entitled to an appropriate discount for his plea of guilty: see R v Thomson [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383. The plea was not entered until arraignment, but it was signified as a possibility some time earlier and as a certainty the week before the arraignment. I am satisfied that the plea in this case is evidence of genuine remorse and contrition and it has saved the State the trouble and expense of a trial. It has also saved some potential witnesses the embarrassment of giving evidence of their sexual activities. I consider that the appropriate discount for the plea of guilty in this case is in the range 10 to 15%.  
    26    The prisoner has been in strict protection, and no doubt will serve at least the greater part, if not all of the sentence, in that classification, owing to the fact that children have been killed and this will make the service of his sentence somewhat harsher. He has been in custody since 28 January 2000 and the sentence will be backdated to that date.  
     
      
      
      
      
    27    Sandor Cikos, in respect of each count in the indictment I sentence you to imprisonment for a term of 21 years; the sentences are to be served concurrently and be deemed to have commenced on 28 January 2000. I fix a non-parole period of 15½ years. The earliest date on which you will be eligible to be released on parole will be 27 July 2015.

     - 10 - 
    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESSperling J22 January 2001S71033/01 - Regina v Amane Iskandar1    In making a determination as to bail and irrespective of any presumption in favour of or against bail, the court is required to take into account the considerations specified in s32 (so far as reasonably ascertained) and only those considerations: s32 (1). The considerations are - in brief form - the probability of the applicant appearing in court in respect of the offence, the interests of the applicant, the protection of any particular person or persons, and the protection and welfare of the community. 
     
      
       
      
    2    Section 8 provides, in relation to the offences specified in that section (being certain minor offences), that an applicant is entitled to bail with specified exceptions.3    Section 8A provides that an applicant, accused of an offence specified in that section, being certain serious drug offences, is not to be granted bail unless the applicant satisfies the court that bail should not be refused.4    Section 9 provides (with exceptions) that an applicant accused of an offence specified in that section (being certain other serious offences) is entitled to bail unless, relevantly, the court is satisfied that it is justified in refusing bail. (A further exception to s9 is created by s9A in relation to domestic violence offences).5    In summary, s8 by-passes s32 by making bail mandatory in relation to the offences to which it applies. Section 8A creates a presumption against bail in relation to the offences to which it appears. Section 9 creates a presumption in favour of bail in relation to the offences to which it applies. In relation to all other offences, there is no statutory presumption in favour of or against bail.6    Uninstructed by authority, I would have thought that the scheme of the statute in these respects is as follows and no more: that, with the exception of s8 cases, the court is to decide whether or not to grant bail having regard to the considerations specified in s32; that, in relation s8A cases, the burden is on the applicant to satisfy the court that the balance of those considerations is in favour of bail; that, in relation to s9 cases, the burden is on the Crown to satisfy the court that the balance of those considerations is against bail; and that, in all other cases, the court decides whether to grant or refuse bail having regard to the specified considerations without any such provisional presumption in favour of or against bail.7    However, decisions binding on me go much further.8    I begin with the first instance decision of Kissner (Hunt CJ at CL, 17 January 1992, unreported). It followed an earlier decision by Wood J, in relation to the same applicant, refusing bail. Section 8A applied. In a judgement again refusing bail, Hunt CJ at CL said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         The presumption against bail expressed in s8A imposes a difficult task upon an application to which the section applies. Its effect is not merely to place an onus upon the applicant to establish his entitlement to bail. He must satisfy the court that bail should not be refused. Wood J said (and I agree) that the presumption expresses a clear legislative intention that persons charged with the serious drug offences specified in the section should normally - or ordinarily - be refused bail. 
          
          
         ……….. 
          
          
         Wood J also adopted (as I do) the views expressed by Badgery-Parker J in a series of cases that, by the presumption against bail enacted by s8A, the Legislature intends the courts to place less weight upon the circumstances which are common to all applicants, and more weight upon the strength of the Crown case against the applicant in the particular case under consideration. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         The strength of the Crown case has become the prime consideration where s8A applies: see for example: Regina v Michael Youssef Toubya (15 November 1990); Regina v Garry Roy Morton (15 May 1990); Regina v Antonio Franco (23 July 1991); Regina v David Clyde Brown (25 July 1991), all unreported. 
         
        
        
         
         Common to all bail applications are the circumstances that the applicant’s continued incarceration will cause a serious deprivation of his general right to be at liberty, together with hardship and distress to himself and his family, an usually with severe effects upon the applicant’s business or employment, his finances and his abilities to prepare his defence and to support his family. Also common to most bail applications by persons charged with the offences to which s8A applies is the availability of sureties prepared to forfeit (with or without security) large sums of money to ensure that the applicant will answer his bail; an application would otherwise be unlikely to be considered in relation to such serious matter. 
         
        
        
         
         The Legislature has, notwithstanding all those particular circumstances, enacted the presumption against bail in these cases, so that such circumstances will not ordinarily be sufficient to overcome the barrier to bail which s8A has erected. As Badgery-Parker J said: if the Crown case is a strong one, the applications for bail in which they will be sufficient to do so must necessarily be somewhat special, and the task of the applicant to overcome the presumption that bail is to be refused will ordinarily be a difficult one. On the other hand, if the Crown case is not a strong one, the circumstances to which I have referred in the last paragraph will ordinarily be given greater weight, and the task of the applicant (although still a substantial one) will be correspondingly less difficult. 
         
        
       
      
    9    The first part of this passage and, I trust, the second part of it were referred to with approval by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Masters, Richards and Wunderlich (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 (Hunt CJ at CL, Allen and Badgery-Parker JJ) at 473, where the court said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         The presumption against bail expressed in trial section (s8A) imposed a difficult task upon the person so charged to persuade the court why bail should not be refused. That presumption expresses a clear legislative intention that persons charged with the serious drug offences specified in the section should normally - or ordinarily - be refused bail. That is the effect of a series of decisions by single judges of the Supreme Court, most recently collected and discussed in  
         Regina v Kissner 
          (Hunt CJ at CL, 17 January 1992, unreported). We agree with that interpretation of s8A. 
         
        
       
      
    10    The statement of principle in Masters, approving what was said in Kissner, is binding on judges at first instance. However, the principles leave room for the grant of bail in an appropriate case. In Hanley (8 December 1992, unreported), Badgery-Parker J, who had been so instrumental in generating this line of authority, granted bail in a s8A application, notwithstanding a strong Crown case, because of the substantial security offered. The figure in that case was $1 million, but the significance of the amount of security offered must vary with the financial circumstances of the persons involved.11    In Brown, (NSW Court of Appeal, 15 March 1994, unreported), Kirby P affirmed the Kissner approach. Speaking of s8A, he said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         The section clearly provides a presumption against bail. It does so in the case of defined drug offences. It has come under the consideration of the Court in Regina v Peter Edward Kissner 17 January 1992 (unreported - the Chief Judge at Common Law); and of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 (CCA) at 473. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         The foregoing decisions make it plain, as indeed the section itself does, that it is the will of Parliament that persons charged with offences of this variety should ordinarily be refused bail. In determining whether the very high onus imposed by law has been discharged, less weight is placed upon the circumstances common to all applicants for bail. More weight is placed upon the strength of the Crown case against the person seeking bail. 
         
        
       
      
    12    The other members of the court, Powell JA and Hunt CJ at CL, took no exception to this re-affirmation of principle.13    The Kissner approach was again approved by the Court of Appeal in Budiman (1997) 97 A Crim R 548 (Mason P, Powell and Sheller JJA) at 550.14    In view of the authorities binding on me, I proceed on the basis that , where s8A applies, an application for bail should normally or ordinarily be refused. A heavy burden rests on the applicant to satisfy the court that bail should be granted. The strength of the Crown case is the prime but not the exclusive consideration. Countervailing circumstances common to applications for bail in the generality are to be accorded less weight than in the ordinary case. The application must be somewhat special if the Crown case in support of the charge is strong. 15    In the present case, the applicant is charged with conspiracy to supply not less than a large commercial quantity of heroin and not less than a commercial quantity of cocaine. Section 8A applies to at least the first of these offences. The presumption against bail attaches to an applicant who is “a person accused of an offence to which this section applies”. Accordingly, no question arises as to whether the present applicant has been correctly charged with the specified offence. The charge itself attracts the presumption against bail.16    The applicant was arrested with others on 21 December 2001 in the course of a police operation which targeted a large illicit drug distribution enterprise. The Crown case against this applicant is that the head of the organisation was Walid Chami, with whom the applicant was living in a de facto relationship; that the applicant was one of three managers under him who managed the distribution of drugs by others from premises used as bases; and that the evidence against the applicant consists principally of a large number of recorded telephone conversations establishing the nature and scope of the business and the applicant’s role in it. Most of this evidence has not yet been served on the applicant’s legal representatives. They have, accordingly, not had the opportunity of evaluating it, including the evidence of voice identification.17    The applicant is 23 years of age. She has a 2 year old child from a previous marriage or relationship. She has the support of her parents. She wishes to live with them, her two younger sisters and her child, pending her trial. Her parents are willing and anxious to have her. They are willing to pledge the equity in their home as security.18    I have regard to the following considerations, pursuant to s32. As to the probability of whether or not the applicant will appear in court in respect of the offences for which bail is sought, the offences charged are very serious charges and I assume for the purpose of this application (without deciding) that there is a strong Crown case against the applicant. The Crown says, in these circumstances that there is strong motivation for flight and that the applicant has or may have access to funds and the means of obtaining false documents to enable her to disappear. As against that, I find that the applicant has very strong community ties, being ties with her parents and siblings and with her child. She has no criminal record. There has been no previous failure to appear in court pursuant to any bail undertaking. There is specific evidence tending to indicate a probability that the applicant will appear in court, namely, the security which her parents are willing to provide over the equity in their home.19    As to the interests of the applicant, it is common experience that cases of this kind may take a long time to come to trial because of delays in serving evidence and because of the length of committal proceedings. The applicant has a specific need to be free for a lawful purpose pending trial, namely, to care for her two year old child.20    As to protection of any particular person or persons, there is no suggestion that, if released on bail, the applicant might cause harm to anyone.21    As to the protection and welfare of the community, it does not seem to me that the applicant is in a position to interfere in any significant way with continuation of the police operation in relation to the illicit enterprise. I also think it unlikely in the extreme that the applicant would endeavour to carry on the illicit enterprise herself if released on bail, as has been suggested. It is not part of the Crown case, so far as the evidence before me discloses, that the applicant had any personal involvement in the procurement of drugs as distinct from their distribution. That function was carried out by Walid Chami. Nor do I think there would be any significant prospect of further criminal activity of any other kind if strict bail conditions were imposed restricting the applicant’s movements except in the presence of one of her parents.22    Having regard to these considerations, I am satisfied that the presumption against bail is displaced in this case and that bail on very strict conditions should be granted.23    In relation to all outstanding matters and offences I grant bail subject to the conditions in the short minutes of order placed with the papers.

     Regina v Kim Van Mai 
      
      
      
     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1     MEAGHER JA: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
       
      
    2     HIDDEN J: The appellant, Kim Van Mai, was tried by a judge and jury in the District Court upon a charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of a quantity of heroin. He was found guilty and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. He appeals against conviction only. 
     
      
       
        
       The trial 
        
       
      
    3     Most of the evidence in the Crown case was unchallenged. On 18 March 1997 a parcel containing dried fish products, in which heroin was secreted, arrived in Australia by air from Cambodia. The parcel was addressed to Mr Kim Ly at an address in Prairiewood, a suburb in the south-west of Sydney.  
     
      
       
      
    4     In the previous month, the appellant, who lived in Melbourne, had travelled to Sydney and taken up temporary residence at that address. A man called Sovan Pen, who was well known to the appellant, had an association with those premises. The two spent some time together before Pen travelled from Australia to Cambodia. He returned to Australia on 17 March 1997, the day before the parcel arrived. 
     
      
       
      
    5     On 19 March 1997 Customs officers detected the heroin. Australian Federal Police arranged a controlled delivery, which took place on the morning of 24 March by a police officer disguised as an employee of a courier service. The appellant and Pen were at the premises at the time, as was a woman whom the appellant understood to be Pen’s girlfriend. The conversation at the time of the delivery was covertly recorded. The appellant was recorded as saying that it was the woman, rather than he, who was Kim Ly, the addressee of the parcel. That was not in fact the name by which he knew her. 
     
      
       
      
    6     Pen drove the appellant away from the premises, the appellant carrying the parcel inside a garbage bag. He got out of the car with the parcel at a nearby bus stop, put it down and stood about five metres from it. A little later Pen drove back and the appellant picked up the parcel and got into the car. 
     
      
       
      
    7     They drove to premises at Edensor Park, where the appellant got out of the car without the bag. Pen then drove alone to different premises in Edensor Park, which he entered. He then drove back and picked up the appellant. Both men were arrested soon thereafter. The parcel was retrieved by police from the yard of the premises at Edensor Park which Pen had attended alone.  
     
      
       
      
    8     In a recorded interview, the appellant told police that he knew nothing of the delivery of the parcel that morning, that he knew no-one called Kim Ly, and that he had not spoken to anyone at the house at Prariewood that morning apart from Pen and his girlfriend. It was the Crown case that these were lies demonstrating a consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
       
      
    9     In the interview, he also said that he had gone to the bus stop intending to travel by bus to Cabramatta, where Pen ran a restaurant. Pen had given him to understand that the bag which he was carrying contained oranges, from which juice was to be made. He walked some distance from the bus stop, leaving the bag unattended, so that he could get a clear view of the bus as it approached to make sure that he caught the right one. Pen, he said, came back and collected him from the bus stop, taking him to visit his (Pen’s) daughter. He left the bag in the car, asking Pen to take the oranges to the restaurant himself. Pen picked him up about twenty minutes later, and where Pen had been in the meantime he did not know.  
     
      
       
      
    10     It was the Crown case that this account should be rejected out of hand. It will be recalled that the heroin arrived in Australia in a parcel containing dried fish products. One of the matters the Crown relied upon was evidence from witnesses that the parcel emitted a distinct odour of fish. 
     
      
       
      
    11     Accordingly, the Crown sought to make out its case that the appellant was knowingly concerned in the importation by inference from the proved circumstances, including his lies to the police. The appellant did not give evidence. It is this which gives rise to the only ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
        
       The appeal 
        
       
      
    12     The basis of the appeal is that the learned trial judge erred in his directions to the jury about the significance of the fact that the appellant did not give evidence. His Honour reminded the jury of the burden and standard of proof borne by the Crown and explained that the appellant was under no obligation to give evidence, that the jury should not conclude that he had taken that course because he was guilty and that there could be many reasons consistent with his innocence why he might have done so. His Honour then continued: 
     
      
       
        
         
         In the present case however, when judging the value or the weight of the evidence which has been put forward by the crown as establishing its case against the accused you may take into account the accused election not to deny, contradict or explain the matters about which he could have given direct evidence from his personal knowledge. You may think that it is only common sense that in a situation where a Crown witness and the accused are directly involved or seem to be involved in a particular set of events that the persons best able to give evidence are those who made the observation on the part of the Crown and the accused. Where the evidence called by the Crown is left undenied or is uncontradicted any doubts which you may otherwise have been entertaining about the evidence of the Crown witness may more readily be discounted and the evidence of that witness may more readily be accepted as the truth, that is the approach which you may take although you do not necessarily take that approach. In any event perhaps some of the thrust of that particular direction is taken out of that direction by virtue of the fact that the accused’s explanation and his version of what went on that day, what he did and why he did it, are in fact in a way before you because his record of interview is in evidence and he has accordingly given his version to the police. That version in the record of interview is accordingly a possible explanation on the part of the accused. It does not have the same quality as evidence which is given on oath, it is not subject to cross-examination by the Crown, but nonetheless he may be content to rely upon that as being the explanation and not give it again as it were by giving evidence in this trial. Of course what he said in that record of interview is able to be used by Mr Cattini as an explanation and it is open to attack by the Crown as being unbelievable on your part as an explanation, but you look at it and give it such weight as you think it is entitled to in the light of what you believe is established by the other material before you, the sworn evidence.  
         
        
       
      
    13     These directions were in accordance with this Court’s approach to s20 of the Evidence Act 1995 expressed in R v OGD (1997) 45 NSWLR 744, per Gleeson CJ at 750-2. In particular, his Honour’s direction that the Crown evidence and the inferences for which the Crown contended might be more readily accepted when the appellant had not chosen to deny, contradict or explain matters of which he must have had personal knowledge was consistent with what the then Chief Justice had to say in OGD at 751, by reference to extracts from the judgments in Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217. The trial took place before the more recent decision of the High Court in RPS v The Queen (2000) 74 ALJR 449, in which the appropriateness of a direction of that kind was re-examined and doubt was cast upon that aspect of the judgment in OGD: see the joint judgment at par 30. 
     
      
       
      
    14     We were referred to recent decisions of this Court where, in the light of RPS, convictions were set aside after trials in which directions of the kind impugned in this case had been given: R v Covill [2000] NSWCCA 231, R v Dang [2000] NSWCCA 269. At par 27 of the joint judgment in RPS, referring to Weissensteiner, their Honours recognised that there may still be some cases in which a direction of that kind would be appropriate. The Crown prosecutor in this Court conceded that the present is not such a case. In any event, the direction was deficient because it failed to specify the particular evidence as to which “the absence of an explanation” was “of sufficiently compelling character” to warrant a direction of that kind: R v Hannes [2000] NSWCCA 503, per Spigelman CJ at par 164. 
     
      
       
      
    15     Accordingly, the Crown prosecutor fairly acknowledged that the challenged direction - that is, the first half of the passage from the summing-up quoted in par 11 of this judgment - is erroneous. She argued, however, that the error was neutralised by what his Honour then went on to say. She contended that the effect of the second half of the quoted passage was that the appellant had put forward his version of events in the recorded interview with police, so that it could not be said that there were matters raised in the Crown evidence within his personal knowledge which he had left unexplained. In the circumstances, she submitted, it may well have been to the benefit of the appellant that his Honour did not particularise the evidence to which the direction related.  
     
      
       
      
    16     There is some force in this argument, and the direction that the appellant’s account in the interview was not on oath and not subject to cross-examination was appropriate, and is commonly given in cases where an accused elects not to give evidence but relies upon exculpatory statements in a police interview. Nevertheless, I am not persuaded that what his Honour said about the appellant’s interview was sufficient to remove the prejudice caused by the erroneous direction. That direction was not withdrawn. Rather, his Honour’s reference to the interview was prefaced by the qualified statement that “perhaps some of the thrust of that particular direction” was “taken out” by the fact that the appellant gave police his version of relevant events.  
     
      
       
      
    17     In any event, there was a matter of significance in the Crown case which was not explained at all in the appellant’s interview. I have referred to evidence that the parcel containing the heroin smelt of fish, tending to give the lie to the appellant’s suggestion that the bag he carried to the bus stop contained oranges. That was not put to the appellant during the interview, apparently because the interviewing police had no statement to that effect at that time. Indeed, there had been an earlier trial of this matter at which the jury could not reach a verdict, and counsel for the appellant informed us that no evidence to that effect had been given at that trial. It emerged for the first time when some witnesses made additional statements after the first trial, and that development was the subject of cross-examination of those witnesses on behalf of the appellant at the second trial. 
     
      
       
      
    18     For these reasons, I am satisfied that his Honour’s error was more than academic and the ground of appeal is made out. 
     
      
       
        
       The proviso 
        
       
      
    19     The Crown prosecutor submitted, however, that the appeal should still be dismissed by the application of the proviso to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In the light of what was said to be the strength of the Crown case, she argued that his Honour’s error had not occasioned any substantial miscarriage of justice. She placed reliance upon the combination of circumstances pointing to the appellant’s guilt outlined above: his presence in Sydney at the relevant time and his association with Pen, his presence at the premises at Prariewood on the day the parcel was delivered and his involvement in its reception, his dealings with the parcel thereafter, together with what was said to be his lies to police about material matters. 
     
      
       
      
    20     However, the live issue in the case was the mental element necessary to establish the crime. This involved proof of the appellant’s knowledge not only of the presence of a proscribed drug but also of its importation into Australia. Knowledge of the former might readily be inferred from the circumstances, but not necessarily of the latter. I am not satisfied that the Crown case was so compelling that it could be said that, notwithstanding the error in the summing-up which has been identified, the appellant has not “lost a chance which was fairly open to him of being acquitted”: Mraz v The Queen (1955) 93 CLR 493 per Fullagher J at 514 
     
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
      
    21     I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction. Counsel for the appellant submitted that a verdict of acquittal should be entered, as this was a second trial and the non-parole period specified would expire in October of next year. However, I am of the view that the appropriate order is that there should be a new trial.  
     
      
       
      
    22     HOWIE J: I agree with Hidden J.

      70066/99 - REGINA v PABLO RECALDE 
       
        
       
      SENTENCE 
      
     1   HIS HONOUR: I will deliver my remarks on sentence and pass sentence. 
     
      
    2   On 19 June 2000 the prisoner Pablo Daniel Recalde was indicted before me on a charge that on or about 25 February 1998 at Budgewoi he murdered Anthony Wayne Brian Boyce. To that charge the prisoner pleaded not guilty of the murder but guilty of the manslaughter of Anthony Wayne Brian Boyce. The Crown accepted the plea of guilty of manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment. 
     
      
    3   The proceedings on sentence were stood over to 20 July 2000 but could not proceed on that date. Ultimately the hearing of the proceedings on sentence did not take place until 11 December. 
     
      
    4   The victim of the offence Anthony Wayne Brian Boyce was a baby six months old at the time of his death. He had been born on 17 August 1997. He was a child of Margaret Enid Boyce. The prisoner was not the baby's father. The prisoner and Margaret Boyce lived together in a de facto relationship for about two months down to 24 February 1998. They lived on the Central Coast at Budgewoi. Two other children of Margaret Boyce, both girls, then aged six and five years, of whom the prisoner was not the father, lived in the same household. A man named Darrell Holmes lived in a garage at the same property. 
     
      
    5   The pathologist who performed the post-mortem examination of the baby's body found that the baby had died between 8.30 in the evening of 24 February 1998 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon of 25 February 1998 but closer to the latter time. Half past eight in the evening of 24 February 1998 was the approximate time at which the baby's mother went to bed that night, the baby then being alive and generally well. 
     
      
    6   Shortly after 3 o'clock in the afternoon of 25 February 1998 the baby's mother, in a distressed state and carrying the baby in her arms, arrived at a next door neighbour's house. The baby was already dead. The baby's mother, Margaret Boyce, was interviewed twice by police on 25 February 1998. In the two interviews she gave conflicting accounts of what she said had happened on 24 and 25 February 1998. 
     
      
    7   In the proceedings on sentence a statement of facts prepared on behalf of the Crown was admitted into evidence without objection. In this statement of facts the two accounts given by Margaret Boyce on 25 February 1998 were summarised in a way which was not the subject of any criticism in the proceedings on sentence and the following summary of the two accounts is derived from this statement of the facts.  
     
      
    8   In the first account Margaret Boyce said that on the evening of 24 February she accidentally burned or scalded the baby by spilling hot tea or coffee on him. She succeeded in settling the baby down. After he went to sleep she held him for several hours. She put the baby to bed in the early hours of the morning and then went to bed herself. The following morning, the morning of 25 February, she checked the baby a number of times and did not notice anything wrong. In the afternoon she checked the baby again and then thought something was wrong. It was then that she took the baby to the next door neighbour's house. In this account Margaret Boyce made no mention of her partner, the prisoner. 
     
      
    9   In her second account Margaret Boyce said that she had lied to the police in her first account. In the second account she said on the evening of 24 February she had gone to bed between 8.30 and 9 o'clock leaving the baby asleep on a lounge. Apart from some minor bruising the baby was well and, in particular, had not suffered any burn injury. 
     
      
    10   On 25 February she woke up at about 5.30 in the morning and went into the kitchen of the house. The prisoner was in the kitchen. The prisoner told Margaret Boyce that he had burnt the baby. Margaret Boyce did not ask the prisoner how this had happened. She went to the doorway of the baby's bedroom and looked in. She saw the baby was lying in his cot. She did not enter the baby's room. She assumed that during the night the prisoner had moved the baby from the lounge room to his cot. The prisoner returned to bed. 
     
      
    11   Margaret Boyce spent the morning in various activities, including taking her daughters to school, mowing the lawn and doing some housework. During the day a number of friends arrived at the house, stayed for short periods and left. None of these visitors saw the baby. About midday Margaret Boyce lay down and fell asleep. About 3.30 she was woken up by the prisoner, who told her something was wrong with the baby. She went into the baby's room and picked up the baby, saw a large burn on his forehead and found that he was lifeless. 
     
      
    12   I have now concluded my summary of the two conflicting accounts given on 25 February 1998 by Margaret Boyce. 
     
      
    13   The post-mortem examination on the baby's body was performed on 26 February 1998. The post-mortem examination revealed the following injuries: 
     
      
       (a) a scald on the right side of the face; 
       
       (b) a fracture of the right occipital bone; 
       
       (c) bilateral subdural haemorrhage;  
       
       (d) optic nerve and retinal haemorrhages; 
       
       (e) recent subarachnoid haemorrhages; 
       
       (f) a healing rib fracture; 
       
       (g) multiple finger type bruises on the face and trunk. 
       
      
    14   In the pathologist's opinion the injuries he observed could not have been caused accidentally. In the pathologist's opinion the cause of death consisted of the combined effects of shaking the baby and an impact head injury. 
     
      
    15   On 25 February the prisoner left the house in which he had been living with Margaret Boyce. He was arrested in April 1998 but only in relation to outstanding warrants for other offences. He was not arrested and charged with the murder of the baby until 25 June 1999. After he was arrested he declined to be interviewed by police concerning the death of the baby and, until shortly prior to entering his plea of guilty to manslaughter, he had not made any admissions to the police or to the prosecuting authorities. 
     
      
    16   The prisoner was in custody from 25 June 1999 to 30 September 1999 when he was released on bail. He remained on bail until he pleaded guilty to manslaughter and he has been in custody ever since. I will make the sentence I impose commence from 19 June 2000 and take into account that the prisoner spent a discrete period of three months five days in pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
    17   I have already referred to the two conflicting accounts given by Margaret Boyce of what happened on 24 and 25 February. Margaret Boyce, although subpoenaed by the Crown, did not attend at Court on 19 June 2000 and her non-attendance and the Crown's lack of knowledge of her whereabouts and hence the inability of the Crown to call her as a witness constituted one of the reasons for the Crown being prepared to accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment. 
     
      
    18   In the proceedings on sentence a statement of facts prepared on behalf of the prisoner and signed by the prisoner was tendered by counsel for the prisoner and admitted into evidence without objection by the Crown. The prisoner went into the witness box and swore that what was asserted in the statement of facts was true. There was no cross-examination of the prisoner by the Crown Prosecutor. I was informed by both counsel that what was set out in the statement of facts was in accordance with the version of the facts which had been conveyed to the Crown on behalf of the prisoner shortly before he entered his plea of guilty to manslaughter. 
     
      
    19   I will set out the statement of facts in full: 
     
      
       
        
        ""On 24, 25 February 1998 Mr Recalde was at 56 Scenic Drive, Budgewoi where he lived with Margaret Boyce and her children, Mishanne, Erin and Anthony. Darrell Homes shared the house and lived in the garage. 
        
       
        
       
        
        Late in the evening Mr Recalde was the only person awake in the house. The baby Anthony was asleep on the lounge in the lounge room. There was an electric lamp without a shade on the arm of the lounge. The lamp was switched. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Recalde had a shot of heroin in the lounge room. It was late in the night of 24 February or in the early hours of the next morning. He became unconscious for a short while. He fell over and knocked the lamp. When he woke up the bulb of the electric lamp was resting against the baby's forehead. It was burning him. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Recalde picked the baby up and took him to the kitchen. A wet tea towel was used to try and comfort the baby who was distressed due to the burn. 
        
       
       
        
        Some time later Mr Recalde was holding the baby in his arms. He went to the kitchen to boil water in preparation of another shot of heroin. While he was doing this some boiling water spilled on Mr Recalde's bare chest. He jumped. He threw the baby onto the kitchen bench. The baby hit his head hard on the bench and then fell onto the floor. He was quiet. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Recalde then put him into his cot in the bedroom. He knew the baby was hurt but did not check the baby until later in the afternoon. When he did check the baby was cold to touch. At that stage Mr Recalde woke Margaret Boyce and told her there was something wrong with the baby. 
        
       
       
        
        After that Mr Recalde tried to make a phone call from a public phone but it was busy. He rode his motorcycle to the phone booth and back. When he returned to the house he was told that the police had been called. Warrants for his arrest were in existence and he had drugs in his possession. He left the scene. 
        
       
       
        
        Some days later Mr Recalde and Margaret Boyce went together to the Byron Bay area where he was eventually arrested."" 
        
       
      
    20   In the hearing of the proceedings on sentence I indicated that I had misgivings about this statement. It seems to me that parts of it lack plausibility and parts of it are difficult to reconcile with the opinions expressed by the pathologist who conducted the post-mortem examination and by the expert paediatricians who supplied reports to the Crown. The statement offers no explanation of a number of injuries on the baby's body which were observed by the pathologist and the statement leaves a number of questions unanswered. 
     
      
    21   I recognise that there were serious difficulties in the way of the Crown establishing what really happened on 24 and 25 February 1998. The baby's mother gave the police two conflicting accounts of what she had observed and did not claim in either account that she had herself observed the prisoner in any way injure the baby. The baby's mother failed to appear on the date fixed for the commencement of the trial and her whereabouts were then unknown. She may still be favourably disposed to the prisoner but, on the limited evidence available, I do not make any finding on this matter. 
     
      
    22   None of the visitors to the house on 25 February 1998 observed the prisoner ill-treating the baby or even saw the baby. The prisoner has not made any admissions to police or the prosecution authorities, apart from giving the version of events set out in the statement of facts signed by him. What he has said to other persons about the death of the baby has been guarded. In seeking to prove any facts more adverse to the prisoner than those contained in the statement of facts the Crown would have had to discharge the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    23   In the circumstances, I am bound to put aside any misgivings I might feel and to sentence the prisoner on the basis of the facts in the statement of facts which he has sworn to be true and upon which the Crown has not sought to cross-examine him. 
     
      
    24   According to this statement of facts, the burn on the baby's forehead was caused by the prisoner unintentionally knocking over a light. The baby received its fatal injuries when the prisoner threw the baby on to a bench in the kitchen. As the Crown has accepted a plea of guilty to manslaughter and I am sentencing the prisoner for the offence of manslaughter and not murder, I must sentence him on the basis that in throwing the baby the prisoner did not intend to kill the baby or to inflict any really serious bodily injury on the baby. 
     
      
    25   From the nature of the baby's injuries I am able to infer beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner threw the baby with considerable force. The act of throwing was not premeditated and happened after boiling water had spilled on the prisoner's bare skin. 
     
      
    26   A circumstance of aggravation is that, although the prisoner knew the baby was hurt, he did not seek medical attention for the baby and did not check the baby until the following afternoon. At the time of committing the offence the prisoner was affected by drugs and was engaged in the process of preparing drugs to administer to himself. 
     
      
    27   The prisoner's subjective circumstances are set out in a pre-sentence report, in a report by Dr Jonathan M Carne, psychiatrist, who saw the prisoner on 18 August 2000 and a report by Mr Gregory Fathers, psychologist, who saw the prisoner on 19 July 2000 and I have taken all of those reports into account. 
     
      
    28   The prisoner was born on 4 September 1974. He was accordingly twenty-three years old at the time of committing the offence and is now twenty-six years old . The prisoner was born in Australia but his family is of South American origin. He was brought up strictly but there is no evidence that he was subjected to any emotional or physical abuse. He was a slow learner at school and had difficulty making friends. When he was about thirteen years old his father died. His behaviour deteriorated after his father's death and under the influence of older friends he developed a dependency on cannabis, heroin and amphetamines which led to involvement in criminal activities. He left school at the age of fifteen years, having made little progress. After leaving school he successfully completed a number of TAFE courses in panelbeating, spraypainting, mechanics and fibreglassing. He has been employed as a cabinetmaker's assistant and in fibreglassing but he has also had periods of unemployment. He had been unemployed for some time at the time he committed the offence. 
     
      
    29   The prisoner's mother has maintained contact with her son by regularly visiting him in prison and she attended the hearing of the proceedings on sentence. 
     
      
    30   Before entering into his relationship with the baby's mother the prisoner had a relationship for about four years with another woman, who, like Margaret Boyce, was several years older than the prisoner and had a number of children. During his relationship with Margaret Boyce, both he and she were regular heavy drug users. 
     
      
    31   Doctor Carne found no evidence that the prisoner suffered from any psychiatric illness. The prisoner has a previous criminal history with a number of convictions for offences of dishonesty, drug offences and driving offences and he has served short terms of imprisonment. In 1996 he was convicted of assaulting by head-butting the thirteen year old son of the woman with whom he was then living.  
     
      
    32   When he was in prison before he was released on bail, the prisoner was seriously assaulted by other prisoners. Since this assault he has, while in prison, been subjected to a form of protective custody known as 'strict protection non-association'. According to a letter written by the prisoner which was not challenged by the Crown and which I am prepared to accept, the prisoner is confined to his cell 24 hours a day for all but twenty minutes of each day. He cannot undertake any employment or attend any classes. At night he is verbally abused by other inmates yelling at him from their cells. I accept the prisoner will serve the sentence I impose on a strict form of protection and that this is a more than usually onerous form of custody. 
     
      
    33   While in custody the prisoner has been on a methadone programme for drug addiction. According to Dr Carne's report, the prisoner has hepatitis C and I accept that he does. 
     
      
    34   The prisoner pleaded guilty and I give credit for his plea of guilty. I accept that he pleaded guilty as soon as the Crown indicated it would be prepared to accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter. 
     
      
    35   There was in my opinion a strong circumstantial case against the prisoner. The pathologist examined the baby's body on 26 February 1998 and found the injuries which I have described. The pathologist and the expert paediatricians consulted by the Crown were firmly of the opinion that the injuries to the baby could not have been caused by the baby accidentally injuring himself. If the baby's mother was eliminated, the prisoner was the only person who would have had the opportunity of inflicting the injuries. On the other hand, it is true that the case against the prisoner was circumstantial and that the baby's mother was herself a drug user, had given conflicting accounts of what she said had happened, had not claimed to have observed the prisoner inflict any injury on the baby and had failed to come to Court for the prisoner's trial. At the time of entering his plea of guilty to manslaughter the prisoner knew the baby's mother had failed to come to Court. 
     
      
    36   While I accept that the prisoner should receive some credit for his plea of guilty I would not accept the submission made by counsel for the prisoner that the present case comes within the principle discussed in R v. Ellis (1986) 5 NSWLR 603, as being a case where, were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, it was unlikely that guilt would have been discovered and established. In the present case, in my opinion, it is not correct that, but for the prisoner coming forward, it was unlikely that his guilt would have been discovered and established. I have decided that because of the plea of guilty I should discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by about ten per cent. 
     
      
    37   In sentencing the prisoner I take into account the prisoner's age. I accept that he experiences some remorse. He has some prospects of rehabilitation. He has family support from his mother and he will be serving the sentence on a strict form of protection. I take into account that the prisoner served a discrete period of pre-sentence custody of three months five days. 
     
      
    38   I find special circumstances within section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in the prisoner's youth, his drug addiction, the fact he will serve his sentence in strict protection and his need for a proportionally longer than usual period of supervised liberty after he is released from prison. 
     
      
    39   I was referred to number of sentencing decisions for the offence of manslaughter, which illustrate the wide range of sentences which have been imposed for this kind of offence. I was referred by counsel for the prisoner to the decision of Justice Studdert in R v Howard 31 August 2000, where his Honour imposed a sentence of seven and a half years with a non-parole period of five and a half years. 
     
      
    40   The Crown referred me to number of decisions. One of the decisions the Crown referred me to was the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Murdoch (unreported) 10 December 1998, dismissing the prisoner's appeal against a sentence imposed by Justice McInerney. However, Murdoch's conduct involved deliberate, calculated abuse of a child, including placing the child under a cold shower on a freezing day, and the facts which the Crown has accepted in the present case are less serious than the facts in Murdoch's case. 
     
      
    41   Mr Recalde, for the offence of manslaughter I sentence you to imprisonment for nine years commencing on 19 June 2000. I set a non-parole period of six years commencing on 19 June 2000 and expiring on 18 June 2006. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 19 June 2006.

      70214/99 - REGINA v HUNG DUC DANG 
       
        
       
      SENTENCE 
      
     1   HIS HONOUR: On 22 May 2000 Hung Duc Dang, whom I will refer to as Dang or the prisoner, was indicted before me on charges that: 
     
      
      1. On 25 April 1999 he murdered John Laurence Hammond. 
       
       
      2. On 25 April 1999 in the company of Nhat Thang Ton he robbed Monica Kaskardi of a lady’s handbag. 
       
       
      3. On 25 April 1999 he used a knife to prevent lawful apprehension (this was a charge of an offence under s33B of the  
      Crimes Act 
      ) 
       
      
    2   Dang pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder and guilty to the other two charges. 
     
      
    3   On 4 February 2000 Nhat Thang Ton, whom I will refer to as Ton, had pleaded guilty to a charge of murdering Mr Hammond. On 3 November 2000 Adams J sentenced Ton for the murder of Mr Hammond to a term of imprisonment of 22 years, with a non-parole period of 14 years. 
     
      
    4   On 22 May 2000, after the prisoner had pleaded not guilty to the charge of murdering Mr Hammond, a jury was empanelled for the purpose of trying him on that charge. However, before the jury had heard any evidence, a voir dire was commenced for the purpose of determining the admissibility of parts of an interview of the prisoner conducted by police on 26 April 1999. One objection to the admissibility of these parts of the interview was that after the prisoner had been arrested on the night of 25 April 1999 contraventions of part 10A of the Crimes Act had occurred and, accordingly, evidence of answers given by the prisoner in the interview should not be admitted because it was evidence which had been obtained improperly or in contravention of Australian law and which, accordingly, should be excluded, in accordance with s 138 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    5   The voir dire enquiry lasted many days. After the first week I considered I had no option but to discharge the jury and I proceeded to discharge the jury. On 8 June 2000 I announced my decision that evidence of answers given by the prisoner in the interview on 26 April 1999, which had been objected to, was admissible. However, by 8 June 2000, the time allocated for the holding of the trial had almost expired and it was necessary to stand over the trial to a date to be fixed. 
     
      
    6   A fresh trial commenced on 16 October this year. In this trial evidence of answers given by the prisoner in the interview on 26 April 1999 was admitted. The trial was a short one. On 23 October the jury returned verdicts of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. 
     
      
    7   In the trial the Crown Prosecutor did not allege that the prisoner Dang had by his own act killed Mr Hammond. The Crown accepted that it was Ton who had killed Mr Hammond by stabbing him with a knife. The Crown case against the prisoner on both murder and manslaughter was that the prisoner was guilty under an application of the doctrine of common purpose. 
     
      
    8   The nature of the Crown case against the prisoner on the allegation of manslaughter can be seen from the written directions, which, with the concurrence of both counsel, I gave the jury. In outline, I directed the jury that, to establish that Dang was guilty of manslaughter, it was necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that: 
     
      
    9   (1) Dang and Ton entered into a joint criminal enterprise to rob Miss Kaskardi. 
     
      
      (2) Ton had committed at least the offence of manslaughter of Mr Hammond by stabbing Mr Hammond with a knife. 
       
      (3) Ton had committed this offence in the course of carrying out the joint criminal enterprise to rob Miss Kaskardi. 
       
      (4) at all material times Dang knew that Ton had the knife which Ton used to stab Mr Hammond. 
      
    10   (5) at all material times Dang knew that in the course of the carrying out of the joint enterprise to rob Miss Kaskardi Ton might do an unlawful and dangerous act with the knife by stabbing someone, otherwise than in self-defence but nevertheless Dang, having that contemplation, continued to participate in the joint criminal enterprise to rob Miss Kaskardi. 
     
      
    11   To prove some of these elements of manslaughter, and in particular elements (4) and (5), the Crown relied on what it said were admissions made by Dang in answers in the interview on 26 April 1999. 
     
      
    12   It is necessary to find the principal objective facts of the three offences for which I am sentencing the prisoner. In finding these facts I will apply, as far as applicable, the statements of principle set out by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Isaacs (1997) 90 A Crim R 587 at 591-2. 
     
      
    13   Many of the facts I am about to state were not disputed at the trial and a number of the other facts, although disputed at the trial, must be taken to have been established to the satisfaction of the jury beyond reasonable doubt, in order for the jury to have arrived at their verdict of guilty of manslaughter. 
     
      
    14   The prisoner and the co-offender Ton are young men who were aged 19 and 20 respectively as at 25 April 1999, who were of Vietnamese origin, who had migrated to Australia as children, who had attended the same school in western Sydney and who were acquainted with each other. On the evening of 25 April 1999 Dang and Ton travelled into the centre of Sydney in a car driven by Ton. Ton had two knives. On the trip into the centre of the city Ton gave Dang one of the knives. Dang knew that Ton was keeping one knife for himself. Ton parked the car in Pitt Street, near the corner of Campbell Street, and Dang and Ton walked to Castlereagh Street. 
     
      
    15   At about five to nine on the evening of 25 April 1999, Miss Monica Kaskardi, a 19 year old student, left her unit in Elizabeth Street to walk to a restaurant in George Street. She made a withdrawal of cash at an automatic teller machine at a branch of a bank between Bathurst and Liverpool Streets. After she had made the withdrawal, she put the cash in her wallet and put the wallet in her handbag, which she was carrying with its strap over her shoulder. She then started walking in a southerly direction down Castlereagh Street towards Liverpool Street. Ton and Dang decided to rob Miss Kaskardi of her handbag. They walked up behind her and Dang grabbed Miss Kaskardi's handbag. At the time Dang grabbed the handbag Ton was standing close to him. Miss Kaskardi felt her handbag being grabbed and she tried to retain hold of her handbag. The strap of the handbag broke and Dang ran off with the handbag. Ton ran off with Dang. 
     
      
    16   Initially, Dang and Ton ran together, being chased by Miss Kaskardi. However, Dang and Ton then separated. Dang turned right out of Castlereagh Street into Bathurst Street, ran in an easterly direction in Bathurst Street and then turned left into Elizabeth Street. After Dang and Ton separated, Miss Kaskardi chased Dang, who was the person who had her handbag. 
     
      
    17   A group of young men heard Miss Kaskardi screaming, saw Dang running holding the bag, saw Ms Kaskardi running in a distressed state and they ran after the prisoner. In Elizabeth Street they saw the prisoner hiding behind a pylon near a building. Two men in this group, Yakup Erkilic and Phillip Marino, cornered the prisoner and jumped on him; a scuffle ensued. During the scuffle the prisoner drew the knife he had earlier been given by Ton. Mr Marino sustained a cut from the knife to his wrist but fortunately was not seriously injured. The use by the prisoner of the knife with the intent of preventing his being apprehended by Mr Erkilic and Mr Marino led to the charge under s 33B of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    18   Mr Erkilic and Mr Marino overpowered the prisoner and Mr Erkilic began frog-marching the prisoner in the direction of the police station near the Town Hall. On the way a police vehicle arrived and Mr Erkilic handed over the prisoner to one of the police officers. The prisoner was formally arrested by one of the police officers. He has remained in custody every since. 
     
      
    19   After the prisoner was arrested by the police, he was first taken to Sydney Hospital for medical attention for minor injuries he had received in the scuffle with Mr Erkilic and Mr Marino. 
     
      
    20   At about 3 o'clock in the morning of 26 April 1999 he was taken to the Sydney Central Police Station. The interview of the prisoner by the police commenced at about a quarter to six. 
     
      
    21   I have already noted that, after initially running together after robbing Miss Kaskarki of her handbag, the prisoner and Ton separated. After they had separated Mr Hammond, the victim of the offence of murder by Ton and manslaughter by the prisoner, endeavoured to apprehend Ton and took hold of Ton. The following statement of what subsequently happened is taken from Adams J's remarks on sentence in sentencing Ton, a copy of which was admitted into evidence in the present proceedings on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Hammond produced a cover for an official police notebook (which he had been given by a friend) and said he was a police officer. A struggle took place. The offender took a knife out of his pocket and stabbed Mr Hammond twice in the left side of his chest. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that when he stabbed Mr Hammond, the offender mistakenly believed that he was a police officer. Mr Hammond let go and the offender fled. Some on-duty fire fighters nearby heard the commotion and emerged from the fire station to see the offender fleeing and Mr Hammond clutching his side and calling for help. First aid was immediately given and an ambulance called but, a little time after he was taken to hospital, Mr Hammond died."" 
        
       
      
    22   The present prisoner was not present when Ton stabbed Mr Hammond and he did not find out that Ton had stabbed Mr Hammond or that Mr Hammond had died, until some time after Mr Hammond's death. After stabbing Mr Hammond, Ton made good his escape. However, he was arrested by police a day or two later and charged with the murder of Mr Hammond. 
     
      
    23   Some of the more important objective facts of the three offences for which I am sentencing the prisoner can be summarised as follows. The robbery for which I am sentencing the prisoner was a robbery in company committed with Ton. The prisoner was the principal offender, in the sense that it was he who snatched the handbag and subsequently carried away the handbag. The offence was not planned in advance by the prisoner and Ton but they had reached a mutual understanding that, if the opportunity arose to snatch a handbag, they would take the opportunity. The prisoner, although carrying the knife Ton had given him, did not use the knife in robbing Miss Kaskardi of her handbag. There was no actual physical violence to Miss Kaskardi, over and above the snatching of the handbag. When the handbag was taken, Miss Kaskardi was seriously distressed. 
     
      
    24   The offence under s 33B of the Crimes Act was committed when the prisoner, having robbed the young woman of her handbag and having been chased by civilians, was cornered by his pursuers and, in those circumstances, drew a knife with the intent of preventing his being arrested. He was not charged with malicious wounding and the evidence does not permit a finding beyond reasonable doubt that he deliberately stabbed Mr Marino. 
     
      
    25   The prisoner is to be sentenced for the killing of Mr Hammond, on the basis that he has been convicted, not of murder, of which he has been found not guilty by the jury, but of the lesser offence of manslaughter. He is to be sentenced for manslaughter on the basis, not that he himself did the act of stabbing which caused Mr Hammond's death, but that he knew that Ton had a knife and he knew that in the carrying out of the joint enterprise to rob Miss Kaskardi Ton might do an act of stabbing with the knife which a reasonable person would realise carried an appreciable risk of causing serious injury. Consistently with the jury's verdict of not guilty of murder, he is to be sentenced on the basis that he did not contemplate that Ton might do an act of stabbing with the knife with the intention of killing or with the intention of causing really serious bodily injury. As I have already remarked, he was not present when Ton stabbed Mr Hammond; he did not encourage Ton to stab Mr Hammond; and he did not know Ton had stabbed Mr Hammond until some time later. 
     
      
    26   The facts of the three offences are objectively serious and the sentences to be imposed must take into account the objective seriousness of the offences. 
     
      
    27   I turn to the subjective circumstances of the prisoner. 
     
      
    28   The prisoner was born on 16 December 1979. He was accordingly 19 years old at the time the offences were committed and has now just turned 21. He has no previous criminal convictions. 
     
      
    29   The prisoner gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence. What he said was very similar to the family and social history he gave Associate Professor Susan Hayes of the Department of Behavioural Sciences in Medicine of the University of Sydney, who saw the prisoner on 17 November 2000 and furnished a report on 20 November 2000. The following extract is taken from Professor Hayes' report: 
     
      
       
        
        ""At the time of the assessment Mr Dang was one month short of his 21st birthday. He was born in Vietnam and when he was about ten the family migrated from Vietnam to Australia. His family consists of his father, his mother and a sister who is two years older than Mr Dang. He also has a niece, the sister's daughter, who is aged three and who lives with the family. His father works at the Bankstown airport and his mother works in a shoe manufacturing business. Prior to arriving in Australia Mr Dang attended school in Vietnam. His father came to Australia before the rest of the family and then brought the family over. Mr Dang lived in Vietnam with his uncle and grandparents as well as his mother and sister, during the years that his father was absent in Australia. When he arrived in Australia he went into grade four at Chullora Primary School, then attended Birrong Primary School, followed by Birrong Boys High School. He said that he did the Higher School Certificate, but did not do well and so he started a matriculation course at the Ultimo TAFE. After the Easter break there was a big reduction in the number of people in the class and for some reason he changed to a course in bar-tending. He then looked for work. He was a process worker at Sefton for a while and then worked as a casual employee in a bistro at Yagoona. Prior to that whilst he was still at school he had work experience at Best and Less. He was also worked at Pizza Hut. His last job before being in prison was at the bistro, in about February 1999. Between February and April 1999 he did a hospitality course. During the time that he was undertaking study he received Austudy. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Dang informed me that he previously smoked marihuana and took Ecstasy tablets. He denied any use of heroin. He says that he did not drink very much alcohol. He claims that he had not taken any substances on the day of the offence, although he indicated that he probably needed money for drugs on that day. He claims that he has not had any illicit substances since he has been in prison. He says that his drug use was on an irregular basis and was recreational. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Dang lived with his family until early 1999 and then moved out of the house to live with his girlfriend and his sister. He had been having a relationship with his girlfriend for 18 months prior to his imprisonment. He says that his girlfriend, who is a receptionist, broke up with him about a month before the offence occurred. The relationship has resumed since she found out that he is in prison. The reason for the breakup, which was to some extent mutual, was because they were arguing over little things. He said that after the breakup and leading up to the time of the offences, he felt very sad and would just sit around, not wanting to do anything. He says that his sleeping pattern was not disturbed and his appetite was not affected and nor did he have suicidal ideation. It appears that he may have had some mild depression."" 
        
       
      
    30   Professor Hayes' conclusions in her report, which I accept, were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""At the time of the assessment Mr Dang was nearly 21 years of age, a quiet, solemn man who appeared to co-operate well with the assessment, although his answers were very brief. Mr Dang is of average intelligence, although he has low average psycholinguistic abilities. Nevertheless, these areas of functioning are in the low average category and do not indicate any severe impairment or disability. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Dang did not report any symptoms which are consistent with psychiatric illness now or at the time of the offences in April 1999. He reported some involvement with marihuana and Ecstasy in the period leading up to the offences. According to his report, the idea to snatch the bag was impulsive and unplanned. He had little insight into his motivation as to why he was carrying a knife at the time. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Dang reports that since he has been in prison he has been 'stressed out' and has suffered from racing thoughts and nervousness. He tries to pass the time by doing exercise. He says that because he is still on remand, he has not enrolled in any courses. When he was at Goulburn he worked in the sewing room. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Dang expresses remorse at the consequences of his actions and says that he wishes he could say sorry to the victims and their families. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Dang appeared to have difficulties in understanding his own motivations on the day of the offences, particularly his motivation in participating in the bag snatch and carrying a knife. In part, the difficulty that he has with insight into his own actions may be related to his low average level of verbal reasoning. It could also be related to cultural differences in admitting to and acknowledging personal motivations in a situation such as this. Nevertheless, I consider that it is important for Mr Dang to be able to articulate and understand his own feelings and emotions and gain some insight into how these influence his behaviour. I recommended that he participate in counselling. Because there seems to be some indirect drug involvement in the offences, he should also undertake drug and alcohol counselling and be supervised to ensure that he does not revert to substance abuse after he is released from prison. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Dang said that after he is released from prison he intends to live with his parents and do a TAFE course in marketing management. He says that he does not intend to return to illicit substance use. 
        
       
       
        
        As noted above, Mr Dang does not appear to have any psychiatric symptoms which would have been relevant to the offence or which would render him dangerous in future."" 
        
       
      
    31   In his evidence the prisoner stated that since he has been in custody he has been on protection, ie subject to more than usually onerous conditions of imprisonment. I am prepared to infer he is likely to remain on protection while serving the sentence I impose. 
     
      
    32   In his evidence he expressed regret for what he had done and apologised for the death of Mr Hammond. He said in evidence he intends after he is sentenced to undertake a course of study in prison. He has not been able to undertake a course of study pending his being sentenced. 
     
      
    33   I have received and read victim impact statements by Mrs Marion Hammond, Mr Hammond's widow, on behalf of herself and her young daughter, and Mrs Dorothy Hammond, Mr Hammond's mother. 
     
      
    34   As I have already noted, a copy of the remarks on sentence of Adams J in sentencing Ton was admitted into evidence in the present proceedings on sentence. Adams J sentenced Ton only for the offence of murdering Mr Hammond. The Crown had accepted the plea of guilty by Ton to the charge of murder in full discharge of the other charges against Ton, including a charge of robbery in company of Miss Kaskardi committed with Dang. Adams J, of course, sentenced Ton for the offence of murder and not the offence of manslaughter and as being the person who had himself done the act causing the death of Mr Hammond. Ton had in fact stabbed Mr Hammond twice with the knife. Adams J found that Ton had stabbed Mr Hammond as impetuous, impulsive responses to his being apprehended. His Honour noted it was common ground between the Crown and Ton's defence lawyers that in stabbing Mr Hammond Ton had not had the intention of killing Mr Hammond but had had the intention of causing him grievous bodily harm, that is, really serious bodily injury. 
     
      
    35   Adams J found as a circumstance of aggravation that Ton at the time of stabbing Mr Hammond believed that the person he was stabbing was a police officer. 
     
      
    36   Ton, like Dang, was of Vietnamese origin and had come to Australia as a child, although he had arrived in Australia when he was younger than Dang. Adams J found that as at 25 April 1999 Ton was a heroin addict who was withdrawing from heroin and he may not have reacted as he did to Mr Hammond’s intervention, if he had been unaffected by drugs. Ton had, of course, pleaded guilty and Adams J said he was reducing the sentence he would otherwise have imposed by 20 per cent by reason of the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    37   Adams J found special circumstances within s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in Ton's youth, the nature of the offence and its context including his drug addiction and the need for a longer than usual period of supervision on parole. 
     
      
    38   In the proceedings on sentence the Crown made inter alia the following submissions. As regards the offence of robbery in company, the Crown Prosecutor referred to the statement of Gleeson CJ (as he then was) in R v Ranse, unreported Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 August 1994, in which his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""One primary purpose of criminal justice is to keep the peace and that includes the freedom of ordinary citizens to walk the streets and go about their daily affairs without fear of physical violence and with respect being accorded to their property rights."" 
        
       
      
    39   While acknowledging the present offence is an offence of robbery in company and not armed robbery, the Crown submitted that the offence of robbery in company committed by Dang exhibited many of the features of the paradigm case described by Spigelman CJ at paragraph (162) of his Honour's judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, the guidelines judgment on sentences for armed robbery, in that Dang is a young offender with no criminal history, that, while not using the knife to rob Miss Kaskardi, he was carrying a knife, that there was only a limited degree of planning and that there was little, if any, actual violence, that Miss Kaskardi was a young woman who at an ATM in a street at night was in a vulnerable position, that only a small amount of money was taken and that there had been a plea of guilty in a case in which the Crown case was very strong. In R v Henry, Spigelman CJ said that sentences for an offence of armed robbery having the characteristics described in the paradigm case, should fall between four and five years for the full term. I accept that what Spigelman CJ said in R v Henry, while not directly applicable, affords some measure of guidance to sentencing Dang for the offence of robbery in company. 
     
      
    40   As regards the offence of manslaughter, the Crown submitted it should make little difference that the victim, Mr Hammond, was not a police officer. The Crown stressed the need for condign sentences for offences in which knives are carried or used. 
     
      
    41   In the proceedings on sentence counsel for the prisoner made inter alia the following submissions. The robbery in company committed by Dang was a simple, foolish, impulsive crime and neither offender had used or even drawn his knife in effecting the robbery. It was submitted that the offence under s 33B of the Crimes Act had been committed when the prisoner perceived himself as being cornered by two or more men and in danger of being subjected to physical violence and the prisoner had pulled out the knife he had been given by Ton in what he perceived to be a means of defending himself. It was conceded by counsel that no legal defence of self-defence was available to the prisoner. The prisoner had pleaded guilty to both the offence of robbery in company and the offence under s 33B of the Crimes Act and should receive some credit for pleading guilty. He had not pleaded guilty to any charge of homicide, because he could not understand how he could be responsible for the death of Mr Hammond and, in any event, the charge which the Crown had continued to press was a charge of murder, of which the jury acquitted him. Any lack of acceptance of the jury's verdict of guilty of manslaughter exhibited in the prisoner's evidence in the proceedings on sentence was to be attributed, not to defiance of the Court or to a lack of contrition, but to the prisoner's continuing lack of understanding of his legal responsibility for Mr Hammond's death under the doctrine of common purpose. 
     
      
    42   It was submitted that Adams J in sentencing Ton had regarded it as an act of aggravation that Ton believed that the person he was stabbing was a police officer. Dang, of course, had no knowledge of who Ton was stabbing or of any belief Ton might have had about who it was he was stabbing. 
     
      
    43   I am sentencing the prisoner for three offences, manslaughter, robbery in company and using a knife with intent to prevent lawful apprehension. I am required to apply what McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said in their joint judgment in Pearce v R (1998) 72 ALJR 416 at paragraph 45, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The judge sentencing must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of accumulation or concurrence as well as, of course, questions of totality."" 
        
       
      
    44   It is not legitimate to have regard only to the total effective sentence which should be imposed on the prisoner, although the principle of totality has an important part to play. 
     
      
    45   I have decided that I should impose sentences for the three offences in the following manner, which I outlined to counsel in the proceedings on sentence and to which neither counsel raised any objection. The sentence for the offence of manslaughter should be the heaviest sentence and that should be served cumulatively upon the sentence for the other two offences. The sentences for the offences of robbery in company and using a knife with intent to prevent lawful apprehension should be lesser sentences, should be served concurrently with each other and should be the first sentences to be served. The sentences for those two offences should be served concurrently, because the two offences are closely connected, the offence of using a knife with intent to prevent lawful apprehension being committed by the prisoner to prevent his apprehension for the offence of robbery. The sentence for those two offences will be fixed terms of imprisonment, because if I were to set a non-parole period and a parole period, any parole period would be subsumed in the non-parole period for the offence of manslaughter. The sentence for the offence of manslaughter should contain a proportionally longer than usual parole period, because the first two sentences will not contain any parole period and the sentence for manslaughter should contain a parole period which bears an appropriate relationship to the total of the sentences. 
     
      
    46   As I indicate later in these remarks, there are circumstances which are special circumstances within s 44 of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act. As stated in the passage in the joint judgment in Pearce quoted by me, because I am setting two sentences to be served concurrently or partly concurrently and then a sentence to be served cumulatively on the first two sentences, it is necessary to have regard to the sentencing principle of totality. This principle will require some adjustment downward of the sentences which would have been imposed, if each had been the only sentence being imposed, in order to achieve an appropriate relationship between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences. 
     
      
    47   It was accepted by both the Crown Prosecutor and defence counsel in the proceedings on sentence that there should be some degree of proportionality, but not parity, between the sentence to be imposed on the prisoner for the offence of manslaughter and the sentence which was imposed by Adams J on the co-offender Ton in relation to the offence of murder. However, the very considerable differences between Dang and Ton, including the different offences of murder and manslaughter of which they have been convicted, their very different roles in the death of Mr Hammond, their very different criminal mental states and the application in Dang's case of sentencing principles of totality because I am sentencing him for other offences as well, will produce the consequence that the sentence to be imposed on Dang for the offence of manslaughter will he less, and substantially less, than the sentence imposed on Ton for the offence of murder. 
     
      
    48   The prisoner pleaded guilty to the offences of robbery in company and using an offensive weapon and I will allow some credit for the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty to those offences. However, the amount of the credit I allow is only slight. After robbing Miss Kaskardi, the prisoner was chased and apprehended and the Crown case against him for those offences was overwhelmingly strong. 
     
      
    49   I have already stated the objective facts and have noted some of the more important of those objective facts. I take into account the prisoner’s subjective circumstances, including inter alia his youth, his lack of any previous criminal convictions, the fact that he will serve the sentence on protection and what I find to be some prospect of rehabilitation. I accept that he experiences some contrition but only to a limited extent. At the time of the interview on 26 April 1999 he thought the taking of Miss Kaskardi’s handbag was a “small” thing and it appears to me that he still regards this offence as minor. In the proceedings on sentence he still claimed he had been carrying the knife for self-defence. I accept that, so far as the offence of manslaughter is concerned, it is still difficult for him to understand how he could be legally responsible for the death of Mr Hammond. In the proceedings on sentence he expressed sorrow for the death of Mr Hammond and apologised to his relatives and I am prepared to accept he experiences some contrition. 
     
      
    50   I have already stated that the non-parole period in regard to the sentence for manslaughter should be less than three quarters of that sentence, because the period during which the prisoner is eligible for release on parole should bear an appropriate relationship to the totality of the sentences I will be imposing and not merely to the sentence for manslaughter. In addition, it was submitted on behalf of the prisoner and accepted by the Crown, that I should find special circumstances in the prisoner's youth, the fact the prisoner would be serving his first sentence of imprisonment and he would be serving that sentence on protection and in any event, the prisoner as a youthful first offender on protection, is likely to find imprisonment more than usually difficult and is in need of a proportionally longer than usual period on parole in which an attempt could be made to address some of the matters referred to in Professor Hayes' report. The sentence will commence on 25 April 1999, the date on which the prisoner first came into custody. 
     
      
    51   Hung Duc Dang, for the offence of robbery in company I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of two and a half years commencing on 25 April 1999 and expiring on 24 October 2001. For the offence of using a knife as an offensive weapon with intent to prevent lawful apprehension I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 25 April 1999 and expiring on 24 April 2001 to be served concurrently with the sentence for robbery in company. For the offence of manslaughter I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of seven and a half years commencing on 25 October 2001. I set a non-parole period of four years commencing on 25 October 2001 and expiring on 24 October 2005.

      70058/99 - REGINA v ADAM ROSS CATALANO 
       
        
       
      SENTENCE 
      
     1   HIS HONOUR: I will deliver my remarks on sentence and pass sentence. 
     
      
    2   On 12 August 2000 at Albury Adam Catalano (who I will refer to as 'the prisoner') was indicted before me on a charge that on 13 December 1998 at Griffith he murdered Archibald Miller. To that charge the prisoner pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The Crown accepted the plea of guilty to manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment. Under section 24 of the Crimes Act the maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for twenty-five years. 
     
      
    3   On 3 August at Albury the Crown tendered as part of the proceedings on sentence a statement of agreed facts, the criminal history of the prisoner, a plan of the area where Mr Miller was killed, a number of statements, a report by the pathologist who performed the post-mortem examination of Mr Miller's body and transcripts of a number of interviews with the prisoner by the police. Counsel for the prisoner requested that I direct that a pre-sentence report be obtained. I gave this direction and the proceedings on sentence were then adjourned. 
     
      
    4   It was not possible to resume the hearing of the proceedings on sentence until 24 November in Sydney. On 24 November the Crown tendered the pre-sentence report which had been prepared and then closed its case. 
     
      
    5   The evidence in the prisoner's case on sentence which was adduced on 24 November consisted of a number of documents, including a report by a psychologist Mr John Flockton and a number of documents about the prisoner's conduct whilst in custody awaiting sentence and oral evidence by his mother Mrs Colleen Catalano and by a family friend, Mr Giuseppe Bagiente. The prisoner himself did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence. 
     
      
    6   I have taken into account all of the evidence which was given in the proceedings on sentence. In making findings of the facts of the offence for the purpose of sentencing the prisoner, I have taken into account inter alia the principle that a finding of fact adverse to the prisoner cannot be made, unless the fact has been established beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    7   The victim of the offence Archibald Miller was fifty-two years old at the time of his death. He lived alone in a makeshift camp at the railway yards at Griffith. He was of very slight physique. The pathologist who performed the post-mortem examination on his body on 14 December 1998 found that he weighed only forty kilograms. The pathologist found that part of his brain showed alcoholic degeneration. 
     
      
    8   The area in which Mr Miller's camp was situated is bounded on one side by Railway Street, Griffith. On the other side of Railway Street is a park, variously known as Kathleen Aiton Park, the CWA Park and Egg Park. It known by the last of these names because in the park there is a children's amusement ride shaped like an egg. In Egg Park there was at least one park bench constructed out of wooden slats. 
     
      
    9   Mr Miller's dead body was discovered at about 10 am on Sunday 13 December 1998. The post-mortem examination was performed on the following day, 14 December 1998. On examination of the body the pathologist found blunt force head injuries consisting of recent cerebral contusion, a traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage and extensive skull fracturing. In his report the pathologist expressed the opinion that Mr Miller had died as a result of the blunt force head injuries. The pathologist said in his report: ""The number of blows rendered to the deceased's head is difficult to definitely ascertain, however I believe that at least six blows were rendered but this is probably an underestimate"". Two flakes of paint were removed from the deceased's head during the post-mortem examination. I accept the facts stated and the opinions expressed in the post-mortem report. 
     
      
    10   The prisoner had been observed by a police officer in the early hours of the morning of 13 December 1998 in an area near the railway yards and the prisoner came under suspicion. The prisoner was interviewed by police in an electronically recorded interview on 15 December 1998. In this interview the prisoner claimed that between about 9 o'clock in the evening of Saturday 12 December 1998 and 2 o'clock in the morning of Sunday 13 December 1998 he had been in the company of a group of young people, who he named, and that he had then walked home. He denied knowing the deceased. He denied having been in the railway yards. 
     
      
    11   On 17 December 1998 the prisoner was interviewed by a police officer named Kreuzer in a recorded interview. In this interview the prisoner admitted that on the night in question he had been with the deceased. He said he had had a number of drinks with the deceased. He had left the deceased in order to urinate and when he returned after five or ten minutes the deceased was lying on the ground with blood on his head. 
     
      
    12   On 20 December 1998 another electronically recorded interview of the prisoner was conducted. In this interview the prisoner said that on the night in question he had been walking through the railway yard, had seen that the deceased was up, had gone over to the deceased, had had some drinks with the deceased and had left the deceased in order to use the toilet in Egg Park, had returned to the deceased and had discovered the deceased lying on the ground with blood on his forehead. The prisoner was allowed to leave the police station after the interview on 20 December 1998. In January 1999 he left Griffith and went to Tasmania. 
     
      
    13   The prisoner was arrested in Tasmania on 9 March 1999 and he has remained in custody ever since. The police had gathered substantial forensic evidence incriminating the prisoner in the death of Mr Miller. Two pieces of broken wood had been found, which were identified in the police investigation by the numbers 30 and 31. Item 30 was found in the railway yards not far from Mr Miller's camp. Item 31 was found in Egg Park close to Railway Street and almost opposite where item 30 was found. A fingerprint of the prisoner's was detected on item 30. In the opinion of the police fingerprint expert the prisoner's fingerprint had been put on item 30 at a time when items 30 and 31 had been parts of the same piece of wood. That piece of wood had been a slat in a park bench in Egg Park. A palm print and two fingerprints of the prisoner were detected on the park bench from which the slat had been removed. There were blood splatters on items 30 and 31. An analyst performing a DNA test found, to a very high degree of probability, that the blood on item 30 came from the deceased. A chemical analyst found that paint on item 30 was probably the same paint as the paint in the flakes removed from the deceased's head during the autopsy. The pathologist considered that the blunt force injuries to the deceased's head which he had found on an examination of the deceased's body could have been caused by striking him on the head with the slat from the park bench. 
     
      
    14   Earlier in these remarks I referred to the versions of events given by the prisoner in the interviews on 15 December, 17 December and 20 December 1998. The following statement of the facts of the offence is derived from the agreed statement of facts admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence, which differs in a number of respects from the earlier versions given by the prisoner. 
     
      
    15   In the early part of the night of Saturday 12 December 1998 the prisoner was with his brother Leo Catalano, Leo's partner and a friend. The prisoner, Leo Catalano and the friend smoked cannabis for about two hours. The group arrived back in the town of Griffith at about midnight. Leo Catalano and his partner returned to a flat in Griffith which they shared with another brother, Michael, and Michael's partner. 
     
      
    16   The prisoner wandered around the streets of Griffith for about an hour and a half. He then went to his brother's flat and spoke briefly with his brother Michael and Michael's partner and then to his brother Leo and Leo's partner. Leo gave the prisoner a small sum of money to buy some soft drink and cigarettes. The prisoner went to the vicinity of a nightclub at a hotel, bought the soft drink and attempted to enter the nightclub to buy cigarettes. He was refused entry to the nightclub. A security camera at the entrance of the nightclub photographed the prisoner at the entrance to the nightclub at 2.34 am. 
     
      
    17   After he had been refused entry to the nightclub the prisoner began to walk in the direction of his brothers’ flat. A police officer patrolling the streets of Griffith made two observations of the prisoner. The prisoner encountered a group of young people of about his age who were the people he claimed he had been with, when he was interviewed on 15 December. While he was with this group the prisoner smoked more cannabis. To the members of the group he appeared 'smashed or whacked' - that is, well-affected by cannabis. The group left the prisoner. 
     
      
    18   The prisoner went to Mr Miller's camp to get some cigarettes. While he was with Mr Miller the prisoner drank some of Mr Miller's cask wine. The prisoner thought that Mr Miller was also drinking but a later analysis of a sample of Mr Miller's blood did not show any alcohol in his blood. The prisoner asked Mr Miller for some cigarettes but Mr Miller refused to give the prisoner any. The prisoner struck Mr Miller a number of time on the head with a piece of wood which had been a slat in a bench in Egg Park. The pathologist considered that the amount of force which would have been required to cause one of the fractures sustained by Mr Miller would have been severe. During the assault the slat broke into pieces. The prisoner left Mr Miller lying on the ground and walked in the direction of Egg Park. On the way he discarded the two broken pieces of timber, which became items 30 and 31 in the police investigation. The prisoner called in at his brothers’ flat and then walked to his home on a farm, some kilometres out of Griffith. 
     
      
    19   In the hearing of the proceedings on sentence two factual issues were raised. One issue related to how the slat from the park bench had been brought to the deceased's camp and, in particular, whether the prisoner, after Mr Miller had refused to supply him with cigarettes, had left Mr Miller and gone to Egg Park and obtained the slat and then returned to the deceased's camp with the intent of assaulting Mr Miller with the slat. Although it is possible that this is what did happen, such a finding would be adverse to the prisoner and I do not consider that, on the evidence available to me, I could make it beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I do not make any finding about how the slat from the park bench was brought to the deceased's camp. 
     
      
    20   The other issue of fact is whether Mr Miller was lying down when he was first assaulted. I do not consider on the evidence available to me that I would be justified in making such a finding according to the requisite standard of proof. However, having regard to Mr Miller's physical frailty and the number and severity of the blows, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner continued to strike Mr Miller after Mr Miller had become incapable of defending himself in any way. 
     
      
    21   Some of the more salient of the objective features of the offence can be summarised by saying that the prisoner struck the victim, a physically frail person, a number of times on the head with a wooden slat and that at least one of the blows was struck with a severe degree of force. 
     
      
    22   The Crown accepted the plea of guilty to manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment and hence the Crown is to be taken as conceding, and I must sentence the prisoner on the basis, that the prisoner did not have the intent required for murder; that is, he did not intend to kill Mr Miller and he did not intend to inflict really serious bodily injury on Mr Miller. The offence was unpremeditated and the prisoner acted impulsively. There was no justification or excuse at all for the violent attack on the victim. At the time of committing the offence, the prisoner was intoxicated by the use of cannabis and alcohol. His drug addiction and his use of drugs on this occasion is no excuse. On the other hand, I accept that his mental processes were disordered by his use of cannabis and alcohol and that the violence he perpetrated on Mr Miller was out of character for the prisoner. 
     
      
    23   I turn to the subjective circumstances of the prisoner. The prisoner was born on 17 July 1980. He was accordingly eighteen years old at the time of committing the offence and is now twenty years old. He is the youngest of three children, having two older brothers. He was born and raised in Griffith. He left school early in about year 8, after a number of suspensions. After he left school he tried distance education but this was unsuccessful. 
     
      
    24   The prisoner has no vocational qualification. He has had what a parole officer described in the pre-sentence report as a variety of short-term labouring and shop assistant positions, with a longest period of employment of three months. He has worked for his father, who is a farm labourer, and has worked for Mr Bagiente. Mr Bagiente gave evidence, which I accept, that he has been a farmer in the Griffith area since 1972, that he knows the Catalano family, that the prisoner has worked for Mr Bagiente and has been a reliable worker and that Mr Bagiente will support the prisoner when he is released from prison. 
     
      
    25   The prisoner has been adversely influenced by his older brother Leo, who has been imprisoned for drug-related offences. The prisoner's relationship with his older brother led to him being exposed to drugs at an early age. 
     
      
    26   The prisoner has a minor prior criminal history of offences in the nature of larceny and stealing. There is no previous conviction for any offence of violence. I accept evidence which was given in the proceedings on sentence that, apart from committing the present offence, the prisoner has not been a violent person. 
     
      
    27   The prisoner started taking cannabis at a young age. In the period leading up to the commission of the offence he was a heavy user of cannabis on a daily basis and was using amphetamines three times a week. He was also using alcohol. He used a large amount of cannabis in the hours preceding the offence. 
     
      
    28   I take into account in the prisoner's favour that he pleaded guilty and I accept he pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity, after the Crown indicated that it would be prepared to accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter and would not press the charge of murder. The plea of guilty has utilitarian value and is also evidence of contrition. On the other hand, I consider that the Crown had a powerful circumstantial case, based on the sightings of the prisoner in the vicinity of the railway yard in the early hours of Sunday morning and the forensic evidence, particularly the fingerprint evidence, linking the prisoner with the park bench and broken slat, and the DNA evidence linking the blood on the broken slat with the deceased. The version the prisoner first gave police that he had been with a certain group of other young people between about 9 o'clock in the evening and 2 o'clock the following morning was contradicted by statements from a number of members of the group which had been obtained by the police. I have decided, in accordance with the guideline judgment in R v. Houlton that I should allow a discount of between ten and fifteen per cent for the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    29   The prisoner has attended the Alcohol and Other Drug Service at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre on a regular basis for counselling and for information on problems associated with the use of alcohol and other drugs. He has also participated in a life management programme. A Prison Chaplain has given a favourable reference about the prisoner. He also has a favourable reference from the Manager of Industries in the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre regarding his employment at the Centre. In statements to me and to a relation of the deceased he has expressed his contrition. 
     
      
    30   The consulting psychologist, Mr John Flockton, interviewed the prisoner on two occasions and also interviewed his mother and Mrs Bagiente. In his report of 22 August Mr Flockton concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Present assessment suggests intellectual ability within the low average range and without any noticeable neurological deficits. His employment history is marked by successive dismissals usually due to reported inability on Adam's part to meet task requirements. This is consistent with indications from intellectual assessment of relatively slow information processing ability possibly related to dependent use of cannabis. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to particular issues raised on referral there is no evidence of clinical psychosis or mental disorder. Acute and transient persecutory thoughts, referred to by Adam as paranoia in being apprehended or harassed by police, are noted, particularly at the time of cannabis use. There is, however, no evidence of an hallucinatory or delusional quality to these thoughts. 
        
       
       
        
        Adam has had early exposure to negative subcultural and peer influences including his older brother which have increased both his vulnerability and access to illegal drug use. His mother's report of a six week period of living with his elder brother and associated access to illicit drugs in the six months period prior to the offence is of note. 
        
       
       
        
        It is likely Adam experienced progressive disappointment, frustration and hopelessness and his inability to maintain employment leading with time to emergent signs of clinical depression. As often occurs, sedative type drugs such as cannabis and alcohol can be used to self-medicate underlying psychological disturbance and mood disorders, as is probably the case with Adam. Adam has confirmed periodic binge drinking, which, when combined with heavy cannabis use as reportedly occurred immediately preceding the current offence, may have led to a gross impairment in judgment. 
        
       
       
        
        There is otherwise little indication from Adam of criminal or antisocial orientation. As best as can be determined, he presents with genuine remorse and a deep empathic understanding of the impact of his actions on the family of the victim and most noticeably his mother”. 
        
       
      
    31   I accept all of these opinions of Mr Flockton, including that there was some impairment in judgment at the time the offence was committed. I accept the evidence of the prisoner's mother and Mr Bagiente that, when the prisoner is released from custody, he will be able to live with his parents and he would have prospects of obtaining employment with Mr Bagiente. 
     
      
    32   On the basis of the evidence in the pre-sentence report, I am satisfied that the prisoner is contrite, that he has prospects of rehabilitation and that he is unlikely to re-offend, provided he does not relapse into drug and alcohol dependency. 
     
      
    33   In submissions the Crown Prosecutor stressed the objective seriousness of the doing of acts which resulted in the loss of a human life. The Crown Prosecutor also laid stress on the age and slight physique and vulnerability of the victim. The Crown, while accepting there is no tariff for sentences for manslaughter and that only limited assistance can be gained by reference to other individual cases, submitted that there was some similarity between the present case and R v Brown (unreported) Court of Criminal Appeal 13 July 1993, in which the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed a prisoner's appeal against a sentence of nine years, with a minimum term of six years and an additional term of three years. I note that there are some differences between the present case and R v Brown, for example in R v Brown the offence was committed in the company of a co-offender. 
     
      
    34   Counsel for the prisoner in his submissions referred particularly to the prisoner's plea of guilty, his youth, the absence of any relevant criminal antecedents, the absence of any other episodes of violent conduct, the prisoner's dysfunctional early life and the circumstance that the prisoner, because of his youth, would be likely to find imprisonment in an adult gaol more than usually onerous. 
     
      
    35   Counsel for the prisoner submitted that some guidance to a proper sentence in the present case could be derived from the sentencing decisions in R v Grenenger (1999) New South Wales Supreme Court 380, 23 April 1999, Sully J, in which a sentence of three years with a minimum term of eighteen months and an additional term of 18 months was imposed and R v T M (1999) New South Wales Supreme Court 504, 28 May 1999, Hidden J, in which a sentence of five years with a minimum term of three years and an additional term of two years was imposed. It seems to me that the facts of the present case call for a heavier sentence than was imposed in those two cases. 
     
      
    36   Counsel for the prisoner submitted I should find there are special circumstances within section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in the prisoner's need for continuing counselling and assistance in dealing with his problems with alcohol and drug dependency, in his youth, in the circumstance that the prisoner has since 9 March 1999 spent and will continue to spend some of his more important formative years in an adult prison and in the circumstance that the prisoner has demonstrated by his conduct while in custody that he has prospects of rehabilitation. The Crown conceded I should find there are special circumstances and I find special circumstances as submitted by counsel for the prisoner. 
     
      
    37   The sentence I impose will commence from 9 March 1999, the prisoner having been continuously in custody since that date. In setting the sentence I have endeavoured to take into account all the objective facts of the offence and all of the subjective circumstances of the prisoner. 
     
      
    38   Adam Ross Catalano, I sentence you to imprisonment for seven and a half years. I set a non-parole period of 4 and a half years commencing on 9 March 1999 and expiring on 8 September 2003. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 9 September 2003.

     Regina v Matthew James HARRIS 
      
    The respondent pleaded guilty to three counts of murder pursuant to s19A of the Crimes Act 1900 and one count of armed robbery in company pursuant to s97(1) Crimes Act 1900. He was sentenced to 40 years imprisonment with a 25 year non parole period for each count of murder, and three years imprisonment with no parole period for the armed robbery offence.The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed under s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentences imposed for the three counts of murder, on the grounds that: in sentencing the offender the trial judge should have had regard not only to s61 of the Criminal Procedure Act, but also the common law “worst case” category of cases; the killings were of such gravity that the trial judge erred in not treating the subjective circumstances as irrelevant; the trial judge erred in assuming that s19A of the Crimes Act precluded the imposition of a non parole period; even if no error in regard to the above grounds was shown, the sentence was so lenient that error should be assumed; and there was no proper basis for departure from s44(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act which provides that the non parole period should be three-quarters of the total term. HELD (allowing the appeal):Residual common law life sentence1. S 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  has not introduced a code that is narrower than the common law “worst case” category of cases which require life sentences. There is no obvious difference between the assessment of whether a particular case falls within the “worst case” category or the level of culpability required under s61. Therefore, decisions giving content to the meaning of the expression “worst case” remain relevant.Edwin Thomas Street NSWCCA 17 December 1996, Leonard NSWSC 10 November 1997, Rose NSWSC 3 September 1998, Kalajkich (1997) applied; Veen (no 2) (1987) 164 CLR 465 considered.2. It was permissible for the trial judge to consider s61 without regard to the common law ‘worst case’ principle, then to assess whether the discretion provided for in s21 was to be exercised so as to impose a specified term of imprisonment. 3. The killings in the instant case were heinous, callous and reprehensible and the trial judge erred in giving too much weight to matters which resulted in her not imposing the life sentence under s61 or the common law. Wilson (1992) 174 CLR 313 appliedSubjective Circumstances4. If the offences are so heinous then the subjective circumstances should be disregarded. In the present case the subjective circumstances could not displace the need for life sentences.Leonard NSWSC 10 November 1997, confirmed on appeal NSWCCA 7 December 1998; Rose NSWSC 7 December 1998, confirmed [1999] NSWCCA 327; and Fernando (1997) 95 A Crim R 533 appliedLife sentence and non parole period5. Part 4 Division 1 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides the only source of power for the sentencing judge to set a non parole period. There is no authority to set a non parole period for a person serving a life sentence for murder.Robinson [2000] NSWSC 972, Richardson NSWSC 28 February 1994 considered 6. The legislative intent that persons with life sentences imposed under s19A of the Crimes Act and s33A of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act remain in custody for the remainder of their natural life, is confirmed by the fact that such sentences are expressly exempted from the provisions contained in Schedule 1 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (which permits persons subject to existing life sentences to apply for determination of a term and non parole period).7. The current law continues to reinforce a division between different categories of prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment and provides a harsher form of punishment for those sentenced under s19A of the Crimes Act and s33A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  than an indeterminate sentence, terminable by the executive.8. Prediction of future dangerousness is notoriously inaccurate. The grant of power to set a non parole period in cases such as the present one and the extension of the redetermination of life sentences provided under s19A would not offend against the “truth in sentencing” doctrine.Bugmy (1990) 169 CLR 525; Mitchell (1996) 70 ALJR 313 referred to.9. The fact that this area of sentencing warrants reconsideration is confirmed by the circumstance that most other jurisdictions have a specific power to set a non parole period for life sentences and that an offender sentenced for life under the Customs Act may have a non parole period fixed, whereas an offender sentenced to life under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act cannot.ORDERS PROPOSED(1) Appeal allowed(2) Sentences for the murders charged in counts 2 and 3 of the indictment quashed, and in lieu thereof the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for life, no non parole period fixed in respect of those sentences.CATCHWORDSCRIMINAL LAW - Crown appeal against sentence - life sentence - sentencing under s19A Crimes Act - operation of common law principle of “worst case” and s61 Criminal Procedure Act - heinousness - non parole period for life sentence - non parole period for life sentence in other jurisdictions - truth in sentencing principle - consideration of subjective circumstances when sentencing ACTS CITEDCriminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) s5(D)Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s19A, s97(1), s431B, 442Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) s 21, 44, 45, 54, 61, schedule 1Sentencing Act 1989 s13ACrimes Administration of Sentencing Act 1999 s132Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act ( NSW) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) s19AB(1)(d)Customs Act 1901 (Cth)Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic) s11Sentencing Act 1997 (Tas) s18Sentencing Act 1995 (WA) s90Criminal Law 1998(Sentencing Act) s32Parole Act (ACT) 1976 (s7)Penalties and Sentences Act (Qld) 1992 s157 IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL No. 60211/00

     JUDGMENT 
    1   GILES JA: I agree with the judgment of Wood CJ at CL. 
    2   WOOD CJ at CL: 
     
      
     BACKGROUND 
      
    3   This is an appeal pursuant to section 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, by the Director of Public Prosecutions, against the sentences imposed upon the respondent by Justice Bell in the Supreme Court on 7 April 2000. 
    4   On 3 December 1999, the Crown presented an indictment against the respondent containing three counts of murder pursuant to S 19A Crimes Act 1900. The respondent pleaded guilty to all counts and the matter was stood over for sentence. When the matter was next listed before her Honour, on 24 March 2000, the Crown presented a second indictment containing one count of armed robbery in company pursuant to s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900. The respondent also pleaded guilty to that count. 
    5   The maximum penalty for an offence under s 19A Crimes 1900 is life imprisonment. The maximum penalty for an offence under s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900 is twenty years imprisonment. 
    6   On 7 April 2000, the respondent was sentenced on all counts. On each of the three counts of murder he was sentenced to 40 years imprisonment. Those sentences were directed to be served concurrently. On each count a non parole period of 25 years was set, commencing on 1 December 1998. As a consequence, the respondent will be eligible to be released on parole on 30 November 2023. On the count of armed robbery, he was sentenced to three years imprisonment. That sentence was also fixed to commence on 1 December 1998, and is due to expire on 30 December 2001. As it was to be served concurrently with the sentences for the three counts of murder, Bell J declined to set a non parole period in respect of it. 
    7   Notice of appeal against the adequacy of the sentences was signed by the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions on 13 April 2000, and served on the respondent on 19 April 2000. The appeal is confined to the sentences imposed in relation to the three counts of murder. 
     
      
     The Facts 
      
    8   It is convenient to deal with the offences in the order of their commission, since the reasons behind them, and the extent to which the respondent was assessed as presenting a danger to the community, were of importance to his sentencing. 
     
      
     Armed Robbery - Indictment 2 
      
    9   On 20 June 1998, the respondent, in company with his co-offender Kenneth Scott Frazier, went to an address in Nordlingen Drive, Wagga Wagga and knocked on the door. The occupant, Tran Nguyen, was alone with her three young children. When asked to identify themselves they said that they were police. Mrs. Nguyen opened the front door to be confronted by the two men wearing baseball hats. Both were armed with large kitchen knives. She tried to resist their entry but they managed to push her out of the way. 
    10   Once inside she sat on the lounge with her three children. Both men demanded money. She removed $55 from her purse and gave it to the respondent. Both men then held their knives at her throat and asked for her keycard and PIN which she did not have. 
    11   More money was demanded. The victim said she only had coins. She handed over coins, amounting to about $3, to Frazier. Frazier searched the flat while the respondent stayed with the victim holding a knife to her throat. Nothing more was taken. When Frazier returned the respondent told him to cut the telephone line. He was unsuccessful in that task so he pulled it out from the wall. Both men left the flat through the front door. Frazier pushed the knife through the gauze screen door and told the victim not to call police. The money stolen was used to purchase alcohol.  
    12   The co-accused Frazier was found guilty at trial, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of fifty four months comprising a minimum term of thirty nine months, and an additional term of fifteen months. 
     
      
     Murder of Peter Wennerbom - Indictment 1 Count 1 
      
    13   Between 7.00pm and 7.30pm on 4 October 1998, Geoffrey George Hall was on his way to 2/2 Jack avenue, Wagga Wagga where his son lived. Hall was aware that the deceased, Peter Wennerbom, a man 62 years of age with some residual difficulties due to a stroke, lived in the building next door to his son. As he approached the flats he noticed that Mr. Wennerbom’s front door was open and that his television sounded as if it was on. Believing this to be unusual, Mr. Hall entered the flat. Inside he found Mr. Wennerbom lying on the floor. He telephoned for an ambulance. 
    14   Senior Constable Joseph Christie responded to the call that was placed by the ambulance officers who attended the scene. On inspecting the body he noticed a bruise on the side of the deceased’s throat which he regarded as suspicious. Mr. Paul Bottrill, a pathologist, conducted an autopsy on 8 October 1998. In his report, dated 16 December 1998, he gave the opinion that the cause of death was consistent with strangulation. 
    15   On 1 December 1998 police arrested the respondent for the offences referred to in counts 2 and 3 of the indictment. He was interviewed about those matters. Subsequently he agreed to be interviewed in connection with the death of Mr. Wennerbom, which, it is alleged, occurred on 1 October of that year. That interview was conducted by Detective Sergeant Peter Mark Spence at Sydney Police Centre. The respondent stated that he knew Mr. Wennerbom through that man’s sister, Elaine de Jong, and that he had visited him at his home on a couple of occasions. He stated that on the occasion of Mr. Wennerbom’s death he knocked on his door under the pretext of asking for a drink of water. He was invited in. Once inside he strangled him. He displayed poor recollection of the exact sequence of events and he was inconsistent in his answers regarding his motive. At question 139 he was asked: 
     
      
       
       “Q. Did you intend to go to the premises to kill him? A. I don’t, no,… intended to do that, no, I intended to rob, I think.” 
       
      
      
     The respondent was asked to explain that admission: 
      
      
       
       “Q. You said, ‘I think I went to rob him’, why do you think you went to rob him? A. I don’t know, I just, I don’t know if I went to rob him, I’m not sure, that’s what I’m trying to say, I think, I just went there to kill him”. 
       
      
    16   In the course of his discussions with investigating police, the respondent also said that Mr. Wennerbom: 
     
      
       
        “… was an old man, there was no resistance at all. I had total, you know, control over the situation, he, he couldn’t do anything.” 
       
      
    17   It was known that Mr. Wennerbom was accustomed to keeping relatively large sums of cash at home. No money was found in the unit following the discovery of his body. 
    18   On 7 December 1998, the respondent was re-interviewed, in the presence of his solicitor. During that interview the respondent repeated his confession that he had strangled Mr. Wennerbom. As in the previous interview he made contradictory statements regarding his motive. In reply to one question, he suggested that he had visited Mr. Wennerbom with the intention of obtaining money or cigarettes. In reply to another question, he said: 
     
      
       
       “I, at the time I wasn’t interested in robbing him, the only thing I wanted to do was to kill, that was my sole purpose.” 
       
      
    19   This interview also included the following exchange: 
     
      
       
       “Q. Now when you, earlier you said you came here, you were going to ask for some money. Do you remember if you actually got any money from him? A. Oh, no, no, I don’t think, I might have, that, that might have been the reason to come here, but like I said, I ended up asking for water instead. I don’t, didn’t come here to ask him for money, I didn’t, I don’t, I I I might have said that but I don’t think I came here to ask for money. The only reason I came here was because I knew the, I knew him, I knew he lived on his own and I knew I could kill him.” 
       
      
    20   Mrs. De Jong recalled that following Mr. Wennerbom’s death, the respondent appeared particularly solicitous, helping to clear out his unit and attending his funeral, although without entering the church. He also appeared to be depressed. 
     
      
     Murder of Yvonne Jean Ford - Indictment 1, Count 2 
      
    21   On 18 October 1998, at 9.15am, Janice Karen Lowing arrived at Yvonne Jean Ford’s home, at 26 Phillip Avenue Wagga Wagga, with the intention of driving her to the boarding kennels where she worked on a part-time basis as a dog walker.  
    22   Mrs. Lowing knocked on the front door but nobody answered. She became concerned and returned to Ms Ford’s home at about 11.00am. On this occasion she heard Ms Ford’s dog inside the building but she again failed to make contact with her. She went to Wagga Wagga police station and reported her concerns. 
    23   Senior Constable Christopher Jason Hall responded to the report. He conducted a search of the premises and located Ms Ford sitting in the bath. She was dead and in a state of nudity.  
    24   Cherryl Holmes, who employed Ms Ford at her dog kennels, said that she had a mild intellectual disability although this did not impair her ability to care for herself and to live an independent life. She was aged thirty-three years at the time of her death, the time of which was fixed as occurring on 17 October 1998, sixteen days after the murder of Mr. Wennerbom. It was not initially treated as a case of murder, the post mortem examination having been inconclusive. 
    25   Mrs De Jong, the sister of Peter Wennerbom, first met the respondent through her involvement in the Adoption Triangle Organisation. She helped him trace his birth parents who had given him up for adoption. Ms De Jong knew that he was a heroin addict. Shortly after their first meeting he moved into her family home as she wanted to support him in his efforts to withdraw from heroin. After six or seven months of living there, he was admitted to a residential rehabilitation program. Eventually he rented his own apartment. Ms De Jong maintained daily contact with the respondent and developed a very deep friendship with him. 
    26   The respondent was not engaged in paid employment but he performed voluntary work as a driver with the Community Transport service, an organisation which provides transport for elderly and disabled persons in the Wagga Wagga community. It was through this work that the respondent came into contact with Ms Ford. 
    27   On 11 November 1998, the respondent informed Ms De Jong that he had attempted to commit suicide with a heroin overdose. He added that he needed to tell her something. They arranged to meet the next day to discuss the matter further, but he went to Sydney without speaking to her. On 15 November 1998, she located him at his flat, where she spoke with him briefly. 
    28   At about 3.00am. on 30 November 1998, she received two telephone calls from the respondent. In the second conversation he confessed to having killed the male person who was missing from next door (Mr. Galvin, the victim mentioned in the third count). She went to Wagga Wagga police station and reported the confession. At about 9.30am, on the same day, she received a further telephone call from the respondent. During that conversation he disclosed that he was in Sydney. He confessed to having also killed a lady (Ms Ford) in Phillip Avenue on Caulfield Cup day. He said that it had happened in the bath. He said that he knew the victim as a client of the Community Transport Group. At about 2.05pm, he again telephoned Ms De Jong and announced that he had some heroin, and thought it best to “end it all”. 
    29   Later that evening, the respondent overdosed as threatened, and was taken to hospital from Embarkation Park in Potts Point. 
    30   On 1 December 1998, at approximately 3.00 am, Senior Constable Peter Hugh Clarke attended St Vincent’s Hospital where he spoke to the respondent. On his discharge he was arrested and taken into custody. Throughout the day at Sydney Police Centre he was interviewed about his role in the murders, to which he had confessed, commencing with that of Mr. Galvin (count 3 in the first indictment). 
    31   At 5.02pm Detective Sergeant Spence commenced a recorded interview with him in relation to the death of Ms Ford. During the course of the interview, the respondent confessed to having strangled Ms Ford while she was in the bath. He denied having committed a robbery. He said that he had targeted her and that he went to her flat with the intention of killing her. 
    32   On 7 December 1998, Detective Sergeant Spence conducted a ‘walk around’ interview with the respondent, at 26 Phillip Avenue Wagga Wagga. During the course of that interview, the respondent admitted that he had made a pretence of a sexual advance towards Ms Ford prior to killing her and that he had suggested that they have a bath together. He said “I just wanted her to get in the bath so that I could strangle her”. He said that she rejected his feigned sexual advances but disclosed that he was in the bath with her at the time when he strangled her. He admitted to having taken advantage of her intellectual disability. He also admitted having held her under the water while strangling her. According to him, it took three to four minutes to kill her. 
    33   Among the other admissions made to police concerning this killing the respondent said: 
     
      
       
       “I just went there. I was probably out on one of me walks and I probably had a few drinks, in the area so I just went went to the house ended up there. 
       
      
      
       
       … We struck up a bit of a friendship, as, just, just driving her around, and I obviously could tell she was lonely, she was slightly handicapped. I didn’t come, I didn’t come around here for sex, I didn’t come around here for anything, I just came around to say Hello, I live nearby, but then these thoughts started entering my head that I wanted to kill her. 
       
      
      
       
       …. It could have been her, it could’ve been anybody. She was just unlucky. 
       
      
      
       
       … I just thought she would be easy, to target, she wouldn’t put up a fight or … she would be relatively easy to kill.”  
       
      
    34   When asked how he had felt at the time he was strangling Ms Ford, he replied: 
     
      
       
       “Powerful, angry, just anger, pure anger. Not, not that she, there was no sex or anything, I was angry at the world. This is why this whole thing has happened, has started, and it was just my total anger building up from, I don’t know, from the day I was adopted, it’s just all built and built and, something has set, set me off and I, I killed her.”  
       
      
    35   Paul Botterill, a pathologist, was asked to review the case. In his report of 26 January 1999, he stated that the direct cause of death was consistent with manual strangulation. 
     
      
     Murder of Ronald Edward Galvin - Indictment 1, Count 3 
      
    36   On 1 December 1998, Robert Allan Simpkin discovered a body between 6 to 8 metres off Church Plains Road, Uranquinty. He returned home and notified police. Later he accompanied an ambulance crew to the location of the body. Detective Senior Constable Scott Lawrence Coleman attended the scene and recovered a number of documents from the body that carried the name of Ronald Edward Galvin. 
    37   Mr. Galvin’s father, Cecil Galvin, last saw his son on 1 November 1998. His son then failed to meet him on 4 November 1998 as had been planned. After the passing of some weeks he telephoned the Credit Union with which he banked and learned that his pension had not been drawn. He then reported him missing. 
    38   Mr. Botterill conducted an autopsy on 8 December 1998. In his report of 22 January 1999, he stated that the direct cause of death was consistent with strangulation. Mr. Galvin’s death was fixed as having occurred on 3 November 1998, ie within 17 days of the murder of Ms Ford. 
    39   Mr. Galvin had resided at 9/1 Joyes Place. On 24 November 1998, Detective Sergeant Spence and another officer went to that address in the course of their investigation of his apparent disappearance. On the following day they returned to those premises and spoke with the respondent who lived next door. While in the respondent’s flat they noticed a collection of books dealing with the subject of non-fictional murders. The respondent said that he had last seen Mr. Galvin on the evening of Melbourne Cup day, sitting on the stairway with a number of persons, including someone he described as “ bloke I’ve never seen before”.  
    40   Detective Sergeant Spence attended Sydney Central Police Station on 1 December, after the respondent’s arrest, and interviewed him in relation to the disappearance of Mr. Galvin. During the interview the respondent admitted killing Mr. Galvin by means of strangulation. He could not recall a great deal of detail about the killing or even where it had occurred. He agreed that he had disposed of the body at Uranquinty. 
    41   On 7 December 1998 the respondent participated in a ‘walk around’ interview. The interview was conducted by Detective Sergeant Spence. The respondent again found it difficult to recall the detail of the killing but suggested that there had been no ulterior motive. To the best of his recollection Mr. Galvin had invited him in when he went to his flat and asked for a beer. Once inside he stood behind Mr. Galvin, put him on his knees and strangled him. He observed that Mr. Galvin was “only a little bloke”. 
    42   His only explanation for the killing was “I think it was just of lot of anger, I was getting rid of and it was being projected on him”, but he said that having “got away with” the earlier murders he “thought well, why not go again?” and repeated this kind of observation more than once. He agreed that he used Ms De Jong’s car the following evening to move the body to the place where it was ultimately found. 
     
      
     Subjective Features 
      
    43   The respondent was born on 30 June 1968 and was aged 31 years when he appeared for sentence. He had been adopted at the age of about ten months, a fact which he learned at the age of ten years. He became unsettled by that discovery and began to exhibit behavioural problems in his early teens. 
    44   Bell J, accepted that the respondent had experienced a significant level of emotional deprivation and rejection in his childhood that led to him leaving home and living life as a ‘street kid’ and as a prostitute. This commenced at about the age of fifteen years, and followed a period of failed attempts to settle him with foster parents. In 1991, he was sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude for 2.5 years for the armed robbery of a sex customer. It was while serving this sentence that he came to meet Ms De Jong. While living with her he remained almost conviction free but used heroin on a recreational basis. 
    45   Bell J, found that this background was causally related to the respondent’s commission of the offences. She also noted that in his adult life, the respondent had tracked down his natural mother with Ms De Jong’s assistance, only to be rejected by her. This rejection Bell J concluded, was “a significant blow” to him. In the interview with police, the respondent reported having experienced nightmares about his adoptive mother. He went on to tell Detective Sergeant Smith :  
     
      
       
       “… just the thoughts, you know, I’ve always, its on record, I’ve always thought of I’ve wanted to kill my mother and my family and stuff like that. Just being dirty on the world, you know, being dirty on the fact that I was adopted and I was taken in by this family and then rejected by them. … in the shit with the prostitution and having to lower meself and all that, just all the thoughts.”  
       
      
    46   He went on to describe the murderous thoughts which he had also entertained about killing people during the period that he was prostituting himself: 
     
      
       
       “I went with so many blokes I could have killed a number of them, but I didn’t, I didn’t, didn’t go through with it, but even then I had the thoughts, you know, these blokes that the, that I was, that I was sleeping with were using me and I using them or whatever, I thought, I wanted to kill them, of course.”  
       
      
    47   Two psychologists, Ms Matsuo and Ms Barrier, examined the respondent and prepared reports. Both came to broadly consistent conclusions. 
    48   Ms Barrier’s testing revealed a schizotypal personality disorder and/or an avoidant personality disorder with prominent depressive schizoid traits. She stated: 
     
      
       
       “Personality test results describe someone who is ‘unable to overcome the feelings that life is empty and meaningless, and unable to master the skills to overcome the deficits he sees within himself, he is likely at times to become cranky if not explosive’.” 
       
      
      
     She added that the respondent demonstrated little empathy for the victims and had only a limited understanding of the enormity of his behaviour. 
      
    49   Ms Matsuo concluded that the respondent had a schizoid personality disorder. She said that he had begun the difficult task of understanding himself, and noted: 
     
      
       
       ‘Mr. Harris is cognisant of his psychological shortcomings and his lengthy problems with drugs and alcohol. He has already shown himself to be highly motivated to work on his offending issues with psychological programs and his substance abuse issues with AOD counsellors”. 
       
      
    50   She also stated: 
     
      
       
       “Taken in context based on his day to day behaviour, Mr. Harris displays few pervasively antisocial traits. He prefers to be alone rather than in large groups but this stems from his feeling of inadequacy and worthlessness. He often denigrates himself in front of the author and has a low self-image. Mr. Harris’ history does indicate he has often failed to comply with social norms especially in terms of his drug use, prostitution and his criminal history, however, he does not lack remorse altogether. He has demonstrated significant levels of compassion both in and out of gaol, helping others in need and in particular taking care of young children at his home in Wagga. 
       
      
      
       
       Mr. Harris’ transient disregard for others has occurred as a very specific end to a certain set of psychological circumstances. He believes the reason he felt indifference to the human life that he destroyed may be the indifference he feels towards his own existence. He is not, in terms of his enduring personality type an irritable, aggressive or violent person as assessed by the MCMI-3 - and he is not a person who pervasively shows indifference or contempt for the feelings and suffering of others or explosive anger.” 
       
      
      
       
      
    51   Somewhat disturbingly, in my view, she noted that he had expressed genuine remorse in relation to the death of Ms Ford, but not in relation to the two other victims. He had, however, expressed distress and confusion as to why this was so. 
     
      
     THE SENTENCES IMPOSED 
      
    52   In determining the sentences to be imposed, Bell J noted that the Crown had submitted, as it did on this appeal, that the killings of Ms Ford and of Mr. Galvin called for the imposition of the maximum penalty. The availability of that sentence depended upon a review of the law as it then stood - a matter not entirely free of complication having regard to the commencement of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on 3 April 2000, and to the provisions of S19A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
    53   Bell J, held that the matter was governed by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Procedure Act”) and in particular by S61, which provides: 
     
      
       
       “(1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder, if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.” 
       
      
      
       
       (3) Nothing in subsection (1) affects S 21(1). 
       
      
      
       
       (6) This section does not apply to a person who was less than eighteen years of age at the date of the commission of the offence.” 
       
      
      
       
      
    54   This Section, Bell J appropriately noted is in identical terms to the former S431B of the Crimes Act 1900, a provision inserted into that Act by amendment in 1996, but now repealed. 
    55   Bell J, also noted that the Crimes Act provided: 
     
      
      
       
       “19A (1) A person who commits the crime of murder is liable to imprisonment for life.  
       
      
      
       
       (2) A person sentenced to imprisonment for life for the crime of murder is to serve that sentence for the term of the person’s natural life.  
       
      
      
       
       (3) Nothing in this section affects the operation of section 442 (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than imprisonment for life).” 
       
      
    56   Section 19A (1) and (2) of the Crimes Act, Bell J observed, do not affect the operation of S 21(1) of the Procedure Act (the successor to the now repealed but equivalent provision formerly contained in S 442 of the Crimes Act), which is in the following terms: 
     
      
      
       
       “21 
         
       (1) If by any provision of an Act an offender is made liable to imprisonment for life, a court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term. 
       
      
    57   That section (S 21) further provides: 
     
      
       
       “(4) The power conferred on a court by this section is not limited by any other provision of this Part. 
       
      
      
       
       (5) This section does not limit any discretion that the court has, apart from this section, in relation to the imposition of penalties.” 
       
      
    58   In the light of her consideration of these provisions, Bell J held: 
     
      
       
       I approach this matter upon the basis that if I am of the view that the prisoner’s level of culpability in the commission of the offences is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence I am required by s 61(1) of the Procedure Act to impose such a sentence. I consider that if I am of that view I would, in any event, be required to impose a life sentence having regard to the principles governing the sentencing of offenders at common law;  
       Regina v Garforth  
        (NSWCCA unreported, 23 May 1994).” 
       
      
    59   Bell J next noted that S 61(1) of the Procedure Act had taken away the discretion that had been reserved under the proviso to the former S 19 of the Crimes Act, which, prior to the enactment of S 19A, had permitted the imposition of a determinate sentence, in lieu of the mandatory life sentence that was otherwise then required. 
    60   Having regard to the terms of S 61 of the Procedure Act, and having regard also to the interpretation that had been given to the expression “culpability for the crime” (used in the proviso) in Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466, Bell J concluded, correctly in my view, that the assessment of the culpability of the prisoner, that was required, had to be directed “to the circumstances surrounding or causally connected with the offence”, leaving aside matters such as remorse, pleas of guilty, prospects of rehabilitation and the like. In substance, this required attention to be given to the “blameworthiness” of the person standing for sentence, although that did not preclude consideration being given, for example, to the extent to which “the deprived life and upbringing of the accused” may have contributed to the commission of the offence. 
    61   It was by reference to these matters that her Honour paid regard first to the prisoner’s culpability and then to the objective seriousness of the offences. Having concluded that S 61(1) of the Procedure Act did not, in the light of the findings made, mandate a life sentence, she went on to consider the appellant’s potential for dangerousness, his prospects of rehabilitation and any other matter potentially attracting leniency. The findings in relation to those four issues may be briefly stated: 
     
      
     a) Culpability 
      
    62   In relation to the respondent’s culpability and the objective seriousness of the offences, Bell J found that it was around about the time of his 30th birthday that he started to become overwhelmed by feelings of depression. This was associated with his view that he had achieved nothing in his life. It also occurred at a time when he had formed an association with Kenneth Frazer that was bad for him. 
    63   She accepted that he had not set out with the intention of killing the first victim, Mr. Wennerbom. Rather, she found, he had gone to his home with the intention of robbing him. However, emboldened by the success of the armed robbery of Mrs Nguyen and affected by alcohol, he then went on to kill this man. 
    64   Having done so, and having avoided detection for this offence, Bell J found that he: “became confident enough to commence killing people for the satisfaction of it”. The later murders, it would appear, were regarded by Bell J, effectively as killings that had been carried out for his own satisfaction, and in particular to meet his desire for revenge upon society and to fulfil the feelings of power that killing gave him. 
    65   The interviews with police and the psychologists, Bell J went on to observe, did describe a “childhood characterised by rejection and emotional deprivation”, a conclusion reinforced by the pre sentence report prepared by Mr. Mullaney. This deprivation and rejection, Bell J assessed as significant, and to have been such as to have led to the respondent leaving home and living the life of a ‘street kid’, with the consequent feelings of debasement and worthlessness that flowed from his period of prostitution. This background, she found, was causally related to the commission of the offences, and was such as to cause her to refrain from finding that the respondent’s culpability was so extreme as to permit only of sentences of life imprisonment. 
     
      
     b) Potential for dangerousness 
      
    66   Bell J noted that no psychiatric evidence had been placed before her to assist with an assessment of the respondent’s potential for dangerousness in the future - that being a matter of relevance in relation to the need to have regard to the protection of the community: Veen (No2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. She held, consistently with the decision of this Court in Garforth NSWCCA 23 May 1994, that the case was one in which it was proper to look to the circumstances of the offences, so far as they threw light on his dangerousness. 
    67   In coming to a conclusion, on this issue, Bell J said: 
     
      
       
       “The prisoner is a person who has killed people whom he perceived to be vulnerable and, therefore, easy to kill because it made him feel powerful to do so. He told Detective Sergeant Spence in the course of the ‘walk through’ interview relating to the death of Peter Wennerbom that, ‘He had been living a straight life in Wagga’ and ‘over months thoughts about killing people came into my head - they were powerful thoughts.’ In that same interview, he said ‘I’ve always expressed the desire to kill people ever since I was a kid and it made, and it, it sought of excited me. It wasn’t like I was getting off on it or anything but it was very powerful and it was revenge on society. It’s you know the whole shit’.” 
       
      
    68   The conclusion reached, by reference to this material, not surprisingly, was that the respondent does represent an ongoing danger to the community. 
     
      
     c) Prospects of rehabilitation 
      
    69   Bell J next found that the respondent was not entirely without hope of rehabilitation, and that with appropriate psychological counselling, over a lengthy period, there was some prospect that he may one day come not to present a danger to the community. 
    70   In this regard she accepted Ms Matsuo’s report as to the possibility of him developing an understanding of his psychological difficulties. Although his crime spoke of a “callous unconcern for human feelings”, Bell J felt that there were some indications that he had himself been disturbed by his behaviour. In particular, it was noted that he reported having consulted a doctor in Wagga Wagga for depression associated with the murder of Mr. Galvin. Moreover, he had attempted to take his own life on two occasions following that killing, and had displayed concern as to his aberrant behaviour in his telephone conversations with Mrs De Jong. 
     
      
     d) Other matters attracting leniency 
      
    71   Several matters were taken into account by Bell J in this regard, consistently with the provisions of the Procedure Act, and with authority. They included: 
     
      
     (i) the fact that the respondent disclosed his otherwise unknown guilt in relation to the killings of Ms Ford and Mr. Wennerbom, a matter that would normally attract some mitigation of sentence:  
     Ellis 
      (1986) 6 NSWLR 603; 
      
      
     (ii) his voluntary admissions to the three killings, and his early pleas of guilty, matters that would also attract mitigation of sentence, in accordance with S22 of the Procedure Act. 
      
    72   In undertaking the sentencing exercise that then befell her, Bell J had regard to the terrible significance of a sentence of life imprisonment with no hope of release, (save for the prerogative of mercy preserved under S 19A(6) of the Crimes Act) regardless of any progress which the prisoner may make towards reform, noted in decisions such as Petroff (NSWSC per Hunt CJ at CL 12 November 1999); as well as to the circumstance that such a sentence could see the respondent serving something in the order of fifty years in custody. 73   She noted that the life sentence redetermination procedure (formerly S 13A Sentencing Act 1989, but now provided for in S 44 and Schedule 1 of the Procedure Act, had produced cases of offenders who, over the course of long terms of imprisonment, had shown themselves rehabilitated to such a degree that their release into the community, under supervision, could be contemplated, and facilitated by the imposition of a determinate sentence in lieu of the original life sentence (if appropriate, with provision for a period of potential release on parole for the remainder of the offender’s natural life). 
    74   She also noted that in Bugmy (1990) 169 CLR 525 the majority (Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 537) spoke of the difficulty of forecasting the likelihood of a prisoner re-offending over the course of a lengthy term. Unlike the position in Victoria ( S11 Sentencing Act 1991 ) she concluded that, in New South Wales, there was no legislative authority for fixing a non parole period in a case where a life sentence had been imposed. 
    75   It was by reference to those considerations that Bell J imposed the determinate sentences previously mentioned. 
    76   Special circumstances were found justifying a non-parole period which was less than the minimum three-quarters of the term of the sentence otherwise required pursuant to S 44(2) of the Procedure Act (resulting in a reduction of that period from 30 years to one of 25 years). Although those special circumstances were not defined, Bell J noted that the sentencing order proposed would provide for an extended period of supervision post release, and would carry with it the sanction of a return to custody, in order to reinforce the respondent’s rehabilitation, should he re-offend. It may safely be assumed that this is what her Honour had in mind by way of special circumstances. 
     
      
     GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
      
    77   Mr. Berman SC for the Director of Public Prosecutions submitted that error was to be found in the following respects: 
     
      
     1) that the exercise to be undertaken was not confined to that stipulated by S 61(1) of the Procedure Act, there being an error on the part of her Honour in not considering whether the case fell into the “worst category” of case that would require the maximum sentence of life imprisonment, under the common law; 
      
      
     2) that the killings here involved were crimes of such gravity that there was error on her Honour’s part, in not treating the subjective circumstances of the respondent either as irrelevant, or as of no weight whatsoever; 
      
      
     3) that the assumption made by her Honour as to the impossibility of imposing a non parole period in the case of a life sentence for murder under S 19A Crimes Act, was incorrect; 
      
      
     4) that even if no error in principle was exposed on the face of the reasons for judgment of the kind identified in paras (1) to (3) above, then the case was one in which the sentencing order displayed a leniency of such a magnitude, that error should be assumed; and 
      
      
     5) there was no proper basis for finding special circumstances, justifying a departure from the direction in S 44(2) of the Procedure Act that the length of the non parole period should be not less than three-quarters of the total term. 
      
    78   Although to a considerable extent these grounds overlap, I shall endeavour to deal with each in turn. Before doing so, it is however necessary to note that the third ground of appeal if made good, would involve a departure from at least two first instance decisions by Judges of this Court, and from the view that a life sentence under S 19A is a sentence that has to be served entirely in custody. For that reason, the Court requested that the matter be brought to the attention of the Attorney General and asked for assistance from the Crown Advocate. That has now been provided in the form of a written submission which does not support  the argument advanced on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
     
      
     Ground 1 - residual common law life sentence 
      
    79   The totality of the respondent’s criminality, involved in the three murders, it was submitted was such as would place the case into the “worst category” of case referred to in Ibbs (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-452, thereby attracting a life sentence at common law. 
    80   Although it was accepted that those cases that would attract a life sentence under S 61(1) of the Procedure Act would inevitably satisfy the Ibbs criterion, it was submitted that the reverse was not necessarily true. Section 61(1), it was argued, called for a consideration of the culpability of the person standing for sentence in relation to an individual offence, or if more than one offence, then in relation to each offence individually. While a particular offence may not satisfy the worst case category calling for a S 61(1) life sentence, so it was put, a combination or series of offences may yet take the matter into the worst category and attract a life sentence at common law. 
    81   The submission accordingly contemplated the continued existence of two avenues for a life sentence - one arising at common law (although not entirely at large because of S 19A Crimes Act) and one arising under S 61 of the Procedure Act. 
    82   Some support for the proposition that the common law had continuing work to do in the case of multiple offences was sought from the decision of this Court in Edwin Thomas Street NSWCCA 17 December 1996, where McInerney J said: 
     
      
       
       “In my view, each murder (standing alone) would not justify the imposition of penal servitude for life, even allowing for the serious nature of the offence, the appellant’s lack of remorse, and his bad criminal background. The question is whether his Honour was justified in imposing the sentence of penal servitude for life when considering the totality of punishment for these offences. His Honour concluded that the two murders, committed some twelve weeks apart, were amongst the worst category of case. 
       
      
      
       
       Despite the cogent submissions made by Mr. Norrish on the appellant’s behalf, I am not convinced that his Honour’s sentencing discretion miscarried. His Honour, in my view, was entitled to conclude that these two murders, twelve weeks apart, placed these offences in the worst category of case. Both offences were committed against defenceless women, and, in my view, it was clearly within his Honour’s sentencing discretion to impose sentences for the term of the appellant’s natural life.” 
       
      
    83   The offender in that case was sentenced, and the appeal determined, prior to enactment of the predecessor to S 61 of the Procedure Act. However, it was submitted, the decision showed that the totality principle was available, at common law, in determining whether a case fell into the worst category. In Leonard, NSWSC 10 November 1997, Badgery-Parker J, similarly endorsed the totality principle when assessing whether a case, involving more than one murder, fell into the worst case category; as did Levine J in Rose NSWSC 3 September 1998. 
    84   The features required for qualification in the “worst case category” were defined in Twala NSWCCA 4 November 1994, where it was said: 
     
      
       
       “in order to characterise any case as being in the  
       worst case 
        category, it must be possible to point to particular features which are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the  
       seriousness 
        of the crime (as distinct from the subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed)…” 
       
      
      
    85   “Heinousness” has been described as follows: 
     
      
       
       “The adjective ‘heinous’ which gives the noun ‘heinousness’ its meaning has been variously defined as meaning atrocious, detestable, hateful, odious, gravely reprehensible and extremely wicked. The test to be satisfied is thus a substantial one”.  
       R v Reginald Keith Arhurell 
        (Hunt CJ at CL unreported 3 October 1997). 
       
      
    86   It was next submitted that the exercise required at common law differed from an assessment of the level of “culpability” under S 61(1) of the Procedure Act, which required a consideration of the reasons for the offending conduct, ie of the circumstances surrounding or causally connected with the offence, such as the background or mental state of the offender. 
    87   It is not at all clear to me that the assessment whether a case falls within the “worst case category” at common law is any different from that postulated under S 61(1). The decision in Veen (No2) (1987) 164 CLR 465, permits reference at common law to background material for the purpose of assessing moral culpability, and dangerous propensity and there is long standing precedent for regard to be had to each of the matters specified in S 61(1) when considering sentence. 
    88   Similarly to the view offered by Hunt CJ at CL in Kalajzich (1997) 94 A Crim R41 in relation to the former S 431B(1) of the Crimes Act, I doubt that its successor (S 61(1) of the Procedure Act) adds anything to the common law. His Honour there observed: 
     
      
       
       “It (S 431 B(1)) adds nothing at all to the common law relating to the imposition of maximum penalties, except the danger that it may eventually be interpreted as replacing the common law by an ill defined code which will eventually become narrower than the common law”. 
       
      
    89   So far as the submission advanced by Mr. Berman SC assumes that S 61(1) of the Procedure Act is narrower than the common law, then I am not persuaded that there is authority, or good reason, for such an assumption. 
    90   That is not, however, to say that the common law has been abrogated, or that those decisions which gave content to the meaning of the expression “worst case” are no longer of relevance. It may be that future development of the common law will embrace a situation calling for a life sentence that would not be justified under S 61(1) of the Procedure Act, which in any event although expressed in mandatory terms, on one view arguably remains subject to a discretion to impose a lesser sentence than life by reason of S 61(3).  
    91   That sub-section provides that “nothing in sub section (1) affects Section 21(1)”). Section 21(1) in turn provides: 
     
      
       
        “If by any provision of an Act an offender is made liable to imprisonment for life, a court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term”.  
       
      
    92   This mirrors the pre-existing position since S 431B(3) of the Crimes Act preserved S 442 of that Act, which authorised the passing of a lesser sentence than the statutory maximum.  
    93   An obvious tension exists between S 61(1) and 61(3) . Greg James J in Petrinovic (1999) NSWSC 1131 identified that tension in relation to SS 431B(1) and 431B(3), but concluded that where the case for sentence met the criteria specified in S 431B(1) then a life sentence was mandated. This may have been what was intended but that interpretation does not sit very happily with the words of exception contained in the earlier Section 431B(3) and now contained in S 61(3). 
    94   So far as the present case is concerned, it appears to me to have been permissible for Bell J, without having to depend upon the common law, to have had regard to the other murders when assessing the level of culpability of each in the application of S 61(1) of the Procedure Act and in particular, whether the case was one calling for a life sentence in terms of S 61(1), and then whether, in the exercise of her discretion under S 21(1), a lesser sentence of imprisonment for a specified term could be imposed. 
    95   Particularly was this so in the context of a case where the three killings occurred in quick proximity, and where the last two were similarly motivated and encouraged by the success of the respondent in carrying out and initially escaping both suspicion and detection for the first of those offences. 
    96   Whether assessed under the common law, or under S61(1) of the Procedure Act, their objective seriousness, and the culpability of the respondent were particularly extreme. 
    97   It was the fact that: 
     
      
     a) the victims were aged, disadvantaged, or physically slight and an easy prey for the respondent; 
      
      
     b) the killing of Ms Ford involved a betrayal of trust; 
      
      
     c) Mr. Wennerbom was the brother of the one person for whom the respondent  
     had any degree 
      of emotional attachment; 
      
      
     d) the second and third killings were carried out for the satisfaction of the respondent, as an exercise of power and to exact revenge on society, ie they were linked in a way aggravating each other; 
      
      
     e) the three killings occurred within a space of only one month; 
      
      
     f) each killing involved considerable callousness, and was such that the respondent could not have attached any value to the lives of those he killed. 
      
    98   It is to be accepted, as Bell J found, that the respondent had a deprived and emotional childhood, and that his experience as a prostitute was likely to have left him embittered and with feelings of debasement and worthlessness. No doubt he also became desensitised to some degree, to violence. Unfortunately, his experiences in this regard are not unique. They were of a kind that might have been expected to lead to a degree of anti-social and criminal behaviour, but not that of the kind or degree experienced here. 
    99   So heinous, so callous and so reprehensible, were the second and third killings, that I am forced to the view that Bell J must have attached unwarranted significance to the matters which led to her conclusion that the respondent’s culpability did not reach the level mandating a life sentence, whether under the common law, or under S 61(1) of the Procedure Act. 
    100   There was an error of law, in this respect, I find, in the failure to give due recognition to the degree of heinousness involved in the taking of three human lives in the circumstances such as were present in this case. The sanctity of human life is of great significance, as Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ observed in Wilson (1992) 174 CLR 313. Where it is ignored in a callous, brutal, repeated and savage way, and where there are multiple victims who are elderly, sick, or disadvantaged, then, in the absence of exceptional circumstances reducing the offenders’ culpability, the maximum penalty must be expected. 
     
      
     Ground 2 - subjective circumstances 
      
    101   So far as it became relevant for Bell J to have had regard to the subjective circumstances of the respondent, it was submitted that undue weight was given to them. 
    102   The level of heinousness involved in the three killings, and the future dangerousness of the respondent, it was put, meant that the subjective circumstances were of so little weight that they should have been entirely discounted, either as irrelevant or of no weight. 
    103   So far as this submission depended upon the proposition that, in some cases, the offence or offences for which an offender stands for sentence are so heinous, that the subjective circumstances should be disregarded either wholly or substantially, then it was, in my view, consistent with principle. In particular, there is support for this view in the decisions of Badgery-Parker J in Leonard NSWSC 10 November 1997, confirmed on appeal NSWCCA 7 December 1998; of Levine J in Rose NSWSC 3 September 1998 also affirmed on appeal [1999] NSWCCA 327 December 1998, and of Abadee J in Fernando (1997) 95 A Crim R 533. 
    104   Relevantly, in Fernando, Abadee J observed, at 544/545: 
     
      
       
       “There are some cases where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met through the imposition of the maximum penalty: see  
       Garforth 
       . Next, rehabilitation and the prospect of offering a person some hope from incarceration, whilst being important considerations and are to be taken into account in favour of persons in the position of each of the prisoners, nevertheless, the requirement of retributive judgments involving the objective features of an instant case may amply warrant not only a case being regarded as in the worst category of case but as warranting the imposition of the maximum penalty: see  
       Baker 
        and  
       Garforth 
       . Indeed, as the decision of Hunt CJ at CL in  
       Milat 
        illustrates there may be some cases falling within the category of the worst class of cases, where there is even little utility in considering the prospects of rehabilitation. Indeed, it may be that in such cases the subjective circumstances generally of a prisoner himself cannot play any real decisive part.” 
       
      
    105   For the reasons already mentioned, I am of the view that the present case is one that answers this description, with the consequence that the subjective circumstance could not displace the need for life sentences. 
     
      
     Ground 3 - Life sentence and non parole period 
      
    106   The assumed absence of any prospect of release in the case of a life sentence was mentioned in passing by Bell J. This arose in the context of her overall consideration of the discretion, which she concluded was available in view of her findings in relation to S 61(1) of the Procedure Act, whether to pass a life sentence or a determinate sentence. It is not entirely clear that her Honour would have imposed a life sentence had she been of the view that the option of fixing a non parole period was open. There are some indications in the reasons for sentence to suggest that this may have been the case, but it is not safe to speculate in this regard, or to conclude that the assumption made led to error.  
    107   Having regard to the conclusion which I have reached in relation to the other grounds, the permissibility or not of the imposition of a non parole period is now a live issue. 
    108   Mr. Berman SC drew attention to the fact that the option to redetermine life sentences, in a way permitting release after a period of years, and preserving an additional term or possibility of release on parole for the remainder of an offender’s life, has existed for some years and continues. A precedent for the imposition of a minimum term with an additional term for the remainder of the offender’s life, it was pointed out, can be seen in the decision of Finlay J in Richardson NSWSC 28 February 1994, for an offender who was found to have fallen into the worst case category, and who was sentenced after the commencement of S 19A of the Crimes Act. It may, however, be noted that Finlay J did say, in the course of his reasons, that a sentence of life imprisonment under the law, as it then stood, meant a sentence for the term of the offender’s natural life, and left no hope of release. It may be that in taking the course which, his Honour did, that S13(c) of the Sentencing Act 1989, was overlooked. Whatever the explanation the sentencing approach was, in my respectful view, anomalous and not followed elsewhere. 
    109   In Robinson [2000] NSWSC 972, Adams J held that it was not possible to set a non parole period against a life sentence. His Honour there noted, contrary to the position taken by the DPP, in this case, that S 19A of the Crimes Act stood in the way of such an order. 
    110   S 19A(2), which provides that a person sentenced to life imprisonment for murder “is to serve  the sentence for the term of that person’s natural life”, provides some support for a legislative intention that would exclude release on parole. However, it needs to be borne in mind that a sentence can be served on parole. Section 132 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999, provides that an offender who is released on parole, “is taken to continue serving the sentence during the period” beginning with the date of release and ending when the sentence expires: see also Reading NSWCCA 23 June 1998 in relation to the parallel position of those offenders sentenced to life under the old regime, and released on licence - a matter dealt with under the transitional provisions of the Sentencing Act 1989.  
    111   To the extent that a possible ambiguity arises in this respect, it is appropriate to refer to the Second Reading Speech: Legislative Assembly 30 November 1989 14052 to 14057. That speech unequivocally discloses that the intention of S 19A was to ensure that an offender, sentenced to imprisonment for life for murder, or for the most serious cocaine and heroin trafficking offence, was to be physically incarcerated for the term of his or her natural life. 
    112   The position of prisoners in this category, who obtained a redetermination, under current law, is secured by S 44(5) and clause 4 of Schedule 1 of the Procedure Act, which permits the setting of a non-parole period in respect of a life sentence imposed before S 19A of the Crimes Act came into effect. 
    113   Adams J, however, in Robinson saw an additional problem in the way of setting a non parole period, for an offender sentenced for the first time, under the law as it presently stands. This arises from S 44 of the Procedure Act which provides, relevantly: 
     
      
       
       “44 (1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, a court is required: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) firstly, to set the term of the sentence, and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) secondly, to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (2) The non parole period must not be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence, unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being less, in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision.” 
       
      
    114   His Honour observed: 
     
      
       
       “The calculation, which is mandatory, cannot be made where a life sentence is imposed. Although it seems strange that so fundamental a matter as the ability of a court to make a parole order when imposing a term of life imprisonment is determined by a procedural provision directed to the method of calculating a non-parole period, I have concluded that s 44(2) is decisive. The result is that, where a life sentence is imposed on an offender, a non-parole order cannot be made.” 
       
      
    115   The DPP now submits that the obstacle, seen to arise by his Honour, is not in fact an obstacle, since S 54 of the Procedure Act provides that Division 1 of Part IV of the Act: 
     
      
       
        “does not apply to the sentence of any offender 
       
      
      
       
        (a) to imprisonment for life or for any other indeterminate period” 
       
      
    116   Accordingly, so it was submitted, S 44(2) which is contained within Division 1 of Part 4 could not require a calculation that could not be made, or for that reason preclude the fixing of a non-parole period. 
    117   The exclusion contained in S 54 applies to the whole of Division 1 of Part 4, headed “Setting Terms of Imprisonment”. Its clear effect is to make S 44, and S 45 for that matter, inapplicable to the sentencing of an offender to imprisonment for life. The question which then arises is whether that Division is the sole source of power for the fixing of a non-parole period, or whether the power exists independently of it. 
    118   Division 1 of Part 4, on its face, provides a comprehensive regime for setting terms of imprisonment, including non parole orders. No other legislation has been identified as expressly conferring a power, in a sentencing Judge, to fix a non parole period. In particular, the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999, confers no such power. Rather it assumes that a non parole has been set, and regulates release pursuant to it. That is clear from S 126, which provides: 
     
      
       
       “126 (1) Offenders may be released on parole in accordance with this Part. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) An offender is eligible for release on parole only if: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) the offender is subject to at least one sentence for which a non-parole period has been set, and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) the offender has served the non-parole period of each such sentence and is not subject to any other sentence.” 
         
        
       
      
    119   So far as I can see, there is no source other than Div 1 of Part 4 of the Procedure Act, and specifically S 44 whereby the Court derives authority to set a non parole period. In particular it appears to me that S 21(1) cannot be invoked as a source of power. The reference in that provision to the imposition of a “sentence of imprisonment for a specified “term” is clearly a reference to what is commonly understood as the “head sentence”. The distinction between the concepts of “the term of the sentence” and of the “non parole period for the sentence” is preserved in S 44(1) (a) and (b). 
    120   Moreover, the existence of a legislative intent to ensure that life sentences imposed under S 19A of the Crimes Act, and under S 33A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, are sentences that will see the offender remain in custody for the remainder of his or her natural life is suggested by the circumstance that such sentences are expressly exempted from the provisions contained in Schedule 1 to the Procedure Act. That Schedule permits a person subject to an existing life sentence to apply for the determination of a term and a non parole period in the place of such sentence. The exclusion of life sentences for murder or for serious heroin or cocaine trafficking offences, flows from the definition of “existing life sentence” contained in Para 1 of the Schedule. 
    121   Additionally, as Abadee J observed in Fernando at 535: 
     
      
       
       “Part 2 of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW) which relates to the setting of minimum and additional terms when sentencing a person to imprisonment for an offence does not apply to the sentencing of a person “to imprisonment for life or any other indeterminate period” (Sentencing Act s 13(c)). As was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
       Boyd 
        (1995) 81 A Crim R 260 (referred to in  
       Baker 
        unreported, Court of Appeal, NSW No 60547 of 1993, 20 September 1995)): 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         ‘It is to be borne in mind that the Parliament of New South Wales in enacting s 19A of the Crimes Act has recently declared that it is consistent with current community standards in this State for a person convicted of murder to be sentenced to serve the remainder of his life in prison.’” 
         
        
       
      
    122   I am accordingly of the view that no authority exists to fix a non parole period where an offender is now sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, or for serious heroin or cocaine trafficking.  
    123   I do, however, observe that there would be merit in either permitting that to be done, or in extending the life sentence redetermination procedure to such cases.  
    124   The concerns which exist, in relation to the imposition of indeterminate life sentences, without any option of release on licence or parole, are well known. Such a sentence can be crushing, particularly for a young offender, whose life expectancy, on current tables, may well exceed the fifty-odd years that would apply in the case of the present respondent. They were noted in Garforth NSWCCA 23 May 1994, where the Court said: 
     
      
       
       “But first we should emphasise that we do not intend to diminish the terrible significance of a sentence of life imprisonment. Nor did Newman J. His Honour quoted the following passage from the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in  
       R v Petroff 
        (unreported, 12 November 1991): 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         ‘The indeterminate nature of a life sentence has long been the subject of criticism by penologists and others concerned with the prison system and the punishment of offenders generally. Such a sentence deprives a prisoner of any fixed goal to aim for, it robs him of any incentive and it is personally destructive of his morale. The life sentence imposes intolerable burdens upon most prisoners because of their incarceration for an indeterminate period, and the result of that imposition has been an increased difficulty in their management by the prison authorities. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       We acknowledge the force of these sentiments. That is why life imprisonment is to be imposed only in the worst type of case. Nevertheless, there are cases in which such a severe punishment fits the crime. This is one such case."" 
       
      
    125   The effect of the current law is to continue and to reinforce a division between different categories of persons imprisoned for life, and to condemn those sentenced under S 19A of the Crimes Act, or under S 33A of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985, to an even harsher form of punishment than an indeterminate sentence that was terminable by the Executive. Such an offender has no prospect of release, save for the prerogative of mercy. 
    126   The decisions in Bugmy (1990) 169 CLR 525 (at 537) and Mitchell (1996) 70 ALJR 313 at 320, confirm the notorious inaccuracy of predictions of future dangerousness, yet in a case such as the present that is precisely what is required. It may be that after a lengthy period of imprisonment, counselling and simple maturing, that an offender sentenced to life ceases to be dangerous.  
    127   Lengthy experience with the life sentence redetermination procedure has graphically demonstrated that to be the case, and has seen a controlled and safe return to society of offenders once considered hopelessly violent and dangerous. See the observations of Allen J, in Crump NSWCCA 30 May 1993: 
     
      
       
       “It is the common experience of judges who have had to consider section 13A applications to note the remarkable effect which imprisonment for a decade or more so often has upon young offenders - notwithstanding how brutally and callously they acted when they committed the crime or crimes. Time and again one wonders: ‘how could this apparently well adjusted applicant be the person who committed such a crime?’ Gone is the brashness. Gone is the bravado. Spent is the passion. Young offenders can change so much during a very long time in gaol as to present almost as an entirely different sort of person.” 
       
      
      
     His Honour later added: 
      
      
       
       “I appreciate that the legislation in its present form empowers the Supreme Court to throw away the key, to deny to the prisoner any prospect of ever again being free to live a normal life. But in a civilised country only the most extraordinary circumstances would justify that course being taken - and what was said in the Parliament when the legislation was being enacted evinces a recognition of that.” 
       
      
    128   In suitable cases, it is possible by an appropriately framed sentence, to preserve the possibility of a return to prison to complete the original life sentence, in the event of serious reoffending. Persons now sentenced to life under S 19A of the Crimes Act or under S 33A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act are, however, denied all opportunity of release even if wholly rehabilitated. 
    129   On the other hand, if an offender is sentenced to a term of years with a non parole period, and remains unsettled, unrehabilitated and dangerous, he or she can be denied parole, yet the time will come, at the expiration of the head sentence, when release must occur, with all the undesirable consequences that this entails. An attempt to deal with that problem by legislation failed in Kable (1996) 189 CLR 51. 
    130   As Adams J observed in Robinson at para 35 the grant of power to fix a non parole period in a case such as the present, and I would add, the extension of the redetermination procedure to life sentences under S 19A Crimes Act and S 33A Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, would not offend against the so-called doctrine of “truth in sentencing”. Neither would involve any form of remissions or an exercise of executive clemency. Moreover, the imposition of a non parole period and a head sentence, either at the time of the original sentencing or upon a redetermination, involves a determination by the Court of the minimum and maximum periods that the prisoner must or could serve. Each is stated at the time of sentence or redetermination, and the later release of the prisoner can be decided by the Parole Board, which is in a position to act in the light of its accumulated experience and current information concerning the prisoner’s mental state and progress towards rehabilitation. Moreover, it is to have regard to the principle that the public interest is of primary importance. 
    131   The concerns that exists in this regard, particularly for those persons who may face potential life sentences in their twenties or early thirties, with the problems of institutionalisation, and the risk of the establishment of a significant population of geriatric prisoners, are such that this area of sentencing, in my view, warrants reconsideration. 
    132   The desirability of a review is, in my view reinforced by the circumstance that, depending on the relevant legislation, a specific power or duty to set a non parole period for life sentences exists in Victoria (S11 Sentencing Act 1991), in Tasmania (S 18 Sentencing Act 1997), in Western Australia (S 90 Sentencing Act 1995), and in South Australia (S 32 Criminal Law (Sentencing Act) 1998. A similar power is implicit in Queensland (S 157 Penalties & Sentences Act 1992) although the period set for release is governed pursuant to S 166(1) of the Corrective Services Act 1988 and S 305(1) Criminal Code Act 1899). 
    133   The Northern Territory (S 53 Sentencing Act 1995) does preserve a similar exemption to that in New South Wales in the case of life sentences for murder. The ACT legislation (S 7 of the Parole Act 1976) does not require a non parole period in the case of a life sentence; nor, it seems, does it expressly exclude it. The Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) however, makes express provision for the fixing of non parole periods for persons serving “federal life sentences” (S 19AB(1)(d)). One consequence of this is that an offender sentenced to life for the most serious form of drug offence charged under the Customs Act (1901) may have a non parole period, while an offender sentenced to life for the most serious form of drug trafficking under the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) cannot.  
    134   New South Wales and the Northern Territory alone, it would therefore appear, deny the Court the power to fix a non parole period for a person serving a life sentence for murder, or for serious heroin and cocaine trafficking. Whether New South Wales should retain the harsh and discriminatory regime that exists for those now sentenced to life is a matter suitable, in my view, for review. I would add that had this Court the power, I would have regarded the present case as one where a possibility of ultimate release on parole, even though for the remainder of the respondent’s life, would have been appropriate. 
     
      
     Ground 4 - error assumed from leniency 
      
    135   By reason of the matters identified above it is not necessary to deal with this ground of appeal. 
     
      
     Ground 5 - special circumstances 
      
    136   Having regard to the need which I envisage to re-sentence the respondent to life, it is also not necessary to deal with the fifth ground of appeal. 
     
      
     CONCLUSION 
      
    137   In considering the approach which the Court should take to this appeal, I have had due regard to the principle of double jeopardy, and to the discretion which attaches to Crown appeals against leniency of sentence as noted in Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562-563. I am of the view that the criminality of the respondent, and the level of his dangerousness, are such that, notwithstanding the principles there discussed, it is necessary for the Court to intervene. 
    138   Since the Crown Prosecutor at trial expressly did not seek a life sentence for the first count in the first indictment, I consider it inappropriate for this Court to intervene in relation to the sentence imposed for that count. However, in relation to the two other counts of murder, I am of the view that the sentences imposed below should be quashed. In lieu thereof the respondent should be sentenced to concurrent sentences of imprisonment for life, each to date from 1 December 1998. I would decline to fix a non parole period, for the reason alone that the Court lacks jurisdiction, in relation to those sentences, to do so. 
    139   JAMES J: I agree with the Judgment of Wood CJ at CL.

    030035/99 REGINA v MARK MALA VALERA @ VAN KREVEL 
     
      
       
      
    SENTENCE1   HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, Mark Mala Valera, stood trial in Wollongong charged with two counts of murder to which, upon the presentation of the indictment on 12 July 2000, he pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. Those pleas were not accepted by the Crown and the trial proceeded. 
     
      
       
      
    2   On 8 August 2000 the jury found the prisoner guilty as charged on both counts, so the prisoner is convicted of the murder of David John O’Hearn on 12 June 1998 and of the murder of Francis Neville Arkell on 26 June 1998.  
     
      
       
      
    3   It is now my responsibility to sentence the prisoner for these two crimes having heard submissions on sentence from the Crown on 1 September 2000 and from Mr Nicholson on 6 October 2000. 
     
      
       
      
    4   Victim impact statements have been placed before the Court from relatives of each of the deceased, but it is well settled that I cannot be influenced by their content in determining what sentences are appropriate: see R v Previtera 94 A Crim R 76; R v Bollen 99 A Crim R 510; and R v Dang [1999] NSWCCA 42. 
     
      
       
      
    5   The deceased, David John O’Hearn, was a fifty-nine year old man who lived alone in a townhouse at 54 Bateman Avenue, Albion Park. His body, horribly mutilated, was discovered on the floor of the living room in his townhouse on the morning of Saturday 13 June 1998. I am satisfied that he met his death on the previous evening. The scene that presented itself to those who entered the deceased’s premises on that Saturday morning can only be described as gruesome in the extreme. It was a scene that was captured on the photographs then taken and tendered in evidence at the trial. These photographs comprehensively depict what was described in oral evidence and they are acutely disturbing. 
     
      
       
      
    6   The body of the deceased was found to be decapitated and the head had been deposited in the kitchen sink. The body was otherwise mutilated: the left hand was severed and it was found resting on a sofa in the lounge room; there were deep incisions to the abdomen, and wounding extended from just above the sternum down to the mid point of the abdomen. Dr Cala, who conducted the post mortem examination, observed five intersecting and parallel incised wounds on the lower chest affecting both right and left sides and the wounding of the abdomen exposed the shaft of a hammer which had been inserted through the anus. The head of this hammer was visible between the buttocks of the deceased and the deceased was lying with his jeans and underpants lowered to a point about the knees. The deceased’s penis had been mutilated and intestinal material had been disturbed. Indeed, near the foot of the deceased was found a silver coloured tray on which a section of bowel was resting. On the breakfast bar in the kitchen a number of sections of intestine were found lying. 
     
      
       
      
    7   There were found on the floor near the deceased a number of knives and implements either used to mutilate the body or put there in contemplation of such intended use. These items included a small metal saw, four knives, a razor blade and a corkscrew. There was much bloodstaining on the carpet near the body and there was blood spatter on items of furniture and curtains. There was blood smearing on a table on which liquor decanters were located and the word Satan had been written on a mirror suspended above that table. The word Satan had also been written in blood on the wall above the lounge upon which the severed hand was resting and immediately above that word, and also written in blood, was a pentagram. On the wall beside the television set an inverted cross had been drawn in blood. 
     
      
       
      
    8   I do not propose to record more here by way of describing the crime scene. The house had been searched and possessions of the deceased lay scattered on the living room floor and in the master bedroom upstairs.  
     
      
       
      
    9   Dr Cala expressed the opinion, which I accept, that the mutilation of the body occurred after death and that the trauma to the head was inflicted first. There were numerous lacerations to the scalp and there was gross fracturing of the skull. The many injuries to the head affected the left ear, the left cheek, the left side of the mouth, the nose, the left side of the forehead, across the forehead, above the left eyebrow, the right side of the forehead, above the right ear, the back of the head and the very top of the head. There was a Y shaped full thickness laceration on the right side of the head with grossly fractured skull underneath, and the doctor found that the left eyeball had been depressed because the globe had been punctured by a sharp object. 
     
      
       
      
    10   In Dr Cala’s opinion, ten to twelve blows would have been required to produce the lacerations he observed and there may well have been more blows that did not produce identifiable injuries. Dr Cala considered that extreme to severe force would have been needed to produce the head wounds. Not only were there numerous separate skull fragments caused by the trauma but there were gross lacerations to the brain and these lacerations were caused either by direct penetration by an implement or by bony fracturing or by the brain moving around by reason of concussive effect. 
     
      
       
      
    11   It was the head injuries I have described which, in the doctor’s opinion, caused death, and I so find. 
     
      
       
      
    12   I pass to the discovery of the body of the deceased Francis Neville Arkell two weeks later on 27 June 1998. Like David John O’Hearn, this deceased lived alone at his residence at 1 Reserve Street, Wollongong. This victim, who was the former Mayor of Wollongong, was sixty-eight years of age. His residence comprised a weatherboard house with an adjoining garage that had been converted into a granny flat. 
     
      
       
      
    13   The body of the deceased was found lying on the floor beside the bed in the granny flat. The crime scene evidenced that this victim had been the subject of a savage attack. The deceased was found lying on his back with his legs outstretched, wearing tracksuit pants and a white singlet. The face of the deceased was heavily bloodstained and his head had been very extensively traumatised and was resting in a large pool of blood. Three tie pins had been placed in his person, one in the left cheek, one in the corner of the left eye and one in the right eyelid and there was a splinter of timber found on post mortem examination to have been embedded in the neck of the deceased. This plainly enough had broken off a timber peg, most of which was found on the bed. There was a leather belt lying partially around the neck of the deceased as well as the electrical cord of a lamp. Beside the bed was a broken timber lamp stand, which the evidence revealed had been used to attack the head of the deceased. Also used in the attack was a glass ashtray. 
     
      
       
      
    14   There was a large quantity of blood on the tiled floor in the bathroom and in the doorway to that bathroom, indicating that the deceased had been in that vicinity during the course of the attack and a pair of bloodstained boots and tracksuit pants (which the evidence proved had been left there by the prisoner) were found lying on the floor near the foot of the bed.  
     
      
       
      
    15   I will not describe the crime scene evidence in further detail but there were many photos introduced into evidence which depict what was seen when the body was discovered. 
     
      
       
      
    16   Again, it was Dr Cala who examined the body at the scene and who conducted the subsequent post mortem examination. Dr Cala said that there were thirty-four injuries to the head region. The many lacerations affected the back of the head, the top of the head, the left side of the head, the right upper ear, where cartilage and muscle was exposed, and, indeed, the doctor described the right ear as crushed and severely haematosed. Other lacerations implicated the left eyebrow, the area below the left ear, the bridge of the nose, the right forehead, the area above the right eyebrow, the area around the eye, both lips, the left side of the mouth and the left side of the cheek and the chin. The deceased had fractured teeth and fractures of the right maxilla and zygoma. There was also a fracture of the hyoid bone and of the sixth rib on the right side. The left jugular vein was punctured. 
     
      
       
      
    17   In Dr Cala’s opinion, which I accept, the deceased died from the combined effect of blunt and sharp force trauma to the head and neck and ligature strangulation. 
     
      
       
      
    18   Some three months after the body of Francis Neville Arkell was discovered the prisoner surrendered himself on the night of 30 September 1998 at the Wollongong Police Station where he admitted he had killed both deceased and explained his conduct in making such admissions by saying that to surrender himself “seemed like the right thing to do”. In very extensive ERISPs, followed by a walkaround at each crime scene, the prisoner, between 12.55 am and 7.50 am on 1 October 1998, admitted being the person who attacked each of the deceased. His presentation on video was, in my opinion, that of a person who was coherent and cooperative. 
     
      
       
      
    19   What the prisoner told the police in the ERISPs included the following: 
     
      
       
        
       (a) In relation to the death of David John O’Hearn: 
        
        
         
         The prisoner told the police that he did not know this deceased as a person but on the day of the killing he just wanted to kill someone and went to his house  
         “just random” 
         . He said that there was no forward planning, that he just felt really angry and felt  
         “I could kill someone” 
         . In the walkaround the prisoner explained using a pretext to gain entry to the deceased’s townhouse:  
         “I stayed at the door and asked if there was any, like accommodation around,” 
          and the deceased invited him in  
         “Come in and we’ll talk about it.”  
         He described the killing as  
         “just random” 
          more than once and he had so described this killing in the same way to Mr Day, his martial arts instructor, on the evening that he gave himself up and shortly before doing so. The prisoner also told the police in the ERISP that he counted the number of times that he struck the deceased with the decanter. He told the police he did this ten times and that after that he concluded that the deceased was dead because there was no pulse. It was then, according to his version, that the prisoner went upstairs looking for valuables, and it was after his search upstairs that he went back downstairs and collected the items used subsequently to mutilate the body. He also described to police the manner of mutilation of the body and using the severed hand to draw a pentagram and the inverted cross which I described. 
         
        
        
       (b) In relation to the death of Francis Neville Arkell: 
        
        
         
         The prisoner told the police in the ERISP that he knew of this man who he described as  
         “a very, very horrible man” 
         . The prisoner told the police that he went to the deceased’s home because he had made up his mind that he wanted to kill him. He explained that he went there under a subterfuge: he just pretended to be gay and communicated this to the deceased by ringing him up, telling him he was gay and inviting himself down. The prisoner repeated more than once that he went to the deceased’s house to kill the deceased and he said that he attacked him, having spoken to him for a couple of minutes. He said that he picked up the lamp and brought it down on the head of the deceased more than forty times. He described the deceased’s attempts to protect himself, crawling away on the floor. He told the police that he used a lamp cord to try to strangle the deceased. He told the police how he kicked him a few times in the face but this, he said, was after the deceased was already dead. Then he said he grabbed two tie pins, putting one in the left cheek and one in his eye. He also told the police he had tried to push the fork into the neck of the deceased but he said that the wood broke. He left his Colorado boots and his tracksuit pants behind, wearing a pair of the deceased’s tracksuit pants away instead of his own. Returning to the reason for his action, he said that he did not like the deceased  
         “all the nasty things he has done to kids. Read about him. Heard about him in the papers and the media.” 
         
        
       
      
    20   The prisoner, in the course of his evidence, told the jury that he had no intention of killing either deceased, but nevertheless the prisoner’s case was presented upon the basis that the prisoner did cause the death of each of the deceased but that he ought only be convicted of manslaughter in each case on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
       (i) that the Crown had failed to negative provocation; 
        
        
       (ii) by reason of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. 
        
       
      
    21   Central to the issues which the case that the prisoner raised was the assertion that the prisoner attacked each of his victims at a time when he had lost his self control. What triggered this loss, according to his evidence and to what he had earlier told Dr Jolly and Mr Taylor, who gave evidence in the case for the prisoner, was the request of each victim that the prisoner should be the active partner in penile-anal intercourse. The prisoner, who revealed such alleged abuse to Mr Taylor in July this year, told him then, and this Court in his evidence, that his father had sexually abused him in his childhood from about the age of seven and that his father had submitted the prisoner to acts of anal penetration some five times between the age of twelve and the age of fifteen. Further, the prisoner said he had been asked by his father to reverse those roles.  
     
      
       
      
    22   It is clear from the verdicts of the jury that the jury was satisfied that the Crown had negatived provocation in each case. It also follows from the verdicts that the defence of substantial impairment was rejected by the jury in the case of each killing. 
     
      
       
      
    23   The description of the killings which I have already given suffices to emphasise the extreme objective gravity of each of these crimes. 
     
      
       
      
    24   Were there facts which mitigated the seriousness of these crimes, or either of them? The verdicts of the jury do not relieve me of the responsibility of considering the evidence with a view to making findings of fact left open by the verdicts, and necessary for the purposes of determining appropriate sentences. 
     
      
       
      
    25   Whilst the jury has been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has negatived provocation, they may have done so for a number of reasons in accordance with directions the jury was given: 
     
      
       
        
       (i) because the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased did not engage in conduct or utter words directed to or affecting the prisoner before the acts causing death, which conduct or words was or were provocative; or 
        
        
       (ii) because the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that if the deceased did engage in conduct or utter words directed towards or affecting the prisoner which were provocative, that the prisoner did not lose his self control because of such conduct or words; or 
        
        
       (iii) that the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that if the prisoner did lose his self control because of such conduct or words that his acts causing death were not acts that occurred whilst he was in loss of self control; or 
        
        
       (iv) that the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt if the prisoner caused the death of the deceased by acts whilst in loss of self control because of the provocative conduct or words of the deceased, that conduct or those words were not such as could have caused an ordinary person in the position of the prisoner to so lose his self control as to form an intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. 
        
       
      
    26   I must assess the relevant evidence to make such findings as appear to me to be appropriate on the evidence (as to each of the crimes), giving the prisoner the benefit of any reasonable doubt: see the judgment of Badgery-Parker J in R v Leonard, approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal in its unreported judgment of 7 December 1998, and in particular in the judgment of McInerney J at p 4. 
     
      
       
      
    27   Likewise, on the issue of substantial impairment, it does not follow that the rejection of this defence necessarily means that the factual basis upon which that defence was raised is to be ignored. 
     
      
       
      
    28   In R v Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466 at 485 Lee J said in relation to the situation where a defence of provocation or self defence had been raised before the jury and rejected: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Had provocation been accepted by the jury, it would have entitled the accused to a verdict of not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter (Crimes Act, s 23) and if self-defence had been accepted it would have entitled him to an acquittal or a verdict of guilty of manslaughter if the case was one of excessive force in self-defence: Viro v The Queen (1978) 141 CLR 88. The rejection of these (or any other defences) does not necessarily mean that the accused cannot get the benefit, as a mitigating factor, at least to some extent, of the factual basis upon which they rested. If the sentencing judge is satisfied from the credible evidence in the case that there was a degree of provocation, he may take it into account as a mitigating factor; likewise, if the judge is satisfied from credible evidence that there was an element of self-defence involved in the killing. But every case must be judged according to its own circumstances and the question for the court in every case will be whether on the evidence the factor being put forward as a mitigating factor has a relevant connection with the crime in its full sense as I have explained earlier.” 
         
        
       
      
    29   It is appropriate that I consider the factual basis upon which the prisoner relied on the issue of provocation and in his defence of substantial impairment to assess whether the evidence established that there were circumstances which reduced the seriousness of the crimes, or either of them. 
     
      
       
      
    30   For the above reasons I must therefore closely consider the evidence given by the prisoner at this trial, together with the other evidence that bears upon the objective gravity of each crime. 
     
      
       
      
    31   The evidence satisfies me that the prisoner had a very unhappy upbringing. He was born on 24 April 1979, so at the time of the killings he was only nineteen years of age and he is presently only twenty-one years old. The prisoner said that his mother left home when he was two or three years of age and his earliest memory of his father being violent to him was at about the age of six or seven when he was thrown into a toy box. Other acts of physical abuse were instanced. The prisoner said that his father threatened him with a rifle, which he placed close to his head and told his son that he would blow his brains out. The prisoner wet himself on that and many other occasions through fear of what his father was going to do to him.  
     
      
       
      
    32   The prisoner said that his father frequently punched him and kicked him. This happened a few times a week until he was fifteen years of age. Thereafter the frequency of any physical violence diminished and the last time his father was violent to him was at the age of seventeen when he punched him in the face and on this occasion the prisoner had to go to hospital. There was a time when the father threw a spanner at him.  
     
      
       
      
    33   In addition to the physical cruelty, he said that his father called him names. He said that he had a stutter and his father used to tease him about this. There were occasions that his father used to threaten to kill them both when he was driving the prisoner to the railway station. 
     
      
       
      
    34   The prisoner’s father gave evidence in which he acknowledged that he had been guilty of physical attacks. Mr Van Krevel said that he had a bad temper and he admitted assaults which he explained by reason of his wife having left. Not only did he hit and punch the prisoner but he said he kicked him both when he was standing and when he was on the ground. He admitted having thrown a spanner at his son on one occasion, intending to hit him with it, and he admitted to having teased his son about his slow speech and to having abused him verbally.  
     
      
       
      
    35   I find on the evidence I have reviewed that the prisoner was physically ill- treated by his father, and also that he was teased by him. Such ill-treatment, serious as it was, was frankly acknowledged by the prisoner’s father in the witness box. 
     
      
       
      
    36   Whilst he freely admitted to physical abuse of the prisoner, Mr Van Krevel continued to deny throughout a testing cross examination that he had ever sexually abused his son.  
     
      
       
      
    37   The prisoner gave evidence that this form of abuse began when he was seven years of age. The abuse took the form of fondling the prisoner’s penis and his father put his finger in the prisoner’s anus. The prisoner said that each engaged in oral sex and the father had the prisoner masturbate him. He said that there were five acts of anal intercourse which the prisoner’s father committed on the prisoner but the prisoner declined to reciprocate in this regard when his father asked him to do so. 
     
      
       
      
    38   The prisoner’s sister, who was approximately eighteen months younger than the prisoner, gave evidence which bore upon the allegation of sexual abuse. Ms Van Krevel did not assert that she observed any act of sexual abuse of her brother but she said that when she was approximately thirteen years of age her father would read to her in her bed, wearing nothing but his dressing gown, and that he would then go down the hall to the prisoner’s bedroom and she said that she heard him close the door. The witness said that the events thus described happened frequently from the time Ms Van Krevel was thirteen years of age. 
     
      
       
      
    39   The evidence of sexual abuse by his father, as given by the prisoner at the trial, contained inconsistencies. It also differed from the histories given when the allegation of sexual abuse by the father was belatedly raised with Mr Taylor in July 2000. In his final submissions, Mr Nicholson adverted to there being some earlier complaint of sexual abuse in the prison records, but these records were not introduced into evidence. To record chronologically the various assertions the prisoner made on the subject of sexual abuse by his father: 
     
      
       
        
       (i) on 3 July 2000 the prisoner told Mr Taylor that his father had never sexually assaulted him; 
        
        
       (ii) on 8 July 2000 the prisoner told Mr Taylor that his father had sexually assaulted him and that this began when he was about seven years of age when his father forced the prisoner’s penis into his anus. The prisoner told Mr Taylor that when he was about twelve years of age he put his penis in his father’s anus, albeit unwillingly. He also said that his father used to make the prisoner masturbate him and suck him off; 
        
        
       (iii) on 19 July the prisoner confirmed for Dr Jolly what he had told Mr Taylor about his father’s sexual abuse and he told Dr Jolly that his father had anal intercourse with him twenty times in four years; 
        
        
       (iv) when the prisoner gave evidence at the trial, he gave evidence that his father had inserted his penis in the prisoner’s anus on a few occasions and when pressed he said that it happened five times over a period of a few years. This was a significantly different account from that to Dr Jolly; 
        
        
       (v) in evidence before the jury, the prisoner said that when he was about twelve his father asked him to put his penis in his father’s anus. The prisoner gave conflicting evidence about what followed this request. He said that when asked by his father he did not do so. Later he said that he did what his father asked him to do. Later still he said that he did not do it. I refer to the transcript:

           Q. What was that? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. He wanted me to insert myself into him. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. And what happened? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. I didn’t…I didn’t.” 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Later, still in the prisoner’s evidence in chief, T462: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           “Q. Yesterday, just before the Court adjourned, I was asking you a number of questions about the last occasion that you saw Mr Arkell; do you recall that? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. And I had asked you what it was that brought on the attack on Mr Arkell, and you said that there was a point when you felt put on the spot, and you felt put on the spot because he asked you to put your penis into him. Do you recall those questions? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. And then I asked you whether - putting Mr O’Hearn to one side - you had been asked to do that on any other occasion, and you told us that your father had told you to do that. He didn’t ask you, he told you to do that; do you remember that? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. When your father told you to do that, what did you do? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. I did what he told me to do. I didn’t really resist. I couldn’t because I was scared.” 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Subsequently, in cross examination, T497: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           “Q. You have also said that when you were about 12 there was an occasion, as I understand your evidence yesterday, yesterday, the first occasion when your father asked you to place your penis in his backside, is that correct? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. You see yesterday when my learned friend asked you how old you were when you first did that you answered ‘I didn’t’, remember saying that yesterday? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Yet today when my learned friend has gone back to that same question I understand you to say you did. Is that right? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Well, no I didn’t, no. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. You didn’t? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. No. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. So what you said yesterday was correct, is that right? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Why did you say this morning that you did? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. I don’t know.” 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    40   That the prisoner had complied with his father’s request to place his penis in his father’s anus was a significant matter of history from the point of view of both Dr Jolly and Mr Taylor, and this is because of the account which the prisoner gave to those witnesses as to the circumstances in which he attacked firstly the deceased O’Hearn and later the deceased Arkell.  
     
      
       
      
    41   The prisoner, in his evidence, offered as some explanation of the failure of disclosure of his father’s sexual abuse his embarrassment to raise the matter earlier. In assessing the evidence given by the prisoner of his alleged sexual abuse I recognise, as indeed Dr Jolly opined, that embarrassment and/or shame frequently affords an explanation for a child not disclosing the occurrence of abuse of such a nature. I also recognise that experience in the courts indicates that a person in a parental position will be slow to face up to responsibility for crimes of the nature here alleged by the prisoner against his father, and I do not overlook this in evaluating the evidence of denial given by Mr Van Krevel. However, I did not find the prisoner’s evidence at his trial to be satisfactory, and assessing all the evidence in point, including, of course, the evidence of Ms Van Krevel, I am not persuaded that the prisoner has proved on the balance of probabilities that his father did sexually assault him, or that the prisoner sexually penetrated his father. Mr Nicholson properly acknowledged that since the prisoner relied upon the assertion that he had been sexually abused in the manner above considered as a matter going to mitigation, the prisoner bore the onus of proof of this assertion, and he has failed to discharge that onus. Such failure inevitably impacts upon the issue of provocation and the defence of diminished responsibility. 
     
      
       
      
    42   The version given by the prisoner to the police in the ERISPs in relation to each of these killings of course differs considerably from the various later accounts expressed to the psychiatrists and to the psychologist called to give evidence. It also differs from the prisoner’s evidence at the trial. The Crown submitted that the later versions were fabrications advanced to support the prisoner on the issue of provocation and on the defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. Mr Nicholson on the other hand submitted, consistently with his address to the jury on this issue, that the ERISPs did not present a true account and that the prisoner’s evidence did. The reliability of the ERISPs is in issue as to both killings and I now propose to address this issue. 
     
      
       
      
    43   In the ERISP account of events which the prisoner gave in relation to the killing of Mr O’Hearn, he described himself as being “straight, heterosexual” (Q & A 244). He was later asked: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Q. 316 …so do you know whether David was hetero- or homosexual? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I don’t know at all. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. 317 You don’t know? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No.” 
         
        
       
      
    44   By way of contrast with the ERISP account as to the circumstances in which he entered the O’Hearn home, the prisoner’s final account was that he first met Mr O’Hearn when he went to his shop at Dapto to buy some drinks in company with some friends in February 1998. According to him, on that occasion Mr O’Hearn stared straight at him in an unusual way and when the prisoner was paying for the drinks the deceased said “Something what you like and something what I like.”  
     
      
       
      
    45   The prisoner said he returned to that shop on the morning that he killed the deceased. He did so on his way back from Unanderra. On this occasion he said that the deceased motioned him into a closet in the shop and masturbated him. Having done this he invited the prisoner to his house that evening and the prisoner accepted the invitation. The prisoner said that the deceased provided him with a drink and sat beside him on a lounge, from which position the prisoner and the deceased watched a pornographic video.  
     
      
       
      
    46   After that was over the prisoner said that the deceased asked him to give the deceased a back massage and to have sex, that the deceased then lowered his trousers and underpants, exposing his backside and getting down on his hands and knees. The prisoner said that he “whacked” the deceased on the head with a wine decanter. He said that he did this because he was “put on the spot” and there was no way out of it and he said he just went out of control and “started to do what happened to him” (the deceased). He said that the deceased’s pants were down around his knees when the attack began and that it was a frenzied attack. 
     
      
       
      
    47   It seems to me there are a number of reasons why this final account of events cannot be accepted.  
     
      
       
      
    48   The deceased was wearing jeans and there was blood deposit at the back of these jeans up near the top of them. I accept the evidence of Det. Doherty and of Dr Cala to the effect that the jeans must have been up at the time that staining occurred. The prisoner’s account of events cannot be reconciled with the significance of this blood deposit. 
     
      
       
      
    49   There is a further problem about this final account. According to the prisoner, he removed the pornographic video and took it away with him but he did not put anything in its place. Evidence in the prosecution case, which I accept, was to the effect that when the body was discovered the television set was on at normal volume and there was a video in the machine which had a segment involving Her Majesty the Queen and other material, none of which was of a pornographic nature. 
     
      
       
      
    50   Mr Nicholson submitted that the ERISP account which the prisoner gave in relation to the killing of Mr O’Hearn was frequently untruthful and that this submission was supported by crime scene evidence. This was a submission developed in considerable detail before the jury at the trial, and I have had regard to this submission in considering and reconsidering the ERISP account upon which the Crown has relied. By reason of the nature of the evidence, I have, of course, had the opportunity of hearing and observing the prisoner as he was questioned both on the interview and on the subsequent walkaround. I remarked earlier upon my assessment of his presentation as seen on video (at para 18). I am also mindful of what Dr Milton said as to the significance of this evidence (T782) and I accept Dr Milton’s evidence in point. 
     
      
       
      
    51   I have concluded that the Crown’s submissions as to the reliability of the ERISP and of the walkaround evidence are to be preferred to Mr Nicholson’s contrary submission. 
     
      
       
      
    52   I find the ERISP account of the killing of Mr O’Hearn to be substantially and essentially reliable. It is consistent with the jury’s verdict that the jury rejected the prisoner’s contrary account as to the circumstances in which he killed Mr O’Hearn and I reject that later account which simply cannot stand with the ERISP account. It follows that I also reject as untruthful the final accounts to Dr Jolly and Mr Taylor to the extent that they were inconsistent with what the prisoner told the police on the ERISP. 
     
      
       
      
    53   I reject the prisoner’s assertion that he was sexually propositioned by the deceased Mr O’Hearn immediately before the killing occurred. I reject the prisoner’s evidence that he did what he did because he lost control. I find that the prisoner’s description of his behaviour at and after the killing indicated not only an awareness of what he had done but also that he was in control of his actions. He was able to recall the number of blows he had inflicted - this tallied with Dr Cala’s evidence. Having killed the deceased he searched for valuables and selected a particular item of jewellery to take away with him. He then returned to the body for the purpose of the extensive mutilation of it. 
     
      
       
      
    54   I turn to the reliability of the ERISP version of the circumstances of the killing of Mr Arkell. 
     
      
       
      
    55   Contrary to that ERISP, the prisoner told Dr Jolly and Mr Taylor that he had had a sexual relationship with Mr Arkell that developed in 1997. It began with masturbation but proceeded to what the prisoner described as oral sex and anal intercourse, with the deceased as the active partner. According to the prisoner, the deceased wanted the prisoner to be the active partner on the occasion that the fatal attack took place. Again, as he had felt with the deceased O’Hearn, the prisoner said he felt “put on the spot” and he described the attack which followed as a frenzied one with no self control.  
     
      
       
      
    56   In the ERISP relating to the Arkell death, the prisoner was asked about his sexual preference: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Q646 O.K. What about yourself, have you got, what’s your sexual preference … 
         
        
        
         
         A I’m hetero - - - 
         
        
        
         
         Q647 Heterosexual. 
         
        
        
         
         A. - - - sexual. 
         
        
        
         
         Q648 Have you got a current girlfriend or? 
         
        
        
         
         A No, not now. 
         
        
        
         
         Q649 Ah hmm. 
         
        
        
         
         A I did, but we broke up 
         
        
        
         
         Q650 Have you ever got involved in any homosexual relationships or? 
         
        
        
         
         A No, no.” 
         
        
       
      
    57   Mr Nicholson submitted that at the time of the ERISP the prisoner was seeking to deflect his questioners from exploring the topic of any sexual relationship with his victim and that the above responses are to be considered in that light because this would lead to exposure of the prisoner’s earlier sexual abuse by his father. I do not find this submission attractive. The prisoner has not proved that he was sexually abused by his father and since the prisoner was in the course of admitting to the police that he had committed the most serious of crimes, an acknowledgment that he had engaged in homosexual activities with his victim would not have made his criminality any the worse. Indeed, had the prisoner killed his victim in the circumstances later claimed by him, one might have expected the prisoner to have told the police of such circumstances in an endeavour to reduce the level of his culpability. 
     
      
       
      
    58   Further, the crime scene evidence does not support the prisoner’s later accounts. The deceased’s body was found to be clothed. As the photographic evidence shows, the deceased was found wearing tracksuit pants and a singlet. Moreover, when the prisoner attacked the deceased he was obviously wearing his tracksuit pants and boots which became so heavily bloodstained in the course of the attack. The state of dress of the victim and of the prisoner is inconsistent with what the prisoner claimed had occurred and what he claimed the deceased requested him to do. 
     
      
       
      
    59   My assessment generally of the prisoner was that he was not a credible witness as he gave his evidence at the trial. 
     
      
       
      
    60   As with the O’Hearn ERISP, I accept the submission advanced by the Crown and I find the Arkell ERISP to be essentially reliable. Here again the ERISP account cannot be reconciled with the prisoner’s later versions. I reject the prisoner’s later contrary accounts of the circumstances of the killing of Mr Arkell. I reject the prisoner’s evidence that he was called upon by Mr Arkell to engage in sexual activity and that this prompted a loss of self control. I reject the prisoner’s assertion that he lost control when he attacked this victim, and I accept Dr Milton’s analysis that this was on the contrary a purposeful killing.  
     
      
       
      
    61   Before making the findings I have expressed, I have closely considered the evidence of the psychiatrist Dr Jolly and the psychologist Mr Taylor, who were called in the prisoner’s case, and also the evidence of Dr Milton called by the Crown. 
     
      
       
      
    62   Dr Jolly saw the prisoner for assessment purposes on five occasions, the first of which was 6 May 1999 and the last of which was during the course of the trial. Dr Jolly had access for assessment purposes to the police statements, to Mr Taylor’s reports, and to Dr Milton’s report. Dr Jolly alerted himself from the outset to the complications on assessment because of the different histories the prisoner had given. Dr Jolly said that he also found interview difficult because of the wide ranging moods and demeanours of the prisoner. Dr Jolly said that he was able to rule out schizophrenia, manic depressive psychosis and major depression. By 22 December 1999 there were three issues that stood out in Dr Jolly’s mind: 
     
      
       
        
       (i) that the prisoner had experienced lengthy periods of physical and emotional abuse in childhood and that there was some developmental disability; 
        
        
       (ii) that the prisoner had a crisis of sexual identity; 
        
        
       (iii) that he had an interest in Satanism and in this regard he described to Dr Jolly a particular picture in the house where the prisoner was living. This picture had a devil’s face on it, which the prisoner said stared at him. The prisoner himself gave no evidence in Court about the picture described by Dr Jolly. 
        
       
      
    63   At the first consultation in May 1999 the prisoner told Dr Jolly why he killed Mr O’Hearn. He said the devil told him to kill somebody. He said that he did not know Mr O’Hearn; that he rode to Unanderra and then back to his house where he listened to heavy metal music. He said he then walked past where Mr O’Hearn was living, he accepted an invitation into Mr O’Hearn’s residence and drank what was possibly a “spiked drink”. He explained that he attacked Mr O’Hearn, wishing it was his father. 
     
      
       
      
    64   Then in the interview in December 1999 the prisoner gave Dr Jolly a history of having met Mr Arkell and that he was seduced on his third or fourth visit. The sexual activity that followed included masturbation, but no anal intercourse. On the day of the killing the prisoner resisted intercourse, went to massage Mr Arkell, and aggression occurred when the prisoner “was overtaken by something”. On this assessment in December 1999, Dr Jolly returned to the O’Hearn killing when the prisoner described visiting Mr O’Hearn’s shop with his friends and then the later visit on the day of the killing. He said that on this occasion the prisoner told him he was shown a pornographic video and the prisoner described the prisoner’s thinking as being influenced by the picture referred to earlier. Dr Jolly’s assessment was interrupted by the prison routine. When he left the prisoner in December 1999, Dr Jolly thought that there had been a loss of control when the killing occurred, but he was not then decided as to why. 
     
      
       
      
    65   The next consultation in February 2000 did not assist Dr Jolly, but on 19 July he saw the prisoner equipped with Mr Taylor’s report which disclosed the allegation of sexual abuse by the father. 
     
      
       
      
    66   In Dr Jolly’s opinion, the fact that, on the history the prisoner ultimately gave, each victim adopted a crouching position for sexual intercourse was a destabilising factor that contributed to the prisoner’s loss of control. It did this because it induced a re-experience of a scene out of his childhood, acting as a trigger to anger, this because of the prisoner’s sexual abuse by his father, according to the history by then available to Dr Jolly. In Dr Jolly’s opinion, at the time that he killed Mr O’Hearn the prisoner was suffering from an abnormality of mind in the form of an altered state of consciousness from the impact of the heavy metal music he had been listening to and from alterations of perception that grew as he looked at the picture in the townhouse where he lived. He said this had significant impact on the prisoner’s loss of control. The altered state of consciousness was extreme and the loss of control flowed from this.  
     
      
       
      
    67   So far as the Arkell killing was concerned, the doctor’s opinion ultimately was that there was a degree of loss of consciousness manifested in continued satanic thoughts, but he was less sure of this he said than in the case of the killing of Mr O’Hearn. However, Dr Jolly’s opinion was, assuming that there had been sexual abuse by the father, that this was re-experienced by the prisoner when the deceased invited anal intercourse. This operated as the force causing loss of control, with the crouch position operating as the trigger.  
     
      
       
      
    68   In short, Dr Jolly considered that on the occasion of each killing, the prisoner was suffering from an abnormality of mind in the form of an altered state of consciousness. He regarded the impairment thus occasioned as more than moderate, at least in the case of the O’Hearn killing, and for brief periods it may be that the prisoner could not “sort out reality”. Dr Jolly agreed in the course of his cross examination that the “crouched position” of the victim was an important element in his assessment, especially in the case of the second victim, Mr Arkell. It is also clear from Dr Jolly’s evidence that the doctor accepted that the prisoner had attacked each of his victims at a time when he had lost his self control. 
     
      
       
      
    69   Mr Taylor first saw the prisoner on 3 July 2000. The prisoner gave a history then of physical abuse by his father, but he told Mr Taylor there had been no sexual abuse. The prisoner gave a history then of what occurred between himself and Mr O’Hearn on the day of the killing that included the assertion of the earlier incident in the shop where the prisoner claimed that Mr O’Hearn had masturbated him in the closet in the shop, that later that night when he visited the victim at his home the prisoner asked him to “do that to him” and that was when the prisoner grabbed a heavy instrument and struck the victim on the head. This, of course, is a somewhat different account than that ultimately given by the prisoner as to the nature of the invitation to him immediately before he embarked upon killing Mr O’Hearn. 
     
      
       
      
    70   In relation to Mr Arkell, the prisoner gave a history of sexual relationship over a period of time that included anal penetration of the prisoner by his victim. He told Mr Taylor that the victim had anal and oral sex with the prisoner on the day of the killing and asked the prisoner to do the same to him and that this was when he started to kill this victim. 
     
      
       
      
    71   Following this first interview Mr Taylor thought that the possibilities were that the prisoner was a psychopathic killer or alternatively that he had some dissociative identity disorder type of problem. However, on the second interview five days later the prisoner gave the account that his father had sexually assaulted him from the age of seven and that this had progressed to anal intercourse from the age of twelve. The prisoner told Mr Taylor, of course, that he had entered his father. It was on this occasion the prisoner gave a further history in relation to the O’Hearn killing that O’Hearn was on his knees when the loss of control occurred. 
     
      
       
      
    72   Mr Taylor decided after the second interview that the prisoner was suffering from a borderline personality disorder and that when he killed Mr O’Hearn he was experiencing dissociation. He said that the borderline personality disorder amounted to abnormality of mind and that the prisoner was suffering from an extreme level of dissociation when he made his attack. In Mr Taylor’s opinion the prisoner knew what was happening but his capacity to control himself was affected by a psychotic episode that came from the underlying borderline personality disorder and an extreme level of dissociation. Mr Taylor said that he held the same opinion in relation to the killing of Mr Arkell. 
     
      
       
      
    73   Dr Milton saw the prisoner on 17 July 2000. He had access to the statements of various witnesses, the transcripts of the ERISPs and the walkarounds and he also saw the police videos. In this last respect he enjoyed an advantage not shared by either Dr Jolly or Mr Taylor, and I regard this as a significant advantage.  
     
      
       
      
    74   Dr Milton assessed the prisoner as being in the upper range of average intelligence and he found no significant abnormalities in mental state examination. The prisoner was suffering no delusions or hallucinations and cognition was good. The history obtained by Dr Milton, later in point of time as it was than that obtained by Mr Taylor on 8 July, included a history of homosexual intercourse by his father.  
     
      
       
      
    75   The history of the O’Hearn killing taken by Dr Milton was similar to that taken by Mr Taylor on his latter assessment. The prisoner denied to Dr Milton that he had selected Mr O’Hearn at random. He described Mr O’Hearn’s request to have sex and said that he had only had sex with his father before Mr O’Hearn got down on his hands and knees asking to massage him and to touch his penis. It was then, according to the prisoner, that he hit the victim with the decanter. He maintained to Dr Milton that he had no intention of killing Mr O’Hearn when he went there but he exploded into a rage.  
     
      
       
      
    76   Turning to Mr Arkell, the prisoner said that on the day of the killing there was “some sexual stuff and he wanted me to do it to him. I exploded again”. He told Dr Milton that he killed Mr Arkell “because of the rage, I didn’t plan to kill him that day.” Dr Milton, having considered the prisoner’s responses and presentation at the ERISPs, considered that the prisoner displayed in the ERISPs awareness of events and self control in the killing of both victims, and that his conduct showed an awareness that what he was doing was wrong. Based upon the prisoner’s account to the police in the ERISPs, and in the walkarounds and on his manner during such, Dr Milton considered it unlikely that the prisoner was in a state of uncontrolled rage, psychosis or dissociation at the time of either killing and that a further feature of the prisoner’s behaviour when describing what he had done to the police was that he showed no feelings for the suffering of his victims.  
     
      
       
      
    77   Dr Milton did not agree with the assessment of Dr Jolly or the assessment of Mr Taylor. Dr Milton rejected Mr Taylor’s opinion that the prisoner was suffering from a borderline personality disorder and, indeed, he considered that none of the criteria of DSM-IV in relation to that disorder was satisfied.  
     
      
       
      
    78   Dr Milton was of the opinion that what motivated these killings was “a general feeling of anger, perhaps arising from loneliness, shyness, teasing at school, and unhappiness in a family situation.”  
     
      
       
      
    79   However as to both killings, Dr Milton did not consider that there was any substantial impairment by abnormality of mind, that the prisoner was capable of understanding what he was doing, and of knowing what he was doing was wrong and that he was capable of controlling himself. 
     
      
       
      
    80   Both Dr Jolly and Mr Taylor acknowledged that the validity of the opinions expressed by them depended upon an acceptance of the histories upon which their opinions were based. The findings which I have recorded impact upon the significance of their evidence. I have not found that the prisoner was sexually abused by his father and I have not found that either victim was attacked in the circumstances claimed by the prisoner in his evidence. I have rejected the prisoner’s account that the deceased O’Hearn placed himself on his hands and knees, with his trousers down, inviting anal intercourse. I have rejected the prisoner’s account that the attack upon Mr Arkell was at a time when there was a loss of self control because Mr Arkell invited the prisoner to penetrate him. 
     
      
       
      
    81   The opinions expressed by Dr Milton are not based upon the acceptance of histories ultimately not proved to be the fact. Moreover, as I have already observed, Dr Milton had the opportunity of seeing the videos. In my opinion, the evidence of Dr Milton is to be preferred to that of Dr Jolly and to that of Mr Taylor. 
     
      
       
      
    82   With this conclusion in mind, I return to the issues of provocation and substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. 
     
      
       
      
    83   I find that the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt, in relation to the killings of both Mr O’Hearn and Mr Arkell, that the deceased did not engage in conduct or utter words directed to or affecting the prisoner before the acts causing the death of the deceased, which conduct and/or words were provocative. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner did not lose his self control before or during the attack on either of his victims. 
     
      
       
      
    84   In re-visiting the issue of impairment by abnormality of mind to determine whether there was some impairment by abnormality of mind such as might mitigate the seriousness of these crimes or either of them, I have decided that there was not. Accepting for present purposes, as Dr Milton opined, that these killings were motivated by anger from the sources identified by Dr Milton and to which I referred earlier (para 78), such did not constitute any abnormality of mind. I do not consider that there was any abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition such as impacted upon the prisoner’s ability to control himself at the time when he attacked either victim or that there was any loss of control in either case. I would add that I do not find that the prisoner’s capacity to understand events or to judge whether what he was doing was right or wrong was impaired in any way at the time of committing either crime. 
     
      
       
      
    85   I bear in mind that the prisoner surrendered himself to the police. Before doing so he had acknowledged to his girlfriend “that he had done some really bad things” (T327), and before going to the police he confessed to his tae-kwon-do instructor that he had killed both Mr O’Hearn and Mr Arkell. In the course of the ERISP concerning the killing of Mr O’Hearn the prisoner said that he had spoken to Mr Day because he had “a real guilty conscience” (Q585) and in the course of the ERISP concerning the killing of Mr Arkell, the prisoner said that he came forward because it was “the right thing to do and I had to get the shit off my chest” (Q616). The prisoner did tell Dr Milton that he thought he was a suspect for the killings before he surrendered (T730); the prisoner had left at the scene of the Arkell killing his tracksuit pants and boots; and he had subsequently seen these displayed in photos in the newspaper, presumably in conjunction with news items about the Arkell killing. Further, the police had interviewed the prisoner concerning these killings prior to his surrender. However, whether the prisoner was close to arrest, or whether indeed he was under suspicion as at 30 September 1998 I am unable to determine. I consider it is a circumstance to be weighed in the prisoner’s favour that he did surrender himself and that he did cooperate with the police in the ERISPs and on the walkarounds. 
     
      
       
      
    86   Whatever his motive may have been in surrendering himself however, I do not find the prisoner to be contrite for these crimes. Whilst the prisoner acknowledged responsibility for the killings when he surrendered and subsequently, and whilst he did say in the course of his evidence that since he has been in gaol he had had a few nightmares about what he had done (T552), the prisoner neither displayed in his demeanour nor did he express in his testimony during the trial any remorse for these killings. He gave no evidence subsequent to the trial in the course of the hearing on sentence.  
     
      
       
      
    87   Whilst I do not have the benefit of any medical evidence directed to this issue, common sense dictates, having regard to the manner and the circumstances in which the prisoner re-offended in the space of fourteen days, that the risk that the prisoner would offend again is a very real one.  
     
      
       
      
    88   The prisoner was seen by other occupants in the townhouse where he was living in June 1998 to have and to read a book, “The A to Z of Serial Killers” which, as its title suggests, considers the misdeeds of a number of serial killers. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, having assessed the evidence of Adam Brauer and Annette Schreiber, that the prisoner had this book and that he was seen to read from it before these killings. The book contained many entries in the prisoner’s handwriting. Dr Jolly did not consider what the prisoner wrote in the book afforded any insight into the prisoner’s state of mind at the time of the killings (T706) and Mr Taylor considered it was hard to place any particular meaning on what was written there. Mr Taylor thought what was written might have been written as fantasy or to get rid of very angry feelings (T695).  
     
      
       
      
    89   However Dr Milton took a different view of this book and what the prisoner wrote in it. Dr Milton considered that the writings in the book were relevant to indicate the state of mind of the prisoner at the time of the killings (T748). Of particular relevance in the present context though, is the significance Dr Milton considered was to be attached to a number of entries. Inside the flyleaf the prisoner had written at some time after the killings: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
               “My List 
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Who will be my No. 3. 
         
        
        
         
         The possibilities are endless including  
         [there then follows a large number of names, in excess of 40, and then some categories] 
         
        
        
         
         Some Satanic faggot 
         
        
        
         
         Some horny faggot 
         
        
        
         
         Some sexy prostitute male or female.” 
         
        
        
       The list ends  
       “Not anyone in particular” 
       . 
        
       
      
    90   Dr Milton considered that the above writing and the long list indicated that at the time when the prisoner wrote, the prospect of killing was pleasing to him. 
     
      
       
      
    91   On the next sheet in the book the prisoner wrote: “I’ll kill anyone who gets in my way even…” In Dr Milton’s view this indicated a homicidal intention towards those who might block the prisoner in what he wanted to do.  
     
      
       
      
    92   On a later sheet in the book the prisoner wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Who will be my No. 3. David O’Hearn, Frank Arkell the first, who else? One is the best, you always remember your first, who’s next.” 
         
        
       
      
    93   This writing, in Dr Milton’s view, indicates that reflection on killing, as well as killing itself, were pleasurable to the prisoner. 
     
      
       
      
    94   Although the prisoner, when asked about the book in his evidence, dismissed what he had written as “just angry writing”, and notwithstanding what Dr Jolly and Mr Taylor opined about this exhibit, I accept the opinions expressed by Dr Milton about it. 
     
      
       
      
    95   Those opinions, of course, bear upon the risk of the prisoner further offending, at least as at the time when the prisoner wrote what he wrote. However, in considering the long term risk of the prisoner re-offending, I have no medical evidence to guide me and it is not appropriate for me to speculate on the extent of such risk. I recognise that any attempt to predict long term future dangerousness is notoriously inaccurate: see Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 625. 
     
      
       
      
    96   In any event I remind myself that a sentence should not be increased beyond what is proportionate to the crime or crimes to be punished, simply to extend the period of protection that society might thereby enjoy against the risk of a further offence or offences being committed: see Veen v The Queen (No. 1) (1979) 143 CLR 458 at 467, 482-483 and 495; and Veen v The Queen (No. 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472 and 476-477. 
     
      
       
      
    97   I complete my review now of the prisoner’s background. Returning to his childhood, his mother played no part in his upbringing from the time he was three years of age or even younger, and his father ill-treated him most seriously. The prisoner demonstrated an interest in Satanism from school days and the evidence satisfies me that his friend, Keith Schrieber, influenced him in this regard. The prisoner did not do well at school but after leaving there was a period of some twelve months when he had regular employment in the kitchen at Planet Hollywood. The prisoner also pursued an interest in tae-kwon-do and attended regularly at his classes for this. Mr Nicholson has submitted that the prisoner’s work record and his healthy interest in tae-kwon-do are favourable pointers to the prisoner’s eventual rehabilitation prospects, but the evidence does not permit me to make a favourable finding on this issue. The risk of re-offending I have already addressed. 
     
      
       
      
    98   This prisoner has no previous convictions. He was only nineteen years of age when he committed these crimes, and that he was so young then impacts generally upon my task, not only in determining the extent of the long term risk that he may re-offend but also upon the possibility of the prisoner’s rehabilitation, in the event that he was eventually to be readmitted to society. 
     
      
       
      
    99   The maximum penalty provided for in the Crimes Act for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life: s 19A(1) of the Crimes Act. Such a sentence, if imposed, means precisely that: s 19A(2). The Court, of course, may impose a lesser sentence where appropriate and, indeed, since the introduction of life imprisonment meaning life imprisonment in 1990, there have been only sixteen prisoners who have been given life sentences, and plainly such penalty is to be reserved for the worst category of cases. As Badgery-Parker J said in R v Twala (unreported, NSWCCA, 4 November 1994), and with his judgment the other members of the court agreed: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “…in order to characterise any case as being in the worst case category, it must be possible to point to particular features which are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed).” 
         
        
       
      
    100   See also R v Street (unreported, NSWCCA, 17 December 1996) and in particular the judgment of McInerney J at 18 where the dicta of Badgery-Parker J in Twala was cited with apparent approval; and R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66 at para 344. 
     
      
       
      
    101   The Crown has submitted that each of these crimes ought to be regarded as falling within the worst category of case, and the Crown has submitted that this Court should impose sentences of life imprisonment. 
     
      
       
      
    102   There are, in my opinion, features of each of these crimes of very great heinousness, as are manifest from what I have already said. Without exhaustively repeating the findings I have already expressed, David O’Hearn was subjected to a most savage attack, and I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner acted in such attack with intent to kill and that it was a random and utterly senseless killing. The way in which the prisoner mutilated the body of this victim showed his utter contempt for his victim and so too did his use of the severed hand and his writings on the wall and on the mirror. Indeed, this first crime scene exuded evil of the prisoner’s making. Francis Arkell was likewise subjected to a most brutal attack, and again I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner conducted the attack with intent to kill. The prisoner sought to explain, and indeed to justify, his attack upon an adverse judgment he had formed of his second victim. Once again he demonstrated his utter contempt for his victim after inflicting the savage injuries which inevitably would have led to death by inserting into the head of the body the three tie pins he found. He also endeavoured to force into the victim’s neck the timber peg earlier described. I find a complete absence of any facts such as might mitigate the seriousness of either crime. 
     
      
       
      
    103   I have, of course, to consider the question of totality for sentencing purposes. This requires an evaluation of the totality of the criminality in the offences and to determine whether that level of criminality was in the worst category: see R v Street (unreported, NSWCCA, 17 December 1996) and in particular the judgment of McInerney J at p 20; and R v Leonard (unreported, NSWCCA, 7 December 1998) and in particular the judgment of McInerney J at pp 7-8 where his Honour said, in a case involving two murders: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The principle of totality required, in combination with the principles regulating the application of a maximum penalty, that the judge evaluate the totality of the criminality involved in both offences that were before him for sentence and to determine whether that level of criminality was in the worst category so as to attract the maximum sentence.” 
         
        
        
       See also  
       R v Harris  
        NSWCCA 469 at para 94. 
        
       
      
    104   If my task was to assess only the criminality of either one of these crimes, I would categorise it as being in the worst category of case; however these two murders were committed two weeks apart and the evaluation of the totality of the criminality involved even more compellingly places the level of criminality of the prisoner as being in the worst category. 
     
      
       
      
    105   Before reaching the conclusions I have expressed as to the level of heinousness, I have considered each of the earlier cases in which a sentence of life imprisonment has been imposed since s 19A of the Crimes Act took its present form. I do not consider that it would be useful to record my review of those cases in these remarks on sentence. In Veen (No. 2) (supra), Mason CJ and Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said in their joint judgment at 478: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “…the maximum penalty prescribed for an offence is intended for cases falling within the worst category of cases for which that penalty is prescribed: Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447. That does not mean that a lesser penalty must be imposed if it is possible to envisage a worse case; ingenuity can always conjure up a case of greater heinousness. A sentence which imposes the maximum penalty offends this principle only if the case is recognisably outside the category.” 
         
        
       
      
    106   Recognition of what was said by their Honours in Veen (No. 2) does not render consideration of the sixteen cases to which I have referred a meaningless exercise, and, indeed, having considered those cases, I am fortified in the conclusion reached that I am dealing here with criminality in the worst category of case. 
     
      
       
      
    107   I should add that before so concluding I have considered many cases in which a prisoner to be sentenced for multiple killings was given determinate sentences. I instance recent sentences imposed by Grove J in De Gruchy (unreported, 17 December 1998); and by Sperling J in Park (unreported, 3 August 2000). Once again, I do not consider it would be useful to record here any review of such decisions since it is my responsibility to determine what sentences I ought to impose in the particular circumstances with which I am concerned. Bell J also set a determinate sentence in Harris (2000) 111 A Crim R 415 but that has now been reversed by the Court of Criminal Appeal (supra). I shall return to the significance of this decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Harris presently.  
     
      
       
      
    108   Section 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which came into effect on 3 April 2000 provides relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         (1) 
          A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence…  
         
        
        
         
         (3) 
          Nothing in subsection (1) affects section 21 (1)…” 
         
        
       
      
    109   Section 21(1) provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         (1) 
          If by any provision of an Act an offender is made liable to imprisonment for life, a court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term.” 
         
        
       
      
    110   Section 61 had its counterpart in s 431B of the Crimes Act (now repealed) and s 21(1) is the successor to s 442 of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
       
      
    111   In Kalajzich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 Hunt CJ at CL observed in relation to the former s 431B(1): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “It [s 431B(1)] adds nothing at all to the common law relating to the imposition of maximum penalties, except the danger that it may eventually be interpreted as replacing the common law by an ill defined code which will eventually become narrower than the common law.” 
         
        
       
      
    112   In Harris (supra) Wood CJ at CL made a like assessment of s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, saying (at para 88): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Similarly to the view offered by Hunt CJ at CL in Kalajzich…in relation to the former s 431B(1) of the Crimes Act, I doubt that its successor (s 61(1) of the Procedure Act) adds anything to the common law.” 
         
        
       
      
    113   The submission advanced in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Harris that s 61(1) of the Procedure Act introduced a narrower code than the common law was rejected. Wood CJ at CL said at paras 89-90: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “89. So far as the submission advanced by Mr. Berman SC assumes that S 61(1) of the Procedure Act is narrower than the common law, then I am not persuaded that there is authority, or good reason, for such an assumption. 
         
        
        
         
         90. That is not, however, to say that the common law has been abrogated, or that those decisions which gave content to the meaning of the expression ‘worst case’ are no longer of relevance. It may be that future development of the common law will embrace a situation calling for a life sentence that would not be justified under S 61(1) of the Procedure Act, which in any event although expressed in mandatory terms, on one view arguably remains subject to a discretion to impose a lesser sentence than life by reason of S 61(3).” 
         
        
       
      
    114   Returning to the present case, Mr Nicholson submitted that even if I found, as I have found, that these crimes are in the worst category of case, I ought to have regard to the subjective features of the case which I have earlier reviewed. Certainly such features were considered in other cases categorised as being in the worst case category: see Garforth (unreported, NSWCCA, 23 May 1994); Trotter (unreported, Hunt CJ at CL, 10 August 1993); Street (supra); and Leonard (supra). Save for Leonard the sentences in those cases were passed before s 431B was introduced into the Crimes Act, commencing 30 June 1996. Leonard was sentenced on 10 November 1997 and the judgment on appeal was delivered on 7 December 1998. The sentencing judge plainly considered subjective circumstances in that case and that he did so attracted no criticism in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  
     
      
       
      
    115   I am satisfied following yesterday’s decision in Harris that I may have regard to the subjective features in this case and I have done so. Indeed, I have given lengthy consideration to the subjective circumstances in this case. In the course of that consideration, I have taken into account not only the evidence which I have reviewed and the submissions advanced by Mr Nicholson but also the handwritten submission of the prisoner himself, dated 16 November 2000, which Mr Nicholson forwarded to me with the concurrence of the Crown and which I have caused to be marked for identification purposes as mfi: 31 and to be placed with the Court file. I have found of particular concern in deciding what sentence to impose the fact that this prisoner is still only twenty-one years of age. As Mr Nicholson pointed out, if sentenced to imprisonment for life he will have the unhappy distinction of being the youngest prisoner to have been so sentenced. Steel (unreported, Hunt CJ at CL, 12 May 1994) was twenty-two years old when he was taken into custody and twenty-three years old when sentenced to penal servitude for life, and Leonard (supra) was twenty-four years of age when the sentence of life imprisonment was imposed upon him. 
     
      
       
      
    116   In Garforth (supra) the court, having remarked upon “the terrible significance of a sentence of life imprisonment”, proceeded to cite with approval this passage from the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Petroff (unreported, 12 November 1991): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The indeterminate nature of a life sentence has long been the subject of criticism by penologists and others concerned with the prison system and the punishment of offenders generally. Such a sentence deprives a prisoner of any fixed goal to aim for, it robs him of any incentive and it is personally destructive of his morale. The life sentence imposes intolerable burdens upon most prisoners because of their incarceration for an indeterminate period, and the result of that imposition has been an increased difficulty in their management by the prison authorities.” 
         
        
       
      
    117   In Garforth the court acknowledged “the force of these sentiments”. So, of course, do I, and the recognition of the significance of imposing a life sentence on a man as young as this prisoner renders my present task extraordinarily burdensome. 
     
      
       
      
    118   However, the legislature has nevertheless seen fit to pass the legislation which I have to consider and to which I must give effect. 
     
      
       
      
    119   In Garforth the Court of Criminal Appeal rejected the submission that it was only in a case where there was no chance of rehabilitation that the maximum penalty of imprisonment for life should be imposed. The court went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “There are some cases where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met through the imposition of the maximum penalty. As we have indicated, we believe that this is such a case.” 
         
        
       
      
    120   In Fernando (1997) 95 A Crim R 533 Abadee J cited the above passage from Garforth and went on to say (at p 544-545): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “There are some cases where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met through the imposition of the maximum penalty: see  
         Garforth 
         . Next, rehabilitation and the prospect of offering a person some hope from incarceration, whilst being important considerations and are to be taken into account in favour of persons in the position of each of the prisoners, nevertheless, the requirement of retributive judgments involving the objective features of an instant case may amply warrant not only a case being regarded as in the worst category of case but as warranting the imposition of the maximum penalty: see  
         Baker 
          and  
         Garforth 
         . Indeed, as the decision of Hunt CJ at CL in  
         Milat 
          illustrates there may be some cases falling within the category of the worst class of cases, where there is even little utility in considering the prospects of rehabilitation. Indeed, it may be that in such cases the subjective circumstances generally of a prisoner himself cannot play any real decisive part.” 
         
        
       
      
    121   Those statements of principle from Garforth and Fernando were cited with approval in the recent decision of Harris in the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    122   I find myself similarly placed in the present case to the courts in Garforth and Fernando. The level of heinousness involved in these two killings does not allow for the imposition of anything less than imprisonment for life. 
     
      
       
      
    123   As I understand the position, Mr Nicholson did not seek to argue that this Court has power to make an order permitting consideration to be given to the ultimate release of the prisoner upon parole in the event of a sentence of life imprisonment. This appears to have been the view of Bell J at first instance in Harris, and in Robinson [2000] NSWSC 972 Adams J determined it was not possible to set a non parole period in respect of a life sentence. The contrary was, however, argued by the Crown on appeal in Harris (supra) and it was for this reason that I delayed passing sentence on the prisoner now before the Court until the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal was delivered in Harris. The decision of the appellate court in Harris yesterday delivered settles the issue unequivocally. This Court does not have the power under the present legislation to fix a non parole period in respect of a sentence of life imprisonment for murder. 
     
      
       
      
    124   I consider it proper that I record that had I been empowered to provide for the possibility of the prisoner’s ultimate release upon parole, I would have done so. 
     
      
       
      
    125   In Harris Wood CJ at CL observed that in all other States of Australia there is either a power or a duty for the court to set a non parole period in respect of a life sentence. Moreover, the Commonwealth Crimes Act makes express provision for the fixing of non parole periods for persons serving federal life sentences. The legislation in the ACT permits the fixing of a non parole period. It is only in the Northern Territory and in New South Wales that the court is denied the power to set a non parole period when imposing a sentence of life imprisonment for murder. 
     
      
       
      
    126   In the course of his judgment (at para 123) Wood CJ at CL made the observation that there would be merit in either providing authority for a judge sentencing a prisoner to life imprisonment for murder to set a non parole period or in extending the life sentence redetermination procedure to such cases. His Honour later said (at para 134): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Whether New South Wales should retain the harsh and discriminatory regime that exists for those now sentenced to life is a matter suitable, in my view for review.” 
         
        
       
      
    127   His Honour’s observations in Harris had the concurrence of the other members of the court. 
     
      
       
      
    128   I unhesitatingly agree with what his Honour said in the above respects. However, I must now sentence the prisoner in accordance with the present law. 
     
      
       
      
    129   The prisoner has been in custody since 30 September 1998 and the concurrent sentences I am about to impose are to commence on that date. 
     
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
      
    130   Mark Mala Valera for the murder of David John O’Hearn I sentence you to imprisonment for life, such sentence to commence on 30 September 1998. For the murder of Francis Neville Arkell, I also sentence you to imprisonment for life, with such sentence also to commence on 30 September 1998. I do not set a non parole period for either sentence for the reason only that I do not have the jurisdiction to do so.

     BEAZLEY JA SMART AJ IRELAND AJ Thursday, 21 December 2000 
     
      
     REGINA v Damon Harley PYE 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
     
     
      
    1    BEAZLEY JA: The appellant was indicted before the District Court on the charge that:  
     
      
       
        
        “On 5 May 1998 at Bolton Point in the State of New South Wales, when armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a .22 calibre hand gun, did rob Christine Lochrin of her wallet, 3 credit cards and money to the amount of $300.00, the property of Christine Lochrin.” 
        
       
      
    2    The Crown alleged that the appellant, and another person, Bernd Bryzenski entered the home of a Ms Christine Lochrin in the early hours of 5 May 1998, that the robbers were armed with a gun, a baseball bat and a knife with a distinctive blue handle, and one had entered the bedroom of Ms Lochrin, threatened her and robbed her of the items specified in the indictment.  
     
      
    3    The appellant was found guilty of the charge and sentenced to five years penal servitude with a minimum term of three years and an additional term of two years. 
     
      
    4    The appellant appeals against conviction. He also seeks leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    5    There were ten grounds raised on the conviction appeal and lengthy written submissions were filed in support of these grounds. However, during the course of oral argument before the Court, it was submitted that there was one, essential, overriding point in the appeal which required that there be a new trial, namely that there had been a shift in the Crown case at the end of the evidence. In particular, it was submitted that the Crown had conducted the entire case, including in its opening, on the basis that it was the appellant who had entered Ms Lochrin’s bedroom with the gun, threatened her and stole the items specified in the indictment. However, prior to the trial judge commencing his summing up, the Crown conceded that it could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was the gunman. It was submitted that the concession having been made, the trial judge then failed to give adequate directions particularly in relation to the change in the Crown case and had failed to separately identify the defence case. In particular, it was submitted that his Honour failed to sum up to the jury on the inferences which were consistent with the appellant’s innocence. As senior counsel for the appellant put it in his opening to this Court: 
     
      
       
        
        “We are talking about a circumstantial case where it has gone terribly wrong through lack of assistance by both sides to His Honour. It did go off the rails.”  
        
       
      
    6    At the time that the matter was before this Court, the Court did not have available to it the opening or closing addresses of Crown or defence counsel and a copy was not provided by the legal representatives of the appellant or by the Crown. In support of his contention that there had been a shift in the Crown case, senior counsel relied first upon the concession by the Crown, which was to be found in the transcript, which was available to the Court, that the Crown could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who had the gun. He relied secondly upon an affidavit from junior counsel who had appeared at trial in which junior counsel deposed that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown Case I understood from the start of the Trial was that Mr Pye was the occupant of the bedroom terrorising the female victim of the robbery, Christine Lochrin.. 
         
         
        4. I recall I took this point before His Honour the Trial Judge because I saw a shift in the Crown Case.” 
        
       
      
    7    The transcript discloses that junior counsel did raise the point as to his Honour’s reference to joint enterprise when he understood that the Crown case was that it was the appellant who was in the bedroom. His Honour reminded counsel that he had sought clarification prior to the summing up as to what the Crown case was and that the Crown had indicated that it relied on joint enterprise. Junior counsel for the appellant had not taken any issue about that prior to the summing up. The transcript also reveals that the Crown pointed out that the case had never been opened on the basis that it was the accused who had the firearm.  
     
      
    8    The effect of the oral submission made by senior counsel for the appellant was that the trial judge’s directions, given the shift in the Crown case, were so fundamentally flawed that the trial was unfair to his client. This submission was a serious one. It was therefore of concern to the Court that no challenge had been made at trial, by the appellant’s then counsel, to such an apparently serious miscarriage. Accordingly, the Court called for the tapes of addresses and had them typed. The services of the official Court Reporting Services were not utilised because of the significant delay which was likely to occur had an official transcript been sought.  
     
      
    9    A copy of the Court’s typed transcript was forwarded to both the appellant’s solicitors and to the Crown.  
     
      
    10    A reading of counsels’ addresses at trial revealed without any doubt that the submission made by senior counsel for the appellant was entirely misplaced. For my part, I do not consider that such a serious assertion should have been put before the Court unless and until it was properly ascertained from the full transcript of the proceedings that there was a proper basis for doing so. I do not consider that obtaining an affidavit from junior counsel at trial was sufficient. That affidavit of itself is of concern, as it does not accurately reflect the complete circumstances as they occurred at trial with the result that the Court was left with a misunderstanding as to the course of the trial. Had the appellant’s legal representatives obtained the transcript of the addresses, the affidavit would have been unnecessary. The appeal would also have been presented very differently.  
     
      
    11    I would also stress that where an appeal revolves around the course of the trial, the Crown should, as a matter of course, ensure that the Court is provided with a full transcript of the hearing. 
     
      
    12    Having provided both the appellant’s legal representatives and the Crown with the full transcript, the Court was advised in a brief note from the appellant’s solicitors that senior counsel for the appellant did not wish to make further submissions on behalf of Mr Pye, although senior counsel wished to emphasise the issues of identification and circumstantial evidence. These were matters raised in the original written submissions. The Crown reasserted that there had been no shift in the Crown case. In oral submissions on appeal the Crown had virtually conceded there had been. It is thus necessary to deal with the written submissions of the appellant, as responded to by the Crown, against the background of what is now known to be the way in which the case was conducted by both parties at trial, rather than the way it was asserted the case was conducted. The lack of assistance from counsel in this regard is not to be commended.  
     
      
       
      Factual Background  
       
      
    13    Briefly, the evidence was as follows. 
     
      
    14    On 4 May 1998, Christine Lochrin was asleep at her home in Enterprise Way, Bolton Point when she was woken during the night and felt something held to her throat. A male person, whom she described as about 163 cm tall and wearing a black balaclava, a dark coloured top and greyish coloured jeans, told her to “get yer money”. She gave the man her purse which contained $358 and her credit cards. The man then produced a gun and said he knew she had “10 grand”. She saw that he was also holding a knife, which had a curved blade, and a creamy coloured baseball bat. She told him that she did not have $10,000. He began to ransack her room. Ms Lochrin then heard the voice of another young man say “[j]ust cut the cunt’s throat, but just hurry up”. After they left, Ms Lochrin realised that in addition to her purse, a bag of coins had been taken from her drawer. 
     
      
    15    Ms Lochrin’s daughter, Hayley Thompson, gave evidence that she was woken by a balaclava-clad young man, who was wearing a dark coloured jumper with writing on it and dark tracksuit pants. She described him as about 5 foot nine or ten. He was carrying a baseball bat which he swung at her. When he missed, he told her to stay in her room or she would be belted.  
     
      
    16    After that person left the room, she left her door slightly ajar, and she peered out to see what she could.  
     
      
    17    She heard someone yell: 
     
      
       
        
        “Just shoot the slut … cut her throat … I want ten grand.” 
        
       
      
    18    Later, she saw a different person to the one who had been in her room, running to the top of the stairs. In her evidence, she described the second person as wearing a dark jumper, dark pants and a balaclava. She agreed in cross examination that she had told police that he was wearing black or grey jeans. He was carrying her mother’s wallet, a silver gun and a knife. She said this person was a little shorter than the man who had entered her room. She said one of the men had been wearing a white pair of gloves, the other a blue pair.  
     
      
    19    Ms Lochrin’s son, John Thompson also saw two men in the house. He saw one standing at the top of the stairs wearing a balaclava and holding a baseball bat. He saw another man with a gun in his mother’s bedroom. He said both men were wearing dark clothing. The first man he saw had been wearing black tracksuit pants or jeans and was a little taller than the other man. He was able to call police on the 000 emergency number.  
     
      
    20    A guest in the house, Sean Neal saw a man wearing a dark coloured balaclava, bone coloured gloves and white joggers and was holding an aluminium baseball bat. He agreed in cross-examination that he had told police this person was wearing dark tracksuit pants and a dark jumper with white trim. By reference to his own height he described this person as about 5 foot 8 inches to 5 foot 9 inches tall. In cross-examination he agreed the person could have been as tall as 5 foot 11 inches. 
     
      
    21    This intruder told Neal to stay down. Neal remained where he was and the intruder stayed at the top of the stairs. Neal heard noises coming from Ms Lochrin’s bedroom, heard the demand for the $10,000, saw the man whom he had encountered knock on Ms Lochrin’s door, heard him tell the other man to hurry up and “[j]ust shoot the stupid … slut”. He heard the man inside the bedroom say he needed more time and the first man tell him to “[h]urry up, just slit her throat, let’s get out of here”. Neal was not cross-examined on this aspect of his evidence. Counsel for the appellant submitted that this was understandable, as at that point, the Crown case was that that person was not the appellant. Accordingly, the second person’s state of awareness of the gun was not in issue. 
     
      
    22    Police responded to the 000 call and stopped a Ford Fairlane shortly after it came out of Enterprise Way. The appellant was driving the car. Bernd Bryzenski was in the passenger seat. There were no other occupants. When stopped by police, the appellant was wearing black jeans, a black and white chequered short sleeve shirt, brown “Yakka” brand boots and white socks. Bryzenski was wearing dark blue tracksuit pants and a green shirt with an ARL motif on it. Later at the police station the appellant had donned a dark blue and khaki sloppy joe.  
     
      
    23    The appellant was searched and $300 was found in his front left hand jeans pocket. It was in the denominations of nine $20 notes, one $10 note, two $5 notes and two $50 notes. The appellant claimed that $220 of that money was his pay from his lawn mowing business. Ms Lochrin said that the $300 contained in her purse was in denominations of $200 in $10 notes and two $50 notes. A white rubber glove was located in his right pocket. When asked to explain the presence of the glove in his pocket, he said that when he heard the police sirens, he saw Bryzenski place his hand in the centre glove console. He said he panicked, reached into the console, pulled out a plastic bag and placed it in his pocket. He said he did not have the faintest idea where the glove in his pocket had come from, but assumed it must have been with the plastic bag he pulled out of the console.  
     
      
    24    The car was searched and the police found, in the back of the car, two self made black or dark coloured balaclavas, together with a plastic bag containing cut up track suit pants of the same material as the balaclavas. A metal pipe wrapped around one end with tape, a yellow woollen glove, a black and white woollen glove and a plastic bag containing coins and a black balaclava were found on the floor in the front of the car or under the front passenger seat. A lady’s purse containing $58.50 and a large knife with a blue handle were located underneath the driver’s seat. Ms Lochrin later identified the purse as hers. 
     
      
    25    Bryzenski was also searched. He was wearing Nike brand shoes, an Australian Rugby League green t-shirt and white socks with blue stripes. A .22 calibre revolver was located down the front of his underpants. Bryzenski said he had never seen it before. Bryzenski was a juvenile at the time of the commission of the crime. He pleaded guilty in relation to an offence relating to the robbery. Bryzenski was not called by the Crown or by the appellant, although the appellant said he had taken some steps to find him.  
     
      
       
      Crown Case at Trial 
       
      
    26    The Crown case as opened at trial was that the appellant and Bryzenski “were armed with a pistol baseball bats and a knife”. At that stage the Crown did not specify which of the two were so armed. The Crown also identified the elements of the charge which it had to prove namely “a robbery [and] a dangerous weapon”.  
     
      
    27    At the end of the evidence, the trial judge asked the Crown to specify what the Crown case was. The following exchange then occurred:  
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN: That the robbery took place. There’s no dispute about that and that shortly after that robbery it would seem 4 or 5 minutes after the car was seen speeding from Enterprise Way into Main Road and it was followed by a police car pulled over and all of the property alleged to have been stolen in the robbery was found in that vehicle including $300 alleged to have been stolen found in the pocket of Mr Pye. Weapons used in the robbery found in the vehicle, the disguises, the balaclavas were found in the vehicle so that. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Does the Crown allege that the accused was one of a particular person involved in this robbery or one of the two? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN: Well, one of two but would tend to suggest that he was the one who confronted or woke up Christine Lochrin. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What’s the evidence that would enable the jury to reach that conclusion should it be necessary to come to that. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN: Well, the Crown says it’s not necessary but just the descriptions vague as they are - the positioning of the wallet under the driver’s seat, the $300. There’s some suggestion in the evidence that Mr Bryzenski had a top on that might of had some sort of motif. He was a bit taller but - doesn’t matter which one carried the knife along those lines. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: So, you are relying on common purpose. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: All right, I think I understand. Thanks Mr Crown. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN: Of course his conduct when he’s arrested -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: All right.” 
        
       
      
    28    The essential evidence relied upon by the Crown to prove it was a joint enterprise was the conversation overheard by the Crown witnesses when the intruder outside the bedroom called out to the intruder inside words to the effect of “just shoot [her]”.  
     
      
    29    Later the Crown made the concession that it could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who had the gun.  
     
      
       
      The Appellant’s Case at Trial 
       
      
    30    At trial the appellant’s then counsel made an opening address to the jury in which he indicated he wished to narrow the issues before them. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “What this case is about is that there is no direct evidence … as to identification of this man being at the premises… we don’t dispute that a robbery took place at these premises on the night. What we do dispute is that this man was involved in it”.  
        
       
       
      Grounds 1 and 3 
       
      
    31    These grounds were expressed in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “ONE His Honour erred when giving directions to the jury concerning the subject matter of fact finding which directions had the effect of mis-stating the onus of proof … 
        
       
       
        
        THREE His Honour gave inadequate or confusing directions concerning the subject matter of circumstantial evidence.” 
        
       
      
    32    His Honour, after stating the onus in unremarkable terms, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… so that at the end of the day after you have heard all of the evidence and so forth and taking into account the directions of law that I give you, what you have to ask yourself is has the Crown proven to my satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that this accused was one of the robbers. If the answer to that question is no, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has proved that, then you must acquit the accused. On the other hand, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has proved that, then you must find him guilty.” 
        
       
      
    33    His Honour then went on to state: 
     
      
       
        
        “Could I come back now to this question of fact finding. Fact finding generally speaking is something that we all do at various levels probably each day, sometimes subconsciously. People tell you various things, sometimes at odds with each other and you sort out which one you think is the truth, and as I say, sometimes you do that subconsciously. 
        
       
       
        
        Well in this case it is very much the same process of course, except that because the issues in this case are so serious and the conflict so diverse, that obviously you give the evidence of this case much more attention than some day to day matter of little consequence.” 
        
       
      
    34    It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that having correctly instructed the jury as to the onus and standard of proof in the first paragraph quoted above, his Honour then proceeded to direct the jury in terms which presented fact finding as a choice between competing versions of fact. 
     
      
    35    This ground is not made out. Both directions quoted above are standard directions and his Honour repeatedly, throughout the summing up, correctly stated the onus. 
     
      
    36    The trial judge pointed out that to prove its case the Crown relied upon circumstantial evidence. He then gave a direction as to such evidence and identified circumstances upon which the Crown relied. Again he did so in unexceptional terms.  
     
      
    37    His Honour added: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown says that you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that all those circumstances had been made out and that the inevitable conclusion you would reach from those circumstances is that the accused was a party to this robbery in the sense that he was one of the robbers.” 
        
       
      
    38    His Honour then put the appellant’s reply: 
     
      
       
        
        “… ‘Well that’s not right, they just haven’t got that proof. There are other hypotheses consistent with the innocence of the accused?, and in fact he [his counsel] has put one to you, namely that there were other people in the car who left the car before the police arrived at the scene and that whilst this robbery was taking place, the accused was sitting in the car waiting.” 
        
       
       
      That was the essence of the appellant’s defence. 
       
      
    39    His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was one of the actual participants in this robbery, that he was one of the two robbers who have been described by Mrs Lochrin and her family, then he must be acquitted …” 
        
       
      
    40    The trial judge told the jury that they must acquit the appellant if they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the essential circumstances which he had identified. The trial judge also told the jury that even if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to these circumstances the appellant must also be acquitted unless they were: 
     
      
       
        
        “satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational conclusion from those circumstances is that he is guilty, is that he was one of these robbers.” 
        
       
      
    41    I do not agree that his Honour directed the jury that they had to choose between the evidence of the Crown and the appellant’s evidence. Directions of this type have been dealt with by this Court on numerous occasions. 
     
      
    42    In R v Dwyer [1999] NSWCCA 47 the Court was concerned with a direction that “for essential purposes in this case, it is a case of your having to make a choice between two accounts, diametrically opposed, from the complainant on the one hand, and the accused on the other”. Dunford J (Meagher JA and Grove J agreeing) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… if it had been left on the basis of a ‘mere choice’ between the evidence of the complainant and the evidence of the appellant, the summing-up would have been defective and a new trial justified: Liberato and Others v The Queen (1985) 159 CLR 507 at 515, 519 per Brennan J and Deane J. …  
        
       
       
        
        On the other hand, a reference to there being two diametrically opposed versions given by the complainant and the appellant, and even the reference to the jury having to ‘choose’ between the two versions, will not necessarily be fatal provided it is made clear to the jury that it is not ‘merely’ a ‘choice’ between the two versions, but that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at least in its essential ingredients the version given by the complainant is true: R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 528-9, R v PAH (unreported - CCA - 18 December 1998) at 8-10.” 
        
       
      
    43    See generally R v Short [2000] NSWCCA 462. 
     
      
    44    In my opinion, the directions in relation to circumstantial evidence were also adequate. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 2, 5 and 6. 
       
      
    45    These grounds were expressed as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “TWO His Honour gave directions concerning the elements of the offence which were confused and inadequate. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        FIVE His Honour erred in directing the jury concerning the subject matter of joint criminal enterprise. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        SIX His Honour’s directions to the jury concerning joint criminal enterprise were inadequate.” 
        
       
      
    46    Grounds 2 and 5 are predicated on the premise that there was a shift in the Crown case. I have already stated that that premise is false. Accordingly, it is not correct to say, as was asserted in the written submissions, that in his summing up his Honour introduced into the trial for the first time the notion of joint criminal enterprise. Thus, ground 5 fails and no further comment is necessary. 
     
      
    47    In relation to ground 2, it was more specifically argued that because of the shift in the Crown case, a number of errors had crept into the trial.  
     
      
    48    First, it was submitted that appellant’s counsel had only addressed on the basis that the Crown case was that it was the appellant who was the person with the gun who had entered Ms Lochrin’s bedroom. It is difficult to know how that submission could have been made without access to the transcript of addresses. The transcript reveals that the appellant’s counsel said at the very commencement of his address:  
     
      
       
        
        “…In this particular case [the Crown] is asking you to find this [appellant] in the house … despite the evidence and despite the facts. 
         
         
        It is part of the Crown case and an indispensable link in the Crown case is have they proved beyond reasonable doubt to the criminal standard that this accused was in the house … Have they proved it? No, they haven’t. They have to show that This man was in the house…” 
        
       
      
    49    The appellant’s counsel then went through the identification evidence of each of the witnesses in relation to both the person outside the bedroom and the person inside the bedroom. He concluded:  
     
      
       
        
        “The identification and the point that I am making is the identification given by each of the persons in the house does not match my client’s description  
        
       
      
    50    Secondly, it was submitted that there was a failure to give a direction in accordance with Browne v Dunn [1893] 6 R 67in relation to the limited cross-examination of the accused. 
     
      
    51    The appellant gave evidence at the trial to the effect of the case outlined by his counsel. He was cross-examined in fairly brief terms. It was submitted that he was cross-examined only on the basis that he had been the person in the bedroom with the gun. It was submitted that having regard to the Crown concession, that that case had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, his Honour was required to give a direction in accordance with Browne v Dunn and failed to do so.  
     
      
    52    In cross examination the appellant was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Mr Pye, I suggest that you’re making all this up about two other people getting into the car with you and Mr Bryzenski. You’re making that up aren’t you? 
        
       
       
        
        A No I’m not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You and Mr Bryzenski went around to 122 Enterprise Way and you and Mr Bryzenski did the robbery there? 
        
       
       
        
        A That’s false. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And you went into Christine Lochrin’s bedroom, didn’t you? 
        
       
       
        
        A No I didn’t.” 
        
       
      
    53    It was then put to the appellant that he had the same knife that was found in the car and the gun which Mr Bryzenski was found with. The appellant denied these allegations. The cross-examination makes it plain the Crown was alleging that there was a joint enterprise in which the appellant was a major participant. 
     
      
    54    The rule in Browne v Dunn is a rule of fairness. It was explained in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (1983) 1 NSWLR 1 by Hunt J at 16:  
     
      
       
        
        “Unless notice has already clearly been given of the cross-examiner’s intention to rely upon such matters, it is necessary to put to an opponent’s witness in cross-examination the nature of the case upon which it is proposed to rely in contradiction of his evidence …” 
        
       
      
    55    In this case, it was always the Crown case that the appellant was one of two persons who went into the Lochrin house armed with a dangerous weapon. Initially, it was also the Crown case that it was probably, but not necessarily, the appellant who was carrying the gun. The Crown put directly to the appellant that he had gone to Ms Lochrin’s home and committed the robbery and the appellant denied it. The question that he was the person who had entered the bedroom was also met with a denial. Accordingly, there was no obligation to also put that he was the person outside the room. That would not have made particular sense to the jury, especially where the appellant raised as an issue in the trial the question whether there was any evidence sufficient to identify him as being in the house at all.  
     
      
    56    The point has not been made out. 
     
      
    57    Next, it was submitted the offence particularised in the indictment was of armed robbery, not armed robbery in company. It was submitted that his Honour first gave a direction as to the elements of the offence of armed robbery in terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now there are only two essential elements to that offence. One is that the accused robbed Christine Lochrin on 5 May 1998.  
         The second is that when he did so, he was armed with a dangerous weapon 
        . So they are the two elements.”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    58    His Honour then almost immediately introduced the concept of joint enterprise.  
     
      
    59    The case was opened as one of common purpose. Counsel for the Crown stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “These two intruders were armed with a pistol, baseball bats and a knife. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The indictment’s been read to you. His Honour read it to you again but what has to be proven, the elements are that there was a robbery on the 5th of May at Enterprise Way, Bolton Point, a dangerous weapon, a firearm was used.” 
        
       
      
    60    Counsel for the appellant addressed the jury at one point to the effect that it was incumbent upon the Crown to prove the accused had the gun.  
     
      
    61    In summing up the trial judge expressly corrected the statement made by counsel for the appellant as to the elements of the offence and also made it clear that the case was one of joint enterprise. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was one of these robbers, and you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were acting together, they were acting as a joint enterprise, they were in it together is probably the best way of putting it, in this armed robbery, then the Crown does not have to prove that it was actually the accused who had the gun, because the law says if you commit a crime together, then you are just as responsible for the actions of your co-offender.” 
        
       
       
      And: 
       
       
        
        “… if you are satisfied that one of them had the gun and the other one was in on it, they were acting jointly, then that element of the offence would be satisfied.” 
        
       
      
    62    His Honour, after observing that, while it was a matter for the jury, it seemed that there was no real dispute but that the robbery took place, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The real issue in this case you might think is whether the accused was one of the robbers.” 
        
       
      
    63    It was submitted that by combining the elements of the offence with which he was in fact charged (that is with armed robbery, not robbery in company) with the concept of joint criminal enterprise, his Honour erroneously left it open to the jury to convict if they were satisfied the appellant was one of the two robbers, one of whom had a gun.  
     
      
    64    That submission was based on the false assertion introduced in this matter by senior counsel on the appeal. The case was run as one based on a joint enterprise and his Honours gave directions in relation to that. It follows that this point also fails.  
     
      
    65    These directions were adequate and I do not consider that the jury could have been either confused or misled given the summing up as a whole.  
     
      
    66    Senior counsel for the appellant next submitted that his Honour failed to make it clear to the jury that, even if it was not the case that the appellant had the gun, he had to know that the co-offender with whom he had acted jointly was armed and might use the gun in the course of the robbery. 
     
      
    67    His Honour’s direction in this regard was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… what the Crown relies upon in this case is that if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was one of these robbers, the Crown says it is not necessary for you to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was the one with the gun because the Crown says he was acting in concert with the other robber, they were in it together …  
        they each knew what the other one was doing 
        , it was obviously part of a joint activity on their part. And that can be gleaned the Crown says from the testimony of Miss Lochrin, her daughter, her son and her daughter’s ex-boyfriend who described to you  
        what was said 
         and what happened, and the Crown says ‘Look you would have no trouble believing that whoever these two robbers were, they were acting together’. 
        
       
       
        
        Now if that is the case, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was one of these robbers, and you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were acting together, they were acting as a joint enterprise, they were in it together is probably the best way of putting it, in this armed robbery, then the Crown case does not have to prove that it was actually the accused who had the gun…”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    68    His Honour further explained the concept of joint criminal enterprise by stating that it meant “they were in it together”. 
     
      
    69    This direction was given in the context that the essential evidence, relied upon by the Crown to prove it was a joint enterprise, was the conversation overheard by the Crown witnesses when the intruder outside the bedroom called out to the intruder inside words to the effect of “just shoot [her]”. His Honour specifically referred to the Crown address and to their reliance on “what was said”. In my opinion, such direction was accurate and sufficient. The appellant’s own submissions recognise that provided the jury is directed that an accused was aware of the existence of the weapon and the possibility it might be used in the robbery, that person could rightly be convicted of armed robbery. 
     
      
    70    A criticism is also made that his Honour sometimes referred to “robbery” and sometimes to “armed robbery”. I do not think that his Honour did so in a way that was confusing in the context of the summing up as a whole. 
     
      
    71    It follows that ground 2 also fails. 
     
      
    72    The submission was made in relation to ground 6 that: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour did not leave for determination by the jury whether in fact there was a combination by way of joint criminal enterprise and if so what the object of the joint criminal enterprise was.” 
        
       
      
    73    Again this ground is not made out. The joint enterprise was not a complicated or sophisticated one. It was to act together to rob Ms Lochrin knowing that a dangerous weapon was involved. That was made plain to the jury. Accordingly, ground 6 also fails.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
       
        
        “FOUR: His Honour erred in failing to direct the jury concerning the nature of interferences and the manner in which they can be drawn.” 
        
       
      
    74    The complaint in relation to this ground is that the trial judge did not give any directions in relation to the drawing of inferences. This is correct. This was a circumstantial case and to find the appellant guilty, the jury was required to draw inferences from circumstantial evidence. 
     
      
    75    However, his Honour gave clear directions as to how the jury were to go about their task of assessing the circumstantial evidence. I do not consider that giving the standard directions in relation to the drawing of inferences would have provided any further assistance. It can be assumed that this was the case, because trial counsel did not seek any further direction on this issue. In the circumstances, no ground for leave to raise the ground has been made out and I would refuse leave to raise it. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7 
       
       
        
        “SEVEN His Honour erred in directing the jury on the issue of bad character.” 
        
       
      
    76    The appellant raised good character as part of his case. The Crown called no evidence of antecedent bad character. In the summing up his Honour referred to this and then dealt with the Crown’s challenge to the appellant’s good character. That challenge was based in the main, on the case the appellant had presented in his defence - namely, that is only connection with the events referred to in the indictment was to drive a person (Bryzenski) whom he knew to have been recently released from a juvenile detention institution, together with two other persons to “score drugs” in the early hours of the morning. The Crown also relied on the appellant’s behaviour when apprehended by the police. 
     
      
    77    His Honour then gave conventional directions in relation to the finding as to character depending upon whether they found the appellant to be of good character or bad character. 
     
      
    78    It was submitted however, that: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is a distinction between a finding of positive good character by the jury and a failure to make such a finding … by virtue of arguments advanced by the Crown. It does not follow by a failure to make a positive finding of good character that a finding of bad character must follow.” 
        
       
      
    79    I do not consider that this ground has been made out. As his Honour said, in his closing address to the jury the Crown questioned whether they would find the appellant of good character. They relied upon the appellant’s case as well as his conduct when arrested. In relation to the former, the Crown relied on the improbability of the appellant’s evidence. In relation to his conduct when arrested, the Crown said, in what can only be described as an ironic terms: “maybe there’s two sides of him”.  
     
      
    80    In circumstances where the jury was confronted with a perspective which the Crown suggested was not consistent with good character, it was important for the trial judge to direct the jury as to what to do with their assessment of character if they did not accept that the appellant was of good character. I do not see any error in referring to that as involving a finding of bad character. His Honour’s directions in relation to bad character were correct. 
     
      
    81    Accordingly, this ground fails.  
     
      
       
      Ground 8 
       
       
        
        “EIGHT The trial miscarried by an absence of a witness, Janelle Sutherland.” 
        
       
      
    82    It was part of the appellant’s case that of the $300 in his pocket, $220 had come from his lawn mowing business for services provided to a Mrs Janelle Sutherland. Mrs Sutherland had provided him with a receipt which was tendered in evidence.  
     
      
    83    Mrs Sutherland did not give evidence. A medical certificate was tendered to explain her absence. 
     
      
    84    The trial judge referred to the absence of Mrs Sutherland as well as to the absence of Mr Bryzenski. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was mention of course of a Miss Sutherland … Tendered in evidence and marked exhibit 3 I think is a medical report explaining her non-attendance. Also mentioned during the course of I think addresses was the absence of Mr Bryzenski who has been mentioned quite a lot in this trial from the list of witnesses. 
        
       
       
        
        You are not entitled to speculate about what Mrs Sutherland or what Mr Bryzenski might have said. The fact is that they are not here. If you are not satisfied that any reason has been advanced or satisfactory reason has been advanced as to why they are not here, then if it were the case that you would have expected one of the parties to call them or even both of the parties, you would be entitled in those circumstances to assume that whatever evidence they might have given would not assist that party.” 
        
       
      
    85    The Crown conceded that if the absence of Mrs Sutherland was an issue raised by the Crown, his Honour’s direction was unfortunate. It was submitted however, that no point was taken at trial as to the direction given.  
     
      
    86    However, the appellant does not challenge the directions given by his Honour. Rather, it was submitted that Mrs Sutherland was a very important witness for the appellant’s case and her evidence should have been before the court.  
     
      
    87    Mrs Sutherland was to have been called in the appellant’s case and his counsel tendered the affidavit explaining her absence. No application was made for an adjournment so that she could be made available to give evidence. There is no basis therefore for this ground of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Grounds 9 and 10 
       
       
        
        “NINE The summing up failed to separately identify the defence case, to identify all of the circumstances in evidence rather than simply those relied upon by the Crown and in particular failed to draw attention to the circumstances referred to identified in Ground Ten below. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        TEN The verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    88    In his opening address at trial, the appellant’s counsel outlined the evidence the appellant would give as to his movements late on 4 May 1998 and early on 5 May 1998. His case was that he was at a gathering in Market Way in a nearby suburb. Bryzenski and two other men he did not know got him to drive to the Woodrising Estate. When they arrived he was asked to park his car. He was told by Bryzenski that he would be gone for about 30 to 40 minutes. The other three men got out and left. When they eventually returned to the car the other men left when they found that the appellant was going in a direction which differed from that which they wished to take.  
     
      
    89    He told the jury that the only issue before them was the question of identification. It was asserted that there would be no identification of the appellant as one of the persons in the house.  
     
      
    90    There was a good reason for counsel at trial to seek to limit the issues at trial to one of identification. Counsel was aware that the Crown was able to establish that within about five minutes after the robbery the appellant’s car was seen driving away at speed from the area in which the house of Ms Lochrin was situated. When the car was stopped the property which had been taken from Ms Lochrin was found in the car along with a distinctive blue-handled curved knife. A gun was located in Bryzenski’s underpants. Only the appellant and Bryzenski were in the car and there was a body of evidence that two men armed with a gun, the distinctive knife and a baseball bat, or bats, had entered Ms Lochrin’s house and committed an armed robbery. They were wearing balaclavas and had disguised themselves. Balaclavas and clothing similar to that worn by the armed robbers were found in the car. In effect Bryzenski and the appellant were caught red-handed. 
     
      
    91    This was a short four day trial. It started on Wednesday 1 December 1999 and continued to Monday 6 December 1999. The second half of 3 December 1999 was taken up with the evidence of the accused. He gave evidence along the lines which had been foreshadowed as well as dealing with other matters. On Monday 6 December 1999 some brief evidence was called on behalf of the accused. This was followed by the Crown’s closing speech which was concise and less than half the length of the speech of the appellant’s counsel. He addressed at length. For the best part of a day prior to the summing up the jury had the evidence of the appellant and his witnesses and his counsel’s speech pressed upon them. 
     
      
    92    The appellant complained that the trial judge failed to marshal those circumstances inconsistent with the appellant being either offender and in particular with the appellant being the offender in the bedroom with the gun. Many of these matters had been adverted to in the closing speech of the appellant’s counsel immediately before the summing up. They would have been fixed in the minds of the jury. On the whole they were not telling points, but went to matters of detail of no great consequence. 
     
      
    93    The trial judge had focussed the attention of the jury on the critical question - was the appellant one of the two men who entered the home of Ms Lochrin and there committed an armed robbery of which she was the victim. 
     
      
    94    The jury received directions as to the circumstances upon which the Crown relied and which they were told, they had to find proved beyond reasonable doubt before they could convict. They were also told that the conclusion of guilt must be the only reasonable conclusion to draw. The trial judge referred to the substantive defence which the appellant had raised. 
     
      
    95    This was not a case in which any of the occupants of Ms Lochrin’s house claimed to be able to identify the robbers. All that they could be sure of was that two men wearing disguises and dark clothes entered the house, a gun was produced and Ms Lochrin was robbed. There was also the knife and the baseball bat or bats. The Crown case depended on the police sighting of the appellant’s car speeding from the area within about five minutes of the robbery and the car when stopped containing the appellant and Bryzenski, the whole of the property taken from Ms Lochrin, the distinctive knife, the gun and the clothes earlier mentioned. The Crown also relied on the clothes of the appellant and Bryzenski being wet (as it had been raining), the state of the appellant (agitated, nervous, aggressive, swearing and frightened) and the lies told by the appellant. This was not a conventional identification case.  
     
      
    96    At the conclusion of the Crown case, the appellant complained of a shift in the Crown case, albeit incorrectly. No other complaint was made. 
     
      
    97    In view of the appellant’s evidence and his counsel’s lengthy and detailed closing address immediately before the summing up, the trial judge focussing the attention of the jury on the key issue and reminding the jury that the appellant contended that Bryzenski and two other men committed the robbery, and the nature of the Crown case, I regard the summing up as adequate. Experienced counsel did not ask the trial judge to re-direct or further direct the jury. He no doubt appreciated that for the judge to again travel over ground which he had covered would not be useful and, indeed, counter-productive if the judge did so in a less sympathetic way. 
     
      
    98    It follows from what I have said that this ground has not been made out. Nor has ground 10. The evidence was more than sufficient for the jury to convict.  
     
      
       
      General Considerations 
       
      
    99    Finally it should be stated that except in relation to ground 5 no point was taken at trial in relation to any of the grounds of appeal. Leave is therefore required for these grounds to now be raised. This was a strong circumstantial case. A tactical decision was made by the appellant’s counsel at the commencement of the trial to limit the issue to identification - not of the appellant in the bedroom but as to whether the appellant was one of the persons in the house. No complaint was made as to the competence of counsel who conducted the trial. Indeed, as has already been explained, it is obvious why the appellant’s case was run on this tactical front.  
     
      
    100    In the circumstances, I would not grant leave to appeal on the grounds where leave is required, and the appellant has not made out ground 5.  
     
      
       
       
      Leave to Appeal on Sentence 
       
      
    101    In his remarks on sentence, the trial judge said that the offence was a particularly serious one and that the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        “armed with a … pistol and a knife and the other person had a baseball bat … entered Mrs Lochrin’s bedroom, placed his hands on her throat and demanded money. He threatened her with a pistol.”  
        
       
      
    102    Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that although it could not be argued that the sentence was outside a proper sentencing discretion, his Honour sentenced the appellant on a basis which did not go before the jury. It was submitted therefore that his Honour should have sentenced on the basis that the appellant had played the lesser of the two roles.  
     
      
    103    There is no doubt that his Honour did sentence on a basis which did not go before the jury. However, once it is conceded by the appellant that the sentence was within a proper discretionary range, this Court should not interfere.  
     
      
    104    The sentence is clearly within a proper discretionary range, even if sentencing had proceeded on the basis that the appellant was one of two armed robbers. This is apparent from R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. In that case, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal set down a range of guideline sentences to be applied in a certain typical category of offences under s 97 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The Court stated that the features of such a typical case included:  
     
      
       
        
        “(i) Young offender with no or little criminal history; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) Limited degree of planning; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; 
        
       
       
        
        (v) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) Small amount taken; 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.” 
        
       
      
    105    It was held that in such a category of cases sentences “should generally fall between four and five years for the full term”. 
     
      
    106    In this case, each of the factors referred to by the Court are present, except that there was no plea of guilty. The Court has consistently recognised the importance of a plea of guilty in determining the appropriate sentence. As the Chief Justice commented in Henry, the extent to which regard is had to a plea of guilty varies depending, amongst other things, on the strength of the Crown case. Here, the appellant not only did not plead guilty, he maintained his innocence in the face of a strong, albeit circumstantial Crown case.  
     
      
    107    In a case where it is apparent that sentence has been determined on an incorrect basis, the appellate Court may still determine that despite the error, the sentence imposed by the trial judge is appropriate. This is such a case. I would refuse leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    108    The Orders I propose are:  
     
      
       
      (i) Appeal dismissed. 
       
       
      (ii) Leave to appeal against sentence refused.  
       
      
    109    SMART AJ: I agree with Beazley JA. 
     
      
    110    IRELAND AJ: I agree with Beazley JA for the reasons given by her Honour.

      REGINA v CORNELIA ELIZABETH VAN TONGEREN 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
    1   HEYDON JA: I agree with Smart AJ.2   SMART AJ: Cornelia Elizabeth Van Tongeren appeals against her conviction on one count of by deception dishonestly obtaining money for herself, namely $10,000 on 15 July 1997 and on two counts of by deception dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage for herself namely $20,000 on 14 July 1997 and $6,000 on 4 August 1997 being counts 2, 6 and 7 of the indictment. In each instance she presented a document to the paying bank thereby representing that she was authorised to withdraw the particular funds from the account of her mother-in-law, Catherine Van Tongeren, the complainant. The sum of $10,000 cash was withdrawn from the complainant's account with the National Bank of Australia (National) Emu Plains by the appellant. At her instigation the sums of $20,000 and $6000 were transferred from the complainant's account at Advance Bank (Advance) Penrith into the account of the appellant and her husband, Hank Van Tongeren at the same branch of that bank. The complainant was an elderly lady who was in hospital. As the various events occurred against a tragic background and there were mitigating circumstances, the appellant was given a concurrent and lenient sentence on each count of 50 hours community service.3   The appellant was acquitted on counts 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9, being the counts of dishonestly obtaining an advantage or money by deception.4   The appellant contends that the convictions represent a miscarriage of justice as the jury should have had a reasonable doubt and that the verdicts of guilty on the three counts were inconsistent with the verdicts of not guilty on the other counts.5   Count 1 was based on a form of National headed ""Change of Specimen Signatures"" and dated 8 July 1997 which authorised the appellant to operate the complainant's account with National. The signature ""C. Van Tongeren"" was not that of the complainant although it purported to be so and was so represented to National. That signature was placed there by the appellant who said that she had the complainant's authority to sign her name.6   Count 5 was based on a form of Advance headed ""Authority To Operate"" and dated 14 July 1997 which authorised the appellant to operate the complainant's account. Again the signature ""C. Van Tongeren"" was not that of the complainant although it purported to be so and was so represented to Advance. It was placed there by the appellant who said that she had the complainant's authority to do so. In both instances the appellant contended that the complainant intended that she should operate the account of the complainant. The complainant left it to the appellant to pay the complainant's debts and accounts out of her money.7   Count 3 related to a withdrawal by the appellant from the complainant's account with National of $2200 cash on 9 October 1997 and count 4 to one of $290 cash on 6 February 1998. Count 8 related to a withdrawal by the appellant from the complainant's account with Advance of $1000 cash on 8 October 1997 and count 9 to one of $600 cash on 19 March 1998. 8   These four withdrawals took place after 4 September 1997 being the date of a General Power of Attorney from the complainant to the appellant and of the will of the complainant leaving the whole of her estate to the appellant. The amounts so withdrawn were relatively small and could have been for the purpose of assisting to maintain the complainant. The Crown accepted that it would be hard pressed to secure convictions in respect of the withdrawals after 4 September 1997. The judge in her summing-up quoted the Crown Prosecutor as submitting ""if you were to look at all the evidence, the Crown was confronted with the power of attorney from 4 September 1997 and from that point she may have had a legal (sic) belief that she could access the funds but before 4 September there was no such document"".9   The withdrawals of $10,000, $20,000 and $6000 were in quite a different category. They all took place well prior to 4 September 1997 and they were for the appellant's purposes. The transfers of $20,000 and $6000 from the complainant's account to that of the appellant and her husband made it even harder to accept that the moneys of the complainant were being used for her purposes. The complainant was a pensioner. It is one thing for her to arrange for the appellant to pay her debts out of her moneys while she was ill and recovering. It is quite another for the appellant to denude the complainant of her assets for different purposes. The appellant had no authority to do that. In her summing-up the judge noted that counts 1 and 5 were based on the authorities earlier mentioned and that the other counts were based on withdrawals in the amounts mentioned (in the indictment).10   Prior to June 1997 the complainant, lived in a “granny flat” at the rear of the home occupied by her son and the appellant. The husband of the complainant had died earlier in 1997 and the appellant’s husband was admitted to hospital with a serious illness. The complainant, who was born on 3 March 1918, developed heart problems and on 24 June 1997 she underwent by-pass surgery. She expected to be away from home for about a fortnight. Complications arose after the surgery and she had to stay in hospital and have further surgery. Her stay in hospital became a long one and that depressed her. Because of her prolonged stay she had to make arrangements for her financial affairs to receive attention.11   The appellant said that she visited the complainant in hospital every day and sometimes twice a day. She also visited her husband in hospital. The appellant stated that when the complainant realised that she would be in hospital longer than expected she asked her to collect a parcel from the National. The appellant said that she went to the bank and was told that she would need a letter. She returned to the complainant and advised her accordingly. She told the appellant to ""get some paper and write it out"". The appellant said that she went to the nurse’s desk in the hospital and was given some Westmead Hospital letterhead. The appellant wrote out at the bedside ""This is to say that I give my daughter-in-law permission to pick up my sealed package and operate my account as I am still in hospital. Her name is Cornelia Van Tongeren"". The complainant signed it. The appellant stated that she said ""You can't take that to the bank Nan it's got, it's very scrawly that writing"". The complainant allegedly replied ""Well do another one and you just sign it"" and added ""Can you now pick up my bank books and get my pension put in."" The appellant stated that she said ""Well I won’t be able to operate your account because it doesn't state this on it"". 12   She stated that she then wrote out another note and asked the complainant to sign it. She replied ""No you sign it because it's no good anyway. My signature is no good anyway"". The complainant had swollen hands and was quite ill. The appellant said that she wrote out the document at the hospital in the presence of the complainant but signed the complainant's name at home. This document was taken to the National. It is dated 6 July 1997 and reads: 
     
      
       
        
         
          ""This is to say that I give my daughter-in-law Cornelia Van Tongeren permission to pick up my sealed package as I am still in hospital. She has permission to operate my account."" 
         
        
       
      
    The National gave the appellant the complainant's parcel which contained two bank books and some other papers which bear the writing of the complainant. 
    13   The appellant stated that at each bank she was given a form to complete She filled out the National form at the hospital. The complainant said ""You just do it. I can't do it"". The appellant said that she copied the complainant's signature from her pension card and took the form to National. The appellant further stated that the complainant also told her to fill out the form from Advance. The appellant filled out the form at her home, signed the complainant's name and took the form to Advance.14   At the trial the appellant formally admitted that the signatures ""C. Van Tongeren"" which appear on the National form and the Advance form just mentioned in each case effectively caused the respective banks to allow her to operate the accounts in the name of the complainant.15   About 12 July 1997 or a little before, while still in hospital the complainant became nervous and anxious about some further impending surgery and asked the nurse looking after her to telephone the appellant and ask her to talk to the doctors about the seriousness of such surgery. The Intensive Care Unit Registrar has stated that on the day of the operation, Saturday 12 July 1997, the risks of and necessity for the operation were explained to the complainant. She was alert and orientated and able to understand that there was a significant risk of dying from the operation. She also understood that if she did not undergo the operation and her wound was not cleaned she would die of “certain sepsis from her wound infection"".16   The complainant declined to proceed with the operation until she had made a new will. As the nurse was unsuccessful in her attempts to obtain a solicitor, she spoke with a social worker. She was also unable to obtain a solicitor. The social worker attended on the complainant with a printed will form and filled it out in accordance with the complainant’s wishes. The complainant stated that one of her sons was brain damaged due to a brain tumour and that the other was an alcoholic. Accordingly, she wanted to leave her estate to the appellant. The will was signed and witnessed. Apparently an informal power of attorney was also signed at this time. The operation was performed. The complainant was transferred to the Geriatric Team. It is to be noted that the withdrawals of $20,000 and $10,000 took place on 14 and 15 July 1997 just a few days after the operation of 12 July 1997 and when it was anticipated that the complainant would be in hospital and a nursing home for some time. To procure the withdrawal and transfer of $20,000 on 14 July 1997 the appellant signed a Record of Transaction for Advance, that was the activating document. Similarly the appellant signed a withdrawal for National on 15 July 1997 for $10,000. That enabled the transaction to proceed. On the Crown case and according to the complainant, the appellant had no authority to sign documents withdrawing or transferring moneys for the appellant's own purposes.17   On 4 August 1997 the appellant in order to procure the withdrawal and transfer of $6000, signed a Record of Transaction for Advance. 18   The complainant had a fixed term deposit of about $9000 with National. The appellant said the complainant was very insistent that the term deposit be placed in the appellant's name. The National advised her that the existing authority was not sufficient and that changing over the deposit had to be done by a separate piece of paper. The appellant said that she obtained some Westmead Hospital letterhead. The appellant said that the complainant wrote and signed a document bearing date ""8/8/97"" in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           ""I Catherine Van Tongeren want my Term deposit to be cancelt (sic) and put in my Daugher (sic) in Law Cornelia Van Tongeren name"". 
          
         
        
       
      
    The appellant placed reliance on this asset being put in her name by the complainant. 
    19   About 8 August 1997 the complainant underwent further procedures in Westmead Hospital. She was subsequently transferred to Nepean Hospital about 12 August 1997. According to the appellant, while the complainant was there a social worker recommended to both of them that a power of attorney and a new will should be prepared and signed. The social worker gave the appellant the names of some solicitors. The appellant contacted Lamrocks, Solicitors. In due course a power of attorney and a will were prepared. The solicitor certified that he explained the effect of the power of attorney before it was executed. The solicitor witnessed the complainant execute the power of attorney and her will.20   The appellant said that while the complainant was in Nepean Hospital for rehabilitation the complainant said to her ""Go and get your new kitchen in. At least I can see where the money's gone"". The appellant said that she was spending money on the poker machines at the time the new kitchen was being installed.21   On 14 October 1997 the complainant was transferred from Nepean Hospital to a nursing home and from there to a second nursing home, Nyora Gardens Nursing Home at Smithfield. She was discharged from that establishment in April 1998. Prior to being discharged, the Director of Nursing told the complainant that the appellant was over $1700 in arrears for nursing home fees. 22   The complainant believed that the appellant was attending to everything including paying the fees of the nursing home. The complainant asked that her bank books be brought and the appellant brought them to her.23   In the course of examining the bank books the complainant discovered that most of her money had gone. The complainant asked the appellant what she did with the money to which the appellant replied ""I put it in the poker machines"".24   The appellant's case was that the complainant, having originally authorised the transactions, had decided to deny having done so because she had discovered that the appellant, as the latter had admitted, had wasted most of the money withdrawn on gambling in poker machines. The appellant attributed this to the unusual and extreme pressure at the time. I have already referred to some of the appellant's evidence as to the circumstances in which the various documents were signed.25   In cross-examination the appellant agreed that there were three conscious decisions on her part to deliberately deceive two banks. The appellant asserted that she was, in effect, asked to do so by the complainant. The appellant also agreed that the power of attorney did not give her carte blanche to spend all the complainant's money on the poker machines.26   The appellant, when asked why she had transferred $20,000 out of the complainant's account into her account said at T24 of 2/2/00: 
     
      
       
       ""A. My mother-in-law said 'Transfer as much money out as you can' because there was talk of nursing home and at the time there was an entry fee to nursing homes or the government was talking about bringing it in. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Why did you stop at twenty? 
        
       A. Because you could have a certain amount in the bank without it being touched."" 
        
       
      
    27   The cross-examiner then asked a series of questions challenging the appellant's explanations and suggesting that they were incredible. The appellant was unable to be precise about the day on which the complainant gave her the alleged instructions. On her evidence it would seem that it was sometime after the bypass operation on 24 June 1997and before the further operation on 12 July 2000.28   Later in cross-examination when it was put to the appellant that there was no discussion about her being authorised to do anything with the complainant's money the appellant insisted that there was such a discussion. She also gave this evidence (T35-36 of 2/2/00): 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. Furthermore, that by virtue of the deceptions, that you obtained a financial advantage at least in respect to your being able to withdraw money out of her account to your account on two occasions. 
          
          A. Right. 
         
        
        
         
          Q. Being twenty thousand dollars and six thousand dollars and that certainly occurred before there was any power of attorney. 
          
          A. Yes. 
          
         
        
        
         
         Q. You were also able as a result of those deceptions, to withdraw money, cash? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
          
         Q What I'm putting to you is this; that you undertook those deceptions and operated the accounts and withdrew money, on your evidence, because she told you to do it? 
          
          A. That's right. 
         
        
        
         
          
          Q. Not because you thought you were legally entitled --- 
         
        
        A. No."" 
        
        
       
      
    29   In re-examination the appellant said that in relation to each of the individual transactions on the complainant's accounts she believed that she had the complainant's authority to do so.30   Appeal Ground 2 reads: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""The verdicts of guilty in relation to counts 2, 6 and 7 are inconsistent with the verdicts of not guilty in relation to counts 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9"". 
        
       
      
    31   The appellant relied upon the surprise expressed upon the return of the guilty verdicts by counsel and the judge. The appellant complained that there had been no cross-examination as to counts 2 and 7 but some of the general cross-examination covered these counts. Further, the thrust of the cross-examination as to count 6 dealing with the withdrawal of $20,000 and the general cross-examination made it clear that there was a real contest as to the big withdrawals, namely that they were unauthorised and used for the appellant's own purposes. They were substantial round sums and appeared quite unrelated to the needs of the complainant.32   The appellant contended that the prosecution had been brought principally on counts 1 and 5 and that the prosecution really depended on whether counts 1 and 5 were proved. The forms of authority enabling the appellant to operate the bank accounts of the complainant received much attention but the judge made it clear to the jury that they had to consider the counts based on the authorities and also those based on the withdrawals from National and Advance. Each member of the jury had a copy of the indictment and could follow the differences between the counts as the judge pointed them out. 
     
      
       
      
    33 The transcript of the final speeches of counsel reveals that the key issue at the trial was whether the appellant had acted dishonestly (T.4 of 3/2/00). The Crown Prosecutor when speaking of ""dishonestly"" said ""the Crown sets out to show or prove to you that at the time of each access of the account and at the times of obtaining the advantage she did not have a belief that she had a legal right to access the account (emphasis added). (T.5.10f of 3/2/00). At T10.30 of 3/2/00 the Crown Prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
       ""The Crown perceives that the major issue relates to dishonestly obtaining. Now in other words what the Crown seeks to prove to you beyond reasonable doubt is that the accused did not believe that she had a legal right to access the accounts and withdraw funds from them  
       at those various times"" 
        (emphasis added). 
       
      
      
       
      
    34   The Crown Prosecutor drew attention to the different counts and the advantage or money allegedly received in respect of each count; as to counts 1 and 5 this was access to and operation of the accounts; as to counts 6 and 7 the actual transfer of money from the complainant's account to the appellant's account; and as to the other counts - cash withdrawals.35   At T.8.40-9.27 of 3/2/00 the Crown Prosecutor was critical of the evidence of the appellant that the complainant had authorised the withdrawal of $20,000.36   At T.10.40 of 3/2/00 the Crown Prosecutor referred to the appellant's assertion that she believed she had a right to draw on the account. He contrasted her evidence with the denial by the complainant of the assertion. He added: 
     
      
       
        
         
          ""Look at the timing of the alleged verbal giving of the authority, the timing about when it was and where Mrs Tongeren was at the time and also take into account the dates, the amounts of the withdrawal; 14 July 1997 $20,000 transferred out of Mrs Van Tongeren's account and into the account of the accused; 15 July $10,000 cash; and 4 August$6000 transferred out of the Advance Bank account into the accused's Advance Bank account. When you look at the evidence in … … respect of the matter you might consider and wonder (or ponder?) on the basis of the evidence who was the major beneficiary of those transactions. It might seem to be more the accused than Mrs Van Tongeren Senior."" 
         
        
       
      
      
    37   At the start of the trial (T,.4-5, 31/1/00) the judge gave the jury the conventional direction that they had to consider each charge separately. She reiterated that point in her summing-up and added that the jury would have to return a separate verdict in relation to each count.38   While I accept that the two authorities and the circumstances in which they were signed, including the authorisation of the appellant loomed large at the trial they were not the only issues. The three major withdrawals and especially the one for $20,000 were also plainly raised. Those withdrawals in large, round figurers were stark and spoke volumes in themselves. They were far in excess of any amounts which the complainant had authorised the appellant to obtain for her requirements whilst in hospital. They were obviously made for the appellant's own purposes. The appellant's claim that she was authorised to make them was decidedly thin.39   I agree with the Crown's submission that, in accordance with the judge's directions a correct approach by the jury would be to consider whether in the case of each charge they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did not believe that she had her mother-in-law's authority. It was clear that the complainant had authorised the appellant to pay certain amounts for her from her pension, for example, fixing her glasses; paying the nursing home.40   The verdicts of not guilty on counts 3, 4, 8 and 9 cannot be regarded as inconsistent with the verdicts on counts 2, 6 and 7. As earlier mentioned the incidents the subject of counts 3, 4, 8 and 9 occurred after the grant of the power of attorney on 4 September 1997 and in respect of which the Crown Prosecutor virtually conceded that he would have difficulty in securing convictions by saying that the appellant ""may have had a legal belief that she could access the funds once she had the power of attorney"".41   The verdicts of guilty on counts 2, 6 and 7 are also not inconsistent with those of not guilty on counts 1 and 5. The jury may not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did not believe that she had the complainant's authority to sign the complainant's name to the two authorities thus enabling the appellant to operate the complainant's accounts with National and Advance respectively. The jury may have gone even further and accepted that the complainant herself had authorised the appellant to sign the authorities in the complainant's name so that the appellant could operate the account for legitimate purposes on behalf of the complainant.42   As the Crown pointed out it is one thing to say that the terms of the complainant's authority, so far as the Bank was concerned, authorised all withdrawals. It is another thing to say that the terms of the complainant's authority, so far as the appellant was concerned, authorised all withdrawals.43   Appeal Ground 2 fails.44   Appeal Ground 1 reads: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""In all the circumstances of the trial, convictions in relation to counts 2, 6 and 7 represents a miscarriage of justice"". 
         
        
       
      
    45   The appellant took the Court through the complainant's evidence and the documents which existed and submitted that her evidence was inconsistent with the documents and that the documentary material supported the appellant's case. There are serious questions about the accuracy and reliability of some of the complainant's evidence. Counsel was correctly critical of it. The deficiencies and problems with it probably led to the appellant's acquittal on most of the counts. However, the position as to counts 2, 6 and 7 was different. There the objective evidence in the form of large withdrawals in round figures applied for the appellant's own purposes was cogent.46   The appellant's submissions fail to distinguish between her having authority to operate the accounts as far as the Banks were concerned and for proper purposes and her lack of authority to make large withdrawls for her own purposes in mid July and early August 1997. The appellant erroneously took a global approach to all counts, lumping them together although, of course, this suited her interests. The Crown had a strong case on counts 2, 6 and 7 and I would have been surprised if there had not been convictions on these counts.47   There has been no miscarriage of justice on the evidence or in the conduct of the proceedings. It was not suggested that the judge's directions were erroneous.48   Appeal Ground 1 fails.49   I propose that the appeal against the three convictions be dismissed.50   IRELAND AJ: I agree with Smart AJ ****************

     JD v Director of Public Prosecutions & 2 Ors 
      
       
    Reasons for judgment1     HIS HONOUR: On 2nd September 1999 I gave judgment on a preliminary issue raised in this matter, that is, whether the learned magistrate had the power to award costs to the plaintiff after committal proceedings were terminated in his favour. I held that the magistrate had that power and I later heard submissions on the merits of the case. It is necessary to examine the circumstances which led to the plaintiff being charged with the offences involving his daughter. 
     
      
       
      
    2     The plaintiff married in 1985 and there were two children of that union, to whom I shall refer only by the initials of their first names. “I” was born in 1988 and “J”, to whom the charges related, was born in 1992. The plaintiff and his wife separated in that same year and the children remained with their mother at her parents’ home in Queensland. (The children later acquired step-siblings as a result of the plaintiff’s remarriage.) 
     
      
       
      
    3     There ensued protracted and acrimonious family law proceedings. In correspondence between their solicitors in December 1992 and January 1993, the mother made somewhat bizarre allegations about a sexual relationship between the plaintiff and a baby-sitter whom he engaged on occasions when the children were with him on access visits. These allegations were said to be based upon observations made by “I”, and the mother said that she had “I” touch her body to demonstrate what she had seen. The plaintiff denied any sexual encounter with the baby-sitter, as did the baby-sitter herself, and he expressed his concern that it was the mother who was promoting these ideas in the child’s mind.  
     
      
       
      
    4     Notwithstanding this, the mother surrendered custody of the children to the plaintiff in August 1993 and that position was solemnised by an order of the Family Court, with access to the mother. She resumed access visits in September 1995, initially at the plaintiff’s home in Sydney but later at her own home in Brisbane. It was during periods when the children were with her that “J” first made the allegations giving rise to the charges against the plaintiff. 
     
      
       
      
    5     According to the mother, in 1996 “J” began to talk about her fear of a man with a black mask on his face. In 1997, she said that the man would come into her bedroom at night, although nothing would happen when he did so. On another occasion, in the presence of “I”, the mother pressed “J” to tell her more about these nightly visits and to describe the man. When she asked “J” who she thought the person was, “J” said that she did not know. 
     
      
       
      
    6     During the next visit, “J” said that the man was the plaintiff and the mother said that she had assumed as much. Asked by the mother whether she thought he was doing good things or bad things, “J” replied, “Bad things”. The mother then asked “J” where he was touching her the most and invited the child to demonstrate by touching her. “J” said that she was frightened and quickly touched the mother between her legs. 
     
      
       
      
    7     On yet another occasion the mother sought further information from “J”. “J” said that the plaintiff would come to her bedroom with a boy who looked like her step-brother, and that he would touch the boy in the same way that he did her. She added that he would touch her in her bed or at her desk and that he left “a yucky, sticky substance” on the desk. 
     
      
       
      
    8     The mother approached “I” and asked her whether she was being visited by anyone from the family in her bedroom at night. “I” said that she was not. In November 1997 the mother discussed the matter with both girls together. She told “I” that the plaintiff had been visiting “J” in her bedroom over a period of time and that often their step-brother was there too. She went on to recount “J”’s allegations that the plaintiff touched both of them indecently. She asked “J” herself to tell “I” what had been occurring. “I” asked “J” whether what the mother was saying was true and “J” said that it was.  
     
      
       
      
    9     In January 1998, “I” telephoned the 000 emergency line from the plaintiff’s home. She told a police officer that the plaintiff had been sexually abusing her, her sister and her step-brother over the past few weeks. In fact, the children had been with their mother on an access visit over that period. The police officer gained the impression that “I” was reading something, rather than speaking spontaneously.  
     
      
       
      
    10     A few days later, “I” disclosed “J”’s allegations to her class teacher at Northbridge and to the school principal. The principal contacted officers of the Department of Community Services, who referred the matter to the child protection team at Chatswood Police Station. 
     
      
       
      
    11     On that same day “I” was interviewed at the school by a detective, in the company of the principal and a district officer of the Department of Community Services. The child adhered to the allegations she had made in the 000 call. “J” was brought to the room where the interview had been conducted and “I” told her that the detective and the district officer were there to help them. “J” became distressed, saying that she did not want to say anything, that whatever had been happening was no longer occurring, and that the plaintiff had told her that God would kill her mother and her if she told anyone about it. After some discussion, including a period when the principal spoke to “J” outside the room, it was arranged that “J” would be interviewed later in the day at an office of the Department of Community Services. That interview proceeded, again in the company of the principal and the district officer, and “J” alleged that the plaintiff would come to her bedroom, remove the bedclothes and touch her all over her body. 
     
      
       
      
    12     Both girls were interviewed again at the school in February 1998 by the detective in the company of the principal. After being reminded that she had told her mother and “I” about a mask, “J” described the mask which she said the plaintiff wore when he came to her bedroom. She also spoke of the “yucky” substance on her desk, again after being reminded that she had told her mother and “I” about it. In the course of her interview, “I” disclosed that the mother had given her “a run-through” of what she told the police in the 000 call. Asked how often this had occurred, she said, “Between maybe one and twenty times.” 
     
      
       
      
    13     It seems that neither the detective nor the district officer was trained in the joint investigation team procedures, that is, the techniques employed in the joint investigation by police officers and officers of the Department of Community Services of complaints by children. 
     
      
       
      
    14     The school principal took the two children into her home for a period. Care proceedings were instituted in the Children’s Court. The plaintiff was arrested and charged on 8 February 1998. His solicitor attended the police station. He declined to be interviewed but denied any wrongdoing. 
     
      
       
      
    15     The plaintiff’s advisers sought a report from the eminent child psychiatrist, Dr Brent Waters, supplying him with a large body of material, including the police brief of evidence. In a report of 17 March 1998 Dr Waters expressed concern about the manner in which the allegations came to light and about their investigation by the authorities. He noted that much of the mother’s dialogue with “J” was engendered by leading questions on her part, putting to the child “complex propositions which require simply an affirmation or denial”. He added, “With most increments in the evolution of the allegations, it seems that [J’s] initial response to her mother’s questions is denial, which her mother challenges at a later date with leading questions.” 
     
      
       
      
    16     In relation to both children, the doctor wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
         The dialogue as represented by the mother… seems to contain a strong confirmatory bias which is most clearly portrayed in the leading questions. That is, the mother holds a suspicion about the father, and her conduct and the line of questioning is oriented towards confirming that suspicion. 
         
        
        
         
         The attitude of the mother towards the children and towards the father in particular… would seem to indicate that the mother was derogatory about the father and also that she was extremely anxious and smothering with the children. This is the type of behaviour which is extremely likely, in a child who is eager to please and to stay in favour with the parent, to lead the child to say what he or she perceives the mother wants to hear.  
         
        
       
      
    17     Dr Waters pointed out that, at least since the separation in 1992, both children had “lived in the shadow of their parents’ unresolved disputation”. He explained that young children “become extremely insecure under these circumstances”, the insecurity in this case being exacerbated by the fact that the children had virtually no contact with their mother between August 1993 and the later part of 1995. He observed that the incidents complained of by “J” “are open to the interpretation that they are a distortion of commonplace bedtime routines”, and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
         
         The presence of a fertile context is relevant in that it clearly raises the question as to whether, through a variety of mechanisms, [J] has finally made statements which had confirmed her mother’s concern, and at least in terms of the alleged abuses, are baseless. [I] has then been a willing accomplice to communicate with the authorities. The issue as to content also raises the possibility of an innocent explanation. A combination of important contextual as well as content concerns significantly shift the balance away from validity in the direction of invalidity.  
         
        
       
      
    18     Turning to the investigation of the complaint, Dr Waters had this to say: 
     
      
       
        
         
         The Joint Investigation Teams have in place a variety of procedures intended to generate the highest quality information from interviews with even very young children. It would appear to me that the investigation by DOCS and by the police has violated the precepts in a number of fundamental ways which jeopardise seriously the quality of the interviews. … 
         
        
        
         
         The interview (sic) with [J], who was six years of age at the time, have always been conducted with the school Principal present, and on at least one occasion also with her sister [I]. While on one view, [the principal] could be regarded as a support person, for two reasons I believe that this view is not supportable. First, [J] is now aged 6 years. It is unnecessary to interview with a “support person”, a child of that age who does not seem to suffer from paralysing separation anxiety. Children of this age are routinely interviewed alone and are given a coherent account of themselves and of events which have occurred to them. Obvious accommodations need to be made for the child’s age, but they are not major nor are they beyond the skills of properly trained Police and DOCS officers. Second, [the principal] has not conducted herself in a neutral supportive role as one might expect from a third party such as a teacher. The children lived in her home for two weeks and during the interviews she displayed a considerable affection to [J] and made encouraging statements to her during forensic interviews. [I] made an early “disclosure” to her, which was known to [J]. The effect in [J’s] mind would have been to see [the principal] as acting  
         in loco 
           
         parentis 
          and in this instance as representative of the views and attitudes of the mother, particularly exemplified by of (sic) [the principal’s] conduct during the interviews. Thus the effect is of having the mother, with her confirmatory bias, in the interview. 
         
        
        
         
         While the conduct on the part of [the principal] was almost certainly well-intentioned, the fact that it occurred does not reflect well on the professional competence of Ms Manning or Mr Bassingthwaighte. Probably not surprisingly then, as you have properly noted, a number of the questions in the DOCS and police interviews are extremely leading.  
         
        
       
      
    19     Apart from the references to Dr Waters’ report, what I have written thus far amounts to no more than brief reference to some salient features of the considerable volume of material which was before the learned magistrate for the purpose of the costs application. It is sufficient, however, to demonstrate what a troubling case this was. Given his experience and expertise, Dr Waters’ views are illuminating. Nevertheless, one does not need the assistance of an expert to perceive the very real danger that “J”’s account has been contaminated by her mother, for whatever reason. The whole of the circumstances surrounding the allegations are such as to cast grave doubt upon their reliability, and they called for a most careful and sensitive investigation. 
     
      
       
      
    20     On 5 March 1998 the Director of Public Prosecutions took over the proceedings. On 12 March the plaintiff’s solicitor wrote to the Director, requesting that no further action be taken in the matter. That request having been declined, the plaintiff pursued a summons in this Court seeking that the proceedings be permanently stayed as an abuse of process. On 27 March Black AJ (as his Honour then was) dismissed that summons. 
     
      
       
      
    21     In the meantime, the Care proceedings continued. It seems that in June 1998 the mother failed to appear at the Children’s Court whilst she was under cross-examination. However, the evidence she had already given served only to confirm fears that she had contaminated the account of sexual abuse by both girls and, indeed, may well have planted the idea of that abuse in their minds. This led to a further application to the Director to terminate the proceedings against the plaintiff, to which the Director acceded after examining the transcript of the mother’s evidence.  
     
      
       
      
    22     The magistrate’s power to award costs to the plaintiff was limited by s41A(2A) of the Justices Act, which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         (2A) Costs are not to be awarded in favour of a defendant unless the Justice or Justices is or are satisfied as to any of the following: 
          
          
         (a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner, 
          
          
         (b) that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecution in an improper manner, 
          
          
         (c) that the prosecution unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the defendant might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought, 
          
          
         (d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecution, it is just and reasonable to award costs. 
         
        
       
       
        
       
      
    23     In his reasons for refusing an order for costs, the learned magistrate dealt with each of the paragraphs of that sub-section. The manner in which his Worship dealt with all of them was the subject of submissions in this Court, but argument was directed primarily to pars (a), (b) and (c).  
     
      
       
      
    24     As to par (a), that the investigation was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner, his Worship said this:  
     
      
       
        
         
         What’s essentially alleged here is that that there was a failure by the police to follow protocols of interviewing young children and there was a failure to take into account, during the course of the investigations, the very real fact of the disputed Family Court proceedings in regard to the custody of the children. … 
          
          
         I find it somewhat difficult to see that anything done by the police was unreasonable or improper as those words are commonly accepted to mean. The fact that an investigation does not come up to optimum expectations would not put it into the category of being unreasonable or improper unless it was grossly below optimum standards, and I cannot say that that is the case here. 
         
        
       
      
    25     As to par (b), that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith, his Worship could see no basis for such a conclusion in light of the material which the police had gathered. He noted that the Director’s decision to terminate the proceedings was made only after consideration of the mother’s evidence in the Care proceedings in June 1998. He referred to the judgment of Black AJ, in which his Honour acknowledged the concern engendered by the mother’s behaviour but was not prepared to conclude that the prosecution was “foredoomed to failure”. 
     
      
       
      
    26     As to par (c), that the prosecution unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter, his Worship stated that the argument was that there should have been further investigations in the light of the contentious Family Court proceedings. He rejected that argument, observing that the nature of the suggested investigations was not specified. However, he acknowledged the need for an appropriate protocol to deal with allegations of child sexual assault in circumstances such as these. He added: 
     
      
       
        
         
         There can be little doubt that at the time of the arrest there were reasonable grounds to suspect the commission of an arrestable offence. Perhaps that aspect of the matter could have been handled differently and perhaps at that point the matter could have been, without arrest, referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for advice as to how to proceed further with the matter in the light of all the circumstances.  
         
        
       
      
    27     In so far as subs (2A) refers to bad faith in the initiation of a prosecution and impropriety in the investigation or the conduct of the proceedings, I do not understand anything of the sort to have been argued in this application for costs. What was urged was that it was unreasonable to launch the prosecution, and that the investigation of the matter before and after the initiation of the proceedings fell below reasonable standards. I must say that, in the unusual circumstances of this case, there appears to have been some force in that submission. 
     
      
       
      
    28     The question whether the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause was to be answered by reference to the quality of the evidence which the police had gathered, with an eye not only to the enquiries which had been made but also to those which should have been made. It turned upon considerations different from (although related to) those to which Black AJ had regard in determining whether the prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of process. Quite apart from the flaws in the investigation to which reference has been made, one can envisage other enquiries which should have been undertaken, preferably before a decision whether or not to lay charges was made. In particular, it could be argued that this was a case in which the authorities should have sought the advice of an expert such as Dr Waters. 
     
      
       
      
    29     These, however, are not matters which I need to decide: nor would it be my place to do so. Apart from certain declarations, the plaintiff seeks an order under s134 (since repealed ) of the Justices Act that the matter be remitted to the Local Court with a direction that it “exercise its jurisdiction in accordance with the judgment of this Court”: to use more familiar and time honoured language, that the matter be heard and determined according to law. At the very least, I must be satisfied that the learned magistrate fell into error in his approach to what was undoubtedly a discretionary decision. Counsel for the Director was content that I should apply the familiar principles governing appellate review of a discretionary decision enunciated in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-5, rather than determining whether there was error amounting to a constructive failure by the magistrate to exercise his jurisdiction: Acuthan v Coates (1986) 6 NSWLR 472, per Kirby P (as he then was) at 482-4; Saffron v DPP (1989) 16 NSWLR 397, per Gleeson CJ at 399 and Priestly JA at 418-9. On either test, I am of the view that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief which he seeks. 
     
      
       
      
    30     It is sufficient to refer to the magistrate’s reasons, quoted at par 24 of this judgment, for disposing of the argument, based upon s41A(2A)(a) of the Act, that the investigation was conducted in an unreasonable manner. His Worship appears to have assumed that this required proof that the investigation fell “grossly below optimum standards”. No such expression appears in par (a), and to apply such a test is to place an unwarranted gloss upon its terms.  
     
      
       
      
    31     Obviously, an investigation which fails to meet optimum standards is not necessarily unreasonable. Equally, however, it might fairly be classed as unreasonable even though it does not fall grossly below those standards. In this case, his Worship did not have to characterise the undoubted shortcomings of the investigation in that way before determining that, in all the circumstances, its conduct was unreasonable. The test is purely objective. To find that the conduct of the investigation of a particular case was unreasonable does not necessarily impugn the general competence, far less the integrity, of those responsible for it. 
     
      
       
      
    32     His Worship’s error in his consideration of par (a) of the subsection is sufficient to require the remission of the matter to the Local Court. However, with respect, I think it likely that his somewhat restricted view of what might be classed as unreasonable also affected his approach to pars (b) and (c). However that may be, the case requires reconsideration with an eye to all four paragraphs of subs (2A). 
     
      
       
      
    33     As the learned magistrate is no longer a member of that Bench, I shall consult the parties about the formal order appropriate to give effect to this judgment. If necessary, I shall also hear argument on the costs of the proceedings in this Court.
