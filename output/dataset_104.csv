   JUDGMENT 1. On 6 January 2009 the matter of Lionel Crescente v The Director of Public Prosecutions came before me. It was an all ground appeal.2. The physical facts were not much in dispute. That is to say that at a point in time at about 11.25am on Bourke Street, Zetland on 1 March 2007 the appellant was at an intersection near Elizabeth Street. When he pulled up he pulled up next to a fully marked highway patrol vehicle also travelling in Bourke Street. That vehicle was then driven by an Acting Sergeant of Police, Damien Preston. He saw the appellant pull up with a silver grey black flip phone in his left hand, pressed against his left ear. The Appellant’s lips were moving, he seemed to be having a conversation on the phone. That conversation lasted for five or six seconds. Sergeant Preston says the appellant turned and looked at him and then immediately dropped the phone onto his shoulder, moved his shoulder and the phone fell down.3. Now that I think about it the appellant’s version is different.4. The appellant agrees that he was in Bourke Street, waiting at the traffic lights alongside the officer and that he was pulled over. He was, he says, not using a mobile phone, but using a Bluetooth electronic device which was operated via the wheel where you could turn it on and off, and that in his ear he had a device so that he could hear. He immediately told the officer, he said, when the officer came to him, “I’ve got Bluetooth.” The officer said, “You aren’t allowed either on Ps to be on Bluetooth” and he issued him a ticket.5. In his evidence before the magistrate he also said as to the Bluetooth: “Somebody rings you and presses the button and it comes on and you can hear him”. He said he did have a phone in his car, but he had his Bluetooth, very similar, he had something in his ear that clips into the ear then. 6. He has brought into court today material which he says supports him, namely a pamphlet “Mobile phones and driving” issued by the RTA. The picture on the front is what is known as a flip top conventional mobile phone, so far as I can tell. On one part of the inside of the pamphlet it says, “It’s The Law”, under that heading it says “It is illegal to drive or ride a vehicle when using a handheld mobile phone”. Then in an orange highlighted section it says “Using a mobile phone can lead to poor steering, drifting across lanes, driving in erratic or overly slow manner”. Then comes this paragraph; 
     
      
      “While mobile phones can be used to report accidents and call for help they can also cause crashes when improperly used while driving”. 
       
      
    In the body of the report under a white heading there is; “Hands-Free Mobile Phones” then this appears; 
     
      
      “If you are a fully licensed or a P2 driver you  
      must 
       (my emphasis) talk on a hands-free phone while driving. Make sure it is a hands-free phone that is set up and working before you start driving. Keep the conversation short, do not engage in complex or emotional conversations. Tell the person on the other end that you are driving and may have to end the call. Never send a text message. End the call if it is distracting you from driving”. 
       
      
    Frankly that material is misleading. The question of whether a mobile phone can be used to report an accident may also be misleading. I would have thought only in cases of necessity could a mobile phone be used, because of the provision (Road Traffic Rule) of 300 Mobile Phones by Drivers (Except holders or Learner or Provisional P1 Licences).  
     
      
      “The driver of a vehicle, (and note this please), except an emergency vehicle or police vehicle, must not use a mobile phone that the driver is holding in his or her hand while the vehicle is moving or is stationary but not parked, unless the driver is exempt from this rule under another law of this jurisdiction”. 
       
      
    Further down: 
     
      
      “A mobile phone does not include a CB radio or any other two-way radio” 
       
      
    I pause to interpolate that is probably because they are usually affixed in the vehicle. The Rule continues: 
     
      
      “Use. In relation to a mobile phone includes the following: holding the phone to or near the ear, whether or not engaged in a phone call, writing, sending or reading a text message on the phone, turning the phone on or off, operating any other function of the phone”. 
       
      
    7. There are two versions before the court. But the first issue to be decided is this, is a mobile phone that incorporates a Bluetooth function a mobile phone? Any device which activates a carriage service so that there can be a transmission of a telecommunication and is portable constitutes a mobile phone. If the Bluetooth device is one capable of being held in the hand and capable of conveying or activating a carriage service then it constitutes a mobile phone. What other functions it does, does not matter.8. So the next question then is one of whom do I accept? If the appellant’s account was correct, and assume for the moment that he was not a provisional P1 license driver and the phone was not held in his hand while the vehicle was moving this provision would not appear to apply.9. When the allegation is (first) put to him, by the police officer, his response to the allegation is “This is a Bluetooth”; not “I was not holding anything in my hand”. The description given by the officer is of a mobile phone being held in his hand. If the mobile phone is being held in his hand then clearly that is a breach of the Road Traffic Rule 300.10. The magistrate, who had the opportunity of observing both witnesses, came down in favour of the prosecution. It can only be that he did so because there was otherwise one on one, the Magistrate found him to be an unreliable witness. The magistrate said, 
     
      
      “We can all wrap the untruth up and present it as the truth. We can bend the truth. We can call them white lies, we are all capable of doing it. On this occasion I have two people who agree to being in the same place at about the same time and then they are diametrically opposed as to who gets in and who gets out of the car. More appropriately I have a police officer who is supposed to have effectively made up a conversation about not having P plates and then issuing P plates and then not issuing a ticket for P plates and had just given a warning. Why, if he was going to stitch up Mr Crescente, why would he do he that? Mr Crescente says, ‘Well it was not me he spoke to’. I do not know how Mr Crescente can say it was not me he spoke to on the day on that occasion, because I had just been to the AMMI Insurance”. 
       
      
    11. What is clear from his Honour is that his Honour has found the appellant unreliable. I have not the advantage of seeing the police officer. I have to rely on his Honour’s judgment as to credibility. That being the case, whether the device that was in his hand was a Bluetooth or whether the device in his hand was your normal average mobile phone, the Appellant was using it in his hand . At the end of the day I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offence has been proved.Thereafter there was discussion as to whether the Appellant was appealing against the penalty imposed.HIS HONOUR: Let me just make the formal orders:12. The conviction appeal is dismissed. The fine imposed by the learned Magistrate and court costs are each confirmed.Mr Crescente, thank you very much.APPELLANT: Thank you so much.

    JUDGMENT1. Matthew Whitmore started his adult life, having reached an elite level in swimming, competent in tennis and talented in music. He is described as having obvious ability, the potential to succeed in any of a number of different areas should he choose to do so. He is physically imposing and no doubt can be socially engaging. 2. At 4.20am on 27 September 2007, police observed him standing on a balcony dressed only in underwear, howling like a wolf. At the beginning of that month, police had found him naked, rambling on a roof, screaming incoherently. On 16 June he had been found in the lobby of his apartment building in an agitated, aggressive, screaming state. On 11 June he was found agitated, aggressive and hitting his head on the footpath. These are two pictures of Matthew Whitmore. One when he is drug-free, the other when illicit drugs have taken possession of his body and his mind.3. On 27 September Matthew Whitmore admitted to having illicit drugs in his premises. He was arrested, placed in custody and granted conditional bail. Today he is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct in possessing prohibited drugs for the purpose of supplying them to his friend or friends. He has pleaded guilty on arraignment to a charge of supplying ecstasy. He asked that his possession of further ecstasy and other drugs be taken into account when he is being sentenced.4. As sentencing judge then, it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence, before this Court, committed by this offender, in this community. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the court. I also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender. The starting point for such assessment requires me to make findings of fact from evidence before the Court relating to both the offence and the offender. My fact-finding task has been circumscribed in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts to which I shall shortly return. It is sufficient at this point that I remind the Court, a judge is not a party to the agreed set of facts. The tender of the agreed facts does not relieve the judge from his or her fact-finding responsibility, it simply limits the material from which the facts may be found. To the extent, if it be the case that the facts, as agreed, do not reflect the actual events that occurred, it must be remembered the Court can only find the facts from the evidence before it.5. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are other questions that need to be asked, particularly in respect of deterrence, discounts, if a sentence of imprisonment is to be imposed, its length and the non-parole period. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are found. What weight needs to be given in all of these matters against the imperative that sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community, will also need to be determined. Facts6. Police arrived in the early hours of the morning to the offender’s Chalmers Street, Surry Hills flat. Whitmore was the sole occupant. They entered the building, knocked on the offender’s door, he opened the door and invited the police inside. Concerned for his welfare, police entered the unit and immediately observed a quantity of drugs on the kitchen table and on the floor by the kitchen table, in plain sight. An ambulance was called, he was conveyed to St Vincent’s Hospital for treatment in relation to an apparent drug-induced psychotic state. Police then left the unit, securing it, making an application for a search warrant shortly thereafter.7. At about 8.45am, Matthew Whitmore returned to his unit, having left the hospital. He was arrested in relation to the drugs. He was cautioned, asked a number of questions, which were recorded. He admitted to having illicit drugs including about twenty ecstasy tablets having a Chinese symbol, costing him $600. He admitted to possession of about a gram of crystal methamphetamine [ICE] which he told police cost him $550. He was conveyed to Surry Hills charge room where he was introduced to the custody manager and informed of his rights. 8. The search warrant, earlier applied for, was granted and executed at about 11.15. During the search police located thirty-two tablets, subsequently analysed as being 3-4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine, more commonly known as ecstasy. These were divided into four separate clear resealable plastic bags, eight in a bag with “M-A-T-T” written on a piece of paper in the bag; four in a bag with “W-A-D-E” written on a piece of paper within the bag. Both of those bags were located on the table. Ten tablets located also in another bag on the table and a further ten in a bag located on the floor near the table leg. All were pink in colour with the same Chinese marking. 9. The basis of the supplying of prohibited drug alleged by the Crown is that the offender had four ecstasy tablets in his possession for supply to a person named Wade. In an interview with the police, he admitted he had drugs for his personal use and had bought a couple for friends. While police are highly suspicious about the remaining twenty-eight tablets, apart from the quantity (4.62 grams), the fact that they were bagged separately, and the offender’s previously stated admissions relating to his intent to supply friends, there is no other evidence available pointing to an intention to supply those tablets. I note that that is sufficient, in my view, to have established that the other tablets were intended for supply but, as will be seen later, I pay some regard to the concession made by the Crown. The appropriate weight of the four tablets is 1.02 grams which is a trafficable quantity, but if my memory serves me, less than an indictable quantity.Form 110. During the search of the apartment police located two small bags containing methamphetamine weighing 1.15 grams. He was charged with that and that constitutes the first matter on the Form 1. Police located three plastic resealable bags containing a total of twenty-eight tablets of ecstasy with a combined weight of 4.62 grams, that is the second matter on the Form 1 and I have already referred to them. Police located a plastic resealable bag containing one piece of paper with perforated sections of ten Discrete Dosage Units, which upon analysis was found to be lysergy (LSD) in the amount of ten Discrete Dosage Units. That constitutes the third matter on the Form 1.11. Police located a number of items used in connection with illicit drug administration including a homemade water pipe, one glass smoking pipe, a bowl and scissors covered with green dry substance. 12. To understand the concession made by the Crown in respect of Wade, it is important to remember eight tablets were in a bag marked “Matt”, the offender’s given name is Matthew. Given the psychotic episodes I have earlier referred to experienced by the offender, I cannot rule out that the other unlabelled drugs were not for the offender’s own use. It is in this sense that I can only be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that the drugs marked “Wade” were in his possession for supply. That appears to be the concession made by the Crown in any event, because all the other material is on the Form 1. 13. Plus, while the law deemed the quantity of drugs in his possession as being in his possession for supply, and therefore amounting to supply for the purposes of the law, upon analysis those drugs held for supply must be, given the concession of the Crown, the drug taking history of the offender and the items found associated with personal drug use, restricted to the packet marked Wade. In other words, both the indictment and the facts seem to support the four tablets only being related to the indictment. The balance of the material is to be taken into account when sentencing for that matter.Objective Criminality14. From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in this case with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact as one might imagine, on the overall sentencing outcome.15. The courts and legislature have made it clear that drug supplying is an unacceptable criminal activity. It is not difficult to understand why drug supplying is a criminal activity. Contrary to the impression many offenders may well have, it is not a social, but rather an antisocial activity. The courts have long recognised that in assessing the objective seriousness of drug offences, it is necessary to have regard to the drug’s potential for harm. Harm to others when inflicted by someone else is antisocial. Drug dealing is harmful to the community by its direct impact on those who purchase drugs, and its indirect impact on the community at large. Matthew Whitmore of all people, would have to recognise the damage that drugs can do to the fit, healthy and vibrant young men, let alone to others less fit, healthy or vibrant. For some, if not most, drugs such as those that I am concerned with can be addictive. Some are otherwise destructive, causing or contributing to mental health problems and/or aggression.16. Supplying of drugs can lead to, create or sustain drug addicts. Drug addicts are human beings whose capacity to function and feel human is smothered to a greater or lesser extent by addiction and the other effects of drugs. The real essence of the criminal harm done by suppliers of drugs, is that in a greater or a lesser way, the disenabling of other human beings is accomplished by those who deal in drugs. In that sense then, drug supplying undermines public health. As I said, it also has an indirect impact on the community. 17. Associated with drug addiction are other forms of crimes such as armed robbery, break and enters, that is, loss of property to an owner, usually arising from that owner’s productive efforts in the community. Associated with robbery and break and enter offences is the trauma, emotional and psychological damage to victims caused by intrusion into their homes and sometimes violence. The spending of money on drugs by addicts without any corresponding productivity by the drug dealers amounts to a monumental transference of wealth, usually from the already poor without any corresponding economic gain for the community. 18. Finally, drug addiction is a significant factor in so many young men and women being incarcerated in our prisons. While their youth slips away, unspent in places of joy, learning and beneficial experience, the prison culture becomes a factor in shaping their attitudes and devalues their future. 19. In this case, the quantity of drugs intended for supply measured on the potential for harm scale, must be at the very bottom of the range. Indeed the drugs for this offender’s personal use, were capable of continuing the great harm he was doing to himself. They were, as I say, larger in quantity than the ones set aside for supply. Apart from the fact that the courts care about the well-being of each person including this offender, the costs of his drug abuse to the community is real. Significant police and healthcare costs have been spent on him as a consequence of his over-indulgence. 20. The supply was limited in its scope to a person known to Whitmore and, I infer, known to him as a user of drugs. There is no suggestion of any recruiting a non-user to drug use. The supply had not been accomplished. There was no financial gain. It was not a one-off event. The quantity of supply points to the supply being to an end user rather than to an on-supplier. This is one of those rare cases where the criminality is so far towards the lower end, that it does not call for a custodial sentence. The defence, in submissions on sentence, made clear it was seeking a section 9 bond. The Crown conceded a section 9 bond was not outside the range of options available to me. As will be seen, there is nothing in the subjective facts that disentitles to, and much that points to the appropriateness of a section 9 bond. Subjective matters20. I turn now to the subjective matters. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence, but also I am sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this offender or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate.21. Matthew Whitmore is a single man aged thirty, sharing accommodation at Newtown. He is the elder of two siblings. At aged five his family moved to the Kempsey area where his father managed the local swimming pool for many years. Whitmore is described as having a very good relationship with both parents although he said they hold fairly conventional views and found it difficult to accept their son was homosexual. Mr Whitmore senior died in August of 2008. The offender’s mother has experienced breast cancer although, reportedly, under control. The offender’s relationship with his sister is not particularly close and was further strained when he disclosed his homosexuality. That he did when he was about twenty-one.22. Given his family circumstances, his being raised in country New South Wales and his sports background, disclosing his homosexuality required personal courage. Not only did it require confronting personally his sexual orientation but he must have understood his coming out would be difficult for his family. His mother is suffering breast cancer, he says he contacts her almost daily. Education, Employment and Skills23. Whitmore completed Year 12 at Kempsey High School. He was academically astute, being placed in the top five or six of his year. He was active in tennis and swimming, rating nationally in the four hundred metres, one of the glamour events. As I mentioned, talented in music. Post high school he attended Newcastle University studying Medical Radiation Therapy. Although scoring well, he abandoned his study after a year for a change of direction. At the UTS he studied Applied Chemistry and Forensic Science for eighteen months and then discontinued. He spent time working at a call-centre until made redundant in 2002. He returned to uni doing an Arts Degree in Media Communication but stopped two subjects short of his degree. His academic history suggests two things. He has an enquiring, active and versatile mind, but he appears to lack self-discipline and persistence. Currently he is working as a caption-writer on films, as I understand it, for the hearing impaired. He is looking for promotion. I am satisfied he has a good work ethic. General Health24. He appears to be in good general physical health with a physique representing years of swimming training.Mental Health Issues25. Whitmore has been under the clinical care of Dr Samuel Roberts, a clinical psychologist since November 2007. He presented with a history of anxiety, depression, low self esteem and drug induced psychosis. Dr Roberts’ current diagnosis is major depressive episode, substance abuse in full remission and substance induced psychotic disorder which I also understand is in full remission. He is currently medicated for his depression on Efexor which he says is working well. Recent stressors identified by Dr Roberts include his mother’s diagnosis of breast cancer, his father’s diagnosis of cancer affecting the spine and subsequent death. Although not diagnosed, it is likely the present criminal proceedings is also a significant stressor. Dr Roberts notes Mr Whitmore has confronted these stressors, his mood has remained stable and he has managed these circumstances appropriately. Drugs26. Matthew Whitmore has a history of serious poly-drug abuse. Since 1998 when he first came to Sydney, he commenced with cannabis, reaching a point of smoking fifty or sixty cones daily. That amounts to a monumental consumption. While the immediate impact may have been one of euphoria, its accumulative impact is menacing indeed. In some, its accumulated effect is paranoia, aggression and/or serious mental health problems. I note that this offender appears to have at least two of the three and I would not be surprised if it was a three out of three.27. He told Probation and Parole his use of other drugs had largely been confined to “party-type drugs” although on the earlier occasions of psychosis I note he was not at a party. He said that the party-type drugs were used by some members of the inner city-gay community. I accept that there are some members of the inner city-gay community using drugs, but I note that overwhelmingly most of the gay community do not find it necessary so to do. In the “party set” this offender’s drug of choice appears to have been GHB, a drug that sedates the central nervous system followed by a methamphetamine which stimulates the contrary effects of GHB.28. Somewhat unaccounted for on the review of drugs by Dr Roberts was the LSD. There is no mention of the use of that drug. That either suggests non-full disclosure, an oversight by Dr Roberts or that the drug was being held for some purpose other than personal use. It seems to me to be the options there.Character and Criminal History29. Matthew Whitmore is a thirty year old intelligent man with great potential, I have already made reference to a passage in the pre-sentence report of him having the obvious ability and potential to succeed at a high level in any one of a number of different areas. To date he has displayed poor self-discipline in several aspects of his life. That lack of self-discipline became problematic and criminal in his approach to drugs. In more recent times however, there has been a change, he appears to have made substantial changes for good in his life. He has been seeking psychiatric assistance as I say since November of 2007. He ceased drug use using the “cold turkey” method, one requiring determination, courage and self-discipline. He has no prior criminal conduct recorded against him, he is entitled to leniency on that account. His being charged with this offence may well mark an important turning point in his life. He is gainfully employed in an activity that must be fulfilling for him and valuable for the hearing impaired.30. His plea was entered at an early time but was entered before this Court. He was committed for trial. Nonetheless the utilitarian value of the plea is noted. Of course had the plea not been entered, the case of deemed supply was strong. The benefit given for the plea is reflected in the overall result.Attitude to Offence31. I am satisfied he is profoundly remorseful. He looks upon his criminal conduct as a low point in his life. He has worked hard to rehabilitate. I note that section 9 is a penalty provided by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The section 9 bond that I am giving will be one of two years. Given the criminality in this offence, it seems to me that I can point to a two year section 9 bond as having a deterrent effect because for two years the question of his liberty is still, in a sense, unresolved. By that I mean that in the event that he should re-offend, my view as to his rehabilitation prospects will have altered by virtue of the re-offence and a more severe penalty may well then be appropriate. 32. Just before I get to the more formal part, I have these conditions. Continue treatment with Dr Roberts until Dr Roberts says that a treatment regime is no longer required. Supervision by Probation and Parole for the first six months for the purpose of demonstrating to them that he has maintained treatment with Dr Roberts, no other reason. That will be done by simply producing a receipt or something and it is only for that purpose. They are my eyes and ears, in other words, I have no way otherwise of knowing. Remain alcohol free for six months. Drug free I do not have to make an order because it would be a breach of the bond anyway. Will you stand up please.33. Matthew James Whitmore, you are convicted of the offence that you on 27 September 2007 at Surry Hills supplied a prohibited drug, namely 3-4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine or more commonly known as ecstasy. I take into account the three matters on the Form 1. Instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment upon you, I make an order directing you to enter into a good behaviour bond for two years from today. The terms of the bond are these:* That you will be of good behaviour* That you will continue with treatment from Dr Roberts until such time as he says a treatment regime is no longer required. In the event that you and Dr Roberts need to part company, a psychiatrist of equivalent qualification is required. * You are to accept supervision by Probation and Parole for a period of not less than six months and thereafter at the discretion of Probation and Parole, solely for the purpose of reporting to them your attendance at Dr Roberts and establishing as a fact, that that attendance has occurred. * You are to remain alcohol free for six months from today.34. That bond can be entered on the fourth floor I think it is. Thank you, I will get the papers up there as quickly as I can. Good luck Mr Whitmore, you can make a great thing of your life I think if you can stay off the drugs, all right, and a bit of self-discipline.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIDDEN J: The offenders, Linard Shamouil and Steven David, were to have faced trial for the murder of Ashoor Audisho at Fairfield West on 9 April 2006. In the event, Shamouil pleaded guilty to that charge. David pleaded guilty to a fresh indictment containing two counts: 
     
      
    (1) common assault of Ashoor Audisho;(2) accessory after the fact to Shamouil’s murder of Audisho. 
     
      
       
      The Crown takes no further proceedings in respect of the charge of murder against him. 
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    2 I have received agreed statements of facts in both cases. For the most part they are identical, but there are some differences between them. I shall point out those differences as I recite the facts. Of course, in dealing with each offender I shall have regard only to the facts in his case.  
     
      
    3 The deceased was a 21-year-old man. On 2 April 2006, at an Assyrian festival at Fairfield, he had an argument with a young woman to whom I shall refer simply as NY. The background to that argument is not material. During the course of it, the deceased ended up trading insults with a friend of NY, a 16-year-old girl whom I shall identify as NS. NS is Shamouil’s cousin although, for reasons which I shall explain later, he saw her as his sister.  
     
      
    4 During the days thereafter those insults came to the attention of Shamouil, who took exception to them. He spent some time trying to locate the deceased, without success. He and David were associates. He did not know the deceased or his family, but David did. David helped him find the deceased, and by the morning of 9 April the deceased knew that both men were looking for him. 
     
      
    5 That afternoon, the deceased spoke to a man he knew, Awney Adam, who was also a friend of David’s brother. Adam advised the deceased against meeting with Shamouil and David. Throughout the afternoon the deceased received a large number of phone calls from both of them. Phone records show that he did not answer any of some 19 calls from Shamouil, but did speak to David on numerous occasions. 
     
      
    6 Most significantly, the deceased had a four minute phone call with David at 6.09 pm. At that time the deceased was working voluntarily at a club at Fairfield, where there was a children’s function. The organiser of that event overheard parts of this phone call in which the deceased appeared to be arguing with someone. Immediately after the call the deceased left the club, telling the organiser that he was having problems caused by a 16-year-old girl and that he had to go to sort something out. 
     
      
    7 The deceased then had further communication with Adam, in which he said that he was going to see “the boys” at Fairfield. It had evidently been agreed that he would meet Shamouil and David at a public place, that is, the 7-Eleven store at the corner of The Boulevard and Hamilton Road, Fairfield. Adam agreed to accompany him and met him at the 7-Eleven store car park. Adam went to the front of the store to buy a drink, while the deceased remained in the car. 
     
      
    8 At about the same time another man, Dilan Shaba, picked up Shamouil and David from Shamouil’s home in Fairfield. Both he and David were known to Adam, but Shamouil was not. Directed by Shamouil and David, Shaba drove to the 7-Eleven store and parked his car. While in the car, he overheard David on his phone telling the deceased to come to the 7-Eleven store. They got out of the car and David walked directly towards the store, while Shamouil and Shaba took a different route which followed the footpath around it. 
     
      
    9 Adam met David at the front of the 7-Eleven store, while the deceased remained in the car. Adam asked David a number of times if there was to be any violence, and stressed that the deceased was there to apologise. A few moments later, Shamouil and Shaba joined them at the front of the store. Adam again stressed that the deceased was there to apologise and asked if there was to be any violence. David assured him that no one was going to touch the deceased and that he only wanted to talk to him. By this time, they had moved to the car park area immediately around the corner from the store. The deceased was still in the car. 
     
      
    10 Adam went to the car and the deceased got out. The deceased talked to Shamouil and Shaba, while Adam was speaking to David. An argument erupted, initially between the deceased and Shamouil. Shaba became involved, and struck the deceased to the face. The argument escalated to the point where a scuffle broke out, involving grabbing, pushing and punching between Shamouil, Shaba and the deceased. 
     
      
    11 Shamouil produced a gun from under his jumper. Shaba stated that, as Shamouil pointed the gun at the deceased’s leg, the deceased said words to the effect of, “If you are not going to use it, put it away.” The facts in Shamouil’s case record that, according to Adam, at this point he (Adam) was attempting to calm everyone down, and he heard the deceased say, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry” about four or five times. The evidence as to exactly what was said by all parties at this time is conflicting, and senior counsel for Shamouil told me that his client does not acknowledge having heard the deceased say those words. I shall approach the matter accordingly. This material does not appear in the facts in David’s case. 
     
      
    12 A few moments after producing the gun, Shamouil fired three shots in rapid succession, one of which wounded the deceased fatally. The other two wounds were to his right upper arm and right buttock. The fatal gunshot wound was to his torso, with an entry point on the right side of his back. This caused damage to his right lung, liver and heart. 
     
      
    13 Immediately after the shooting Shaba ran to his car, followed by Shamouil and David. The facts in Shamouil’s case record that, before leaving the scene, the deceased’s mobile was taken from his person. There is no evidence as to who did so. The memory of that phone recorded the calls received from the phones of Shamouil and David at a time that would have immediately connected them with the death of the deceased. Again, none of this material appears in the facts in David’s case.  
     
      
    14 Shaba dropped David off a few blocks away from the scene. Shamouil gave David his mobile phone and items of clothing worn by him at the time of the shooting. David disposed of these items in order to assist him after he had murdered the deceased. It is this conduct which constitutes the offence of accessory after the fact to murder. In the facts relating to Shamouil, it is recorded that while he was in the car Shaba heard him saying “Fuck, fuck” in a scared tone. 
     
      
    15 Police arrived at the scene at about 7pm, to find the deceased lying face down on the footpath near the corner of The Boulevard and Hamilton Road. He was gasping for air and opening and closing his eyes, but he did not respond to police or to ambulance officers. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Liverpool Hospital. 
     
      
    16 It is not the Crown case that Shamouil carried a loaded gun to the meeting with the intention of shooting the deceased. Some explanation for his carrying the gun is to be found in evidence to which I shall turn later. The Crown accepts that the shooting was spontaneous. However, there is an issue whether Shamouil intended to kill the deceased or to cause him really serious bodily injury. I shall deal with that matter also later.  
     
      
    17 David pleaded guilty to assault on the basis that he played a role in arranging for the deceased to attend the meeting, anticipating that the deceased would be persuaded to apologise by means of threats or intimidation, if necessary. He did not contemplate actual violence. The deceased was threatened verbally in the moments before Shamouil produced the gun in circumstances amounting in law to an assault. The production of the gun by Shamouil and the shooting form no part of the facts upon which he is to be sentenced for this offence. Indeed, he was not aware that Shamouil was carrying a gun until it was produced and fired. 
     
      
    18 For his part in the incident Shaba also pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact to murder. He has been sentenced, and it will be necessary to consider that matter when dealing with David’s case. 
     
      
       
      Victim impact statement 
       
      
    19 I received a victim impact statement written by the deceased’s sister, Nahrin Audisho, on behalf of his family. The statement speaks in eloquent terms of the serious and enduring effects of this tragedy upon her parents, her older brother and his fiancée, her younger sister and herself. Of course, their grief and their outrage are understandable and entirely justified. The tragedy is all the greater because it appears from the statement that two other siblings of hers died in Iraq before the family came to this country.  I expressed my deepest sympathy to the family during the sentence proceedings, and I do so again now. 
     
      
       
      Subjective cases 
       
       
      Shamouil 
      
    20 Linard Shamouil was 20 years old at the time of the offence, and is now 23. His criminal history is, to say the least, disturbing. I put to one side some traffic offences, for which fines were imposed. In 2007, after a trial in the District Court, he was found guilty of attempted murder and was sentenced to an effective term of imprisonment of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. (The sentence actually passed was reduced somewhat so as to take account of an initial period of custody before he was released on bail.) That offence was committed on 17 July 2004, before the present offence. Indeed, it was while he was on bail in respect of it that the present offence was committed. 
     
      
    21 In 2008 he pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, and asked that four further charges of supplying prohibited drugs be taken into account on a Form 1. All five offences were committed in May 2006, that is, after the present offence. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years, which was partly accumulated upon the sentence for the attempted murder. In the aggregate, those sentences expire on 29 January 2019, and he would be eligible for release on parole on 29 January 2017. 
     
      
    22 He remained at large after the murder of Mr Audisho until 3 June 2006, when he was arrested for the drug offences, and he has remained in custody since that day. The sentence for the attempted murder was directed to commence on that date. It was while he was in custody, on 17 July 2006, that he was charged with the murder of Mr Audisho. Thus, none of the period he has spent in custody is exclusively referable to the present offence. 
     
      
    23 I have been supplied with material concerning the attempted murder and the drug offences, including the remarks of the sentencing judges. The victim of the attempted murder was a man whom the offender believed to be having contact with his (the offender’s) girlfriend. He and that young woman had had an intermittent relationship over a number of years, although it seems that it was not a sexual one. Nevertheless, he was jealous of any contact she had with other men as, indeed, was she of his contact with other women. On the occasion in question he drove to the victim’s home, armed with a handgun. He lured the victim outside, and he fired at least six shots in his direction. The victim ducked for cover but sustained two wounds, one to the left foot and one to the right thigh. These caused him significant injury, but it seems that he made a complete recovery. 
     
      
    24 The trial judge, Neilson DCJ, found that the offence was premeditated and could not be described as a “crime of passion”. On the other hand, he noted that the offender was only 18 years old at the time and saw the offence as the product of emotional immaturity. 
     
      
    25 The drug offences were dealt with by Zahra DCJ. It is unnecessary to recite the facts of those offences. It is sufficient to say that the offender was the subject of an undercover police operation, and the principal offence and the four matters on the Form 1 represented a course of drug dealing in which he supplied methylamphetamine to an undercover police officer. His role was that of a courier. Steven David was also involved in the principal offence, a matter to which I shall return when I deal with his case. 
     
      
    26 The offender’s background appears from the affidavits of three of his aunts, Muna Shamouil, Amira Shamouel and Elen Shamuel, together with a psychological report of Mr Tim Watson-Munro.  
     
      
    27 He has not had an easy life. A member of Sydney’s Assyrian community, he is an only child who was born in Iraq. His parents’ marriage failed while he was an infant, and he has since had no contact with his father. He was raised by his mother, assisted by her sisters and his maternal grandmother. In the early 1990’s, in the aftermath of the Gulf war, the family left the country, travelling to Jordan and settling in Malta in 1993. 
     
      
    28 He was close to both his mother and his grandmother. Sadly, his grandmother died after their arrival in Malta. His mother had not enjoyed good health, and suffered from kidney disease during the period leading up to his birth. While in Malta, she was found to be suffering from breast cancer. She had one of her breasts removed and had to undergo chemotherapy. He was only eight years old at the time, and during his mother’s treatment he had to be cared for by neighbours until his aunt, Muna Shamouil joined them. 
     
      
    29 In 1996 they came to this country. Unfortunately, his mother’s cancer worsened and she died in the following year. As I understand it, it was around that time that Elen Shamuel settled in Australia, as did Amira Shamouel and her family. Between them, the three aunts cared for the offender. It will be remembered that the genesis of the offence was the deceased’s trading insults with the offender’s young cousin, NS. She was a member of his extended family, and it is against this background that it must be understood that he saw her as his sister. 
     
      
    30 He left school before completing year 10, whereupon he had a number of labouring jobs. Not surprisingly, he described to Mr Watson-Munro longstanding symptoms of depression, anxiety and low self esteem. He also told Mr Watson-Munro that during his teenage years he had been the subject of violence involving the use of a firearm and a knife, had witnessed a friend of his shot at a nightclub, and was concerned about what the psychologist expressed as “an ongoing litany of violence” in the area where he was living. This provides some explanation for his carrying a loaded gun on the occasion of the offence. Although this material was not the subject of sworn evidence, the Crown prosecutor did not take issue with it. 
     
      
    31 He did not report to Mr Watson-Munro a history of the abuse of alcohol or drugs. However, he did say that he had consumed a small quantity of cocaine and alcohol on the day in question, which aggravated his anxiety and may have had some bearing upon his capacity to control his impulses. Again, the Crown prosecutor took no issue with this account but, in all the circumstances, I do not consider it to be of significance. 
     
      
    32 Among the observations in the conclusion of Mr Watson-Munro’s report were these: 
     
      
       
        
        This man has been exposed to a multitude of serious life events including an absence of his father, the ongoing illness of his mother prior to her death when he was 11 years old, a number of alleged attacks upon him and the significant dislocation which he experienced through shifting from Iraq to Jordan and Malta, prior to his arrival in Australia. 
        
       
       
        
        An analysis of the depositional material confirms a very troubled child who was conduct disordered, disinterested and evidently constantly anxious. No doubt the loss of his mother shortly after arriving in Australia substantially destabilised him as a preadolescent, with this in turn establishing the basis for his problems later in life. 
        
       
       
      The psychologist went on to say that the offender had had time to reflect upon his actions while in custody and appeared to have developed insight into his wrongdoing, and that he had expressed “considerable remorse for the death of Mr Audisho and the impact that this has had upon his family and others.” Mr Watson-Munro was of the view that he requires “long term psychotherapy, coupled to more specific social skills training to help improve upon his low self-esteem and poor impulse control.” 
       
      
    33 I received a handwritten statement by the offender directed to the deceased’s family. Copies of it were made and were given to those family members. The statement is a clear expression of his remorse for his crime, which I accept as genuine. I also received a statement from his parish priest, Father Lazar, which also attests to his remorse and assures him of the support of his church upon his eventual release.  
     
      
       
      David 
      
    34 Steven David was 21 years old at the time of the offence, and is now 24. He has a brief criminal history, the only matter of significance being the offence of supplying methylamphetamine in which he was involved with Shamouil. He was arrested for that offence on 1 June 2006, and has remained in custody since. He was charged with the murder of Mr Audisho on 12 July 2006, while in custody. He pleaded guilty to the drug offence before Solomon DCJ, who sentenced him to imprisonment for 3½ years with a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing on 1 June 2006. Again, it is not necessary to recite the facts of that offence except to observe that Judge Solomon saw his role in it as “very minor.” His non-parole period expired on 31 May 2008 but, of course, he was not released because the present matter remained outstanding. 
     
      
    35 His background is to be found in a statement by his brother, Sargon David. He also is a member of the Assyrian community, born in Iraq. He has five older siblings. The family suffered privations during the Gulf war, as well as discrimination arising from their being Christian Assyrians. When the offender was a baby they fled from the country, making their way through Turkey and Kurdistan to Iran. There they remained for about four years, living in difficult conditions as refugees. 
     
      
    36 In 1990 the family was accepted by New Zealand as refugees and settled in that country until they moved to Australia in 1994. The offender was educated here to year 10 standard, whereupon he commenced apprenticeship as a bricklayer. Prior to his arrest he had been working in that trade, and I received a reference from his employer which speaks highly of him as a worker. It is clear from his brother’s statement, supported by statements from his parish priest and the family doctor, that he is a member of a hard working and respectable family, who have been shocked by his involvement in criminal activity but who remain supportive of him. 
     
      
    37 A statement by his fiancée, Sally Danial, also speaks highly of him and pledges her continuing support. To her and to his brother he expressed remorse for his involvement in the death of Mr Audisho, whom he had considered a good friend. He did so in a handwritten statement presented to me and, in his case also, I accept it as genuine. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing 
      
     
     
      
      Shamouil 
      
    38 Clearly, Shamouil must face a salutary sentence, in the light of the circumstances of the killing of Mr Audisho and his criminal history. As I have said, it is accepted that the purpose of the meeting on the occasion in question was to extract an apology from Mr Audisho and the shooting was spontaneous. Nevertheless, the Crown prosecutor argued that I should find that the offender intended to kill the deceased. There is force in that argument, given that three shots were fired and that one of the bullets penetrated the deceased’s torso. I have given this matter careful consideration, and find that I am not satisfied to the requisite degree that the offender had that intent. I am left in doubt about the matter because of his psychological makeup, and the fact that the shooting was clearly in the heat of the moment in the course of a fast moving event. He is to be sentenced upon the basis that he intended to inflict really serious bodily harm. 
     
      
    39 Of course, the objective gravity of the offence is increased by the fact that a firearm was used and that it was discharged in a public place. Nevertheless, I find that that objective gravity falls short of the mid range. That is a sufficient reason to refrain from setting the standard non-parole period of 20 years. Other reasons are to be found in the offender’s plea of guilty and the difficulties he faced in his disturbed background. The standard non-parole period takes its place as a guidepost in the sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    40 That said, he stands for sentence for a murder committed less than two years after he committed a serious offence of a similar kind, so that considerations of retribution and deterrence call for a more severe sentence than might otherwise have been warranted. Moreover, the fact that he committed the present offence while on bail for that earlier offence is a serious aggravating feature. As the Crown prosecutor pointed out, the sentence I pass should also reflect the community’s abhorrence at young men carrying guns, for whatever reason. The drug offences for which he has been sentenced, although committed after the murder, are an additional factor disentitling him to leniency. In so saying, I am guided by the principles examined by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381, 167 A Crim R 159 at [50]-[61]. 
     
      
    41 In his favour, it is to be noted that he is remorseful and that he has pleaded guilty. The plea of guilty was late, but is still of significant utilitarian value. In my view, it should entitle him to a reduction of sentence of the order of 15 per cent. An examination of his criminal history, without regard to the other subjective material, would not inspire confidence in his prospects of rehabilitation. However, I think that those prospects are reasonable. He is still a young man, who has the capacity and the opportunity to put his disturbed background behind him. He has developed insight into the gravity of his crime and, hopefully, will have matured significantly by the time he is in a position to be released. Clearly, he enjoys continuing support from his extended family and from within his community.  
     
      
    42 I have considered whether I should find special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory ratio between sentence and non-parole period because of his subjective case and the fact that the sentence I pass must be accumulated to a significant extent upon the sentences he is currently serving. I have decided that I should not take that course. The sentence I impose must be a heavy one, and a non-parole period within the statutory ratio would still him leave him with a lengthy period of parole eligibility. Moreover, I do not believe that a non-parole period less than that which I propose would be sufficient to mark his criminality.  
     
      
    43 An important and difficult aspect of the sentencing of this offender is the application of the principal of totality. As I have said, he is currently serving sentences which expire on 29 January 2019 and an effective non-parole period expiring on 29 January 2017. The effect of the sentence which I pass must be such as to reflect the totality of his criminality, while recognising that the severity of a sentence may increase at a greater rate than the increase of its length and that a very long total sentence may be “crushing”, so as to engender in the offender a sense of hopelessness and destroy such prosects as there might be of his rehabilitation. The principle of totality was also revisited in MAK at [15]-[18]. 
     
      
    44 I propose to determine an appropriate sentence for the murder, and to reflect the principle of totality by allowing it to be served partly concurrently with the offender’s existing non-parole period. The circumstances of the offence and the aggravating features attending it call for a sentence of imprisonment for 22 years. This I shall reduce to 19 years in recognition of his plea of guilty. I shall fix a non-parole period of 14½ years, a little over 75 per cent of that term. That sentence will commence on 30 July 2011. In the result, the offender’s effective non-parole period will be increased by 9 years, followed by a period of parole eligibility of 4½ years.  
     
      
     
     
      
      David 
      
    45 I have set out earlier in these remarks the bases for David’s pleas of guilty to common assault and accessory after the fact to murder. As to the latter charge, it is necessary to have regard to the sentence passed upon Dilan Shaba for the same offence. 
     
      
    46 Shaba was sentenced by Berman AJ after pleading guilty to that offence. At that time it was the Crown case that both Shamouil and David were involved in the murder, and Shaba’s offence was the assistance he afforded to both of them. At that stage of the proceedings it was necessary to protect his identity from publication, and his Honour’s remarks were published as R v AB [2007] NSWSC 1517. He was sentenced on the basis that he drove Shamouil and David from the scene after the shooting. He drove Shamouil to his home, a journey of about five minutes, dropping David off in a back street on the way. 
     
      
    47 Shaba is also a member of the Assyrian community. He had a minor criminal record, which Berman AJ ignored for the purpose of sentence. His subjective case was otherwise favourable. Of particular significance was his assistance to the authorities in relation to the murder which, together with his plea of guilty, persuaded his Honour to allow him a 50 per cent reduction of sentence. He had been in custody for almost one year and eight months, and his Honour accepted that that was a sufficient non-parole period in the circumstances. Accordingly, he imposed a sentence of 2½ years imprisonment but set a non-parole period which enabled his immediate release. 
     
      
    48 The Crown prosecutor acknowledged that the criminality of Shaba and David as accessories after the fact fell into the lower end of the range. However, he submitted that their culpability was comparable and that I should take the undiscounted sentence of Berman AJ as the starting point in determining the appropriate sentence for David. However, I am persuaded by the argument of senior counsel for David that I should not approach the matter in that way. In my view, David’s criminality in disposing of Shamouil’s mobile phone and clothing was less than that of Shaba, who drove both offenders from the scene of the crime and delivered Shamouil to the safety of his home. Moreover, Berman AJ was constrained in the leniency he was able to extend to Shaba because of the length of time he had already spent in custody. Clearly, his Honour’s sentence was structured in a practical way to ensure that his custody came to an end. This is not to say that the sentence his Honour passed is to be ignored, but the sentence of David calls for a different approach. 
     
      
    49 As with Shamouil, I shall treat this offender’s subsequent drug offence as a factor disentitling him to leniency. In other respects he has a favourable subjective case. He also enjoys support from his family and within his community, he is remorseful, and I think that his prospects of rehabilitation are good. His pleas of guilty were late and, like Shamouil, they will earn him a reduction of the overall sentence of roughly 15 per cent. In his case there are special circumstances arising from the need to foster his rehabilitation and because the sentences I pass must be cumulative upon the sentence for the drug offence. Consideration must also be given to totality.  
     
      
    50 Although the offence of common assault did not involve actual violence, I consider that it calls for a short custodial sentence. That sentence will be concurrent with the sentence I pass for the offence of accessory after the fact to murder, in the interests of totality and because the two offences are closely linked. Both sentences will commence on 1 June 2008, that is, immediately upon the expiry of the non-parole period fixed in respect of the drug offence. His period of custody thereafter is fairly referable to the present offences. 
     
      
    51 For the common assault I shall impose a sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months. For the offence of accessory after the fact, I would reduce a sentence of 3 years to 2½ years in recognition of the plea of guilty. I shall fix a non-parole period of 15 months. That will secure his release on 31 August 2009, whereupon he will be subject to the sanction of parole for a further 15 months. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
      
    52 Linard Shamouil, for the murder of Ashoor Audisho you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 14 years and 6 months, commencing on 30 July 2011 and expiring on 29 January 2026, and a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months, commencing on 30 January 2026 and expiring on 29 July 2030. You will now be eligible for release on parole on 29 January 2026. 53 Steven David, for the offence of common assault you are sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months, commencing on 1 June 2008 and expiring on 30 November 2008. For the offence of accessory after the fact to murder, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months, commencing on 1 June 2008 and expiring on 31 August 2009, and a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months, commencing on 1 September 2009 and expiring on 30 November 2010. I direct that you be released on parole on 31 August 2009.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 BUDDIN J: The accused is charged with having murdered Robert Woodger at Eastwood on 20 June 2007. This is an inquiry conducted pursuant to the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (“the Act”) for the sole purpose of determining whether the accused is fit to stand trial for that offence. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    2 I was provided with an Agreed Statement of Facts upon which I have relied heavily in order to describe in summary form the essence of the case which the Crown seeks to advance. . 
     
      
    3 About 5.45am on 20 June 2007 a Taxi Reg. No T-7309 was involved in a collision with a garbage truck in Rutledge Road, Eastwood. The taxi failed to stop. About 6.00am the taxi was located at the corner of Warrawong and Read Streets, Eastwood by the driver of another garbage truck. Police were notified and attended the scene.  
     
      
    4 The vehicle was unoccupied but had sustained damage to it. Blood smears were found in various places on the outside of the vehicle and there were blood spots on the ground outside the taxi. 5 There was a significant quantity of blood throughout the interior of the taxi including pools of blood on the floor both in the front and the rear. Blood stained clothing, a tomahawk, a knife covered in blood and two rolls of gaffer tape, one being made of a red latex type material was located inside the vehicle. A red plastic knife sheath was also located. Police observed what appeared to be knife slash damage on the driver’s seat headrest along with an amount of hair. 6 Police ascertained that the deceased, who was aged 66, had been driving the taxi. He had commenced a 12 hour shift at 1.30am on 20 June. Taxi records indicate that the deceased delivered a passenger from the City to Marsfield at 3.00am. At 3.02am the taxi picked up a passenger in Sobraon Road, Marsfield. At that point the vehicle’s GPS system stopped transmitting any further locations. 7 Police obtained CCTV footage from the taxi. It contains a number of images of a male person in the back seat between 3.17am and 3.59am. The male is wearing a baseball cap with a kangaroo motif on the front and a jacket. The lower portion of his face is uncovered. In a number of images the deceased appears to be having an animated discussion with the passenger. Police assert that the images show that the driver is the deceased and that the passenger is the accused. Police found a cap with a kangaroo emblem on the front of it in the accused’s possession when they arrested him. He was also captured on CCTV wearing the cap at Eastwood Railway Station the previous day. Those same CCTV images also reveal that the accused was wearing a red, white and blue Kangwei jacket. An item matching that description was found in the rear of the deceased’s taxi covered in blood.  8 At about 11.50 pm on 20 June cleaners at Macquarie University Library at North Ryde located four shopping bags containing clothing covered with blood. Security staff were called and found the accused hiding in the library. They said that his whole body was shaking. The accused had a number of lacerations to the fingers on both of his hands which were covered with bandaids. 9 Police attended at approximately 12.30 p.m. and inspected the bags which were observed to contain blood stained clothing and several knives. 10 A man’s brand Tissot wrist watch was also located in one of the bags. Inquiries conducted with members of the deceased’s family reveal that the deceased had worn a wrist watch fitting that description. A pair of bloodstained latex gloves were also located in the bag.  
     
      
    11 Police enquiries revealed that up until the afternoon of June 20 the accused had been residing at 54 Clanwilliam Street, Eastwood which is approximately one block from where the abandoned taxi was located. The owner of those premises rented rooms to foreign exchange students.  
     
      
    12 The accused was arrested and taken into custody. He was interviewed the following day and was also subjected to the conventional forensic procedures. At the request of the accused, police attended the Silverwater Correctional Centre on 23 June and again spoke to him. Investigators showed him a street directory which displayed the Eastwood area. The accused marked streets on the page of the street directory with a pen. He circled an area of Ball Avenue, Eastwood as being the location where investigators should concentrate their search for the body of the deceased. 13 As a result police searched the vicinity of Ball Avenue. At about 2.40pm they located the body of the deceased in an overgrown garden area adjacent to a car park in Ball Avenue. The deceased had suffered extensive lacerations and stab wounds to his head, throat and chest. The autopsy report indicates that the direct cause of death was an incised wound to the neck. In addition there were eight superficial incised injuries to the left side of the head and neck, two superficial wounds to the upper chest, incised wounds to the left thumb and tip of the middle and ring fingers. Contusions and abrasions predominantly to the forehead were also noted. 
     
      
    14 DNA testing was conducted upon various items which were covered in blood. DNA consistent with that of the deceased was located on the blade of a knife found on the back seat of the taxi. DNA consistent with that of the accused was located on the handle of the blade. The accused’s DNA was also located on blood swabs taken from the taxi and from a latex glove found at the library. DNA consistent with that of the deceased was located on a swab taken from the accused’s premises.  
     
      
      The evidence 
       
      
    15 I was provided with reports from Dr Lucas who provided a psychiatric assessment at the request of the accused’s representatives, and from Dr Skinner who provided a similar assessment on behalf of the Crown as well as a statement from the accused’s solicitor, Salina Sadiq. Suffice it to say that the evidence in this case is all one way and is to the effect that the applicant is unfit to stand trial. Nonetheless I must make my own assessment of the material, the question for determination being whether I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused is fit to be tried. In so proceeding I must of course have regard to the nature of my function as set out in s 11(2) of the Act.  
     
      
    16 The issue which I must resolve is to be determined by application of what is known as the Presser test. In R v Presser [1958] VR 45 Smith J stated the test in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        It is whether the accused because of mental defect fails to come up to certain minimum standards which he needs to equal before he can be tried without unfairness or injustice to him. He needs. . . to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceedings, namely that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all of the various court formality. He needs to be able to understand. . . the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; he needs to be able to make his defence or answer the charge. Where he has Counsel he needs to be able to do this through his Counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his Counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence but he must . . . have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his Counsel, if any. (at 48) 
        
       
      
    17 Dr Lucas interviewed the accused on 29 September 2008. In making his assessment he also had the advantage of reading the extensive clinical notes held by Justice Health in relation to the accused which indicate that he has been seen by a number of psychiatrists since he has been in custody. 
     
      
    18 The accused, who is now aged 24, grew up in China as an only child. He was apparently sent by his parents to Australia to undertake tertiary studies. To that end he enrolled at Macquarie University which he attended for three years. His academic progress was poor and it would appear that just prior to the fatal incident he was informed by the University that he was unable to continue his studies as he had not reached the required academic standard. That placed the accused in an invidious position as he had falsely informed his parents, who had remained in China and who held high expectations of him, that he had been progressing well. 
     
      
    19 Dr Lucas provided the following opinion about the accused. 
     
      
       
        
        In my opinion [the accused] is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. The history indicates psychosis had an insidious onset, certainly prior to his arrest, and was diagnosed shortly after his reception into prison. His symptoms have never been florid and remain somewhat subtle but clearly psychotic. His presentation has been influenced by the gradual onset of symptoms and almost certainly by cultural factors. In 2005 and 2006 there were indications of depressive and anxiety symptoms and deteriorating academic performance. His prognosis is guarded and treatment at a psychiatric unit is strongly indicated. 
        
       
       
        
        During his early assessments it was thought that malingering had to be excluded. In my opinion the diagnosis is now settled and simulation of psychosis can be ruled out. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [The accused] is suffering from a psychosis, paranoid schizophrenia. He remains unwell despite some improvement with treatment. He lacks insight and has been refusing contact with his treating psychiatrist. 
        
       
       
        
        Bearing in mind Presser criteria, in my opinion, [the accused] is unfit to stand trial. I understand he has been informed of the nature of legal proceedings, the role of parties and personnel involved in them. He gave a rather cursory account of his knowledge but I believe he is well able to comprehend information he has received and will undoubtedly continue to receive about his case and the nature of proceedings. He intends to plead not guilty but has been informed about the defence of mental illness. 
        
       
       
        
        I have a number of concerns which have led to the opinion that he is unfit to stand trial. He has psychotic symptoms which I believe affect his ability to instruct and to rationally comprehend and appreciate proceedings in a trial on the charge of murder. He has strong and consistent beliefs about supernatural being, also referred to as “he”, a “power” or “third person”. It is all knowing, immeasurably powerful, knows about not only [the accused] but also his legal advisors, the judge and jury, and can influence events. [The accused] also believes that this power has saved him from the likely loss of his visa and put him into the situation where he has been charged with murder, a matter which he can fight in court, something he could not do with the loss of a student visa. He believes the power will look after him and see him through.  
        
       
       
        
        Also, as described by his solicitor, he believes the power in some way has been present during conferences with her client. In a sense this power, a product of a delusional belief, will be in [the accused’s] mind an unseen party in his dealings with his legal advisors and during court proceedings. One cannot predict just how this may influence [the accused] in his instructions and decisions or how he perceives the progress of court proceedings, the actions of participants and the decisions reached. His lack of insight and delusional beliefs are likely to influence instructions regarding his plea. 
        
       
      
    20 Ms Sadiq has conducted numerous conferences with the accused. It is apparent that his delusional beliefs have prevented him from communicating meaningful instructions to his legal representatives. The following examples taken from her statement demonstrate the point: 
     
      
       
        
        During my first meeting with the accused, he told me that he could study while he was asleep. He told me that he could communicate with other people while he was asleep and that he received messages from people while he was asleep and that he could carry out their demands while he was asleep. 
        
       
       
        
        During my first meeting with the accused, he appeared to look around the room. He touched the entire wall and looked under the table. There was no person in the room other than the accused and myself. 
        
       
       
        
        In one of my early meetings with the accused, he referred to the existence of a ‘third party’. He told me that the ‘third party’ had participated in the incident with which he had been charged. He told me that he could speak or consult with the ‘third party’ before our next conference and that he would ask the ‘third party’ to join us in the conference. 
        
       
       
        
        I had my second conference with the accused on 25 August 2007. During the conference, the accused said to me: ‘The third party informed me last night that you will be coming’. He told me that the ‘third party’ had informed him that I had been sent by a ‘Que Ren’, meaning a being who guides or helps. 
        
       
       
        
        During the conference on 25 August 2007, the accused asked me to speak very softly. He told me that he was concerned that someone would hear us talking. He said: ‘This room is full of listening devices’.  
        
       
       
        
        During the conference on 25 August 2007, the accused told me that he could communicate with a ‘super-power’. He asked me not to tell anyone about this. He asked me to ‘finger-promise’ that I would not do so. We shook hands in a way common in Asian cultures, involving the hooking of the little finger of one another’s hands. He said that he would ask the ‘super-power’ to join us in our next meeting. 
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        On an occasion in about September 2007, the accused telephoned me on my mobile telephone. He told me someone was harming or intending to harm him and that the person had a very sharp object in his room. He told me that the man with whom he shared a room was dangerous. He asked me to help him. I telephoned the Department of Corrective Services immediately and spoke with a welfare officer. I told the officer what the accused had said. The welfare officer telephoned me back shortly afterwards. The officer told me that the accused did not share a cell with anyone. 
        
       
       
        
        I had another conference with the accused on 28 October 2007. During the conference, the accused asked me not to sit too close to the heater. He asked me to bring a chair closer to the heater for the ‘third’ person to sit on during our conference. I did so. 
        
       
       
        
        During the conference on 28 October 2007, the accused appeared to be smiling to someone other than myself. He appeared to be communicating with someone other than myself. There was no person in the room other than the accused and myself. … 
        
       
       
        
        During the conference on 8 December 2007, the accused again asked questions and then answered the questions himself. At one point, he said: “Wait he is talking now, let him finish and I will tell you what he said”. He appeared very attentive to something or someone not apparent to me. There was no one in the room other than the accused and myself. 
        
       
       
        
        I had another conference with the accused on 18 December 2007. The accused telephoned me before I attended the conference and told me that I must see him urgently. I did so. During the conference, the accused told me that he had to attend an exam to be held tomorrow at Macquarie University. He told me that he had been unable to sleep because he had been studying for the exam. He told me that I should attend the exam with the ‘third party’ and direct him to the correct exam hall. He told me that the ‘third party’ would help him with the exam. 
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        During the conference on 3 June 2008, I told the accused that I would be visiting him with senior counsel soon. He said the third party had already told him that he would be coming. I asked him how and when the third party communicated with him. He said: “I speak to him in my dreams, or in the yard, or in my room”. He told me he was fearful that an inmate may hear him communicating with the third party. 
        
       
       
        
        On 16 June I visited the accused with Mr Ierace SC. During the conference, the accused referred to a force. Mr Ierace asked him: ‘Is there some kind of force?’ The accused said: ‘Yes, he will help me in the hearing’. 
        
       
      
    21 Dr Skinner examined the accused on 13 November 2008. Her observations and findings are consistent with the views expressed by Dr Lucas. 
     
      
    22 Her conclusions and opinions are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        [The accused] is suffering from a severe mental illness, probably chronic schizophrenia, characterized by delusional beliefs. He denies auditory hallucinations, but appears to have had some other perceptual disturbances, as he described olfactory hallucinations, altered bodily sensations and strange feelings accompanied by sensation of fear. 
        
       
       
        
        From his description of circumstances surrounding the event and after reading his first interview and the statement of his solicitor, I think that he was suffering from delusional beliefs that affected his capacity to reason around the time of the alleged offences. 
        
       
       
        
        I do not think that [the accused] is fit to plead and to stand trial. He is intelligent and has a good understanding of the court proceedings and in general terms, of the legal process. He is capable of reading and understanding the evidence. His English is fluent and his English comprehension is good. However, he continues to hold delusional beliefs that would affect his interpretation and understanding of the evidence presented in court. 
        
       
       
        
        He might have unrealistic expectations of his legal team (“the involvement of the QC was arranged by the super being”). He does not accept that he is suffering from a mental illness or that he has suffered from any mental illness in the past and therefore it is unlikely that he will accept the defence of mental illness. He probably holds delusional beliefs in relation to his defence. Thus he would not be able to assist his counsel to prepare a defence to the charge. 
        
       
       
        
        He requires ongoing psychiatric treatment with anti-psychotic medication and should remain under psychiatric treatment for the foreseeable future. 
        
       
      
    23 Having regard to the state of the evidence, I am satisfied that on the balance of probabilities the accused is unfit to be tried. The delusional beliefs observed by the two very experienced forensic psychiatrists who examined him restrict his understanding of the trial process and limit his capacity to communicate his instructions to his legal representatives. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    24 1 The accused Xinfei Gu is unfit to be tried for the offence of murder of Robert Woodger at Eastwood on 20 June 2007. 
     
      
       
      2 In accordance with s14 of the  
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 
       I refer the accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 
       
       
      3 I remand the accused in custody pending the determination of the Tribunal pursuant to s16 of the Act.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    2 KIRBY J: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    3 HALL J: By application for leave to appeal dated 5 August 2008 and filed on 6 August 2008, the applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him by the District Court on 18 May 2007. On that date, he was sentenced for two counts of maliciously damaging property by fire committed respectively on 10 August 1998 and 7 October 1999. The offences were contrary to the provisions of s.195(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    4 The maximum penalty for an offence under that section at the relevant time was 10 years’ imprisonment. The applicant sought to have a further offence under s.195(b) taken into account on a Form 1. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was sentenced as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) On Count 1, a non-parole period of 12 months to commence on 24 February 2005 and to expire on 23 February 2006 with a total term of three years to commence on 24 February 2005 and to expire on 23 February 2008. 
       
       
      (2) On Count 2, taking into account the matter on the Form 1, a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on 24 February 2006 and to expire on 23 August 2007 with a total term of four years to commence on 24 February 2006 and to expire on 23 February 2010. 
       
      
    6 The total effective sentence was, accordingly, a term of imprisonment of five years with an effective non-parole period of two and a half years. 
     
      
    7 The applicant relied upon one ground of appeal in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentences imposed upon the applicant are such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance when considered against the sentences imposed upon the applicant’s co-offender and father, Anthony Coleman.” 
        
       
      
    8 The applicant was almost 19 years of age at the time of the offence committed on 10 August 1998 and was 20 years of age at the time of the offence committed on 7 October 1999. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    9 An agreed statement of facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. The Crown set out a summary of the facts based upon the agreed statement of facts in its written submissions in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Count 1: 
         In the early hours of the morning of 10 August 1998, the Applicant’s father set alight the warehouse belonging to a company trading as Matrix Essentials Australia at Zetland. The building stock and operating equipment were destroyed. The loss was estimated at $4.35 million. The Applicant assisted his father by driving him to the premises (they were living on the Central Coast at the time) and by helping him to get up onto the roof. His father had offered $500 for driving him there, but the Applicant claimed not to have received any payment. The Applicant played no part in the planning or organisation of the offence, which involved other co-offenders (ROS 3-6). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: 
         In the early hours of the morning of 7 October 1999, an explosion and fire occurred at the premises of Laxales Hair and Beauty Supplies Pty Limited at Seven Hills. The loss of stock and profit was estimated at $262,000 and damage to the building was approximately $65,000. Again the Applicant’s father was responsible for setting alight the premises. The Applicant’s role was limited to that of a look out. 
        
       
       
        
        Form 1: 
         On the night prior to the offence in Count 2, a smaller fire was lit by the Applicant’s father in a garage at the Laxales premises, causing the loss of stock limited to that contained in the garage. The estimated loss was $49,000. Again the Applicant’s role was limited to that of a look out.” 
        
       
      
    10 In the Written Outline of Submissions for the Applicant, the facts are set out in detail (paragraphs 7 to 17 of those submissions). In paragraph 15, it is noted that police spoke to the applicant on 22 December 2004 and he made admissions stating that he had been helping his father out by driving him to the fires. He was later interviewed by way of ERISP interview and made admissions in relation to the offences. 
     
      
    11 In relation to the “Matrix” offence (Count 1), it is noted that the applicant admitted assisting his father with scaffolding to gain access to the roof of the premises. In the submissions it is noted (paragraph 16) that it was an agreed fact that the applicant played no part in the planning or organisation of the offence. He had been offered the payment of $500 in exchange for driving his father to the scene, which it is stated he never received. 
     
      
    12 In relation to the “Laxales” offences (Count 2 and Form 1), the applicant also made specific admissions when interviewed. It was agreed that his role with respect to those matters was that of a “look out”. 
     
      
       
      Ground of appeal 
       
      
    13 The applicant’s father was sentenced in the District Court. His Honour Judge Hulme SC sentenced him at Parramatta on 21 September 2007. The applicant’s father had earlier pleaded guilty before Her Honour Judge Morgan on 20 February 2007 to a number of offences including the following:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Count 1: 
         For that he on 10 August 1998 at Zetland in the State of New South Wales maliciously damaged property by fire namely the premises of Salon Management Services trading as Matrix Essentials Australia located at 3/5 15 Epsom Road. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: 
         For that he on 11 Jun 1999 at Auburn in the State of New South Wales maliciously damaged property by fire namely the premises at Hairtech Australia Pty Limited located at 86A Adderley Street. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: 
         For that he on 7 October 1999 at Seven Hills in the State of New South Wales maliciously damaged property by fire namely the premises of Laxales Hair and Beauty Suppliers Pty Limited located at Boomerang Place. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4: 
         For that he between 22nd January and 25 January 2000 at Wamberal in the State of New South Wales maliciously damaged property by fire namely the premises of Philip Kennedy and Margaret Kennedy located at 3/99 Ocean View Drive.” 
        
       
      
    14 The applicant’s father was sentenced as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Count 1: 
         a non-parole period of two and a half (2½) years commencing on 20 December 2004, and a total term of four and a half (4½) years. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2:  
        a non-parole period of two and a half (2½) years commencing on 20 June 2005, and a total term of four and a half (4½) years. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: 
         a non-parole period of two (2) years commencing on 20 December 2005 and a total term of four (4) years. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4: 
         a non-parole period of two (2) years commencing on 20 June2006 and a total term of four (4) years. 
        
       
       
        
        The overall effective sentence for the applicant’s father was one consisting of an effective non-parole period of three and a half (3½) years and a total effective term of five and a half (5½) years.” 
        
       
      
    15 It is noted in the written submissions for the applicant that Counts 1 and 2 for which the applicant was dealt with were the same matters as are referred to in Counts 1 and 3 with respect to his father. 
     
      
    16 The applicant’s father, accordingly, had a further two counts on the indictment that were not common to the applicant.  
     
      
    17 The applicant, as previously noted, had taken into account on a Form 1, a matter which was not common to the counts for which his father pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    18 In the written submissions for the applicant it was contended:- 
     
      
       
        
        “26. When considering the matters common to both the applicant’s father and the applicant (allowing for the fact that the applicant had a further matter on a Form 1 taken into account) the notional overall effective sentence for the applicant’s father with respect to these matters is one consisting of an  
        [sic]  
        notional effective non-parole period of three (3) years and a notional effective total term of five (5) years. 
        
       
       
        
        27. The difference between the applicant and the applicant’s father when this comparison is made is therefore is  
        [sic]  
        one of only six months as to non-parole period.” 
        
       
      
    19 In the Crown’s submissions, the sentences in respect of the applicant and his father in respect of Counts 1 and 2 are set out in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “12. The sentences imposed were: 
        
       
      
     Applicant Applicant’s father 
     
      
      Count 1: 12 mths NPP/ 3 yr term 2½ yr NPP/ 4½ yr term 
      
     [count 1] 
     
      
      Count 2: 18 mths NPP/ 4 yr term 2 yr NPP/ 4 yr term 
       
       [including Form 1 offence] [count 3]” 
       
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    20 In the Outline of Submissions for the Applicant, a number of objective and subjective matters relating to the applicant and the applicant’s father are set out (paragraphs 28 to 51). 
     
      
    21 In the Crown’s written submissions, it is observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “13. The Applicant argues at QWS [23]-[53] that by reference to Anthony Coleman’s breach of conditional liberty, his more extensive criminal record and the Applicant’s clear record, the Applicant’s difficulties with drug addiction and mental health issues, the more senior role of the Applicant’s father in the offending and lack of any distinguishing features between them as to the timing of their pleas, remorse, rehabilitative prospects and a common finding of special circumstances, that the Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in respect of his father’s sentence when a comparison is made of the sentences in common for which they were sentenced. The Applicant points at QWS [5] and [26] to his effective sentence of 5 years with a 2½ year non-parole period compared to his father’s effective sentence  
        on the two matters in common 
         of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. Therefore, the Applicant argues, there should have been a greater difference between the sentences than the 6 month difference in their effective non-parole periods. 
        
       
       
        
        14. There are difficulties with this argument.” 
        
       
      
    22 It is correct to say, as has been submitted on behalf of the applicant, that the objective criminality of the applicant’s father was of a higher order given the father’s lead role in the commission of the offences and the remuneration received by him for his efforts, in particular, in respect of Count 1. Additionally, the fact that the father was on various forms of conditional liberty at the time of the commission of the offences for which he was sentenced is an important matter to be taken into account. Additionally, the applicant’s father’s criminal history distinguished him from the applicant who was treated as not having had a criminal record as at the time of sentence. 
     
      
    23 The matters concerning the applicant’s earlier history of drug taking and his psychological assessment recorded in the report of Mr John Taylor, forensic psychologist, dated 17 April 2007 (Exhibit 1) are matters that also distinguish his position from that of his father. 
     
      
    24 It is relevant to observe in relation to the particular ground of appeal relied upon that this is not a case of true parity in the offences for which the applicant was sentenced and the offences for which his father was sentenced. The father had two more substantive offences than the applicant and the applicant had a matter on the Form 1. 
     
      
    25 An important aspect to be taken into account is that the sentencing outcome in respect of the applicant’s father was the result of the application of the principle of totality with the sentences in respect of the four offences each being accumulated by six month periods. Accordingly, it is necessary to consider the total effective non-parole period and the total effective sentence imposed in respect of the applicant’s father in that context. 
     
      
    26 In the course of his remarks on sentence in respect of the applicant’s father, Hulme DCJ, in his remarks on sentence dated 21 September 2007, referred at some length to the factors taken into account in the sentencing exercise in relation to the applicant (ie, Tony Keith Coleman): see remarks on sentence, pp.12 to 13. 
     
      
    27 At the conclusion of his remarks on sentence, Hulme DCJ observed (at 14):- 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to the different roles played by the co-offenders, the differences in offences for which they were dealt with, and the differences in personal circumstances, no question of direct parity arises. However, it is important that I have regard to those sentences so as to ensure that the sentences to be imposed upon the present offender retain an appropriate proportionality. In terms of the respective roles played, it is clear that the present offender played a more significant role than his son, Tony Keith Coleman, but he was subordinate to that of Awit and Zakhem.” 
        
       
      
    28 It is also to be observed that his Honour did, in fact, sentence the applicant’s father to longer sentences on each of the two counts in common (being Counts 1 and 3 in relation to the applicant’s father). In respect of Count 1, the applicant’s father received a total term of four and a half years with a non-parole period of two and a half years. In respect of Count 3, he received a term of four years with a non-parole period of two years. 
     
      
    29 I consider that, in the circumstances, the Court should accept the submission made on behalf of the Crown to the effect that “the difference in approach occasioned by the principle of totality in each case invalidates the direct comparison in overall sentence length suggested by the applicant” (Crown’s written submissions, paragraph 18). 
     
      
    30 I do not consider that the ground of appeal relied upon has been made out. Even if it could be said that there was a valid basis of complaint in respect of the overall sentencing outcomes in the two cases (and I do not consider that there is such a basis), it is necessary to bear in mind the seriousness of the offences and, in particular, that involved in Count 1. The sentencing judge, in relation to the applicant, observed :- 
     
      
       
        
        “These are, of course, extremely serious matters and the extent of the damage or loss which was occasioned was enormous, particularly on Count 1 …”  
        (Remarks on sentence, 18 May 2007, at p.12) 
        
       
      
    31 Any lesser sentences than that imposed in this case would, in my opinion, fail to properly give effect to the aspects of specific and general deterrence. It was necessary that the objective criminality of the offences be reflected in both the head sentence and the non-parole period. 
     
      
    32 I consider that the observations of Wood CJ at CL in Regina v Kollas & Mitchell [2002] NSWCCA 491 at [45] are relevant to the present case:- 
     
      
       
        
        “45. The parity principle of sentencing established in  
        Lowe v The Queen 
         (1985) 154 CLR 606 and in  
        Postiglione v The Queen 
         (1997) 189 CLR 295 requires, as a condition precedent to appellate intervention, that there should be a marked disparity between the sentences imposed on co-offenders of a degree or kind which gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. A sentence which offends that principle should be reduced. That may occur notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate, or within the permissible range of sentencing options (per Mason J in  
        Lowe 
         at 612 and per Dawson and Gaudron JJ in  
        Postiglione 
         at 301) and  
        R v Anderson 
         NSWCCA 25 March 1993 per Justice Hunt, Chief Judge at Common Law at p.4. The Court, however, still retains a discretion to intervene in those circumstances, if to do so would be to produce a sentence which was totally inappropriate to reflect the objective criminality involved. 
        
       
       
        
        46. In determining whether the parity principle has been observed, as the judgments of Gibbs CJ (at 610) and of Mason J (at 613) in  
        Lowe  
        and of Dawson and Gaudron JJ (at 301), and of Kirby J (at 338) in  
        Postiglione 
         show the different circumstances of co-offenders, including the part which each played in the offence, as well as their subjective circumstances such as age, background, previous criminal history, remorse, rehabilitation prospects and the like, must be considered. 
        
       
       
        
        47. That follows from the circumstance, as Dawson and Gaudron JJ confirmed in  
        Postiglione 
         (at 301) that the parity principle is ‘an aspect of equal justice’. Equal justice requires, as their Honours pointed out, that ‘like should be treated alike, but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them’. 
        
       
       
        
        48. The principle is enlivened only where the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or to the appearance of justice not having been done. As Kirby J pointed out in  
        Postiglione 
         (at 337):- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ‘So long as the sentencing Judge has taken into account the relevant considerations of law and fact, the appellant court will not ordinarily intervene merely because some arguable discrepancy appears between the sentencing of otherwise apparently connected or like offenders.’ 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        49. This is associated with the principle of appellate restraint, and with the circumstance that sentencing can never be reduced to a precise mathematical exercise, or to one involving analytical certainty. Room must be left for discretion, and for an individual assessment of the facts by the sentencing Judge who has the benefit of seeing and hearing the evidence first hand. 
        
       
       
        
        50. The test for determining the existence of a sense of grievance is objective. That is, a person complaining of disparity must show that a reasonable person, looking at the circumstances of the case, would regard the offender’s grievance as justified:  
        R v Ilbay 
         [2000] NSWCCA 251 per Grove J (at par 6).” 
        
       
      
    33 I confirm that even if the grounds of appeal had been established the gravity and repeated nature of the offences would have indicated that no lesser sentences were warranted in law: Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s.6(3). 
     
      
    34 I consider that the appropriate orders are as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      (2) The appeal be dismissed.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL 2006/7227 GROVE J BLANCH J KIRBY J Wednesday 11 February 2009 
     
     PMW v Regina 
      
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1 GROVE J: We are in a position to give judgment in this matter and Justice Blanch will give that judgment.2 BLANCH J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed at Dubbo District Court on 15 November 2006. The applicant entered a plea of guilty to a charge of robbery in company with wounding contrary to s98 of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty is twenty-five years imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of seven years. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of three years and six months with a balance of term of three years and six months. The non-parole period commenced on 8 June 2006, the day the applicant went into custody.3 The offence occurred at Dubbo on Sunday 24 April 2005. The victim, who was sixty-three years of age, was the driver of a pizza delivery van and he was delivering a pizza at 7.45 pm which had been ordered for 15 Collins Avenue. When the victim got out of his vehicle to get the pizzas, the applicant came up and said to him “Come on give us your money, we want your money.” The victim said he had no money and the applicant struck the victim with a metal bar. His co-offender then stabbed the victim in the leg with a knife. As the victim was trying to get back into his vehicle, the applicant ran around the car and took the victim’s mobile phone from the vehicle and ran away. Witnesses had noted that the house where the pizza van was to make the delivery was empty and was in darkness and the occupier was away from the house. The witness had seen two young men sitting in front of that address up to the time of the incident. The applicant made no admission to telephoning for the pizza.4 A victim impact statement was tendered. The victim suffered grazing and bruising to the left side of his jaw and required surgery to his right thigh involving the repair of three severed arteries. The victim impact statement indicated he has suffered from depression and anxiety arising from the incident.5 The applicant was born on 9 March 1989 and at the time of the offence he was sixteen years of age and was still only seventeen when he was sentenced. The sentencing Judge recommended he serve the sentence in a Juvenile Justice institution but he did not make a direction to that effect under s19(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act.6 The applicant had a prior criminal history in the Children’s Court. In 2006 for offences of break, enter and steal and driving he was given a control order for nine months with a six month non-parole period and a bond to be of good behaviour for twelve months. Later in July 2006 he was given a control order for twelve months with a non-parole period of six months in relation to assaulting an officer in the execution of duty and break, enter and steal and he was given one control order consisting of a non-parole period of six months to expire on 7 December 2006 and another control order with a non-parole period to expire on 26 January 2007. He was arrested on the instant offence on 8 March 2006 and granted bail until sentenced on 15 November 2006. The judge noted he had been in custody since 8 June and backdated the sentence to that date.7 The applicant comes from an Aboriginal background. His parents separated when he was young and he has lived with his grandmother since the age of four. He left school during year seven and the Juvenile Justice report tendered before the Judge indicated that his record of supervision was poor. It also said he had been experiencing mental health problems with regard to depression and psychotic symptoms in the form of auditory hallucinations. Unfortunately, no psychiatric report was tendered before the sentencing judge and this has been explained by the fact that the Aboriginal Legal Service was unable to fund the preparation of such a report.8 The first ground of appeal argued is that there is a disparity with the sentence of the co-offender such as to leave the applicant with a legitimate sense of grievance. The co-offender DD was born on 6 October 1988 and was thus six months older that the applicant. He was sentenced on 29 March 2007 by the same judge to a non-parole period of three years and two months with a balance of term of three years and two months. Accordingly, the total sentence he received was eight months less than the applicant and the non-parole period was four months less.9 The co-offender also had a criminal record in the Children’s Court which was more serious than that of the applicant because it included a control order for robbery in 2006 in addition to other convictions.10 The sentencing judge was aware of the problem of avoiding a disparity in sentence when sentencing the co-offender. His sentence of the co-offender appears to have been strongly motivated by a desire to a fix a non-parole period which expired before he turned twenty-one which at that time guaranteed he would serve the full term of the non-parole period in a Juvenile Justice institution. The non-parole period he imposed expired just before the co-offender turned twenty one.11 When comparing the situation of the applicant with that of the co-offender, it is significant that the applicant was six months younger, that he made full admissions on his arrest and nominated his co-offender and offered to give evidenced and expressed remorse whereas the co-offender at first denied involvement. The applicant entered a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity whereas the co-offender did not enter his plea until after committal for trial in the District Court. It should also be noted that it was the co-offender who stabbed the victim in the thigh which constitutes the wounding in this case. I find it difficult to distinguish between the roles of the two offenders in the incident and there does not seem to me to be any justification for treating the co-offender more leniently. I note also in the case of the co-offender there was a direction given that he served his sentence in a juvenile institution. As to such a direction, s 28 of the Children (Detention Centres) Act 1987 was amended in July 2008 to allow the Director General of the Department of Juvenile Services to override such a direction where the detainee is or above the age of sixteen.12 It is also argued that the penalty is manifestly excessive. However, in a case such as this where the standard non-parole period is seven years and where the sentencing Judge correctly categories the offences as falling into the upper level of seriousness, I do not believe that a sentence involving a total period of seven years with a non-parole period of three and a half years could be described as excessive. The victim was a vulnerable person which was appropriately considered as an aggravating factor. In my view, the sentence imposed is well within the range of sentence appropriate for the offence, even for a juvenile convicted of such an offence.13 I do believe there is merit in the parity argument put forward by the applicant and the submission that what should have occurred was a direction that the sentence be served in a juvenile institution because that is the form of the order provided for in the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. That conclusion requires this court to re-sentence and in respect of that exercise, the Court has received a psychiatric report from Dr Kasinathan dated 18 October 2008. He has diagnosed the applicant as probably suffering from schizophrenia at the time of the offence. It is pointed out that he experienced auditory hallucinations and paranoia from the age of twelve and has demonstrated consistent psychotic symptoms from the start of his custodial term. While in custody he has required intensive psychiatric treatment. On the other hand, when giving account of the offence to the psychiatrist he “...insisted that he did not hear any voices at that time. He also denied feeling paranoid in relation to the victim of the index offences. Master W said that he hit the pizza delivery man (the victim) with a ‘skinny metal bar’ because ‘I needed money to get drugs and grog’”.14 The sentencing judge was aware that the applicant had experience mental health problems and that he had been on anti-psychotic medication. In my view, the psychiatric report does not justify a more lenient sentence than that given to the co-offender.15 In order to correct the disparity in sentence and to give effect to those factors which favour the applicant over the co-offender, particularly the plea at first instance, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. I grant leave to appeal. 
      
     
     
      
      2. I allow the appeal. 
      
     
     
      
      3. I quash the sentence given in the District Court and instead sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of two years and nine months to date from 8 June 2006 and a balance of term of two years nine months. I would direct the sentence be served in a Juvenile Justice institution and he will be eligible for parole on 7 March 2009 
      
    16 GROVE J: I agree.17 KIRBY: I also agree.18 GROVE J: The orders of the Court, therefore, are as proposed by Justice Blanch.

    2 To each of these charges the accused pleaded not guilty.3 The accused asked that he not be presented for trial upon one indictment, but that there be separate trials for the offences alleged by the different complainants. On 5 February 2008 the accused filed a notice of motion seeking orders in the following terms: 
     
      
      “ 
      1. Pursuant to section 21  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
       1986 that the court should quash the present indictment and order separate trials in relation to those counts particularising a different complainant. 
       
      2. Leave be granted for short service on the Respondent to this motion. 
       
      3. Any other orders deemed appropriate. 
      ” 
      
    4 The accused also opposed the application by the Crown in the cases to be presented in respect of each complainant, to adduce as coincidence evidence, evidence of the facts and circumstances of the offences alleged by the other two complainants.Non-Publication Orders5 Non-publication orders were made in respect of the names of the complainants and the accused, later extended to the evidence and submissions made and to be made upon these applications, to be revisited once I had reached my decision. This was a precaution against the risk of prejudice to the proceedings should there be separate trials, and to protect the privacy of the complainants. At the time there were a number of journalists in the public gallery taking notes.6 On 11 February 2009 I lifted the non-publication orders made in respect of the name of the accused and the evidence, but those made in respect of the names of the complainants and information that might enable their identification remain.The Proceedings7 After the parties outlined the contest to be resolved before a jury was empanelled, and they had tendered the documents upon which they intended to rely, I adjourned the proceedings to the following day to allow me the opportunity to read the material.8 On 10 February 2009 I resumed the hearing and heard the parties’ submissions, in the course of which each tendered further statements to be included in Exhibits 1 and 2 on the voir dire. I reserved, intending to inform counsel of my decisions that afternoon and publish my judgment on 11 February 2009. The parties were informed by email of the decision I had reached during the afternoon of 10 February 2009 to facilitate their preparation of the matter the following day. Upon resumption of the matter on 11 February 2009 I announced my orders, with my reasons to be published. Copies of the orders, bearing my signature were distributed to the parties and a copy placed on file. My orders were, 
     
      
      1. The application for separate trials is refused. 
       
       
      2. In respect of each of the charges particularising an offence against M M, the Crown is given leave to adduce as coincidence evidence the evidence of the facts and circumstances alleged in respect of the offences against L McP and C-A B. 
       
       
      3. In respect of each of the charges particularising an offence against L McP, the Crown is given leave to adduce as coincidence evidence the evidence of the facts and circumstances alleged in respect of the offences against M M and C-A B. 
       
       
      4. In respect of each of the charges a particularising an offence against C-A B, the Crown is given leave to adduce as coincidence evidence the evidence of the facts and circumstances alleged in respect of the offences against M M and L McP. 
      
    9 The parties then sought further time to refine the issues and to negotiate agreement upon those facts that would not be contested to gain efficiency in the presentation of the trial. The matter was adjourned until later that afternoon when further time was sought to continue those negotiations. The trial was adjourned to commence at 10:00 am on 12 February 2009. When court resumed that day I was informed that the accused had instructed his counsel that he would plead guilty to offences charged in a fresh indictment, but some further time was sought to allow the preparation of that document and to allow the parties to settle an agreed statement of facts upon which the accused was to be sentenced.10 The accused was thereafter presented on a fresh indictment charging six offences. He pleaded guilty to all charges upon arraignment, and he was formally convicted of each offence. The Crown tendered an agreed statement of facts, marked Exhibit A in the proceedings on sentence, and the hearing was adjourned to resume on 23 April 2009. Later in the day the parties asked the court to reassemble when it was learned that this date was not suitable; the hearing was reappointed to 28 May 2009 in the District Court, Sydney.11 My decisions not to grant separate trials and to allow the Crown to adduce coincidence evidence were upon the evidence tendered on the voir dire. My reasons are therefore prepared upon that material, including the indictment upon which the accused was arraigned before me on the first occasion charging him with the 10 offences set out earlier in this document.The Evidence12 The Crown tendered a bundle of documents, which together were marked Exhibit 1 on the voir dire. Counsel for the accused read an affidavit filed in support of the notice of motion for separate trials, sworn by the accused’s solicitor on 3 February 2009, and tendered a statement from an officer of the Ministry of Transport. This statement was marked Exhibit 2 on the voir dire.13 In the course of submissions the Crown tendered a further statement from “Mark”, M M’s boyfriend. This was added to Exhibit 1.14 Counsel for the accused tendered further material, which was added to Exhibit 2. These were a certificate pursuant to section 177, Evidence Act 1995 by Dr Joshua Florida, dated 10 April 2008, pages 1 and 2 of a certificate pursuant to section 177, Evidence Act 1995 by David Bruce, date of preparation unknown, and a statement by Detective Senior Sergeant Evin Bouris dated 25 July 2008.15 Both parties provided written submissions and spoke to them.The Issues In The Trial16 Counsel for the accused made some preliminary submissions acknowledging that the issue in the trial would be consent. The accused’s case was to be that any sexual conduct between the accused and the complainants was entirely consensual.17 In relation to the offences in the first two counts on indictment, alleged to have taken place in 2003, the accused intended also to rely upon the fact that he was not a licensed taxi driver during that time, thereby challenging that proposition represented or implied in the evidence anticipated from the complainant M M. It was to be alleged that the accused and M M met during the evening and went to a hotel room for consensual sex, after which they returned to the hotel where they met and from there went on their separate ways. It was the accused’s case that if there was a sexual assault of her by a taxi driver, it was someone other than this accused.The Crown Case18 There are three discrete episodes of misconduct, which the Crown alleges against the accused.19 The first event upon which counts one and two are charged is said to have occurred on 18 July 2003 when the accused, then in charge of a taxicab in the early hours of the morning, had anal sexual intercourse and then vaginal sexual intercourse without the consent of M M. The second event upon which counts 3, 4, 5, and 6 are charged is said to have occurred on 16 December 2006 whilst the accused was engaged as a taxicab driver in the early hours of the morning, when he indecently assaulted L McP by touching her vagina, had anal intercourse and vaginal intercourse, and then committed an act of indecency towards her by masturbating. The third event upon which counts 7, 8, 9, and 10 are charged is said to have occurred during the evening on the 1 June 2007 when the accused, engaged as a taxicab driver, indecently assaulted C-A B by touching her crotch, forced his penis into her mouth, and had vaginal intercourse with her twice.20 There is no evidence of any association between the complainants, other than that each was the subject of sexual assaults by the accused as alleged by the Crown.21 The evidence implicating the accused in these sexual encounters is compelling. Upon making their complaints, each of the women was examined and their bodies swabbed from which DNA with a profile matching that of the accused was identified, expected to occur in fewer than one in 10 billion individuals in the general population.The Offences Alleged By M M22 The Crown anticipated that M M would give evidence that during the evening of 17 July 2003 she consumed three bottles of wine with friends. After 11:30 pm she and one of her friends went to a club in Kings Cross where they continued drinking from about 12:30 am on 18 July 2003. She said that she became extremely intoxicated, and as a consequence was unable to remember much of what occurred after leaving the club.23 She could not remember leaving the club or getting into a taxi. She described in her statement what she was told by her friend about her departure, and what she was told by her boyfriend of telephone conversations with him. She recalled that at some point she was sitting in the rear seat of a taxi behind the driver. There was no other passenger. She remembered speaking to the taxi driver but not the subject of their conversation. She said that she kept falling in and out of consciousness because of her intoxication.24 Her next memory is of the taxi driver having opened the nearside rear door. Her initial thought was that they had arrived at her house and he was attempting to extract her from the vehicle, but he crawled into the rear seat, unzipped his fly, and said, ""You want this, I know you want it."" He repeated, ""You want this."" He forced himself on top of her. She struggled, but was limited by her intoxication. He pulled her pants and underwear down to her knees and forced her legs into the air so that her legs were over his shoulders or back. She described her position as being crouched back into the corner of the vehicle. He began to move back and forth in a thrusting motion, and inserted his penis into her anus. She continued to say, ""Stop it, stop it, I don't do that."" He then penetrated her vagina.25 She did not see his penis, and could not say whether he wore a condom. The high vaginal swab taken when she was examined revealed semen from which DNA matching the accused’s profile was identified. This is consistent with the accused having not worn a condom, and is evidence from which one might infer that he did not do so. The Crown conceded the possibility that if he did wear a condom it might have ruptured, leaving a deposit of semen, however, the description of the event given by the complainant makes no reference to him having applied a condom or behaved in such a way that would indicate that he did so. In my opinion there is available upon the balance of probabilities the inference that he was not wearing a condom.26 The complainant’s next memory is of speaking to her boyfriend to whom she complained, and then of an ambulance arriving at the vicinity of the post office on Glebe Point Road from whence she was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.27 Mark was the complainant's boyfriend. His statement has been included in Exhibit 1 on the voir dire. He described a phone call from the complainant about 2:30 am. He was at the time in Canberra on business. He described her as upset and disoriented. She said that she had lost contact with her friend with whom she had gone for dinner and drinks. She told him that she did not know where she was. He told her to look for a taxi but to stay on the telephone until she had attracted one. When she did so, she had difficulty giving the driver instructions because of her intoxication, and Mark told her to put him on the telephone so that he could provide the address. Mark’s statement represents that he spoke to the driver, gave him the address, and asked him to make sure that she got home safely. The driver replied, ""No problem. I will look after her.""28 By 3:30 am Mark had not heard from the complainant, notwithstanding that she had promised to call when she arrived home safely. He attempted to call her and was unsuccessful at first, but she answered about five minutes later. She made her complaint in the following terms, ""I think he's done something to me."" When asked who did something to her she said, ""The taxi driver."" After some further conversation she became hysterical and incomprehensible and terminated the call. He called her again but she was unresponsive, was unaware of the location, and complained of bleeding. An ambulance arrived and took her to hospital.29 She described the taxi driver as solid, with dark hair, which was sort of bushy and wavy, and he appeared to be about 30 years of age. He had a Mediterranean complexion. He was wearing dark pants.The Offences Alleged By L McP30 The Crown anticipated that L McP would give evidence that on 15 December 2006 she travelled to Sydney by train where she met a friend about 5:00 pm. At about 6:30 pm she went to a bar in Sussex Street, Sydney where she remained with friends until 9:30 pm. She was drinking, but was not then very affected by alcohol and was in control of her conduct, her speech, and had a good memory of the events occurring at that time.31 With her friend she travelled by taxi to Kings Cross where they were involved in an unrelated incident for which they attended Kings Cross police station. They left there about 12:30 am on 16 December 2006 and went to a nightclub. There she continued drinking with her friends. There was a point reached when her memory of events diminishes, but she recalls feeling sick inside the club. She told her friend, who said that she also felt sick, and they both went outside. She did not remember picking up her bag before doing so. They crossed the street and were sitting on steps until she vomited in a nearby garden. Her next memory is of being in a taxi. She was talking to the driver and the vehicle was moving. The driver referred to the fact that she’d had a baby and said, ""It doesn't look like it, you’re so hot.""32 She was seated in the front passenger seat; he placed his left hand beneath her skirt and between her legs. She thinks that she moved her leg, and said that normally she would have done more and does not know why she did not. After a time he stopped the taxi at a grassed area near a crate, coloured orange brown and made of corrugated iron. She said it was about the size of a house. There were other cars parked to the left of the taxi about 7 metres away. She saw no other people around. She alighted from the taxi, and the driver came around and took her by the left arm. He led her to the back of the crate and held her against it by the wrists. He began to kiss her and placed his hand beneath her skirt and, “… fingered my vagina."" She pushed his hand away and told him no, to which he said a few times, ""C’mon baby, you're making me so horny."" She told him that she had to find her friend and he said, ""I'll take you back there soon, this won't take long."" He also repeated words to the effect of, ""You're making me so hot."" He took her by the waist and pulled down her pants and raised her skirt. He bent her over so that she was facing the crate and penetrated her anus with his penis. She moved forward and pushed him back and told him to stop, but he laughed. She stood and tried to pull her pants back up but he pulled them down again and penetrated her anus once again. She said no and moved away again and walked back to the taxi. He ran to her and repeated, ""C’mon baby, C’mon baby."" He began to rub his hands “in” her vagina and said, ""You’re so wet you’re making me horny."" She was at that point standing with her back to the crate. He penetrated her vagina with his penis quickly. He did not use a condom. He said, ""Just let me finish, I'm so close."" He masturbated. He offered her $20, which she declined, and then offered her $50, which she also declined.33 Her next memory is walking back into the club at Kings Cross. She complained to her friends and was taken to the police station at Kings Cross from whence she was taken to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and examined.34 She described the taxi driver as aged in his early thirties, of Greek appearance, with an olive complexion, wearing a uniform of dark blue shorts and a pale blue short sleeve shirt, with black shoes and white socks. There were dark blue tags on his shoulders. His hair was black and short in length; about 3 cm. She described him as chubby, but not obese, although with a large stomach.The Offences Alleged by C-A B35 The Crown anticipated that C-A B would give evidence of her employment as a sex worker, in the course of which she provided massages and hand relief to her clients. She states that she did not provide other sexual services. She was employed on a casual basis at premises in Padstow. On either 15 May 2007 or 22 May 2007, she started work about 10:30 am or 10:45 am. Between 12:00 pm midday and 1:30 pm she serviced a client who introduced himself as Mohammed. He asked her for her telephone number, which she gave him. This was not unusual, and allowed her clients to make enquiries to see whether she was working when they next wanted to have her services.36 About 2:30 pm on 1 June 2007 she agreed with her sister to go to a football match with their children, arriving there about 6:30 pm or 7:00 pm. About 10 minutes before half time she received a telephone call on her mobile phone from a man representing himself as Mohammed. She arranged to meet with him outside of the grounds.37 About 8:23 pm he called to say that he was waiting out the front. There she saw a taxi, which she presumed Mohammed occupied. She opened the door and asked the driver whether he was Mohammed but he did not reply. He was speaking on the telephone. Because of traffic she entered the taxi, and realised that it was not Mohammed. She asked the driver who he was. He first claimed to be Mohammed, but then said that he was a friend of Mohammed, and thereafter represented that Mohammed was coming to join them. The complainant told him to pull over because she did not know him and wanted to leave the vehicle. He said that he would, but continued driving instead. He said into the telephone, ""She is beautiful, she's hot."" He used his left hand to grab at her shorts and placed it on her crotch. She asked him what he was doing, and he said, ""She's fucking beautiful man."" He reached over and touched her again and attempted to insert his hand inside pants.38 She reached across and took hold of his penis, held it tight, and told him to pull up and stop what he was doing. Whilst speaking on the telephone he asked her to show him what was beneath her shirt. She did so, so that he would leave her alone. He asked her how much it would cost for her to fellate him and she refused, telling him that she didn't do that. She told him then in what she described as a joking manner that it would cost $100, but said that she would not do it anyway.39 By that time they were in an industrial area. The driver turned off the engine. The complainant alighted from the vehicle, and told him to take her back to the football ground. He said that his friend was coming. She again told him that she wanted to return to the football ground, but he asked her to come and sit down on the grass nearby. She complied, through fear she said. He took his penis out of his pants and held it in his hand as he took her by the back of her head, pulled her down and said, ""Here, suck my dick”.40 She pulled her head back, told him to wake up to himself, commented that he was not wearing a condom, and said that she was not doing that. She made a general remark about cleanliness. He was continuing to hold her head and pulled it towards his penis, which he held with his right hand. He forced his penis into her mouth and thrust forward three times before he released her. She attempted to move away to which he said, ""Where are you going, stop fuck arsing around."" She said she was scared and wanted to get away from him.41 Next, she was face first on the ground on her hands and knees, and saw his hands near his mouth. He put his hand inside the leg of her shorts and wiped it across the vagina as if he was lubricating her. She asked what he was doing, and he penetrated her vagina with his penis. She told him to stop. She complained that he did not have a condom and continued to tell him to stop. He turned her over onto her back and penetrated her vagina from the front through the leg of her shorts. She again told him to stop.42 They returned to the taxi and he drove her back towards the football field, and on the way handed her his business card. When he reached traffic lights she took the opportunity to open the door and leave the vehicle. She complained to her sister.The Submissions43 The Crown submits that there are a number of comparable features in the evidence anticipated from these witnesses. It says there are seven features common to each of the events described.44 First, the alleged offender was in each case driving a taxi. This is said to be significant of itself, but the Crown also points to the fact that as a taxi driver he was within a relatively small group, a member of the class of service provider including taxi drivers, bus drivers, and train guards. The Crown submitted that generally speaking, people would enter the vehicles used by these service providers without fear of conduct such as that suffered by these complainants. It is part of the Crown case that the accused exploited the trust given by the clients using the services provided by people such as the accused.45 It is said on behalf of the accused that the fact that the alleged offender in each case was a taxi driver is not so significant. There is evidence that the accused was not the holder of a taxi driver's licence at a time of the incidents alleged by M M. He acknowledges a sexual encounter with this complainant, which was entirely consensual and in circumstances different to those described by her. If there was an incident involving a taxi driver, it was not this accused. It remains however, that upon the evidence tendered in these applications, M M described one sexual encounter on that evening, at the hands of the taxi driver in whose vehicle she found herself. There is no evidence that there was another sexual encounter involving this complainant in addition to that described in her statement, only the submissions of counsel upon this point. I do not mean to imply that these were not made in good faith and in accordance with instructions, but there is no evidence of the sexual encounter described by counsel.46 Although there is evidence that the accused was not the holder of a taxi licence at the time of the first offences, it does not follow that he was not driving a taxi at the time.47 The second point said by the Crown to be common to each complainant is that the offender made lascivious remarks. On behalf of the accused, it was said that this is not significant; in consensual sex one would expect that there would be such banter.48 Thirdly, the sexual intercourse alleged in each case included the vaginal penetration. On behalf of the accused, it was said that sexual intercourse in this fashion is to be expected in a consensual relationship.49 Fourthly, the complainant in each case was resistant to the sexual advances. Counsel for the accused submits that this is not of any significance, for it would be common to all such allegations except where the complainant might have been completely submissive. Moreover, this is conduct on the part of the complainant, which can be probative of nothing more than that in the particular case the complainant did not submit. I agree that this is not a matter that ought to be brought to account in the assessment of the similarity between the events and the circumstances in which they occurred.50 Fifthly, the alleged offender did not use a condom. L McP and C-A B were both in a position to observe this, and it is a matter of inference on the balance of probabilities that the offender did not wear a condom with M M.51 Sixthly, there was evidence of recent complaint. Counsel for the accused submits that once again this is a factor that is unique to the particular complainant in each case, and is probative of no more than she complained shortly after the alleged event. I agree that this is not a matter that ought to be brought to account in the assessment of the similarity between the events and the circumstances in which they occurred.52 Seventhly, semen harvested from each complainant had DNA with the profile matching that of the accused. On behalf of the accused counsel acknowledged the sexual encounters, which he claims were entirely consensual, and submitted that since issue was not to be joined upon the proposition that there were sexual encounters in each case, whether semen was present or not is of no probative value for it did not indicate one way or the other whether the sexual activity was consensual.53 I do not agree with that submission. The Crown submitted when speaking to the offences alleged by C-A B that it would be unlikely that a person employed in her industry would embark upon unprotected sex with a client unknown to her, because of the risk of infection and the resultant compromise to her health and ability to continue working. I am of the opinion that the risk of infection from an unknown sexual partner in unprotected sexual intercourse is a factor that would be of probative value upon the issue of consent.54 The Crown also draws upon other features that are common between two of the three complainants.55 In the case of the evidence from M M and L McP, both were in Kings Cross late at night, and were heavily intoxicated. It is the Crown case that the accused exploited their state of intoxication for the commission of his offences.56 Both provided a description of the offender comparable to the accused.57 In the case of the evidence from L McP and C-A B, both were taken to secluded areas; in the case of L McP to an area where there were unattended vehicles near some structure she described as a crate built of corrugated iron, and in the case of C-A B to an industrial area; both were out of the vehicle at the time the offences alleged took place.58 In both cases there is evidence of the accused’s interest or concern regarding the lubrication of their vaginas. In each case he introduced the topic of payment for sex, and with C-A B he left his business card.59 The Crown case is that the accused’s references to money, and the provision of his business card, was a premeditated attempt to provide an explanation for the sexual connection, against the probability that he would be identified as the perpetrator in these two incidents. The Crown submits that the effluxion of time between the first event, and the second and third events allows the inference that at the time of the commission of the first offences he was not so concerned about the risk of detection, but became so later as his offending continued and evolved.60 The Crown also points to the reliability of the complaints by C-A B. I referred to this earlier. She was a sex worker, and one would accept, so it was submitted, that her concerns for her health were such that it would be contrary to common sense to accept that she would engage in consensual sex with a man unknown to her without the protection that a condom would offer her.The Accused’s Application For Separate Trials61 In support of the notice of motion an affidavit sworn by the accused’s solicitor was read. It rehearses the history of these proceedings from 5 September 2008 when the accused was first listed to appear for arraignment. The essence of the representations in the affidavit is that at some point earlier in these proceedings the lawyer then representing the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions agreed that there should be separate trials for the discrete events from which the charges were brought, and that the accused would be presented in three separate trials upon indictments charging him in each case with offences alleged by the particular complainant. Notwithstanding these representations, on 2 December 2008 a copy of the indictment with all of the offences included was sent to the solicitor, and on 12 January 2009, upon his return to work after the Christmas vacation, the solicitor found notices of the Crown's intention to lead coincidence and tendency evidence. The notices were dated 19 December 2008. Annexed to the affidavits were copies of correspondence to the accused from the solicitor, the indictment, and the notices of intention to lead coincidence and tendency evidence.62 Although the accused’s counsel informed the court that he relied upon the affidavit and the annexures, ultimately no point was taken in the course of submissions regarding the representations attributed to the lawyer representing the Crown at those interlocutory stages. They would not in any event have provided much assistance to the accused upon his application for separate trials. The views and the representations attributed to the earlier Crown representative could in no measure bind the Crown prosecutor given the brief to prosecute this trial.63 The submissions made in support of the challenge to the Crown's intention to offer coincidence and tendency evidence as proposed in its notices were also ventured upon the application for separate trials.64 The nature of this matter is such that the question whether the accused ought to face separate trials in respect of each of the complainants or be presented upon one indictment charging all counts is inextricably bound to the question whether the Crown ought to be permitted to lead coincidence evidence as proposed in its notice. If the Crown is permitted to lead coincidence evidence, the proper application of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 would in my opinion require that the application for separate trials be refused. On the other hand, if the Crown ought not to be permitted to lead coincidence evidence, there remains discretion to allow the charges to proceed together.65 Section 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides relevantly, 
     
      
      “ 
      (1) … 
       
      (2) If of the opinion: 
       
        
        (a) that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or 
         
        (b) that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment, 
        
       
      the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment. 
       
      (3) … 
       
      (4) An order under this section may be made either before trial or at any stage during the trial. 
       
      (5) … 
       
      (6) Any power of the court under this section is in addition to and not in derogation of any other power of the court for the same or similar purposes. 
      ” 
      
    66 Section 29 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides relevantly, 
     
      
      “ 
      (1) A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to 2 or more offences alleged to have been committed by the same accused person in any of the following circumstances: 
       
        
        (a) the accused person and the prosecutor consent, 
         
        (b) the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances, 
         
        (c) the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character. 
        
       
      (2) … 
       
      (3) Proceedings related to 2 or more offences … may not be heard together if the court is of the opinion that the matters ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice.

    67 For the reasons that will appear hereunder, I am of the view that in respect of each of the charges contained in the indictment particularising an offence against M M, the Crown should be permitted to adduce as coincidence evidence the evidence of the facts and circumstances alleged in respect of the offences against L McP and C-A B, and that in respect of each of the charges particularising an offence against L McP, the Crown should be permitted to adduce as coincidence evidence the evidence of the facts and circumstances alleged in respect of the offences against M M and C-A B, and that in respect of each of the charges a particularising an offence against C-A B, the Crown should be permitted to adduce the sequences evidence the evidence of the facts and circumstances alleged in respect of the offences against M M and L McP.68 For the reasons that I came to those decisions, I am not of the opinion that the accused will be prejudiced or embarrassed in his defence by reason of the inclusion of all charges on one indictment, and I'm not persuaded that it is desirable to direct that he be tried separately for any one or more of the offences upon which is to be presented to the jury.69 I find that there is no good reason why the court may not hear and determine together the proceedings relating to the offences alleged in respect of the separate complainants. I find that it is not in the interests of justice to require these complainants to attend court on three separate occasions to give evidence, in the circumstances where I propose to allow the Crown to lead the evidence it wishes to rely upon as coincidence evidence. The offences alleged against the accused are aptly described as a series of offences of the same or similar character. I have not overlooked that the first offences are alleged to have occurred in 2003, the second group in December 2006, and the third six months later in June 2007.70 I am not of the opinion that the charges ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice.71 The application for separate trials is refused.The Crown’s Application to Adduce Coincidence Evidence72 Although the Crown issued notices of its intention to lead evidence of tendency and coincidence, it ultimately abandoned its application for leave to adduce the evidence for tendency purposes.73 The high point of the submissions made on behalf of the accused against the Crown’s use of the evidence as coincidence evidence was that because each complainant alleged that she did not consent, the jury might without more conclude that the evidence of each of the complainants that they did not consent was more reliable. The following passage from the decision of the High Court in Phillips v The Queen (2006) 225 CLR 303 at paragraph [47] was cited: 
     
      
      “ 
      Neither the courts below nor counsel for the respondent cited any case in which similar fact evidence of complainants who said that they did not consent was led to show that another complainant had not consented. Whether or not similar fact evidence could ever be used in relation to consent in sexual cases, it could not be done validly in this case. It is impossible to see how, on the question of whether one complainant consented, the other complainants' evidence that they did not consent has any probative value. It does not itself prove any disposition on the part of the accused: it proves only what mental state each of the other complainants had on a particular occasion affecting them, and that can say nothing about the mental state of the first complainant on a particular occasion affecting her. 
      ” 
      
    74 The structure of the prosecution of Phillips was not dissimilar to the present matter. The charges brought against him were in respect of six complainants alleging sexual assaults from disparate circumstances.75 In Phillips v The Queen the view of the trial judge upon applications to lead evidence of similar facts, and upon an application for separate trials, was that the points of similarity identified were not of themselves or collectively of sufficient probative value to prove propensity on the part of the accused, but, that it was so improbable that five separate complainants would allege events with the comparable features identified, that the jury were permitted to consider the evidence of each of them as to what they allegedly suffered at the hands of the accused, when assessing the reliability of each of them upon the issue of consent. In the course of his summing up his Honour asked rhetorically what was the probability that all of the girls had lied when they said they did not consent to the appellant dealing with them sexually.76 Their Honours in the High Court agreed with the opinion of the trial judge inferred from his remarks throughout the trial that the points of similarity identified were not particularly remarkable and were therefore of limited probative value as evidence of the accused’s propensity. At paragraphs [54] and [55], after summarising the principles relevant to the admissibility of similar fact evidence, their Honours wrote, 
     
      
      “ 
      In this case none of these criteria are met - either on the issue of whether in relation to any particular charge the appellant committed the acts of assault or intercourse alleged, or on the issue of whether he did so being honestly and reasonably mistaken about consent. Take count 8, assaulting JD with intent to rape her. Where is the strong degree of probative force necessary to permit the exceptional reception of evidence that in earlier years the appellant had indecently assaulted or raped five other complainants? What was the really material bearing of that evidence on the issues to be decided on count 8? What was there about the prejudicial evidence which showed that on five earlier occasions the appellant had a strong desire for sexual intercourse (with consent if he could get it, without it if he could not) which caused its probative value clearly to transcend that prejudicial effect? Did the evidence have ""strength in its probative force"", or was its specific probative force ""sufficiently great""? Did it have ""some specific connexion with or in relation to the issues for decision"" giving ""significant cogency"" to the evidence about count 8? 
      
     
     
      
      The similarities relied on were not merely not ""striking"", they were entirely unremarkable. That a male teenager might seek sexual activity with girls about his own age with most of whom he was acquainted, and seek it consensually in the first instance, is not particularly probative. Nor is the appellant's desire for oral sex, his approaches to the complainants on social occasions and after some of them had ingested alcohol or other drugs, his engineering of opportunities for them to be alone with him, and the different degrees of violence he employed in some instances. His recklessness in persisting with this conduct near other people who might be attracted by vocal protests is also unremarkable and not uncommon. 
      ” 
      
    77 The Crown responded to this submission by noting that Phillips v The Queen emanated from Queensland, and although a sound exposition of common law principle, this court is required to apply section 98 and section 101 of the Evidence Act, 1995, as amended: Regina v Ellis (2003) 58 NSWLR 700.78 Although Phillips v The Queen, as the Crown correctly points out, must be read with appropriate circumspection when considering the terms of the legislation according to which this decision must be made, it does provide guidance. I am persuaded that the decision of the complainants in each case to complain early, and that they resisted the sexual advances in each case, ought to be set aside from the assemblage of features upon which the Crown advances its application.79 I agree with the submission that the evidence of those facts shows the mental state of the complainant in each case at the relevant times, and whatever might have been the state of mind of one of them, it cannot say anything about the state of mind of the others. Moreover, there is nothing so remarkable in a complainant making an early complaint of sexual assault, or in resisting the sexual assault as it is taking place, that would elevate evidence of those facts to the point where it might be said to be significantly probative of the facts that will be in issue in this trial, namely, whether when the accused engaged upon the sexual connection acknowledged on his behalf, he did so without consent, knowing that the complainants were not consenting.80 On the other hand, the other features to which the Crown points are not caught by the same criticism, and are matters relevant to the question whether the accused acted without the consent of the complainants knowing that they were not consenting. Moreover, in the case of the complainant M M, the relevance of the evidence of the other complainants extends beyond whether the accused had sexual connexion knowingly without her consent, to the issue of whether the accused did so in a taxicab, the use of which he denies pointing to the fact that he was not licensed to operate as a taxi driver at the time. The accused’s counsel said in his written submissions, 
     
      
      “ 
      It is the accused’s position that he had met her in a hotel at Kings Cross earlier in the evening. They struck up a conversation and this led to the accused having consensual and casual sex with her at a private hotel at Kings Cross. After having sex they both returned to the hotel where they met and where they parted company. 
      ” 
      
    81 In New South Wales the admissibility of this evidence as coincidence evidence is governed by sections 98 and 101 of the Evidence Act, 1995 and upon consideration of the provisions of sections 135 and 137 of the Act. I must also turn my mind to section 192 of the Act. I note that section 192A, recently included in the Act, allows for the resolution of these questions in advance of the evidence being adduced. Accordingly, there is no difficulty with the decision being reached upon the written statements provided by the complainants and other relevant documents without the complainants and other witnesses being called to describe the facts recorded in that written material. They were not required for cross-examination upon the voir dire.82 The Crown gave early notice of its intention to offer this evidence as coincidence evidence, albeit in terms reflecting section 98 as it applied before the commencement of the amended provision on 1 January 2009. This said, no point was taken with regard to the notice and I am not called upon to consider whether it ought to have been expressed differently, or turn my mind to the notice requirement in section 98(1)(a) or the application of section 100 of the Act.83 The relevant terms of the coincidence rule as provided before the amendments to the Act were: 
     
      
      “ 
      (1) Evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind if: 
       
        
        (a) … 
         
        (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 
        
       
      (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), 2 or more events are taken to be related events if and only if: 
       
        
        (a) they are substantially and relevantly similar; and 
         
        (b) the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar. 
        
       
      (3) … 
      ” 
      
    84 Section 98 of the Evidence Act, recently amended, now provides relevantly, 
     
      
      “ 
      (1) Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless: 
       
        
        (a) …, and 
         
        (b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 
        
       
      Note. 
       One of the events referred to in subsection (1) may be an event the occurrence of which is a fact in issue in the proceeding. 
       
      (2) … 
       
      Note. 
       Other provisions of this Act, or of other laws, may operate as exceptions to the coincidence rule. 
      ” 
      
    85 The word “related” has been omitted in the new formulation of section 98(1), and there is now no requirement of the Crown to show that the events were substantially and relevantly similar, or that the circumstances in which they occurred were substantially similar, all of which the Court was previously required to be satisfied before it could find that the events were related events.86 The test now to be satisfied in respect of the evidence that two or more events occurred, to prove that the accused did a particular act or had a particular state of mind, will be met once the court is satisfied that having regard to the similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, the evidence of those events will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.87 If this test is met, then subject to section 101 of the Act, the evidence will be admissible to show the improbability of the two or more events occurring coincidentally, and may be used as evidence prove that the accused did a particular act or had a particular state of mind.88 In each case, the issues to which the evidence is relevant are whether the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting thereto, and additionally in the case concerning M M, whether the accused had sexual intercourse with her in a taxi to which he had access at the time even though he was then unlicensed to operate the vehicle.89 The term probative value is defined in the dictionary to the Evidence Act, 
     
      
      “ 
      probative value 
       of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. 
      ” 
      
    90 The word “significant” used in section 98 of the Evidence Act has been held to require that the probative value of this evidence must mean something more than mere relevance, but may be less than a substantial degree of relevance: R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 per Hunt CL at CL at page 459; or must be of importance or consequence: R v Martin [2002] NSWCCA 332 at [67] approved by Wood CJ at CL in R v Folbigg [2002] NSWSC 1127 at [74].91 In the cases of M M and L McP one may anticipate an attack developed upon their capacity to recall events in light of their state of inebriation, and with regard to the credibility of C-A B, her status as a sex work might excite an application for leave to examine and cross examine her about this work, the commercial aspects of it, and the acknowledged hold of the accused’s penis and her lifting of her shirt. There may be other avenues of attack upon their reliability or credibility of which I am unaware at this point in the proceedings, to shed doubt upon their assertions that they did not consent to the sexual connection by the accused. Even so, I am of the view that in each case, viewed independently of the allegations made by the other complainants, the evidence anticipated from each complainant has significant probative value with regard to the assessment of the probability that the accused sexually assaulted her, without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting.92 I am also of the opinion that the evidence anticipated from the complainants is, in each case, capable of being ascribed significant probative value to the assessment of the probability that the accused sexually assaulted each of the other complainants, and that he acted without their consent, knowing that they were not consenting: R v Fletcher (2005) 156 A Crim R 308; [2005] NSWCCA 338.93 Accordingly, I find that the evidence of the similarities between the events and the circumstances in which they occurred are therefore admissible to prove the improbability of them having occurred coincidentally, and that the test required by section 98 is met.94 The points of comparison upon which the Crown may rely for these purposes are: 
     
     The offender was in each case was driving a taxi, and thereby exploited the vulnerability and trust of each complainant; 
     
     
     In each case the offender made lascivious remarks, which although not precisely identical in their terms, were comparable; 
     
     
     In each case the offender did not use a condom, thereby exposing the complainant to the risk of infection from unprotected sex with a man not previously known to her; 
     
     
     In the cases of M M and L McP, both were in Kings Cross late at night, and were heavily intoxicated; 
     
     
     The description of the offender given by M M and L McP were comparable; 
     
     
     L McP and C-A B, were both taken to secluded areas; 
     
     
     With L McP and C-A B the offender took steps to lubricate their vaginas; 
     
     
     With L McP and C-A B the offender introduced the topic of payment for sex and in the case of C-A B he left his business card. 
    95 Section 101 of the Evidence Act provides, 
     
      
      “ 
      (1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98. 
       
      (2) … coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. 
       
      (3) … 
       
      (4) … 
      ” 
      
    96 The prejudice to which the accused is said to be exposed is the risk that the credibility of the assertions by the complainants in each case that they did not consent to the sexual intercourse will be used improperly to enhance the creditworthiness of the other complainants’ evidence that they did not consent to the sexual connection by the accused. In support counsel relies upon what was said in the High Court in Phillips v The Queen.97 Phillips v The Queen was concerned with the alleged conduct of a young male, toward a number of complainants, about which there was nothing unusual. The behaviour alleged in respect of each complainant was comparable, but the similarities suggested were entirely unremarkable for a male teenager seeking sexual activity from girls of his own age. Moreover, the evidence was permitted in the trial to show the improbability of so many complainants alleging that their participation was without their consent.98 In the present matter the court is faced with a man of mature age, who in a predatory manner is alleged to have exploited his position as a taxi driver and the vulnerability of the complainants M M and L McP from their intoxication late at night, and of C-A B who entered his vehicle presuming that it was occupied by one of her clients. The Crown would rely upon this evidence to prove the sexual intercourse as alleged in each case, and that the accused knew that the complainant in each case was not consenting; it is not offered with regard to the states of mind of the complainants, but with regard to the state of mind of the accused. The jury would be instructed carefully in those terms.99 This submission also exposes the question whether this is a case where the statutory test as presently formulated for the admission of evidence as coincidence evidence would not be satisfied unless the common law test explained in Pfennig v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461 was also satisfied: Regina v Ellis (2003) 58 NSWLR 700: and whether accordingly the evidence should be excluded unless, when taken in conjunction with the balance of the evidence, the only rational explanation is the guilt of the accused in respect of the offence upon which the evidence is offered as coincidence evidence: R v Folbigg [2002] NSWSC 1127 at [81] and the authorities there cited. In my opinion the evidence upon which the Crown wishes to rely as coincidence evidence in the case of each of these complainants meets the more stringent test expounded in Pfennig v The Queen, whatever view one might have of the need for the application of that test to the present matter.100 These findings also address the test required by section 137 of the Evidence Act. Furthermore, I am satisfied that the evidence will not be unfairly prejudicial to the accused, will not be misleading or confusing, and will not cause or result in any undue waste of time. Accordingly, I do not propose to exercise the discretion provided in section 135 of the Evidence Act.101 In reaching this decision I have also considered the paragraphs in subsection 192(2) of the Evidence Act. I am of the view that the admission of this evidence as coincidence evidence will not impact adversely upon the length of the proceedings, that it will not be unfair to the accused, and that the evidence is of importance in the proceedings, in the case being presented by the Crown. I have not overlooked the fact that these are criminal proceedings. The jury would be directed in terms that the use of this evidence as coincidence evidence must not extend to the proposition that because each of the complainants said that they did not consent, their evidence on that point in each case was more reliable; this would in my opinion address the perceived risk of misuse.The Orders102 I make the following the orders, 
     
      
      1. The application for separate trials is refused. 
       
       
      2. In respect of each of the charges particularising an offence against M M, the Crown is given leave to adduce as coincidence evidence the evidence of the facts and circumstances alleged in respect of the offences against L McP and C-A B. 
       
       
      3. In respect of each of the charges particularising an offence against L McP, the Crown is given leave to adduce as coincidence evidence the evidence of the facts and circumstances alleged in respect of the offences against M M and C-A B. 
       
       
      4. In respect of each of the charges a particularising an offence against C-A B, the Crown is given leave to adduce as coincidence evidence the evidence of the facts and circumstances alleged in respect of the offences against M M and L McP.

    4 The respondent had pleaded not guilty to a charge on an indictment that [he] on 18 May 2006 at Broken Hill did maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm upon Jeffrey Mark Hands with intent to do grievous bodily harm to him contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (the first count). The respondent was also charged in the alternative with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon Mr Hands contrary to s 58 of the Crimes Act (the second count). On 29 November 2007, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the first count.  
     
      
    5 On 17 May 2008, the sentencing Judge sentenced the respondent to a term of imprisonment of 5 years consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months commencing on 29 November 2007 and expiring on 28 May 2010 with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months commencing on 29 May 2010 and expiring on 28 November 2012.  
     
      
    6 The earliest date the respondent is eligible for release to parole is on 28 May 2010.  
     
      
    7 An offence contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act is punishable by 25 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 7 years applies.  
     
      
    8 The principles relevant to Crown appeals against sentence were summarised by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]: 
     
      
       
        
        “…it is important to note the principles which apply in relation to the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
        House v The King 
         (1936) 55 CLR 499, applies to Crown appeals against sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion, as to the appropriate sentence, for that of the sentencing judge:  
        Lowndes v The Queen 
         (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown;  
        R v Tait 
         (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 58 and 109. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
        Malvaso v The Queen 
         (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere:  
        R v Baker 
         [2000] NSWCCA 85. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle "" 
        for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons 
        "": per Barwick CJ in  
        Griffiths v The Queen 
         (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
        Everett v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299;  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         (2000) 202 CLR 32, at paras 61 and 62, and  
        Wong & Leung v The Queen 
         at para 109. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
        R v Allpass 
         (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
        R v Papazis 
         (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         at para 110. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
        R v Holder and Johnston 
         (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         at para 62.” 
        
       
       
       
      The Findings of Fact  
       
      
    9 The sentencing Judge found the following facts (ROS 1-3):  
     
      
       
        
        The facts giving rise to the commission of this offence are that on 17 May 2006 the victim, Geoffrey Hands, along with his workmates, Jason Ryan, Tim McKeller and Anthony Owens, all from Bathurst, all of whom had been working doing contract roofing work within the Broken Hill area. In the evening they went to the Social Democratic Club where they drank alcohol and met up with Bree Lithgow and some of her friends. The Mundine/Green fight was on that evening and the men had gone down to watch it. Bree Lithgow was a local girl who became friendly with Mr Ryan. The males were asked to leave the Democratic Club following some animosity between them and some local men. The group then went across to Mario’s Palace Hotel where they watched the fight. Again a group of males was seen to be watching them. The victim and his friends drank a lot of alcohol and Mr Owens returned to their motel, the Old Willyama, during that part of the evening. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        When the fight was over Miss Lithgow went into Argent Street, there were many people in the street. The offender arrived and joined his friends, Corey Meahan and others and as Mr Ryan proceeded down the street Meahan engaged in an argument with him, with a fight ensuing outside Torpy’s store between Meahan and Taylor, with the result that a shop window was broken after Ryan made contact with it. Ryan became separated from McKeller, Lithgow and Hands. They could not find him, went to the motel to look for him before returning to the area around Al Fresco’s restaurant at the corner of Argent and Oxide Streets. On this corner the victim was spoken to by Mr Quin who had threatened him. Mr Quin made a mobile telephone call telling some people to “get up here, we have some Bathurst wankers to bash”. The victim noticed he was wearing a grey jumper with a hood.  
        
       
      
      
     
      
       While they were looking for Ryan, the police arrested Meahan after he ran into Al Fresco’s subsequent to the fight and broken window. That arrest took place at about 11.45pm. Lithgow and McKeller found Ryan who had cut his leg. An ambulance took him to hospital with Lithgow.  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        About that time Mr McKeller told Mr Hands to go to the motel to get Mr Owens. Mr Hands crossed Argent Street to the opposite side from Al Fresco’s and walked east towards the motel. He noticed the man in the grey jumper walk along the opposite side in the same direction. As he then moved further he saw other men following the man in the grey jumper. Outside the Working Man’s Club this man crossed the street and confronted him, calling out that it was on and pushed him. The victim struck him in return. The victim was then punched three times to the face by that man, who is the offender, fell to the ground and during the altercation he saw others approaching from either side. While he was on the ground he was struck and kicked by persons. At one time he was struck on both sides of the jaw and felt great pain. He was dragged by the jumper and he was kicked and lost consciousness. When he woke up he was alone and bleeding from facial injuries. He had been left in that condition by the offender and his cohorts.  
         
         
        The victim then went to the motel, woke the proprietor, was taken to hospital. At hospital it was ascertained that he had a fracture to the jaw in two places, a fracture to the left eye socket and a nasal fracture requiring a six hour operation during the course of which he was required to have molar teeth removed and three sets of screws inserted with a plate in the jaw.  
         
        
       
      
    10 His Honour found that matters which added to the seriousness of the offence were the commission of it in company and whilst the respondent was subject to conditional liberty. The respondent had been placed on a 12 month good behaviour bond on 30 May 2005 for an offence of common assault. On the same day, he had been sentenced to 100 hours community service for malicious damage to property. His Honour further detailed the circumstances of the respondent’s conviction of malicious wounding in company, for which he had been placed on a nine month good behaviour bond in August 2004.  
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances  
       
      
    11 During the proceedings on sentence the respondent gave evidence. Reports from Anna Robilliard, a psychologist, and Professor David Greenberg, a psychiatrist, were tendered as was a Probation and Parole pre-sentence report. 
     
      
    12 The respondent was born on 21 April 1986 and was 20 years old at the time of the commission of the offence. He had a dysfunctional family background, and his parents separated when he was an infant. He rarely saw his father and had been cared for mostly by his mother who had multiple male partners. As a child he lived an unsettled life and had attended ten different schools. He left school after completing year 10.  
     
      
    13 On leaving school, he worked as a roustabout and then as a shearer. He then obtained employment as a field technician with mining companies in Broken Hill. Testimonials as to his good character and work ethic were tendered during the sentencing proceedings. He had been in a stable relationship for 5 years and his girlfriend remained supportive of him.  
     
      
    14 The respondent had abused alcohol from the age of 16 years. Professor Greenberg diagnosed an alcohol abuse disorder and anger management issues. 
     
      
    15 The sentencing Judge during his remarks on sentence quoted from Professor Greenberg’s report which included the psychiatrist’s assessment that the respondent’s prognosis: (ROS at 7): 
     
      
       
        
        “Is dependent on him abstaining from alcohol for an indefinite period and seeking counselling for his anger management difficulties and other personality problems.” 
        
       
      
    16 His Honour considered the Probation and Parole report and noted that since his incarceration on 29 November 2007, the respondent had complied with correctional centre routines, had neither caused trouble nor had any institutional misconducts recorded against him. His Honour noted that the author of the report had said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        He was a young man who had problems in the past and now appears to have a bright future within the mining industry. On a personal level his family appears to be highly supportive of him and he seems to be in a stable relationship.  
        
       
      
      
     
      
       
        
        While [the respondent] maintains his innocence of the current offences before the court, he acknowledges the need to address his alcohol abuse, binge drinking issues, and appears to have gained some insight into the problems his previous offending behaviour has caused him.” 
        
       
      
    17 His Honour accepted the evidence that had been given as to the respondent’s increased maturity since the offence occurred and his employment in the mining industry. His Honour accepted that he was a good worker and was “a young man with great potential, good work ethics, and capable of being a young leader who could influence his peers in a positive way.” 
     
      
    18 His Honour quoted extensively from the psychologist’s report which included the following passage:  
     
      
       
        
        “[the respondent] has sound goals and future perspective. He also has the support of immediate family members and girlfriend. With this level of structure and support [the respondent’s] progress is positive. He is a young man who has taken responsibility for supporting himself from an early age and he has done so in demanding circumstances. He does not have an extensive criminal record, nor does he appear to have entrenched antisocial attitudes and values. Excessive drinking affects good decision making and reduces behavioural self control and this appears to be at the centre of [the respondent’s] involvement in this matter.” 
        
       
      
    19 The sentencing Judge observed, however, that the jury’s verdict was a correct one and the respondent had shown “little contrition by his continued denial of involvement.” During the trial the respondent had admitted he was at the scene of the attack but maintained that he played no role in it and denied that he struck the victim. Upon sentence he acknowledged that no one deserved the injuries that the victim had suffered.  
     
      
       
      Dealing with the appeal  
       
      
    20 There is one ground of appeal which is that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. The Crown also points to what are said to be a number of individual errors made by the sentencing Judge. It is appropriate to first consider the individual errors alleged by the Crown.  
     
      
    21 During his sentencing remarks, his Honour said (ROS at 5): 
     
      
       
        
        “Notwithstanding the violence and the matters of aggravation to which I have referred, I am of the view that this offence is below the middle of any scale constructed for such an offence,  
        principally because of the absence of any weapon.” 
         (italics added)  
        
       
      
    22 The Crown submitted that the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence as below the middle range of objective seriousness was in all the circumstances erroneous. The Crown contended that the presence of a s 21A factor serves to aggravate an offence but the corollary does not follow and the fact that no knife, chair, ashtray or gun was used to inflict injury does not cause the offence per se to be less than mid-range in seriousness. The Crown pointed out that the principal reason why the sentencing Judge had concluded in the passage quoted at [21] above that the offence was below the middle of the range of objective seriousness was the absence of a weapon.  
     
      
    23 The actual or threatened use of a weapon is an aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence: s 21A(2)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    24 The respondent on the other hand submitted that the sentencing Judge had incorrectly found that the victim had been kicked. This was a matter, it was said, that was relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. Although such an incorrect finding was made, the respondent contended that the sentencing Judge correctly characterised the offence as being below the middle of the range.  
     
      
    25 The sentencing Judge said during his sentencing remarks (ROS at 2): 
     
      
       
        
        “The victim was then punched three times to the face by that man, who is the offender, fell to the ground and during the altercation he saw others approaching from either side. While he was on the ground he was struck and  
        kicked by persons 
        . At one time he was struck on both sides of the jaw and felt great pain. He was dragged by the jumper and  
        he was kicked  
        and lost consciousness.” (italics added)  
        
       
      
    26 And (ROS at 3): 
     
      
       
        
        “The offence was committed in company, such company being organised by the offender as can be seen by reference to the mobile phone and was committed by the offender when he was on conditional liberty. The violence was cowardly because of the numbers attacking the person on his own and then when he was knocked to the ground  
        the use of the boots as a weapon.  
        These are matters which add to the seriousness of the offence.” (italics added).  
        
       
      
    27 And (ROS at 4): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        There were no weapons used on this occasion in this assault except for the use of the fist  
        and feet 
         and arranging for a large number of persons to assist the offender in the carrying out of this very violent assault.” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    28 No evidence was given during the trial that the victim was kicked. The victim made no such complaint nor was it submitted by the Crown that he had been kicked.  
     
      
    29 It was his Honour’s duty to determine the facts relevant to sentencing the respondent. The finding that the sentencing Judge made that the victim had been kicked was not open on the evidence. His Honour, with respect, in assessing the objective gravity of the offence erred in taking into account that the victim had been kicked.  
     
      
    30 It is important to emphasise that the absence of a weapon (and in my opinion the use of boots to kick another may be readily characterised as the actual use of a weapon) is not a matter of mitigation: Versluys v R [2008] NSWCCA 76 per McClellan CJ at CL at [37]. As was said in Versluys it does not necessarily follow that where hands (in the present case fists) have been used by an assailant instead of a weapon that the offence is less serious than if a weapon was used. This may particularly be considered to be the case when a single victim is attacked by a number of assailants even though the method of assault was confined to the use of fists.  
     
      
    31 The respondent’s criminality was aggravated by the fact that the offence was committed in the company of other persons whom he had summonsed, with the intention that the victim was to be attacked. It was the respondent who led the attack punching the victim causing him to fall to the ground whereupon he was savagely set upon. As a result of the attack, the victim suffered serious facial and dental injuries.  
     
      
    32 A determination of where the subject offence lies on the scale of seriousness of an offence of its type is essentially one of fact and as such is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. As was said by Simpson J in R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 140 at [36]:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          For the Crown to succeed on this aspect of the appeal, it is necessary that it establish that the finding, which is essentially one of fact, was not open to his Honour. The finding, being an evaluation is akin to an exercise of discretion and may only be held to be wrong if it can be shown that some wrong principle was applied, or irrelevant consideration taken into account (or a relevant consideration overlooked) or that the finding itself simply was not open on the evidence:  
          House v The King 
          …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    33 It is well recognised that s 33 of the Crimes Act covers a wide variety of offences and a diversity of injuries: see R v Heron [2006] NSWCCA 215 per Hoeben J at [54]. The finding of fact which the sentencing Judge made that the victim had been kicked enhanced the gravity of the offence and was favourable to the Crown’s argument that the assessment of objective seriousness of the offence as being below the middle range was erroneous. Serious as the injuries to the victim were and the number of persons present at the time of their infliction, I am not persuaded, that an assessment that the objective seriousness of the offence as being below the mid-range of objective seriousness was not open on the evidence. In my opinion, however, the objective seriousness of the offence could not be characterised as being less than slightly below the middle of the range.  
     
      
    34 The Crown further contended that the sentencing Judge had incorrectly double counted subjective features as justifying a departure from the standard non-parole period and then used the same features to find special circumstances and to lower the non-parole period again. The respondent contended that the authorities cited by the Crown such as R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 and R v Alameddine [2004] NSWCCA 286 did not prohibit the consideration of the same or similar factors in relation to both special circumstances and the standard non-parole period. They are, the respondent submitted, in reality discussions about the same issue which was how long should the offender spend in prison.  
     
      
    35 In R v Fidow Spigelman CJ said at [18]:  
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        R v Simpson 
         (2001) 53 NSWLR 704, this Court identified the wide range of factors capable of constituting special circumstances. Nevertheless, on each occasion in which s 44(2) of the Act is invoked, it is necessary for the sentencing judge to make a decision, as noted in  
        Simpson  
        at [68] that the circumstances are sufficiently special for the statutory proportion to be reduced. Section 44(2) requires the ‘decision’ to be that the statutory proportion of one-third be “less”. ‘Double counting’ for matters already taken into account in reducing the head sentence, and therefore already reflected in the non parole period, must be avoided. (see  
        Simpson 
         at [47]). Almost all matters capable of constituting special circumstances have usually been taken into account in determining the head sentence and sentencing judges should ensure that double counting does not occur.”  
        
       
      
    36 Whilst it is true that what was said by the Chief Justice in Fidow at [18] cautioned against the double counting of matters already taken into account in reducing the head sentence and then in the finding of special circumstances to vary the statutory proportion of the non-parole period, sentencing Judges, in my view, should also take care to ensure against double counting when a matter is taken into account in departing from the standard non-parole period and then as a special circumstance justifying a variation in the statutory proportion between the non-parole period and balance of the term of the sentence thereby further reducing the mandatory period of imprisonment. Section 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that the balance of the term of the sentence should not exceed one-third of the non-parole period unless there are special circumstances, in which case reasons must be given: s 44(2).  
     
      
    37 This Court said in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [110]:  
     
      
       
        
        “While many of the factors which qualify as special circumstances will be taken into account as factors specifically listed in s 21A in determining the appropriate non-parole period, it does not necessarily follow that its work is fully done at that stage,  
        although caution will need to be exercised so as to avoid inappropriate double counting.” 
         (underlining added). 
        
       
      
    38 The Court explained in Way at [112] that while there are separate considerations involved for s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and for reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period, the relevant steps can be taken simultaneously. By avoiding a two stage process, the risk of double counting is reduced.  
     
      
    39 The sentencing Judge recognised that the Court was required to impose the standard non-parole period of 7 years unless it was determined that there were reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period. The reasons for imposing a shorter non-parole period, his Honour said, were (ROS at 12):  
     
      
       
        
        “1. There were no weapons involved.  
        
       
       
        
        2. The offender has taken very positive and big steps in maturing and settled into the workplace since this offence.  
        
       
       
        
        3. I accept that as evidence of a real prospect of rehabilitation and I accept that which all of the reporters have written in relation to his prospects of rehabilitation.  
        
       
       
        
        4. I accept the support that has been proffered by his family and community in relation to the way they see his future, for the offender is a young man in need of supervision, direction and involvement. He needs direction in relation to anger management, alcohol abuse, and the psychological assistance of which Ms Robilliard speaks.  
        
       
      
     5. That the pre-meditation upon the offence was short term.  
     
      
       
        
        6. The offender is a young man, well regarded by family and community.  
        
       
       
        
        7. The violence in the Green-Mundine fight which was telecast that night appeared to have moved a number of persons in the streets of Broken Hill to violence as there were a number of fights, but did not necessarily involve this offender, to which the police were called after the Green-Mundine fight was over. I make this comment in saying that I am of the view that any premeditation was limited.  
        
       
      
     8. It is the offender’s first custodial sentence.  
     
      
     9. The offender has put himself into protective custody.”  
     
      
    40 His Honour then went on to say (ROS at 13): 
     
      
       
        
        “It has been submitted that I should find special circumstances. For the same reasons that I have found for not sentencing the offender to the seven years non-parole period, for those same reasons I find special circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    41 His Honour then sentenced the respondent to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years 6 months. The effect of his Honour’s finding of special circumstances was to increase the balance of term of the sentence from the statutory ratio of 1 year 3 months to 2 years 6 months with a corresponding reduction in the non-parole period from 3 years 9 months to 2 years 6 months. The same matters which were said to justify a departure from the standard non-parole period of 7 years resulted in the alteration of the statutory ratio under ss 44(1) and (2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The approach adopted by his Honour and the non-parole period which was set suggests that the same matters which had been taken into account in departing from the standard non-parole period were then taken into account as special circumstances in further reducing the non-parole period. It was, in my respectful opinion, erroneous for his Honour to ‘double count’ in this way. I am satisfied that the second ground of individual error alleged by the Crown has been established.  
     
      
    42 The Crown next argued that his Honour placed undue emphasis on the respondent’s subjective factors such as rehabilitation although he continued to deny responsibility for the offence. The respondent on the other hand submitted that the sentencing Judge, in a difficult sentencing exercise, balanced the objective gravity of the offence with the circumstances of the respondent and arrived at a sentence which was open to him. 43 His Honour correctly identified the commission of the offence by the respondent whilst he was subject to conditional liberty for an offence which had involved violence to be a factor of aggravation and noted that little contrition had been shown by his denial of involvement. However, his Honour accepted that the respondent who was 20 years old at the time of the commission of the offence had good prospects of rehabilitation if he overcame his alcohol abuse and dealt with his anger management issues. There was evidence that the respondent whilst on bail had taken positive steps towards his rehabilitation in the 18 months which had elapsed between the commission of the offence and the trial. He had obtained employment in the mining industry. His Honour found that the respondent had taken “very positive and big steps in maturing,” had “settled into the work place” since the offence and was a young man ”well regarded by family and community”. All of these findings were open to his Honour on the evidence.  
     
      
    44 The prospects of rehabilitation have long been recognised as an important consideration in sentencing of offenders and the promotion of the rehabilitation of the offender is one of seven purposes of punishment set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Important as the positive steps taken by the respondent towards his rehabilitation and his relatively young age were in the sentencing exercise, it was incumbent upon the sentencing Judge not to give undue weight to these considerations in the balancing process and to have proper regard to the serious objective circumstances of the respondent’s offending and to all of the purposes of punishment in s 3A. 
     
      
    45 In R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 Hunt CJ at CL said at 469 (with whom McInerney and Sully J J agreed):  
     
      
       
        
        “What all those principles make clear is that rehabilitation (or reform) – the hope that the offender will be released back into the community a better person than when he or she left it – is only one of the purposes of punishment and that, even when some measure of rehabilitation has been achieved, such a subjective consideration remains necessarily subsidiary to the need for the sentence to act as a deterrent to the public.” 
        
       
      
    46 Where there has been a gang attack upon a single victim, sentencing Judges, in my view, should ordinarily give more weight to considerations of personal and general deterrence, the protection of the community and denunciation than to rehabilitation. Gang attacks invariably involve multiple acts of viciousness, randomly directed at the victim’s person with the high potential of serious injury being inflicted.  
     
      
    47 Whilst his Honour referred to “the requirements for general and specific deterrence” as necessitating a sentence of imprisonment, it seems to me that his Honour gave too much weight to the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation. I am satisfied that the third ground of individual error alleged by the Crown has been established. 
     
      
    48 Although error has been identified, the question to be determined is whether the sentence is manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
    49 The maximum penalty for the offence for which the respondent had been found guilty by the jury is 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The objective and subjective features referred to by his Honour, in my respectful opinion, did not justify in the circumstances of the case the substantial departure from the standard non-parole period to a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months and inappropriate ‘double counting’ occurred. Too much weight was given by his Honour to the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation and the sentence imposed does not adequately reflect the gravity of the offence. This was a serious crime. At the respondent’s instigation the victim who was walking alone in the early hours of the morning was viciously attacked by the respondent and his fellow assailants. The victim was bashed and left unconscious. The respondent at the time was subject to a good behaviour bond for an offence of common assault. To my mind, a sentence of 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months is not merely lenient but is manifestly inadequate. The non-parole period “must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence”: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [63]. In this case, the non-parole set by his Honour failed to do so.  
     
      
       
      Intervention 
       
      
    50 Even if error is shown, this Court has a discretion to refuse to intervene and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, the Court is to have regard to the double jeopardy that the convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal. 
     
      
    51 The respondent submitted that the Court should exercise its discretion not to intervene as the offence was committed on 18 May 2006 and the Crown appeal was not heard until 12 December 2008 during which time the respondent has lived with the uncertainty of outcome.  
     
      
    52 The uncertainty which the respondent faced prior to the jury’s verdict was a consequence of his pleas of not guilty and the present uncertainty as to whether the term of the sentence is to be increased is an inevitable consequence of most Crown appeals. This is not a case where there has been delay by the Crown in the prosecution of the appeal nor is it a case where a non-custodial sentence was imposed by the sentencing Judge. I am not of the opinion in the circumstances of this case that the Court should exercise its discretion not to intervene.  
     
      
    53 I am satisfied that the Crown appeal should be upheld.  
     
      
    Re-sentencing  
     
      
    54 When re-sentencing, the Court is obliged to have regard to the principles of double jeopardy and to the obligation to impose the minimum sentence which a Court might have imposed at first instance rather than a sentence that the Court itself considers to be the appropriate sentence.  
     
      
    55 I have concluded that the minimum sentence that might have been imposed is a term of imprisonment of 5 years 6 months consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years 2 months with a balance of term of 2 years 4 months.  
     
      
    56 The finding that the offence fell slightly outside the middle range of objective seriousness and the respondent’s subjective features justify the departure from the standard non-parole period and the balance of term reflects the special circumstances of the respondent’s first time in custody and the nature of the custody.  
     
      
    57 Accordingly the orders that I propose are:  
     
      
       
      (1) The sentence is set aside. 
      
     (2) The conviction is confirmed.  
     
      
      (3) The respondent is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 years 6 months consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years 2 months commencing on 29 November 2007 and expiring on 28 January 2011 with a balance of term of 2 years 4 months commencing on 29 January 2011 and expiring on 28 May 2013.  
       
       
      The earliest date on which the respondent will be eligible for release to parole is 28 January 2011.

    2 HISLOP J:  
     
      
       
      Introduction 
       
       
      This is a conviction appeal. The grounds of appeal contained in the notice of appeal are: 
       
       
        
        “1. The conduct of counsel in raising the issue and adducing evidence of the appellant’s criminal convictions and bad character gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        2. His Honour’s failure to direct the jury about the permissible uses of the evidence of the appellant’s criminal convictions gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        3. His Honour’s summing up involved a factual error which gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    3 The appellant was charged on indictment on the following counts: 
     
      
       
      Count 1 
       
        
        “On 8 July 2005 at Parramatta being in the dwelling house of [the complainant] he did commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely, intimidation and did break out of that dwelling house in circumstances of aggravation, namely, he was in company with [another]”, contrary to the  
        Crimes Act 
        , 1900 s 112(2); and, in the alternative 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 
         
        “On 8 July 2005 at Parramatta he did enter the dwelling house of [the complainant] with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely to intimidate, in circumstances of aggravation, namely he was in company with [another]”, contrary to the  
        Crimes Act 
        ,1900, s 111(2). 
        
       
       
      The appellant pleaded not guilty to each count. 
       
      
    4 During the course of the trial, the Crown withdrew count 1 and on 13 December 2006 the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the statutory (s 115A) alternative to count 2, namely that the appellant entered the dwelling house of the complainant with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely to intimidate, contrary to the Crimes Act, 1900, s 111(1). The maximum penalty for that offence is 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    5 On 8 June 2007 the appellant was sentenced in respect of that offence to two years six months imprisonment with a non parole period of 20 months commencing on 4 December 2006. The non parole period expired on 3 August 2008. The appellant has been released to parole. 
     
      
       
      The evidence 
       
      
    6 The complainant resided in Unit 28 of a block of units. The appellant frequently stayed at the block of units with a friend who lived in Unit 18. 
     
      
    7 The evidence in the Crown case is shortly summarised hereunder: 
     
      
       
      The complainant 
       
      
    8 The complainant gave evidence that: 
     
      
       
      (a) On Monday 4 July 2005 the appellant made a complaint to him about the level of noise being made by him. The complainant said that he was soon leaving the block of units, to which the appellant replied “Good riddance”. 
       
       
      (b) On the evening of 8 July 2005, the complainant heard a banging on his front door. He opened the door 20-30 cms. The appellant and another man were there. The appellant said “We had a discussion about the noise complaints before”. The appellant pushed the door, leaned in and head butted the complainant, his lips touched the complainant’s. The complainant said “What are you doing, are you trying to kiss me?” The appellant then pushed the front door open and grabbed the complainant and pushed him back against the wall which was a distance of about 3-4 metres. The complainant was pressed up against the wall.  
       
       
      (c) The appellant said that he was going to kill the complainant with a syringe of coke. He grabbed the complainant’s head, he pushed his head into the brick wall. The appellant hit the complainant’s head, he went to do it a second time. The complainant blocked it with his hand. The appellant was pointing his finger at the complainant, almost poked him in the eye with his index finger. The appellant walked back to the front door to close it but left it just ajar approximately 5 cms. The appellant said he was in charge of all the drugs in Kings Cross and said ‘Do you know who I am?’ His friend was saying ‘Don’t tell him’. The appellant was becoming very aggressive. 
       
       
      (d) The complainant said he did not give permission to the appellant to enter his unit. He said to the appellant: “Get out of my house, what are you doing, get out of my house.”  
       
       
      (e) The complainant suffered a cut just above his cheek and a few lumps, no bruising.  
       
       
      (f) The complainant denied consuming or selling drugs to anyone on the premises and denied that he had been charged with any drug offences. In cross examination he admitted he had taken drugs but not during the first half of 2005. He denied the appellant had had a conversation with him in February 2005 about the supply of drugs from unit 28. 
       
       
      Mr and Ms Baudemont 
       
      
    9 (a) Mr and Ms Baudemont resided at Unit 26. Mr Baudemont gave evidence that on the night of 8 July 2005 he heard a very loud knocking on the door of the complainant’s unit. He opened his door and saw the complainant open his own door and the appellant grabbing the complainant by his t-shirt and pushing him inside the unit. He heard the complainant say to the appellant “Get the fuck out of my house”. He saw the appellant punch the complainant. 
     
      
       
      (b) In cross examination he elaborated on this answer and said he didn’t actually see a punch, he saw the appellant’s arm moving forward and saw the complainant’s head flicking back and heard the complainant say “What did you do that for?” 
       
       
      (c) In cross examination, Mr Baudemont said that he saw inside the flat the appellant holding the complainant by the neck against the wall and they were speaking loudly and arguing. He said the wall was about two metres away from the door and that he had a clear view of this incident.  
       
       
      (d) Ms Baudemont gave evidence that she noticed the man from Unit 18 was knocking or banging the door very loud at unit 28. She asked her brother to “Stay in and close the door”. She then began looking through the peep hole and saw the man from unit 18 pushing the complainant inside the unit and she heard the complainant say “Get the fuck out of my house”. She said the man from unit 18 was with another man and she saw the other man closing the door and did not hear anything for a few minutes. She then called the police because she was afraid of what would happen to the complainant. The police arrived ten minutes later.  
       
       
      Peter Bilokin 
       
      
    10 Peter Bilokin was with Mr and Mrs Baudemont. He gave evidence he heard a loud bang and the words “Get the fuck out of my house”. He saw the appellant standing in the doorway of unit 28. That was the last thing he saw before Mr Baudemont closed the door to the unit. 
     
      
       
      Ms Michalsky 
       
      
    11 Ms Michalsky resided in Unit 27. She gave evidence that on the night in question she saw two men standing outside the door of unit 28. She said she saw the men, one of whom was the appellant, step into the unit “and from there I heard a lot of banging against the wall and a lot of screaming”. She said one thing that stood out to her was that she was pretty certain that the appellant shouted out “I’ll get a syringe and I’ll put it in your arm, would you like a syringe in your arm? Go get the syringe.”  
     
      
       
      Jodie Saul 
       
      
    12 Jodie Saul also resided in Unit 27. She said she saw the appellant arrive in the carpark that evening and come upstairs with another man. She heard somebody asking which unit to go to and they knocked on unit 28. She heard yelling outside the door to unit 28 and the door to unit 28 opened. She heard them go inside and slam the door and there was a lot of yelling and banging going on. She heard something banging on the wall. She heard mention of syringes. She heard the appellant say he “would get a needle and stick it in his arm”. She saw the appellant leave the unit and there was another man still inside. The appellant walked downstairs and came back about five minutes later. She saw the police arrive. 
     
      
       
      Constables Mooney and Ford 
       
      
    13 Constable Mooney gave evidence that he and Const Ford arrived at unit 28 at about 8.20 pm on 8 July 2005. He looked inside the unit and saw the complainant standing with his back pressed up against a wall. He saw the appellant standing right up against the complainant and he had his arms raised so that his elbows were bent and his arms outstretched towards the complainant. It appeared that the appellant was holding the complainant around his upper chest area. He noticed that the complainant appeared terrified. This evidence was supported by Constable Ford.  
     
      
       
      Detective Sendt 
       
      
    14 Detective Sendt was the officer in charge of the investigation. He attended at unit 28 at about 8.50 pm on 8 July 2005. He saw the complainant, whose hands were trembling and who had a small cut and redness to his forehead. He charged the appellant and at the time he charged him he was aware of his criminal record. He gave evidence as to his investigations. 
     
      
    15 The evidence in the appellant’s case is shortly summarised hereunder. 
     
      
       
      The appellant 
       
      
    16 The appellant gave evidence that: 
     
      
       
      (a) He was born in 1965. In 2005 he used to visit a friend who lived at the block of units. In January 2005 he had noticed unfamiliar people in the car park whom he described as “junkies”. He found some syringes in the toilet near the car park of the unit. In February 2005 he saw people walking into that toilet and injecting. He also saw people injecting in a car. He formed the opinion that the complainant was dealing in some form of intravenous drugs. 
       
       
      (b) He complained to the caretaker of the block of units about the presence of syringes at these locations. He also complained to the police and Parramatta Council but they were not interested in his complaints. He complained to the landlord of the block of units. 
       
       
      (c) In February 2005, after he had made those complaints, he confronted the complainant about the syringes. He said: “Listen you fuckin’ piece of shit, it’s like junkie central up there…What the fuck’s going on?” The complainant replied: “It’s my fuckin’ business, I’ll do what I like in my unit’. The appellant responded “Well I’ll make it my fuckin’ business when a fuckin’ child might step on a syringe.” The appellant said to the complainant “You might want to consider pulling back a bit because I’m not going to have a kid step on a syringe.” The complainant said “I’ve got a relative up at Parramatta Police Station he’s a detective so don’t worry about me, I’m tied up with big people.” The appellant then said “Well listen you fucking smart arse. I’ll video tape the faces coming up and down the stairs and I’ll walk into ICAC and play the fucking tape on the thing. You want to be a fucking smart arse, I’ll show you what a smart arse is.” The appellant went on to say “I might add I did tell him who I was.” 
       
       
      (d) In cross examination the Crown referred to the conversation which the appellant alleged he had had with the complainant in February 2005: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. You told him who you were? 
           
          A. That’s right. 
           
           
          Q. Because you wanted to put fear into him, didn’t you? 
           
          A. Yes. 
           
           
          Q. Just like after you barged into the unit you said to him words to the effect ‘I control the drugs in King Cross. I’m going to get a needle or syringe full of heroin and stick it.’ 
           
          A. I’m tied up in the building industry, I leave the drug industry to the fucking rats.”  
          
         
        
       
       
      (e) On 8 July 2005 the appellant went up to the complainant’s unit on three occasions and entered the unit on two of those occasions. He, Mr Colburn and Ms Wall had left the Granville Hotel at about 8.15 pm. The complainant’s utility was parked in Ms Wall’s car space. The appellant walked up to unit 28 and knocked loudly on the complainant’s door. This was the first visit that night. He asked the complainant: “Is that your ute down in Miss Wall’s car space?” The complainant said “Yeah. I’ve just come to clean the stove.” The appellant asked the complainant if he could move his ute out and the complainant said he was only there for ten minutes and then he’d never see him again. The appellant then said “Good”. 
       
       
      (f) On that occasion the appellant was standing face to face with the complainant at the door. He then walked downstairs and started peeling vegetables. 
       
       
      (g) Shortly thereafter the appellant walked to the opening of Ms Wall’s balcony door and saw three capped syringes and one uncapped syringe on the balcony. The four syringes were tendered as Exhibit 7. The appellant believed that the complainant was selling heroin. 
       
       
      (h) The appellant had a discussion with Ms Wall and said to her about the syringes: “They’d have to come from upstairs. Well, of course, there was twenty people out on the balcony last night screaming and yelling abuse at everybody.” Colburn said to the appellant “Is that guy a drug dealer upstairs?” The appellant said “Well as far as I know yes.” Colburn said to the appellant “I need to get some speed. I’ve got a twelve hour shift at work tomorrow.” The appellant told Mr Colburn in colourful terms to stay behind at Ms Wall’s unit. 
       
       
      (i) The appellant then went back up to unit 28 and knocked loudly on the door four times. This was the second visit and the first entry. The appellant and the complainant were standing toe to toe at the door way and the following conversation ensued: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Appellant: Listen you fucking maggot, what’s the fucking story with the syringes on the balcony? 
           
          [Complainant]: What syringes, what are you talking about? 
           
           
          Appellant: Listen don’t fucking lie. The syringes on the balcony down stairs, you piece of shit. You can come and pick the fucking things up. 
           
          [Complainant]: The syringes aren’t mine. Look come inside and I’ll show you.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (j) The appellant and the complainant walked to the complainant’s balcony, unlocked the door, the complainant asked the appellant “How could the syringes come from this balcony down to your balcony?” The appellant then asked his friend Mr Annam how many syringes were on his balcony, Mr Annam answered “Four”. The appellant then said “See there’s four fucking syringes on my balcony.” 
       
       
      (k) The appellant and the complainant had further words about whether the syringes came from the complainant’s balcony. The appellant asked the complainant for the keys to his car. The appellant then went and moved the complainant’s ute from Ms Wall’s car space. The appellant went back to Ms Wall’s unit and told her to move her car into her own car space. 
       
       
      (l) He then went back up to unit 28. This was the third visit and the second entry. The appellant said he walked in and the complainant and Mr Colburn were “talking drugs”. He said that the complainant was talking to Mr Colburn about how he might be able to get some speed for Mr Colburn. 
       
       
      (m) He then “walked straight up to [the complainant’s] face.” He was about 20 cms away from it. He then said to the complainant: “Why did you move the furniture out last night from eleven to four in the morning?…What was going on up here?” The complainant said “Well that was pay back to all the people that had made written noise complaints about me.” The appellant then said “and the syringes you threw on the balcony were a pay back to me, weren’t they?” 
       
       
      (n) He saw the police arrive at unit 28 and described a conversation with them. He made no admissions to the police. 
       
       
      (o) He denied that he head butted or poked or punched the complainant. He denied he banged the complainant’s head against the wall or threatened his life or threatened him with a syringe. He admitted that he was angry with the complainant. 
       
       
      (p) In short the appellant suggested that he had been invited into the unit by the complainant on two occasions. He said it was not his intention to intimidate the complainant. Rather, it was his intention to question him about whether he was responsible for placing syringes on Ms Wall’s balcony and also to ensure that he moved his ute.  
       
       
      Dawn Wall 
       
      
    17 (a) Dawn Wall resided in unit 18. She gave evidence that the appellant was a regular visitor to her unit - about two or three times a week if he had business in Sydney. She noticed in about January 2005 there were a lot of visitors, who looked unsavoury, who visited the block of flats. She believed that they were junkies who were buying drugs from the person in unit 28. She also complained that she had constant difficulties with her parking space. 
     
      
       
      (b) The appellant had told Miss Wall in February 2005 about a conversation he had with the occupant of unit 28 about needles being left around the toilet area. She also said she found a syringe near her car. 
       
       
      (c) On the evening of 7 July 2005 there was a lot of noise from unit 28 and people carrying things down stairs and furniture moving. She said that a number of occupants were complaining about the noise coming from unit 28 and she saw someone kick a big hole in the door of unit 28. 
       
       
      (d) At about 8.30 pm on 8 July she returned to her unit and saw a white ute parked in her car space. She said that the appellant told her that the ute might belong to the new tenant in unit 28 because he knew that was now vacant. 
       
       
      (e) She said that the appellant went up to unit 28 and returned about five minutes later and said it was the occupant of unit 28 and he was cleaning his premises. The appellant said that the occupant of unit 28 was going to move his ute and that he would be leaving shortly. 
       
       
      (f) The appellant then went back to cooking a roast for dinner. She said she then noticed four syringes on her balcony, three capped and one uncapped. She told the appellant “There are syringes on the balcony.” The appellant then said that he would go up and see the occupant of unit 28. He said “That person, he’s put them there. He can come down and clean them up.” She also said that Mr Colburn expressed an interest in going up to unit 28 to purchase drugs. The appellant ordered him not to go. 
       
       
      (g) The appellant then went to unit 28 on a second occasion that night. Shortly after he left she heard the appellant out on the balcony of unit 28 calling down and saying “Norm, how many syringes are down there”” Mr Annam replied “There are four.” 
       
       
      (h) About five to ten minutes later the appellant returned to unit 18 and said that Ms Wall could park her car. He also said that he had asked the complainant about the syringes and the complainant denied that they were his. The appellant said that Mr Colburn was still up in the unit and “he [the appellant] was going to go back up and have another word with [the complainant] about removing the syringes”. Ms Wall then received a call about half an hour later from the appellant saying he had been arrested and was on his way to Parramatta Police Station and asked her to pick up the four syringes. She did so.  
       
       
      Norman Annam 
       
      
    18 Norman Annam gave evidence that on the evening of 8 July 2005 the appellant had said to him that he was going upstairs to ask the neighbour to move his car. Shortly after the appellant returned, he saw four syringes on Ms Wall’s balcony. The appellant then said that he was going upstairs again to ask “the fellow” to come down and remove them. He said that when the appellant was in unit 28 he heard the appellant’s voice shouting out from there to go out on the balcony and the appellant asked him how many syringes there were and he said “Four”.  
     
      
       
      Allan Merriman 
       
      
    19 Allan Merriman did the building and maintenance work for the units. He gave evidence of a conversation he had with the appellant in February 2005 which was that the appellant had said that he thought the person in the unit above him (unit 28) was dealing in drugs and he had found people using drugs in the car park. Merriman said he had found syringes around the property. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    20 The notice of appeal was filed on behalf of the appellant by the Legal Aid Commission. The appellant’s submissions were signed by senior counsel retained by the Legal Aid Commission on his behalf. 
     
      
    21 The appellant appeared in person at the hearing of the appeal. There was no appearance for him by any legal representative. He explained to the Court: 
     
      
       
        
        “I actually had legal aid handling this matter. I only recently came out of gaol. Alex Howen [appellant’s trial counsel] had a few hiccups and I am not going to have him kicked to death. I come here today because I am not going to have legal aid kick someone to death, so I have come here. The judge was not correct in a lot of his directions.” 
        
       
      
    22 The appellant did not speak to the written submissions, which he observed were not signed by him. He did not raise any new ground of appeal. He stressed on a number of occasions that his former counsel was a good man and that he would not see him slandered. However, he did not formally withdraw any part of the appeal. Accordingly, each of the three grounds stated in the notice of appeal is considered hereunder. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The conduct of counsel in raising the issue and adducing evidence of the appellant’s criminal convictions and bad character gave rise to a miscarriage of justice 
       
      
    23 The appellant had a criminal record which relevantly included a conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, demand property with menaces and two convictions for intimidation.  
     
      
    24 Counsel for the appellant, in opening to the jury, referred to the fact that the appellant had a criminal record including a conviction for intimidation. He cross examined the police officers in respect of the fact the appellant had a criminal record. The appellant himself gave evidence which referred to at least one of his convictions. Appellant’s counsel referred to the appellant’s criminal history in his final address. 
     
      
    25 The Criminal Appeal Act, 1912 s 6(1) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion …that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice…provided that the court may…dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.” 
        
       
      
    26 It was submitted in the written submissions for the appellant that, by reason of the incompetence of trial counsel, a miscarriage of justice had occurred in consequence of which this Court should set aside the conviction. The miscarriage of justice, it was submitted, resulted from the unnecessary adducing of evidence of the appellant’s criminal record and the repeated references to that criminal record in the appellant’s counsel’s opening and closing address.  
     
      
    27 The following principles are applicable: 
     
      
       
      (a) A trial may have been unfair, leading to a miscarriage of justice, by reason of the manner in which counsel appearing for the accused conducted the defence ( 
      Seymour v R 
       [2006] NSWCCA 206; (2006) 162 A Crim R 576); 
       
       
      (b) The “flagrant incompetence” of trial counsel may give rise to a miscarriage of justice ( 
      R v Birks 
       (1990) 19 NSWLR 677); 
       
       
      (c) The inquiry about miscarriage must be an objective inquiry -  
      Nudd v The Queen 
       [2006] HCA 9; (2006) 225 ALR 161, per Gummow and Hayne JJ at [27]. 
       
       
      (d) The question is whether there  
      could  
      be a reasonable explanation for the course that was adopted at trial. If there could be such an explanation, it follows from the fundamental nature of a criminal trial as an adversarial and accusatorial process that no miscarriage of justice is shown to have occurred -  
      Ali v The Queen 
       [2005] HCA 8; (2005) 214 ALR 1 per Hayne J (with whom Gummow J agreed) at [25]. 
       
       
      (e) The appellant must show that the failing or error of counsel was a material irregularity and there is a significant possibility that it affected the outcome of the trial -  
      TKWJ v R 
       [2002] HCA 46; (2002) 212 CLR 124 per McHugh J at [79]. 
       
       
      (f) In the context of the adversarial system of justice, unfairness does not exist simply because an apparently rational decision by trial counsel, as to what evidence to call or not to call, is regarded by an appellate court as having worked to the possible, or even probable, disadvantage of the accused. For a trial to be fair, it is not necessary that every tactical decision of counsel be carefully considered, or wise ( 
      TKWJ  
      per Gleeson CJ at [16]). 
       
       
      (g) Regard may be had, inter alia, to the opening address of counsel for the appellant and statements of intention during the course of the trial to determine the tactical result sought to be achieved -  
      Seymour 
       at [37], [39]. 
       
      
    28 The initial questions for determination are whether there could be a reasonable and rational explanation for counsel’s disclosure of the appellant’s criminal record and whether there is a significant possibility that counsel’s action affected the outcome of the trial adversely to the appellant. 
     
      
    29 The written submissions for the appellant asserted there was no rational or reasonable explanation for trial counsel to open to the jury on the appellant’s criminal convictions or to elicit evidence of those criminal convictions from the police for the following reasons: 
     
      
       
      (a) Trial counsel had been informed by the Crown that the complainant had no previous convictions and that he had no drug criminal history. It was not necessary for the appellant to prove or raise a doubt about whether the complainant himself sold drugs.  
       
       
      (b) It was completely unnecessary for trial counsel to raise the issue of the appellant’s previous criminal convictions in his opening address when his Honour had not given any ruling on the matter. This was particularly so as counsel maintained the position that the Crown would still need leave to cross examine the appellant on his previous criminal convictions.  
       
       
      (c) Even if trial counsel’s decision to question the complainant about whether he sold drugs was rational or reasonable, this would not have been a proper basis upon which to permit the adducing of the appellant’s prior criminal convictions.  
       
       
      (d) Adducing evidence of the complainant’s alleged previous drug dealings would not have permitted the Crown to obtain leave under s 104(4)(b) to cross examine the appellant about his prior criminal convictions because such evidence would not establish he had a tendency to be untruthful. In any event, there was no “evidence” adduced of that fact - only questions which were denied.  
       
       
      (e) There was no forensic advantage to the appellant in adducing evidence from the police regarding the appellant’s past criminal history. First, there was little really in dispute between the appellant and the police. The police came too late to witness the critical events. Secondly, the extreme prejudice occasioned by disclosure of the appellant’s criminal record overwhelmed any possible minor forensic advantage gained in relation to any bias against the appellant.  
       
      
    30 Background matters apparent from the transcript and bearing on this issue are: 
     
      
       
      (a) The complainant’s evidence, if accepted, would result in the appellant’s conviction. That evidence was supported, in varying degrees, by the seemingly independent evidence of a number of persons either residing or present in the unit building at the time and the evidence of the police constables who attended. The appellant denied the allegations against him and was prepared to give evidence in support of that denial. There was some assistance for him in the evidence of Ms Wall and Mr Annam though they were not independent witnesses and their evidence did not extend to observations of what occurred in or outside the door of unit 28. It was, on the face of it, a strong Crown case. As appellant’s counsel said to the jury in his opening, the Crown believes, based on the witnesses he has, that “it is really simple, open and shut”. 
       
       
      (b) The Crown case depended to a considerable extent upon the evidence of the complainant. If the complainant’s credibility could be destroyed, the appellant would have prospects of successfully defending the charges. Those prospects would be enhanced if inconsistencies in the evidence of the witnesses could be exploited in cross examination and if the police evidence could be attacked. 
       
       
      (c) The appellant gave written instructions to his counsel that the complainant engaged in drug dealing activities, that he had observed what he concluded, on reasonable grounds, was drug trafficking activity in the block of units emanating from unit 28, that people were observed injecting drugs, that syringes were found on the balcony of the unit below, that the appellant had spoken to the complainant about the syringes and about his observations of drug dealing activity in the building. Thus an available strategy for the defence would be to attempt to destroy the complainant’s credibility by suggesting he was involved in the supply of illegal drugs.  
       
       
      (d) The appellant also was of the opinion that because of the appellant’s criminal record the police had not diligently investigated the complaint made against him.  
       
       
      (e) The Crown informed appellant’s counsel that if such issues were raised it would seek to cross examine the appellant on character. If the Crown was permitted to introduce evidence of the appellant’s prior convictions, including convictions for intimidation, for the first time in cross examination, almost certainly it would be destructive of the appellant’s case. 
       
       
      (f) The matter was raised with his Honour by appellant’s counsel. His Honour, without finally ruling on the question, said, inter alia,  
       
       
        
         
          
          “My tentative view is that if you [the appellant] simply say in evidence in chief I saw all these things, I saw the people shooting up, I saw the syringes, I was worried about it, that’s evidence of the factual matters, it’s not impugning the credit of [the complainant]. If you’re not going to say ‘You, [the complainant] are a drug dealer’, then I think at the moment you’re safe but once you go over the line I think you then open yourself up. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          [COUNSEL]: …I can do everything your Honour has described, just dealing exactly with the factual matrix of what was seen, that’s not difficult but there are conversations between my client and [the complainant] which are problematic because the content effectively…my concern is the minute I put to [the complainant] the conversations, not the observations, observations are easy, the conversations as per my instructions…there’s an inference that there’s an allegation against him of being involved in drugs, not just observations of activities in the unit… 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          HIS HONOUR: Once you do that you’ve got a problem in my view.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The Crown indicated that it did not disagree with anything which had fallen from his Honour: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “HIS HONOUR: This is really going to set the ground rules. I’m concerned that he’s able to challenge the factual matrix but once you start on his instructions to go beyond that into the next level, then there’s a penalty and I can’t see any way of avoiding that one frankly.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Appellant’s counsel submitted, for the record, that his Honour was incorrect in the view which he had expressed. He submitted that the appellant should be permitted, without penalty, to raise the matters he had outlined for the purpose of fairly meeting the accuser and the allegations in the Crown case. 
        
       
       
      (g) Appellant’s counsel said he would “still maintain that the Crown will have to seek leave to cross examine [the appellant] on these matters.” 
       
      
    31 Appellant’s counsel said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I note your Honour’s comments and that if - I’ll work on the basis that if there was a formal ruling, that’s what the formal ruling will be and that will have an affect on my opening and the matters that follow, I thank your Honour for the adequate opportunity I’ve had for the submissions…I’m instructed that it won’t be possible to run the extent of the defence that’s required without crossing the line…You’ll hear my opening - you’ll hear it but it will lock my client into a particular position in the opening…” 
        
       
      
    32 Appellant’s counsel had instructions to adopt the strategy which was previously mentioned and which carried with it the risk of the appellant being cross examined as to his character. Unlike in Seymour’s case [27], the instructions to pursue this strategy were not obviously the work of the appellant’s legal advisers. The appellant’s strong personal feelings on this aspect, which were apparent in his evidence and in interjections made by him during the trial, strongly suggests that the appellant may have requested counsel to follow the strategy adopted irrespective of advice from his counsel as to whether such a course was in his best interests. The suggested strategy was also to be used to assist in undermining the police evidence. 
     
      
    33 Having determined his strategy, appellant’s counsel opened the appellant’s case to the jury and, as earlier indicated, referred to the fact the appellant had criminal convictions which included a conviction for intimidation. Counsel thereafter adhered to this strategy. 
     
      
    34 On 6 December 2006 the Crown Prosecutor indicated that he wished to cross examine the appellant in respect of three matters relating to his prior convictions. His Honour, having considered the factors under s 192 of the Evidence Act, held he would not permit the Crown to lead any evidence on the appellant’s prior convictions. 
     
      
    35 The strategy adopted by appellant’s counsel was carefully weighed and considered by him. He embarked upon it with the appellant’s express instructions to do so. The appellant, it would seem, felt very strongly in relation to what he considered to be the actions of the complainant in dealing drugs and creating risk in respect of abandoned needles. As his Honour observed, counsel had opened on his bad character to the jury on the basis of specific instructions and on the basis of a clear forensic decision. 
     
      
    36 In my opinion, it would be inappropriate to categorise counsel’s decision as flagrant incompetence. On the contrary, it was a carefully considered forensic decision. Counsel’s conduct represented a legitimate choice which a competent counsel could fairly make in the circumstances of the trial and viewed objectively it was a rational tactical decision in the particular forensic situation in which it was made. Further, it has not been established there was a significant possibility that the jury impermissibly relied upon the appellant’s criminal history as evidence of guilt. 
     
      
    37 The fact that ultimately cross examination of the appellant on his record was not permitted and he was convicted does not establish that a miscarriage of justice occurred. 
     
      
    38 In my opinion, this ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: His Honour’s failure to direct the jury about the permissible uses of the evidence of the appellant’s criminal convictions gave rise to a miscarriage of justice 
       
      
    39 Following upon the completion of the evidence of Det Sendt, his Honour made the following comments to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is just one thing that came up in the course of Det Sendt’s evidence which I would re-emphasise. There was reference made whether the accused had a criminal history and the answer given was, in my view, perfectly correct and I think everybody here would agree with it but it’s something I will need to direct you about. That is that in dealing with a person with a criminal history, that is basically irrelevant to your consideration of the facts of this particular matter. As Det Sendt said, and I will be saying to you again, anything that he Mr Clee may have done in the past is irrelevant in your consideration of the evidence. If you just bear that in mind, as I say, I am not either endorsing or denying or in any way criticising or accepting Det Sendt’s evidence. That, as with all the other evidence, is entirely a matter for you but on that matter if you could just bear that in mind very strongly, thank you.”  
        
       
      
    40 In his summing up, his Honour directed the jury that: 
     
      
       
        
        “…I am going to be giving you directions, in particular three areas, on firstly the use you can make of the accused’s prior record and the evidence you have heard about his character and behaviour. 
        
       
       
        
        Now I have already said to you and you will recall at the end of Det Const Sendt’s evidence, when there was reference made to the fact, as there was both by his counsel and by other witnesses during the proceedings, that he Mr Clee has had a criminal record, has been involved in other matters. I think his counsel referred to him as either unlovable or unlovely, using an appropriate rhetorical flourish. 
        
       
       
        
        But the reality is, as I have said to you then and I will repeat now to you very strongly, the fact that a person has a criminal history or criminal past or may have been involved in such activities is completely irrelevant to your consideration of these particular charges and the evidence in relation to it. In particular you must not jump to the conclusion or indeed accept that there’s any tendency on his behalf to have behaved in any kind of criminal manner. You must consider your verdict according to the evidence only in relation to this particular charge.” 
        
       
      
    41 His Honour later in his summing up reminded the jury of the evidence of Det Sendt, and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Again, in relation to that evidence, I remind you of what I said before, not to and reiterate it very strongly ladies and gentlemen, not to take any account of any references to prior criminal history - that being indicative of any kind of tendency whatsoever.” 
        
       
      
    42 His Honour stressed in his summing up that the burden of proof on all elements rested throughout upon the Crown. 
     
      
    43 It was submitted in the appellant’s written submissions that his Honour, in his summing up to the jury: 
     
      
       
      (a) did not state that his prior criminal convictions were irrelevant (which was what the jury was originally directed). They were told that the convictions were not relevant to prove the appellant’s tendency. However, the jury was not given any assistance as to how they could permissibly use that evidence. The jury may have believed that the evidence was admissible because it corroborated the complainant’s evidence or because it undermined the appellant’s evidence; 
       
       
      (b) did not clearly direct the jury about the permissible uses of that evidence. That omission also denied the appellant a real chance of acquittal. 
       
      
    44 In my opinion, the overall effect of his Honour’s directions was to inform the jury in strong terms that such evidence was irrelevant. There was no risk, in the light of his Honour’s directions, that the jury would impermissibly rely upon that evidence as showing that the appellant was the sort of person who would engage in the conduct the subject of the charges and would use it as evidence of guilt. 
     
      
    45 That the jury had regard to his Honour’s directions is further exemplified by the fact that it took three days to reach its verdict and in so doing rejected a finding of guilt on the primary charge. 
     
      
    46 Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.” 
        
       
      
    47 Counsel had discussed the proposed directions with his Honour in the absence of the jury. The directions were then given and no objection was taken to them nor were any further directions sought. This is indicative that in the atmosphere of the trial there was not apparent any reasonable ground of concern as to the fairness and adequacy of the directions. In these circumstances, leave under r 4 is refused. 
     
      
    48 In any event, there was no miscarriage of justice in this regard. In my opinion, this ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: His Honour’s summing up involved a factual error which gave rise to a miscarriage of justice 
       
      
    49 The appellant gave evidence, in chief, of a conversation with the complainant in February 2005 in which he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. …And I might add I did tell him who I was. He pulled up, there was - obviously the activity was still going on, but the syringes in the car park stopped and the shooting up in the toilets stopped to a - well I never saw it after that anyway.” 
        
       
      
    50 In cross examination the following exchange occurred in relation to the February 2005 conversation between the appellant and the complainant: 
     
      
       
        
        CROWN: “So you told him who you were?” 
         
        APPELLANT: “That’s right.” 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN “Because you wanted to put fear into him, didn’t you?” 
         
        APPELLANT “Yes.” 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN “Just like after you barged into the unit you said to him words to the effect ‘I control the drugs in Kings Cross. I’m going to get a needle or a syringe full of heroin and stick it.’”  
        
       
       
        
        APPELLANT “I’m tied up in the building industry, I leave the drug industry to the fucking rats.”  
        
       
       
      
    51 It was submitted for the appellant that his Honour had transposed the first question from the February 2005 conversation to the night of the incident (8 July 2005) with the consequence that the comment attributed to the appellant an intention to put fear into the complainant when he went into the unit on 8 July 2005.  
     
      
    52 There is no reason to suppose the jury was confused or misled by this apparent slip on the part of his Honour as 
     
      
       
      (a) the jury had heard the evidence; 
       
       
      (b) they were reminded moments later that it was on the earlier occasion that the appellant said he told the complainant who he was; 
       
       
      (c) a full transcript of the appellant’s evidence in chief and in cross examination was provided to the jury at its request. 
       
      
    53 In my opinion there was no miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    54 Furthermore, there was no objection or request for redirection. The appellant accepted no direction was sought to correct this alleged error. I infer that in the atmosphere of the trial there was not apparent any reasonable ground of concern as to the fairness and adequacy of the summing up. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. I would not grant leave to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    55 I propose the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    56 HARRISON J: I agree with Hislop J.

      2008/12898 R v Dean Reginald FORDHAM 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 22 October 2008 Dean Fordham pleaded guilty on arraignment to a charge that, on 23 June 2007, he murdered David Harrison. 
     
      
    2 The background of the matter is as follows. Towards the end of 2006 the offender first met a woman I will refer to as EB, who was then 21 years old. She had two children, a boy born in December 2002 and a daughter born in October 2004. The father of the children was in prison in South Australia, having been convicted of detaining and sexually assaulting her. EB had been in some sort of relationship with the deceased for some years, albeit on a sporadic basis. It was through her that the offender first met the deceased. They had met on two or three occasions before June 2007. 
     
      
    3 It is unnecessary for present purposes to describe the history of the relationship which developed between the offender and EB. It is clear, as I shall describe later, that the offender was smitten by her, and that he dearly loved her children. In about May 2007, they moved, together with the two children, into a rented house in Muswellbrook. 
     
      
    4 At that time the deceased was living with his parents in Melbourne. He had maintained contact with EB, and in June 2007 he arranged to drive to Muswellbrook and visit her. He arrived at the home rented by EB and the offender in the early hours of 22 June 2007. When his parents were unable to contact him two days later, he was listed as a missing person. EB told the police that he had left the Muswellbrook home in the early hours of 23 June, intending to drive to Newcastle. In fact, as it later emerged, he was murdered in the early hours of 23 June, in circumstances which I shall describe shortly. 
     
      
    5 Not long afterwards, EB and the offender were evicted from the Muswellbrook home. EB moved into a Women’s Refuge at Gosford. On 16 July 2007 she told another resident of the Refuge, Ms Simpson, that she and the offender had stabbed the deceased and later disposed of his body. She said that the deceased was a hit man, and showed Ms Simpson what she said was his “hit list”. Ms Simpson observed that it looked more like the page from an address book to her. EB described the circumstances of the killing in considerable detail, in terms which were essentially compatible with the account later given by the offender in his ERISP. In this account she, EB, admitted to having played a major role in the killing. Indeed, she said that it was she who had arranged for the offender to kill the deceased. She showed Ms Simpson a message on her mobile phone which she said had led her to fear violence from the deceased. The message said: “You’re nothing but a fucking loser like your mother. You want to hurt my heart. I’ll fuck you and your kids up.” 
     
      
    6 The next day Ms Simpson reported the matter to the Gosford Police. She gave a very detailed account of EB’s conversation with her the previous day. Later that day, 17 July, the police conducted an ERISP with EB at Gosford Police Station. She admitted that the deceased had been stabbed to death at the Muswellbrook house, but essentially placed all responsibility upon the offender. She said that she did not call the ambulance or the police because she was scared of the offender. It was he who, on this account, made her clean up the bloodstains afterwards. At first she denied much of the story said to have been given to Ms Simpson the previous day, although later she appeared to concede a greater involvement in the planning of the killing. 
     
      
    7 On 18 July 2007 the offender was arrested, and an ERISP was conducted at the Entrance Police Station. He freely admitted his involvement in the killing of the deceased. He told police that he had fallen in love with EB and her two children, and had killed the deceased in order to protect the three of them, as well as himself. He said that EB had shown him what she described as a “hit list”, with a number of names on it, including hers and his. EB had arranged for the visit of the deceased with the intention of murdering him. Indeed, she had drawn up a list of things which she and the offender were to purchase in order to clean up after the killing and to facilitate the disposal of the body. The circumstances of the killing itself were as follows. 
     
      
    8 On the night of 22 June 2007, the deceased and EB had gone into Muswellbrook, leaving the offender minding the two children. They returned home at about 2.00 am on 23 June. Shortly before their arrival, EB telephoned the offender, telling him that this was the time. The offender went out to the car, carrying a knife. When the deceased alighted from the car, the offender stabbed him in the face. The deceased jumped back, saying “what are you doing?” He then started to run away. EB ordered the offender to run after him and catch him. This he did, and he walked the deceased back to the house and into the garage. The offender sat the deceased on a seat, and asked him whether he, EB and the children were on his hit list. The deceased nodded his head, at which the offender proceeded to inflict multiple stab wounds, as I shall describe shortly. In due course he stopped and went into the house where he and EB proceeded to take some cannabis. A little later she went out to the garage, and returned calling out: “He’s not dead!” She and the offender then returned to the garage, where each of them inflicted a further stab wound to the deceased’s back. 
     
      
    9 I do not propose to describe in detail the various steps EB and the offender then took in order to dispose of any sign of the deceased or of the fact that the killing had taken place. The body of the deceased was placed in the boot of his car, which EB drove to the Greta area. They dug a hole in the bush, into which they put the body, later covering it with cement. The deceased’s car was abandoned in the Mayfield area. 
     
      
    10 After completing the ERISP, the offender took police to various locations where a number of items connected with the killing had been concealed. These included the clothing worn by him and EB during the commission of the offence, the deceased’s phone, wallet and car keys, various lists written by EB setting out items to be purchased to facilitate the killing, as well as instructions to the offender. One of the notes read: 
     
      
       
        
        “Wipe him out of existence, go somewhere two hours out, burn his body, bushland or bury him in bushland, keep driving half an hour out somewhere, burn the parked car, take the number plates, dispose of them on the way then burn all the evidence, drop me off at home, go somewhere about one or two hours out and burn the car.” 
        
       
      
    11 The offender told police that on the day of the killing he had heard that his closest friend had been killed in a car accident the previous evening. He had drunk many bourbons and cokes, and had consumed a number of drugs. It was his concern for EB’s children, however, which he said was the primary reason for his killing of the deceased. EB had told him that if he did not kill the deceased she would kill him (the deceased) in the offender’s bed. 
     
      
    12 On post-mortem examination the deceased was found to have sustained multiple stab wounds. The most serious wound was located in the central lower chest. It had entered the pericardium and caused a large cut in the side-wall of the aorta which had resulted in extensive bleeding into the chest. A further wound into the right side of the chest had passed through the upper and lower surfaces of the upper lobe of the right lung. Three other wounds had entered the chest cavity without causing damage to major organs, although they would have resulted in a general loss of blood into the chest cavity. Various wounds were found on the back of the right forearm and the back of the right hand. These were almost certainly defensive injuries. The remaining wounds involved soft tissue injuries only. These wounds were numerous, and in combination would have led to a “moderately significant” amount of blood loss. 
     
      
    13 Both the offender and EB were charged with murder and committed for trial in this Court. Following discussions between himself and the authorities, the offender agreed to plead guilty to murder and to give evidence against EB. This is obviously a highly significant matter on sentence and I shall be returning to discuss it later. 
     
      
    14 I turn now to discuss the offender’s personal history. He is now 28 years old, having been born on 27 June 1980. His family lived in Curlewis, a small town near Gunnedah. He had an uneventful childhood but was a poor student and left school at the age of 15 when he was part-way through year 9. He has very poor literate skills. After leaving school he had various forms of employment of a manual nature. He had not worked for about two years before the killing of the deceased. 
     
      
    15 Since his mid-teens the offender has smoked cannabis several times a day. He has also regularly injected amphetamines and sometimes used other recreational illegal drugs. He has also consumed large quantities of alcohol. Reports were tendered on sentence from Mr John Taylor, a clinical forensic psychologist, and from Dr Olav Nielssen, clinical psychiatrist. Mr Taylor administered a number of psychological tests. These measured the offender’s full-scale IQ at 81, which is at the 10th percentile point, meaning only 10% of the population would be lower. The offender had an above average predisposition to engage in substance abuse, and inadequate impulse control. Mr Taylor considered that he was socially, and probably emotionally, immature. There was no indication that he was suffering from any psychotic disturbance. Mr Taylor said that he offender might be considered “somewhat naïve and easily persuaded due to an intellectual handicap” in accepting EB’s statement about the necessity of killing the deceased. 
     
      
    16 Dr Nielssen’s opinions were similar. He considered that the offender suffered from substance abuse disorder, but did not have symptoms of psychotic illness. His intelligence was assessed to be at about the bottom of the normal range, which Dr Nielssen said might have made him more susceptible to EB’s influence. 
     
      
    17 The offender has had a number of previous brushes with the law. This commenced in 2004 when he was placed on a bond for impersonating a police officer. He had various driving offences and a number of other relatively minor offences for which he was fined or placed on a bond. More significantly, in March 2006, he was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, commencing on 15 February of that year, for an offence of breaking, entering and stealing from a building. In June 2006 that sentence was reduced to three months. At the same time the offender was sentenced to various terms of imprisonment in relation to further charges of affray, resisting an officer in the execution of his duty and assaulting a police officer. He was sentenced to a total of nine months’ imprisonment, commencing on 14 March 2006, with a non-parole period of five months concluding on 13 August 2006. He was released from prison on about that date, and met EB not long afterwards. On 6 February 2007 he was placed on a 12 month good behaviour bond for breaking and entering a place of worship and destroying or damaging property. He was subject to this bond when he committed the present offence. 
     
      
    18 The standard non-parole period for murder, of 20 years, is not directly applicable in the present case, given the offender’s plea of guilty and his offer to assist the authorities. However, it remains a reference point when assessing both the objective gravity of the offence and the moral culpability of the offender. 
     
      
    19 I turn to consider the objective circumstances of the offence. The one aggravating factor under, s 21A, which is not inherent in the offence of murder, is the fact that this was a deliberately planned killing. The circumstances of the killing were not so extreme as to bring it within the terms of s21A(2)(f), namely that it involved gratuitous cruelty. Nevertheless, the killing itself was a particularly cold-blooded one. It is difficult to imagine the horror experienced by the deceased when he started to realise the enormity of what was happening to him. The large number of injuries – some 35 in all – attest to the ferocity of the offender’s attack upon him. The deceased had no chance of escape. 
     
      
    20 All of this, together with the extent of planning for the killing, which was callous in the extreme, would, if all else were equal, support the Crown Prosecutor’s submission that the circumstances of the offence put it well above the mid-range of seriousness. But all else is not equal. For as Mr Stratton SC, on behalf of the offender, pointed out, the offender was in many ways a pawn in the hands of EB. He had never had a relationship with a woman before, and his love for EB and her two children, together with his own naivety, made him particularly vulnerable to her demands. The document which EB told the offender was the deceased’s “hit list” was tendered on sentence. To any objective observer it is plainly a list of names and telephone numbers, but I accept that the offender totally accepted EB’s description of it as the deceased’s “hit list”. 
     
      
    21 I should say at this point that there is nothing at all in the evidence to support the proposition that the deceased was in fact a hit man, as described by EB to the offender, or that he posed any threat whatsoever to EB or the offender. He must be taken to have been, in all respects, the innocent victim of the plot hatched by EB and perpetrated by herself and the offender. However, the offender himself did not know this. I accept that he genuinely believed that he was protecting EB, and particularly her children, from harm at the hands of this man who had been falsely described by EB as a dangerous gunman. 
     
      
    22 There are thus two competing considerations. On the one hand there is the callous brutality of this carefully planned killing; on the other, the offender’s genuine albeit misguided belief that the killing was necessary to protect EB and her children as well as himself. In my opinion these considerations effectively cancel each other out. Accordingly, I would place the circumstances of this killing, as perpetrated by this offender, as essentially in the mid-range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    23 I should say that a very moving victim impact statement was read in court by the victim’s mother, Jean. I would like to convey my and the Court’s condolences to her, her husband and other family and friends of the deceased. I hope they understand that, as a matter of law, the extent of the grief of the survivors cannot be used as a measure for the appropriate sentence in a homicide case. 
     
      
    24 I turn to discuss the subjective considerations on sentence. The offender, as already mentioned, has a number of prior convictions, some of them involving a degree of violence, albeit only to a very small degree when compared to the facts of the present case. He spent five months in prison in 2006. I would not use his criminal record itself as an aggravating factor, indeed it cannot be used in that way. However, at the time he committed this offence, he was, as mentioned, subject to a 12 month bond to be of good behaviour. His breach of that bond is an aggravating factor under s 21A, albeit, in the circumstances of this case, it must be regarded as a relatively minor one. 
     
      
    25 I should say at this point that I regard the risk of the offender re-offending in a similar serious manner as low. The offender gave evidence on sentence in which he said he now realised that the deceased was not a hit man. He expressed considerable remorse for his actions, a remorse which I accept as genuine. 
     
      
    26 By far the most significant factors on sentence arise from the following three matters: first, the offender’s plea of guilty to murder; second, the assistance he has already given to the authorities; and, third, the assistance which he has promised to give in relation to the charge against EB, particularly his offer to give evidence against her at her forthcoming murder trial. 
     
      
    27 In relation to the first of these matters, the offender pleaded guilty upon arraignment in this Court and is therefore entitled to a significant discount for the utilitarian value of his plea. 
     
      
    28 As to the assistance to the authorities already given by the offender, the Crown tendered an affidavit of Superintendent McKechnie annexing a report by Detective Sergeant Kelly, dated 3 December 2008. In this report Sergeant Kelly expressed the view that, during the offender’s ERISP, he was honest and “was endeavouring to assist police with as much information as possible”. Following that interview, the offender accompanied police to three locations around Curlewis and Gunnedah where they found property used during the commission of the offence and property taken from the body of the deceased. This included clothing worn by the offender and EB during the killing, handwritten notes alleged to have been written by EB planning different aspects of the killing, as well as receipts for the purchase of items used for the killing. Sergeant Kelly expressed a strong doubt that this evidence would have been obtained by detectives without the offender’s assistance. The retention of this property assisted in compiling a complete brief of evidence against EB and the offender. 
     
      
    29 The various objects located by the police as a result of the offender’s assistance, particularly EB’s handwritten notes, are likely to considerably assist the Crown case against her. This is a relevant matter in determining the appropriate discount on sentence. 
     
      
    30 For the combined utilitarian value of the offender’s plea of guilty and the assistance he has already rendered to authorities, I propose to discount the offender’s sentence by 27%. 
     
      
    31 The discount to be applied in response to the offender’s offer of future assistance needs to be separately quantified. As Mr Stratton has pointed out, there are only two living witnesses to the events of 23 June 2007. Accordingly, the offender’s evidence will undoubtedly be central to the Crown case against EB, albeit that there is already strong evidence from Ms Simpson and from EB’s own ERISP. There is always the risk that giving evidence for the Crown might adversely affect the conditions of the offender’s incarceration, notwithstanding his disavowal of that proposition when he gave his evidence. In the circumstances, I consider that a further discount of 18% is appropriate in relation to this matter. That makes a combined discount of 45%. 
     
      
    32 I should say that I have taken into account the various acknowledged purposes of criminal punishment: the protection of society, both individual and general deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation. Having considered all these matters, together with the objective circumstances of the killing, and the subjective matters relating to the offender, I would, in the absence of his plea of guilty and his assistance to the authorities, have imposed the standard non-parole period of 20 years, together with the statutory minimum additional term. I do not consider that special circumstances exist which would justify a departure from the statutory nexus between the non-parole period and the balance of the term of imprisonment. Applying the combined discount of 45%, a non-parole period of 11 years is reached, together with a balance of term of three years and eight months, making a total sentence of 14 years and eight months. 
     
      
    33 The offender has been in custody since 18 July 2007 and his sentence is to commence on that date. 
     
      
    34 Dean Reginald Fordham, I sentence you to imprisonment to be served by way of a non-parole period of 11 years to commence on 18 July 2007 and expire on 17 July 2018, with a balance of term of three years and eight months, commencing on 18 July 2018 and expiring on 17 March 2022. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 17 July 2018.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: On 18 October 2007 the appellant pleaded guilty before her Honour Judge Ainslie-Wallace in the District Court of New South Wales to the following offences: 
     
      
       
        
       Count 1: That between 28 February 2005 and 9 May 2005 in Sydney, New South Wales, he did supply a prohibited drug, namely cocaine, being an amount not less than a large commercial quantity for that drug contrary to s 25(2) of the  
       Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
       1985; 
        
        
       Count 2: That between 14 March 2005 and 17 March 2005 at Sydney, New South Wales, he did an act, namely fabricated a false account for police that his brother Ahmed Elmir was the driver of car registration NXH 04A on 14 March 2005 with intent to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 319 of the  
       Crimes Act  
       1900. 
        
       
      
    2 The appellant requested her Honour to take into account a further five offences pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
       
      
    3 The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of cocaine is life imprisonment and/or a fine of $550,000: Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, s 33(3). It is subject to a standard non-parole period of 15 years. The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence of perverting the course of justice is imprisonment for 14 years.  
     
      
       
      
    4 On 19 December 2007 her Honour sentenced the appellant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ■ On the first count to 12 years and 6 months imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 8 years to commence on 9 November 2007 and to expire on 8 November 2015 and an additional term of 4 years and 6 months to expire on 8 May 2020; 
        
        
        ■ On the second count to 6 years imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 4 years to commence on 9 May 2005 (being the date on which the appellant was arrested) and to expire on 8 May 2009 and an additional term of 2 years to expire on 8 May 2011. 
        
        
       The appellant appeals against both his conviction and his sentence. 
        
        
       Factual overview – Count 1: supply prohibited drug 
        
       
      
    5 The appellant was one of a number of persons charged as a result of an investigation into the activities of one Shayne Hatfield (Hatfield). The investigation commenced in or about December 2004 when a New South Wales Crime Commission registered “source” referred to as “Tom” provided information about the distribution of imported cocaine by Hatfield. 
     
      
       
      
    6 On 7 February 2005 Tom took investigators to a location at Wahroonga where he said he had buried approximately 7kg of cocaine that had been imported into Australia the previous October. Each kilogram was packed separately. The cocaine was seized by the authorities and taken to the Australian Government National Measurement Institute for analysis.  
     
      
       
      
    7 One of the persons through whom Hatfield had arranged supplies of cocaine was Stephen Sevastopoulos (Sevastopoulos). On 28 February 2005 at about 1.08pm, Sevastopoulos contacted Tom asking for a “big one” and making arrangements to meet him at 3pm that day at Rushcutters Bay. A “big one” was code for 1kg of cocaine. After speaking to investigators, Tom telephoned Sevastopoulos and put off the meeting until 4pm.  
     
      
       
      
    8 At 3.35pm on 28 February 2005, the Commissioner of the New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commissioner) granted an authority to conduct a controlled operation pursuant to s 6 of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997 (the LECO Act) (the Authority). The Authority authorised three nominated law enforcement officers to engage in the controlled activity of possessing 1kg of cocaine to be supplied to Tom. The Authority further authorised Tom to also engage in a controlled activity of taking possession of 1kg of cocaine and supplying it to Sevastopoulos and/or persons attending with him or introduced by him in return for an amount of cash expected to be $160,000.  
     
      
       
      
    9 Pursuant to the Authority, the authorised law enforcement officers provided Tom with a bag containing 1kg of cocaine. Tom then drove to Rushcutters Bay where he met with Sevastopoulos and the appellant. Tom gave the cocaine to the appellant and received $160,000 cash from him. 
     
      
       
      
    10 On 14 March 2005 the appellant picked up Sevastopoulos and they drove to the home of one Gassan Jabour (Jabour). Sevastopoulos received 496g of cocaine from Jabour and returned to the car the appellant was driving. Police officers were conducting surveillance of the appellant and Sevastopoulos, but the appellant evaded them by driving off at high speed. Sevastopoulos threw the package of cocaine from the vehicle. 
     
      
       
      
    11 A number of telephone conversations between the appellant, Sevastopoulos and Jabour were intercepted by the police during which the appellant gave instructions to Jabour about where to look to recover the cocaine. Jabour was unable to locate it but police recovered it later that evening.  
     
      
       
        
       Factual overview – Count 2: perverting the course of justice 
        
       
      
    12 The vehicle driven by the appellant on 14 March 2005 had been borrowed from Modena Prestige Cars. After the appellant and Sevastopoulos had evaded the police, the former contacted one, Nasser Elkordi (Elkordi), a director of Modena Prestige Cars, and discussed with Elkordi how he could report that the vehicle had been stolen. After further discussion (which occurred in a number of separate conversations), Elkordi suggested to the appellant that he could say that a friend borrowed the vehicle while the appellant was asleep.  
     
      
       
      
    13 On 15 March 2005 when the investigators spoke to the appellant, he told them that he thought that his younger brother Ahmed Elmir had the vehicle the previous night. The appellant and Ahmed attended Campsie Police Station on 17 March 2005 and both repeated the lie that Ahmed had been driving the vehicle.  
     
      
       
        
       Similar authorities are declared invalid 
        
       
      
    14 Six authorities had been purportedly granted pursuant to s 6 of the LECO Act by the Commissioner for the conduct of controlled operations relating to the supply by Tom of the 7kg of cocaine. Of those authorities five, excluding that the subject of the present appeal, were granted on 8 February, 22 February, 24 February, 25 February, 4 March and 17 March 2005 respectively. Two of those authorities were relevant to a case against one Gilbert Gedeon (Gedeon) and one authority was relevant against one David Dowe (Dowe).  
     
      
       
      
    15 On or about 11 April 2006 proceedings were commenced in the Supreme Court by Gedeon and Dowe seeking declarations that the authorities relating to them were invalid. Relevantly, on 6 March 2007 Hall J dismissed those proceedings: Dowe v Commissioner of New South Wales Crime Commission [2007] NSWSC 166; (2007) 169 A Crim R 43 As a consequence of that decision the appellant first pleaded guilty to the charges on 27 July 2007. Gedeon and Dowe lodged appeals against the decision of Hall J to the Court of Appeal that were heard on 9 August 2007 and decided on 19 October 2007, being the day following the sentencing proceedings of the appellant at which he confirmed his guilty pleas. 
     
      
       
      
    16 On 9 November 2007 Gedeon sought special leave to appeal from the High Court against the majority decision of the Court of Appeal and Dowe filed a similar application for special leave on 16 November 2007. On 18 April 2008 Gleeson CJ and Gummow J referred the special leave applications to a Court of six Justices. The applications were heard on 13 July 2008 and on 4 September 2008 the High Court granted special leave, upheld the appeals and declared the Gedeon and Dowe authorities to be invalid: Gedeon v Commissioner of New South Wales Commission; Dowe v Commissioner of New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] HCA 43; [2008] 82 ALJR 1465.  
     
      
       
      
    17 The reasons of the Court of Appeal and the High Court for coming to their respective conclusions regarding the validity and invalidity respectively of the authorities the subject of that litigation, are set out in my judgment in Dowe v R [2009] NSWCCA 23. 
     
      
       
        
       The appellant’s appeal against his conviction 
        
       
      
    18 Only one ground of appeal is advanced with respect to the appellant’s conviction. It is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The conviction of the appellant for the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of cocaine was a miscarriage of justice in that his plea of guilty was entered under a belief as to the law applicable to the case against him which was subsequently overturned.” 
         
        
       
      
    19 Count 1 to which the appellant pleaded guilty covered two discrete occasions although they were treated as part of one continuing enterprise in accordance with the decision of this Court in Hamzy v R (1994) 74 A Crim R 341. The first occasion related to the supply of 1kg of cocaine by Tom to the appellant on 28 February 2005. The second related to the supply by Jabour to Sevastopoulos of 496g of cocaine to which the appellant was a party. Only the first occasion was the subject of a controlled operation authority.  
     
      
       
      
    20 The essence of the appellant’s challenge to his conviction is that he had first pleaded guilty on 27 July 2007 upon the assumption that the Authority which related to the supply of cocaine on 28 February 2005 was valid as Hall J had so held with respect to the Gedeon and Dowe authorities. In this respect, in an affidavit sworn 23 October 2008 and read to the Court, the appellant relevantly deposed to the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “2. On 27 July 2007 I pleaded guilty to supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, being cocaine and another matter. 
         
        
        
         
         3. I was aware that two of my co-accused had challenged the validity of the controlled operations but that the Supreme Court had dismissed their applications. 
         
        
        
         
         4. I was aware that the co-accused were going to appeal but my trial was due to start on 30 July 2007. I pleaded guilty after advice from my legal representatives. I was advised that if the appeal was successful I could appeal later and there was no point in trying to get the trial adjourned. 
         
        
        
         
         5. I believed that the evidence was properly obtained and could be used in my trial. I would not have pleaded guilty had the Supreme Court declared the controlled operation invalid.” 
         
        
       
      
    21 The appellant therefore submitted that had he gone to trial on the basis of the law as expounded by the High Court, which declared the Gedeon and Dowe authorities invalid, the trial judge would have been required to have regard to s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 to determine whether, notwithstanding the unlawful conduct of the law enforcement authorities in supplying Tom with 1kg of cocaine and the subsequent unlawful supply by Tom of that kilogram of cocaine to the appellant, the relevant evidence of the controlled activities should, as a matter of discretion, have been admitted.  
     
      
       
      
    22 The appellant therefore submitted that he had entered his plea of guilty to Count 1 under a misapprehension with respect to the state of the law relating to the validity of the Authority. Due to the change in the law effected by the High Court’s subsequent enunciation of the Authority’s invalidity, it followed that his plea was tainted and was not a free and voluntary confession. Reliance was placed upon the decision of this Court in R v Chiron (1980) 1 NSWLR 218, although it was accepted that the present case was not on all fours with the facts of that case. 
     
      
       
      
    23 In Chiron the appellant went to trial on a charge of rape. Over objection the trial judge decided to admit certain similar fact evidence. Following that decision Chiron changed his plea to guilty. By majority the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the decision to admit the similar fact evidence was erroneous and that if the trial had proceeded to conviction, that conviction would have been set aside and a new trial ordered. As Chiron had pleaded guilty, the question arose as to whether, notwithstanding that plea, the conviction nevertheless should be set aside.  
     
      
       
      
    24 Street CJ (at 220) noted Chiron’s counsel’s professional assessment of the effect the admission of the similar fact evidence had upon the outcome of the trial, namely that in the light of its admission, he did not consider that he could successfully defend Chiron on the subject charge. His Honour also referred to Chiron being oppressed by the significance that he attached to a comment made by the trial judge during the course of argument – that admission of the evidence of similar facts would be “sudden death” to his chances of acquittal. The Chief Justice then said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “(4) The evidence called on the hearing of the appeal leaves no room for doubt but that the erroneous decision to admit evidence of similar facts, with the consequential significance attaching to it in the mind of the appellant as a result of his counsel’s expression of opinion and the trial judge’s reference to ‘sudden death’, was the predominating factor which lead to the appellant changing his plea, and thus admitting guilt of the crime charged against him. 
         
        
        
         
         (5) In the foregoing context, the admission of guilt involved in the change of plea to ‘guilty’ must be regarded as tainted. It was not a free and voluntary confession. It was not properly available to the jury as a basis for returning the verdict of guilty.” 
         
        
       
      
    25 Nagle CJ at CL agreed with the Chief Justice holding (at 222) that in the circumstances he found it impossible to say that there had been no miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
       
      
    26 Lee J agreed with the majority that the trial judge’s decision to admit the similar fact evidence was erroneous. However, he dissented from the majority that there had been a miscarriage of justice such as to attract the appellate jurisdiction of the Court. However at 235 his Honour accepted that a plea of guilty would be allowed to be withdrawn on appeal if there had been a miscarriage of justice. His Honour then went on to refer to the circumstances in which a court would set aside a conviction notwithstanding that it followed a plea of guilty. He referred (at 235 [73]) to the decision in R v Forde [1923] 2 KB 400 that identified two grounds upon which a plea of guilty might be permitted to be withdrawn on appeal. The first was where the appellant did not appreciate the nature of the charge or did not intend to admit that he was guilty of it. The second was where, upon the admitted facts, the appellant could not in law have been convicted of the offence charged. 
     
      
       
      
    27 His Honour then referred to other authorities that held that the principles formulated in Forde should not be regarded as exhaustive of all possible cases of miscarriage of justice. It did not cover, for example, cases where an accused person against whom a prima facie case existed but who had never admitted his guilt, is induced by threats of a fellow accused, or a police officer, to plead guilty where otherwise he would have pleaded not guilty: R v Murphy [1965] VR 187 at 190 per Sholl J. 
     
      
       
      
    28 His Honour then made the following observations (at 235): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “(76) In  
         Ansell v The Queen  
         Gibson J, delivering the judgment of the court said: ‘An appeal against conviction recorded on a plea of guilty will only be allowed in exceptional circumstances ( 
         Pilkington v The Queen 
          (1955) Tas SR 144).’ 
         
        
        
         
         (77) His Honour referred to  
         R v Forde  
         and went on: ‘But if the appellant can satisfy the court that he had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice in any other way he is entitled to succeed in his appeal ( 
         R v Murphy 
         ). Thus, a plea of guilty procured by fraud could not stand, and such a plea of procured by an improper inducement might also be vitiated by the manner in which it was brought about.  
         Pilkington v the Queen 
         .” 
         
        
       
      
    29 The appellant also placed reliance upon the decision of this Court in Sauer v R [2006] NSWCCA 81 at [8] where the circumstances referred to in the authorities pursuant to which a conviction based on a plea of guilty would be set aside, were summarised. Those circumstances included that referred to in R v Sagiv (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 at 80, namely, where there had been a “mistake or other circumstance affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt”. Thus in Maxwell v The Queen [1996] HCA 46; (1996) 184 CLR 501 at 511, Dawson and McHugh JJ observed: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The plea of guilty must however be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt. Those circumstances include ignorance, fear, duress, mistake or even the desire to gain a technical advantage.” 
         
        
       
      
    30 Particular reliance was placed by the appellant upon the following statement of Dawson J in Meissner v The Queen [1995] HCA 41; (1995) 184 CLR 132 at 157: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The entry of a plea of guilty upon grounds such as these nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. Ordinarily that will only be where the accused does not understand the nature of the charge or does not intend to admit he was guilty of it or if upon the facts admitted by the plea he could not in law have been guilty of the offence.  
         But the accused may show that a miscarriage of justice occurred in other ways and so be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty and have his conviction set aside. For example, he may show that his plea was induced by intimidation of one kind or another, or by an improper inducement or by fraud.” 
          (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
      
    31 In the light of the foregoing authorities it was submitted that although the present was not a case that fell within the various examples of a miscarriage of justice to which the authorities referred, nonetheless there was no restraint upon the circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice could be demonstrated. It was thus submitted that in the present case there was a miscarriage because the appellant had only pleaded guilty because he understood that he could not challenge the validity of the Authority pursuant to which Tom supplied the heroin to the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    32 It is important to note that the appellant does not dispute the facts that constitute the foundation of the offence with which he was charged. In other words, he does not deny that Tom supplied him with 1kg of cocaine. Had he pleaded not guilty his only defence would have been to seek the exclusion of the evidence of the controlled activities pursuant to s 138 on the basis that it was unlawfully obtained in contravention of an Australian law. Accordingly, there can be no doubt that there was a genuine recognition of guilt on the part of the appellant when he entered his plea. In other words, his guilt was undisputed: the miscarriage of justice, so it is submitted, was the denial of an opportunity to have the evidence of his guilt excluded. 
     
      
       
      
    33 In R v Toro-Martinez [2000] NSWCCA 216; (2000) 114 A Crim R 533, Spigelman CJ at [21], with whom Newman and Adams JJ agreed, referred with approval to the formulation by Sholl J in R v Murphy of the appropriate test of when there would be a miscarriage of justice justifying the withdrawal of a plea of guilty, namely,  
     
      
       
        
         
         “…for some other reason which enabled one to say that her plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilty …” 
         
        
       
      
    34 To similar effect, the Chief Justice noted (at [22]), were the observations of Lee J (with whom McInerney and Campbell JJ agreed) in Sagivat 80, who applied a test of  
     
      
       
        
         
         “mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt …”.  
         
        
       
      
    35 On the other hand, as Lee J observed in Sagiv (at 80–81) in the context of an application to withdraw a plea of guilty: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ”But if the plea has been entered in full knowledge of all the facts and intentionally as a plea to the charge which is made, the court is plainly entitled to exercise its discretion against a withdrawal of the plea. The law regards a plea of guilty made by a person in possession of all the facts and intending to plead guilty as an admission of all the legal ingredients of the offence … and as the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made …” 
         
        
       
      
    36 Both Murphy and Sagiv were referred to with approval in this Court in Davies (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993, unreported) by Badgery-Parker J, with whom Wood and Mathews JJ agreed and which, the Chief Justice said in Toro-Martinez (at [26]) has frequently been referred to with approval. Badgery-Parker J concluded:  
     
      
       
        
         
         ""The appellant's submission that it would in the circumstances be unfair to hold him to his plea draws attention to the two factors which to my mind are the significant factors in this case. The test is whether the circumstances revealed a miscarriage of justice. The need to accord finality to a plea of guilty because of its status as a solemn admission of all of the ingredients of the offence is postulated upon knowledge by the person entering that plea of all the facts (see the passage cited earlier from the judgment of Lee J in  
         Sagiv 
         ) and it is not necessary to be accorded such finality if there are circumstances which indicate that the plea 'was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt' (per Sholl J in  
         Murphy 
          supra). If the integrity of the plea is bona fide questioned because it appears that the person who entered that plea was not in possession of all the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt, then in my opinion the plea of guilty ought to be set aside and a new trial ordered if (but only if, and the onus lies on the appellant) it is clear that there is, in the words of Sholl J 'an issuable question of guilt'- to put it more simply, if there is a real question to be tried. If the plea was not entered into with full knowledge of the facts and as a genuine recognition of guilt, and if the material before the Court of Criminal Appeal shows that there is a real question about the guilt of the accused, then the proper course must be to set aside the plea of guilty, to quash the conviction, and to order a new trial.""  
         
        
       
       
      
    37 The Chief Justice then continued (at [27]) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “27. … This Court will only permit an appeal against conviction after a plea of guilty, to reiterate  
         Davies:  
         ‘… 
         if the material before the Court of Criminal Appeal shows that there is a real question about the guilt of the accused … 
         ’  
         
        
        
         
         28 …in the present case no attempt has been made suggest that the appellant might  
         not  
         be guilty. The case for the appellant rises no higher than, if certain evidence had been rejected, he would not have been  
         found to be 
          guilty.” 
         
        
       
      
    38 In R v Van [2002] NSWCCA 148; (2002) 129 A Crim R 229, Greg James J, with the agreement of Hodgson JA and Kirby J, adopted (at [48]) the following summary by the applicant in his submissions taken from the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Hura [2001] NSWCCA 61; (2001) 121 A Crim R 472 at [32]–[33] of the relevant circumstances justifying the setting aside of a conviction based on a plea of guilty:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
         ""• Where the appellant 'did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered' ( 
         Regina v. Ferrer-Esis 
          (1991) 55 A. Crim. R. 231 at 233). 
          
         • Where the plea was not 'a free and voluntary confession' ( 
         Regina v. Chiron  
         (1980) 1 NSWLR 218 at 220 D-E). 
          
         • The 'plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt' (

          [1965] VR 187 at 191).

         • Where the 'plea was induced by threats or other impropriety when the appellant would not otherwise have pleaded guilty … some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt' (

         • The 'plea of guilty must either be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt' (

         • If 'the person who entered the plea was not in possession of all of the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt' (

         Regina v. Ganderton 
          (NSWCCA, 17 September 1998, unreported) and  
         Regina v. Favero 
          [1999] NSWCCA 320."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    39 As the Crown submitted, there have been a number of decisions of this Court subsequent to Toro-Martinez which have confirmed that this Court will only find that a miscarriage of justice has occurred if there is a real question about the guilt of the accused: R v Khan [2002] NSWCCA 521 at [22] and [27]; R v Rae (No 2) [2005] NSWCCA 380; (2005) 157 A Crim R 182 at [25]; Woods v R [2008] NSWCCA 83 at [36]–[45]. 
     
      
       
      
    40 In the present case there is no suggestion by the appellant that he had any genuine reservations about his guilt in relation to the first count. Rather, to adopt the observations of the Chief Justice in Toro-Martinez at [28] no attempt was been made to suggest that the appellant might not be guilty: rather, his case rises no higher than if the evidence obtained pursuant to the invalid Authority was rejected in the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion under s 138 of the Evidence Act, he would not have been found to be guilty. 
     
      
       
      
    41 Relevant to the present case are the following further remarks of the Chief Justice in Toro-Martinez: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ” 30 The system recognises - not least in the discretion to exclude evidence illegally or improperly obtained - that the truth may cost too much. As Knight Bruce VC said in  
         Pearse v Pearse 
          (1946) 63 ER 950 at 957 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         32. The occurrence of circumstances in which considerations of this character could be permitted to overturn a conviction after a plea of guilty, when there is not even a pretence of innocence is, to my mind, virtually inconceivable. In the application of a test as broad as ""miscarriage of justice"" I am not prepared to say that there can be no such circumstances. However, they would have to be extreme, not just extraordinary. Nothing of that character appears on the facts of this case.” 
         
        
       
      
    42 Notwithstanding the appellant’s present stance, his plea was entered as a genuine recognition of his undoubted guilt of the offences with which he was charged. There was no pretence of innocence. In these circumstances, the subsequent invalidity of the Authority in the particular circumstances in which it occurred was not, in my view, so extreme as to constitute a miscarriage of justice justifying the quashing of his conviction. 
     
      
       
      
    43 It follows from the foregoing that in my opinion the appellant’s appeal against his conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
        
       The appellant’s appeal against sentence 
        
       
      
    44 The appellant seeks the leave of this Court to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by the sentencing judge on two grounds: 
     
      
       
        
       1. The sentencing judge erred in the exercise of his discretion on the question of the extent to which the second sentence was to be cumulative on the first;  
        
        
       2. The sentencing judge erred in failing to give appropriate weight to the medical condition of the appellant’s wife. 
        
        
       Ground 1 
        
       
      
    45 As I have already noted in [4] above, the sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period of 4 years with an additional term of 2 years on the second count. That sentence was ordered to commence on 9 May 2005, being the date upon which the appellant was taken into custody. Her Honour then imposed a sentence comprising a non-parole period of 8 years and an additional term of 4½ years with respect to the first count, which she ordered to commence on 9 November 2007. Accordingly, the second sentence was cumulative on the first by a period of 2½ years. The appellant thus received a combined total sentence of 15 years with a non-parole period of 10½ years. 
     
      
       
      
    46 In her Remarks on Sentence, her Honour, after indicating the sentences she intended imposing with respect to each offence, then turned to the question of accumulation. She said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Turning to how the sentences are … to be constructed, it would not reflect the objective seriousness of either offence to make them wholly concurrent. The charges represent two separate offences. I will make them partially cumulative to give an effective overall sentence of 15 years with a non-parole period of 10½ years. I will backdate the sentences to 9 May 2005 which was when the offender was taken into custody on these matters.” 
         
        
       
      
    47 As I have indicated, the sentences imposed by the sentencing Judge resulted in a period of accumulation of 2½ years and a period of concurrence of 1½ years, namely from 9 November 2007 to 8 May 2009. The appellant submitted that the accumulation has resulted in a combined sentence which is erroneously high. The offences were very closely linked in time and, so it was submitted, the motivation for the s 319 offence was inextricably bound up with the appellant’s commission of the supply offence. It was therefore submitted that the principles of totality required a greater degree of concurrence than her Honour had determined. 
     
      
       
      
    48 Reliance was placed upon the following passage from the judgment of Kirby J in R v Myers (2002) NSWCCA 162 at [34]: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Pearce  
         required that certain things be considered… [C]onsideration must be given as to whether the sentences imposed should be made concurrent or cumulative (or partially one or the other). It will be appropriate, for instance, to make sentences for offences concurrent where, although separate, they are substantially contemporaneous and connected.” 
         
        
       
      
    49 It was also submitted that the foregoing observation applied to the present case as the offences were substantially contemporaneous with and connected to each other. However, it was not contended that they should have been fully concurrent. 
     
      
       
      
    50 The Crown submitted that where an offender is to be sentenced for more than one offence, the principle of totality requires that a sentencing judge impose a sentence that will result in a “just and appropriate” sentence that properly reflects the total criminality of the offender: Mill v R [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63; Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. The effect of the sentence imposed on an offender should represent a proper period of incarceration for the total criminality involved.  
     
      
       
      
    51 The foregoing principle was recently stated by Howie J with whom, relevantly, Adams and Price JJ agreed, in Cahyadi v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27] where his Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
         
         “In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.” 
         
        
       
      
    52 It is well established that whether or not sentences imposed in relation to multiple offences are accumulated involves, in the end, an exercise of discretion to be made in accordance with the principles to which I have referred: R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [7]. Being a matter for the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion, in order to establish error on her part it behoves the appellant to establish that that discretion miscarried in accordance with the well-known principles espoused in House v The King [1936] HCA 40, (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505.  
     
      
       
      
    53 The sentencing judge considered each of the two offences to which the appellant had pleaded guilty as being of the most serious kind. In my view there were no common features between the two offences, which were entirely separate episodes of criminality. The primary occasion, upon which the first offence was committed, on 28 February 2005, involved the supply by Tom to the appellant of 1kg of cocaine. The secondary aspect of that offence occurred on 14 March 2005 when Jabour supplied Sevastopoulos with 496g of cocaine in circumstances where the appellant provided the transportation for Sevastopoulos for the purpose of receiving the supply.  
     
      
       
      
    54 The police officers who conducted surveillance of Sevastopoulos identified themselves immediately after the transaction took place. It was then that the appellant drove off a high speed in order to evade arrest. The s 319 offence then occurred between 14 and 17 March 2005. On 17 March 2005 the appellant and his brother attended Campsie Police Station and repeated the lie that he (the appellant) had told investigators, namely, that his brother had been driving the subject vehicle. 
     
      
       
      
    55 Were it not for the fact that the transaction which occurred on 14 March 2005, and its discovery by the police, was the cause of the appellant driving off at high speed to evade the police, thus leading to the lie regarding who was driving the relevant vehicle, there would be no connection at all between the two offences.  
     
      
       
      
    56 I am not prepared to accept the appellant’s submission that the s 319 offence was substantially contemporaneous with and connected to the drug offence. In particular there was no connection between the s 319 offence and the primary offence committed on 28 February 2005. In these circumstances, the appellant has not demonstrated any relevant error in the sentencing judge’s exercise of her discretion to accumulate the two sentences in the manner she adopted. I would therefore reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 2 
        
       
      
    57 The appellant’s wife gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. She stated that she and the appellant had four children aged 11, 13, 17 and 21. They had also raised the appellant’s brother’s four children (who had been orphaned) – they ranged in age from 21 to 27. 
     
      
       
      
    58 Mrs Elmir also gave evidence that she was studying hotel management, her plan being to ultimately sell her home and acquire a motel which she would run in conjunction with the appellant when he was released. She was attending Ryde TAFE three days per week for that purpose. Mrs Elmir also gave evidence that in about October 2006 she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis in both lungs. She was under the care of a specialist, Dr Jenders, but there was no evidence from him as to her condition. Mrs Elmir’s general practitioner, Dr Vu, who stated that she suffered from moderate/severe obstructive airways disease and that she was using various inhalers and cortisone tablets to assist her lung function, produced a medical certificate to that effect dated 20 August 2007. 
     
      
       
      
    59 Mrs Elmir gave evidence that she was on five different medications a day, including steroids, in order to keep her lungs going. She said she saw her specialist every month to monitor her lung capacity. 
     
      
       
      
    60 Mrs Elmir considered that her illness was terminal and that she would eventually need a double lung transplant. The following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Have you been given a timeframe in relation to either a transplant or to ask you bluntly, in relation if there is no transplant, what the eventual outcome may be or how long you’ve been given? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I will die young. I’m not going to last too long because it’s in both lungs already. It’s – it’s fairly advanced. 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It’s, sorry? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It’s advanced, top and bottom lung so. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I suppose the difficulty here is that no-one can say how it will progress? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And whether it will or if it does, how quickly it will go? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah.” 
         
        
       
      
    61 Mrs Elmir also indicated that she did not know her future: she was studying so that she could demonstrate to her children the right way to go in their life. Eventually, she said, that it was just a matter of time 
     
      
       
        
         
         “but I know eventually down the track I will need a double lung transplant – I just don’t know when, [it] can hit me anytime they say.” 
         
        
       
      
    62 The sentencing judge referred to Mrs Elmir’s illness in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Ms Elmir suffers from ill health. She was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis about twelve months ago and is presently taking medication to control her illness. She has been told that she will eventually require a lung transplant and said that she does not know how long she will live although fortunately, at this time, she remains relatively well.” 
         
        
       
      
    63 With respect to the submissions made on behalf of the appellant as to the impact of his wife’s illness upon any non-parole period, her Honour remarked as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “It was argued that Ms Elmir’s illness was an exceptional circumstance which should be taken into account in mitigating the sentence otherwise to be imposed on the offender. That she is ill with such a dreadful, debilitating illness is indeed a great tragedy. She has been the main provider and support for their children and those children whom she has raised. It appeared from evidence that the offender took little part in the domestic life through his drug and other criminal activities. While her circumstances are tragic I do not regard them as exceptional.” 
         
        
       
      
    64 Before the dealing with the appellant’s submissions with respect to this issue, I should also refer to the observation of the sentencing judge that the appellant and his wife had “four children aged between 21 and 17”. This was clearly an error as their ages ranged from 11 to 13 to 17 to 21. Although this was not picked up in the appellant’s written submissions, when it was pointed out to his counsel in the course of argument, reliance was then placed upon that error as a further indication that her Honour had not taken into account the effect of Mrs Elmir’s illness on her children.  
     
      
       
      
    65 The appellant’s complaint appears to be two-fold. First, it was submitted that the sentencing judge had erred in finding that Mrs Elmir’s condition did not constitute “exceptional circumstances”. It was submitted that the prospect that  
     
      
       
        
         
         “Mrs Elmir would require a double lung transplant and the risk that she would die at any given time constituted circumstances which went far beyond the sort of hardship which inevitably results when a family’s breadwinner is imprisoned.” 
         
        
       
      
    66 Secondly, it was submitted that even if Mrs Elmir’s condition did not constitute exceptional circumstances, nevertheless it was incumbent upon her Honour to factor in some allowance for the contingency (which was neither remote nor fanciful) that she might die leaving the two youngest children in particular without an available parent. Some moderation of sentence was required to make full allowance for this factor.  
     
      
       
      
    67 Alternatively, Mrs Elmir’s medical condition was a relevant part of the subjective case presented by the appellant, as his imprisonment would be attended by a higher degree of anxiety given his wife’s parlous condition, than would pertain if she did not have such a condition. It was thus a factor to be taken into account in assessing the impact of imprisonment upon him. Reliance was placed upon the observations of Hodgson JA in R v Girard [2004] NSWCCA 170 at [21] where he observed that the fact that innocent children would be adversely affected by the imprisonment of their parents could be taken into account as one subjective circumstance in assessing an appropriate penalty.  
     
      
       
      
    68 The Crown submitted that it was well established that a sentencing court might only take into account hardship to an offender’s family or dependants in mitigation of an otherwise appropriate sentence in “exceptional circumstances”. In a case where an accused person at the time of sentencing had given birth to a child (R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522; (2001) 127 A Crim R 23), Spigelman CJ observed (at [13]–[14]) that the sentencing judge had approached the exercise on the basis that hardship to a child had to be classified as “exceptional” before it could be given substantial weight for the purposes of s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  
     
      
       
      
    69 His Honour observed that the necessity for such an “exceptional” effect had long been accepted for sentencing at common law: see, for example, R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 at 516–517 per Gleeson CJ.  
     
      
       
      
    70 In the same case Grove J endorsed the following excerpt from Professor R G Fox and Professor A Freiberg Sentencing: State and Federal Law in Victoria 2ed, (1999) as correctly stating the common law:  
     
      
       
        
         
         “The circumstances may be regarded as exceptional if the imprisonment of a parent leaves a child without parental care, if a dependant will suffer  
         overwhelming 
          hardship because of the imprisonment of the offender … where all the features of the case point to a custodial sentence and there is evidence of  
         extreme  
         hardship, a court  
         may  
         take into account the  
         extraordinary 
          features of the case by suspending the sentence of imprisonment. Alternatively, the sentence may be shortened, or the non-parole period decreased.” (Emphasis provided by Grove J)  
         
        
        
       See also,  
       Le v R  
       [2006] NSWCCA 136 at [24]–[25] per Latham J, with whom McColl JA agreed. 
        
       
      
    71 In my opinion I can detect no error in her Honour’s finding that the condition of the appellant’s wife did not constitute “exceptional circumstances”. The present was not a case of young children losing either or both parents to imprisonment. On the contrary, at the time of sentence the appellant’s two youngest children were being cared for by their mother and there was nothing to suggest that that situation would not continue, at least until a point was reached when Mrs Elmir was overcome by her condition. The problem was that other than that of Mrs Elmir herself who said that it could hit her at any time, there was no expert evidence as to when that might occur. On the other hand, Mrs Elmir also gave evidence that no one could say how her illness would progress or at what rate. 
     
      
       
      
    72 Furthermore, no evidence was forthcoming as to the extent of support from family and friends that might be available to Mrs Elmir if her illness prevented her from caring for her two younger children. The only evidence as to the state of her family was that her brother and his wife were deceased. She did not give evidence as to whether she or the appellant had other siblings or parents who might be able to step into the breach if her condition so required. Nor was there any evidence as to the extent of the Elmir’s close friends within the Lebanese community who might be in a position to assist in the care of the younger children if necessary. 
     
      
       
      
    73 In the foregoing circumstances, in my view the appellant has not demonstrated any error in the approach of the sentencing judge to Mrs Elmir’s illness. 
     
      
       
      
    74 As I have indicated, the appellant submitted that his wife’s illness was part of his subjective case. It was asserted that his imprisonment would be attended by a higher degree of anxiety than would pertain if she were not ill. Again, the difficulty with this submission is that it is unsupported by any evidence, as the appellant did not give any on the sentencing hearing. Accordingly, I see no reason why the Court should speculate as to the extent of the appellant’s anxiety, if any, with respect to his wife’s medical condition.  
     
      
       
      
    75 Finally, I would also reject the appellant’s submission that part of the ”general mix” of the subjective matters to be taken into account by the sentencing judge was the real possibility that his two younger children might lose their mother in the future. Her Honour’s approach, so it was contended, precluded that contingency from being properly taken into consideration. 
     
      
       
      
    76 Contrary to the appellant’s submissions, I do not detect any relevant error on her Honour’s part in the manner suggested. As I have recorded in [62] above, the sentencing judge noted that Mrs Elmir was presently taking medication to control her condition and that although she was unaware how long she would live “fortunately, at this time, she remains relatively well”.  
     
      
       
      
    77 The observations that I have made with respect to the appellant’s submission that her Honour erred in determining that the circumstances were not exceptional, apply equally to the present contention. In all the circumstances I am not prepared to accede to the appellant’s submission that her Honour relevantly failed to take into account in the “general mix” the contingency that at some indeterminate time in the future, prior to the expiration of the appellant’s non-parole period, Mrs Elmir’s condition might deteriorate to the point where she was unable to care for her younger children. 
     
      
       
      
    78 In any event, even if her Honour had overlooked that consideration, nevertheless in all the circumstances I am of the opinion that no sentence other than that imposed by the sentencing judge was warranted in law within the meaning of s 6(3) under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Accordingly, I would reject the appellant’s second ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
      
    79 It follows from the foregoing that the appellant’s challenge to his sentence and conviction fail. I would therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      
    (a) Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    (b) Grant leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    (c) Appeal against sentence dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA : I agree with Latham J. 
     
      
    2 LATHAM J : This an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court by Walmsley SC DCJ (the Judge). The applicant was convicted by a jury of an offence of knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug being not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that drug. The drug was pseudoephedrine. The offence was alleged to have been committed between 23 and 28 August 2005. The offence is a breach of s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1986 for which the maximum penalty is life imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period prescribed for that offence of 15 years. 
     
      
    3 On 25 May 2008 the Judge sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months with a balance of sentence of 2 years and 6 months. The sentence was to commence on 29 October 2006 and the non-parole period expires on 28 April 2014. 
     
      
    4 There are three grounds of appeal as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The sentencing process resulted in a miscarriage of justice because the applicant has been left with a justifiable sense of grievance due to the disparity between his sentence and the sentences imposed upon Du and Lam. 
         
         
        2. The applicant’s sentence is manifestly excessive. 
         
         
        3. The sentencing proceedings miscarried because evidence of the applicant’s son’s developmental disability was not discovered and its significance not understood until after sentence had been imposed. 
        
       
      
    5 The facts can be summarised from the Judge’s sentencing remarks. On 2 August 2005 the offender Du attended a shipping company and handed over documents relating to a container to be shipped from Vietnam. He asked the company to be his agent in relation to the importation of the container. He produced identity and paid over $2,000 in fees. The container arrived in Sydney on 17 August and came under Customs scrutiny. The contents included 886 gypsum statutes. One of these proved positive to narcotics. Investigations revealed the presence of pseudoephedrine in the base of 766 statues. 
     
      
    6 On 21 August Du and the offender Lam leased storage in Padstow, again Du showing proof of his identity. On 24 August the container was delivered to the storage facility. Later that day Du arrived and unpacked some of the boxes containing statues from the container. He put one box in his vehicle and drove away. The next day Du returned and with the help of another person, not charged with any offence, unloaded more packages out of the container. Later that day the offenders Ly and Lam arrived and they looked in the container. They had a conversation that was recorded which disclosed their knowledge as to the presence of drugs. They agreed that it was better to do “it” tomorrow. They then left. 
     
      
    7 The next day, 26 August, the applicant and Ly arrived at the storage facility. They unpacked boxes and removed a number of the statues. Noises were heard consistent with the statues being broken. They removed the bases from about 177 of the statues. At about midday the applicant loaded a box and a number of hessian bags into the back of his vehicle. He then drove off with Ly. Later that day Lam arrived with the offender Nguyen and removed 11 of the boxes and placed them in a vehicle. They then left the premises. 
     
      
    8 When arrested Lam admitted his involvement in the delivery of what he said was Sudafed. He was to receive some of the drug to sell for himself. He said that Du was paid $5,000 but was unaware of the nature of the goods imported. Lam was to be paid $40,000 for the drugs. The weight of the recovered drug was about 300 kilograms and was 25 per cent pure. 
     
      
    9 The applicant’s house was searched and the remains of the bases of some of the statues were located containing white powder. There was also located a number of mobile phones. Du’s residence was searched and the sum of $5,000 was found. Phone records showed that Ly, Du and Lam had been in frequent contact. Ly had been in regular phone contact with the applicant. 
     
      
    10 The pseudoephedrine could have been used in the manufacture of about 100 kilograms of methylamphetamine of 80 per cent purity at a value of about $37 million. 
     
      
    11 The applicant was aged 37 years at the date of sentencing. He was born in Vietnam where he suffered hardship until he escaped by boat. The boat however broke down and the applicant spent some months in a camp in Singapore. He came to Australia under sponsorship of a cousin and attended school in this country until Year 12. He left school to obtain employment to sponsor his sister. Having achieved that result he returned to school to finish his intermediate schooling and obtained entry to university. However he did not complete his university course. He was working for Australia Post when arrested for this offence. He had financial problems because of a gambling habit that resulted in a dishonesty offence in 2002. 
     
      
    12 The Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I am satisfied that [the applicant] was more vulnerable because of his background and his financial troubles and that he was only to receive modest remuneration for his part in this matter. It follows from the jury’s verdict, and the evidence put to the jury, I am satisfied that he knew that he was dealing with illegal drugs. He is, however, and always has been, I am satisfied, a hard working and family orientated man. His history in prison and before augers well. His depression is something for which he will need treatment at some stage. His criminal history is relatively insignificant. I am satisfied that there are very good prospects of rehabilitation. 
        
       
      
    13 The Judge found that the standard non-parole should not apply and did not find special circumstances. It should be noted, however, that the non-parole period imposed is half the prescribed standard non-parole period. The Judge did not explicitly indicate where the offence lay in the range of offences of its kind. It seems that a major reason why the Judge departed from the standard non-parole period was the nature of the role undertaken by the applicant in the venture. He also indicated that parity was an issue. 
     
      
    14 Du pleaded guilty to an offence of importation of Tier 1 goods in breach of s 233BAA(4) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). That is an offence for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years. An offence against him of supplying the drug did not proceed. The Judge sentenced Du to imprisonment for 2 years but suspended that sentence. 
     
      
    15 Ly was convicted of an offence of supplying the drug. The Judge sentenced him to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 9 years with a balance of term of 3 years. 
     
      
    16 Lam pleaded guilty to an offence of importation and an offence of supplying the drug. He was sentenced by her Honour Judge Morgan to imprisonment for 2 years 6 months on the importation offence and a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 8 years and a balance of term of 4 years for the supply offence. The sentences were to be served concurrently. 
     
      
    17 The first ground of appeal is based on the alleged disparity between the sentence imposed upon the applicant on the one hand and the sentences imposed upon Du and Lam on the other. However the second ground asserts that the sentence is manifestly excessive. That ground should be considered first because an argument based upon parity accepts that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was otherwise appropriate. 
     
      
    18 The main thrust of the argument on the second ground is based upon the nature of the drug. It was submitted that it should have been regarded as being in the “midrange of seriousness of prohibited drugs”. This was on that basis that it is not a drug that “end users” seek and that it has less “narcotic or psychotropic” effect than other drugs such as methylamphetamine. It was noted that it was within the category of “tier one goods” under the Customs Act and that it was a precursor under Schedule 1 to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Regulation 2006 the possession of which in breach of s 24A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years (see s 33AB). 
     
      
    19 In my opinion the nature of the prohibited drug is not a mitigating factor in sentencing for an offence under the Act. This was made clear in R v Nai Poon [2003] NSWCCA 42; 56 NSWLR 284 where it was held that the best guide to determining the sentence for different types of prohibited drugs was the structure of the Act under which the offences were created. As Ipp JA stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        18 With respect to those who have expressed different views, I do not think that a person who commits a midrange drug offence is entitled to a discount in comparison with the sentence that would be imposed for a similar offence, relating to heroin or cocaine, merely on the ground that a midrange drug is a less harmful substance. 
         
        
       
      
    20 Hulme J considered that the scheme of the Act in prescribing different quantities, depending upon the nature of the drug, for determining offence categories, such as trafficable and commercial quantities, was significant. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        40. Common experience would suggest that there would have been a number of factors taken into account in the decision as to the weight(s) to be specified for the substances listed. Both potency and the potential of each drug to do harm are likely to have been included. It is not unlikely that there will have been some expert opinion considered in the determination of the substances and quantities specified. But whatever the reasons, the terms of the legislation to which I have referred amount to a clear statement as to the seriousness which Parliament attributes to possession of, or dealing with, not only the substances listed, but also particular quantities of those substances.  
        
       
      
    21 In R v Dang [2005] NSWCCA 430, with the concurrence of Studdert and Whealy JJ, Howie J stated at [29]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………………………This Court no longer approaches the evaluation of the seriousness of a particular supply offence by distinguishing between different types of drugs according to the perceived dangerousness of the drug being supplied. Rather the Court has stressed that the appropriate consideration is the relevant statutory regime and the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence:  
        R v Nai Poon 
         (2003) 56 NSWLR 284;  
        R v Neale 
         (2004) 148 A Crim R 493. The  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         does not distinguish in any way between cocaine and methylamphetamine: the maximum penalty for offences involving the two drugs is the same, as are the prescribed quantities. 
        
       
      
    22 In Adams v The Queen [2008] HCA 15; 82 ALJR 718 the High Court considered whether it was relevant to take into account when sentencing for an offence under the Customs Act that the drug was MDMA on the basis that it was less harmful than heroin. The Justices in the joint judgment (Gleeson CJ, Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) were of the opinion that there was no factual basis to support the argument that MDMA was “less harmful to users and society than heroin”. They then went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [10]  
        An equally serious difficulty for the appellant's argument is in seeking to reconcile it with the scheme of the Customs Act in relation to penalties. In fixing the trafficable and commercial quantities of heroin and MDMA respectively, and applying the same maximum penalties to the quantities so fixed, Parliament has made its own judgment as to an appropriate penal response to involvement in the trade in illicit drugs. The idea that sentencing judges, in the application of that quantity-based system, should apply a judicially constructed harm-based gradation of penalties (quite apart from the difficulty of establishing a suitable factual foundation for such an approach) cuts across the legislative scheme. This problem was recognised by the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales in  
        R v Poon 
        . A similar problem in relation to Victorian legislation underlay the decision in  
        Pidoto and O'Dea 
         noted above. 
        
       
      
    23 The Act recognises that there is difference in the criminality involved in supplying pseudoephedrine when compared with, say, methylamphetamine in the different quantities prescribed for the two drugs. So the commercial quantity in relation to the former is 1.25 kilograms whereas for the latter it is 0.25 kilograms. Similarly the comparable amounts for the large commercial quantity of both drugs is 5 kilograms and 0.5 kilograms. The fact that there is another scheme dealing with the possession or sale of precursors seems to me to be irrelevant especially when the offence involves drugs in the quantity that was being supplied in the present case, some 60 times the large commercial quantity prescribed for the drug.  
     
      
    24 Further, I have difficulty in appreciating any significant difference in culpability, either legal or moral, between the person supplying a precursor and the person using that drug to manufacture another more harmful drug. In R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 this Court stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [166]  
        Nor are we persuaded that the fact that the drug was methylamphetamine, rather than cocaine or heroin, makes any substantial difference in this case. Amphetamines in all their forms regrettably comprise an easily available and widely used illegal substance. A good deal of criminal behaviour, of an organised kind, is attached to their manufacture and distribution. 
        
       
      
    25 This was on any view a commercial operation designed to result in the dissemination into the community of a very large amount of a prohibited drug for profit. As the joint judgment in Adams notes at [8], the most obvious of the facts and circumstances of the present offence was that the applicant was involved in the supply of a prohibited drug. The relationship between the amount of drug being supplied and the large commercial quantity fixed for that type of drug could be determined by a mathematical calculation. 
     
      
    26 The Judge held that the role of the applicant was “significant to the enterprise” and thought that his role was below that of Lam and of Ly. This finding leads in part to the argument in relation to parity. However, before coming to that issue, I should indicate my view that the sentence imposed upon the applicant is a lenient one. 
     
      
    27 As I have already noted, the non-parole period is half of the prescribed standard non-parole period yet the offence was itself a very serious one, if for no other reason, because of the large amount of the drug involved. I would have thought that this supply offence was above midrange in seriousness, even though Judge Morgan found it to be of midrange seriousness and Judge Walmsley did not qualify it. A person committing an offence in the midrange of the hierarchy indicated by the maximum penalty is fortunate, in my opinion, to receive a non-parole period so far below the standard fixed for the offence. There was also the very generous finding made by the Judge that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation notwithstanding his denial of the offence and therefore the lack of any remorse. There is no merit in the complaint that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    28 The parity issue arises because of the sentences imposed upon Du and Lam. Some history is relevant. All the offenders were initially charged with both the importation offence and the supply offence. Complaint was made about this to the trial judge in the case of Du. As a result the Crown was required to elect as to which offence was to proceed in order to avoid the indictment being stayed. In the case of Du, the Crown elected to proceed on the importation offence. In the case of the applicant and Ly, the Crown chose to proceed on the supply offence. No complaint could be made about that decision as an exercise of prosecutorial discretion. 
     
      
    29 However, as a result Du pleaded guilty to an offence that carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. His culpability was based upon recklessness as to the presence of the drug in the container. There were generous findings made in favour of Du. The Judge gave him a discount of 20 per cent for the plea, notwithstanding it was a late plea, on the basis that he could not be expected to plead guilty when there were two charges on the indictment. The Judge found that he was “somewhat naïve and trusting and probably vulnerable because of his marriage break up”. He found that Du was the dupe of Lam and that he did not take enough care to find out what was in the container. Notwithstanding that the Judge found that “no penalty other than one of full time imprisonment is appropriate”, his Honour went on to suspend the sentence of 2 years imprisonment that he imposed. 
     
      
    30 Judge Morgan sentenced Lam for both the importation offence and the supply offence, no point having been taken before her that in some way the indictment was duplicitous or an abuse of process. As noted above, Lam’s non-parole period is 6 months more than that imposed upon the applicant. 
     
      
    31 In relation to Du’s sentence the complaint is that his criminality “seems more significant and indeed even more serious than the applicant’s”. That submission completely ignores the nature of the offence with which Du was charged and the factual findings made by the Judge. But the applicant relies upon a decision of this Court in R v Kerr [2003] NSWCCA 234, that suggests that parity can apply notwithstanding that two offenders are charged with completely different offences. There the applicant, who was sentenced for aggravated robbery, complained of a lack of parity with his co-offenders, one of whom was charged with simple robbery and the other with concealing a serious offence. The judge sentencing the applicant stated that there was no issue of parity between the co-offenders. 
     
      
    32 Miles JA, with whom the other members of the Court concurred, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        19  
        It is established that disparity so called can arise when a co-offender is sentenced after the aggrieved offender has been sentenced: Postiglione v The Queen. In such cases there can be no error on the part of the judge sentencing the offender later aggrieved: Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610-611. It is also recognised that the parity principle is of wide application and is not to be applied or withheld in a technical or pedantic way. It is indeed part of or a reflection of the wider principle that consistency in sentencing by the courts overall is to be aimed at as desirable in the public interest. Perfect consistency is a goal that can never be reached because of the infinite variety of the circumstances of offences and offenders. However there is a danger that it may be compromised by the selection of differing charges so that one offender may be charged with a serious offence and given punishment at the top of an acceptable range for that offence, and a co-offender charged with another less serious offence and dealt with at the very bottom of the acceptable range for that other offence. There may be no impropriety in that course, which will often arise from negotiation between co-offenders and law enforcement authorities. Sometimes, however, and it is not necessary to put it higher than that, the result may have the appearance of injustice. 
         
         
        20  
        In other words when it is known that a person implicated in the offence for which an offender is being sentenced has already been convicted and sentenced, care needs to be taken to ensure that as far as possible the sentence about to be imposed is not so severe as to generate, not only a sense of grievance in the offender but also a sense of disquiet in the disinterested observer. The observer must of course be reasonably acquainted with the circumstances. Sometimes such a situation may be unavoidable. A co-offender may be given immunity in exchange for testifying against the accused. That does not in itself require leniency to be extended to the offender being sentenced let alone a sentence that is so lenient that it is out of the range of what is appropriate. 
         
        
       
      
    33 This statement of principle was considered by this Court in R v Formosa [2005] NSWCCA 363. There the applicant was charged with malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm in company. The co-offender, Wood, was dealt with as an accessory after the fact to the applicant’s offence. In dismissing the appeal, Simpson J stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        40 The decision in  
        Kerr  
        is capable of being read as extending the principle so that it applies even where co-offenders are charged with different offences. I do not wish to be taken as entirely rejecting the proposition that the principle can be so applied, but here, with the extremely wide divergence between the nature of the crimes charged against the co-offender and against the applicant it is difficult, if not impossible, to see how that principle can be applied.  
         
         
        41 The effect of the submissions made on behalf of the applicant (and the decision in  
        Kerr 
         is at least capable of giving them some support) is that the principle of parity in sentencing is broad enough to extend to redressing disparities or discrepancies in the charging process as well as in the sentencing process.  
         
         
        42 In  
        Kerr 
        , there were marked parallels with the present case. The facts suggested that both the applicant and Oliver had been actively involved in the actual assault, and, so far as the facts are recited in the judgment, to a comparable degree. Yet Kerr was charged with a significantly more serious offence than was Oliver. Quite apart from any other differences, which were recognised in the passage quoted in  
        Postiglione 
         as justifying different sentences, that alone imposed demands upon each sentencing judge that were different. 
         
         
        43 In the present case the divergence was even greater. While Colin Wood does not appear actively to have participated in the assault, he was undoubtedly present for the purpose of supporting the applicant. That he was charged only with an accessorial offence is mysterious and unexplained.  
         
         
        44 I do not understand either  
        Lowe 
         or  
        Postiglione 
         to suggest that the parity principle extends to correcting any imbalance in the manner in which co-offenders are charged. I would be very cautious before proposing or adopting any such principle. 
        
       
      
    34 The statement of caution made by Simpson J above was repeated in Spinks v R [2007] NSWCCA 52 where a complaint of disparity was rejected in circumstances where one offender had been charged with less offences than the co-offender. The statement was also endorsed in Yin v R [2007] NSWCCA 350 at [23]–[24], in Kauwenberghs v R [2008] NSWCCA 98 at [109] and referred to in McGuiness v R [2008] NSWCCA 80. In the latter case there was no disparity arising where one offender had been dealt with summarily and the other on indictment. In Yin Barr J stated at [24]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……………….Although I express no opinion about the comparison of an appellant's sentence with that of an offender convicted of a more serious offence, it seems to me that comparison with that of an offender convicted of a less serious offence, as is done in this appeal, is attended with difficulty. 
        
       
      
    35 For completeness I note that Kerr was referred to in Yassine v R [2008] NSWCCA 139 and a small part of the judgment of Miles AJ quoted, but without critical comment. But the argument on parity failed and the appeal was dismissed. Similarly, Formosa and Spinks were referred to by Buddin J (Basten and Barr JJ agreeing) in Holden v R [2008] NSWCCA 100 at [38] with apparent approval and the appeal was dismissed. 
     
      
    36 In my opinion, if Kerr has any applicability, it must be in a very limited class of case. This Court is not generally concerned with addressing the consequences of prosecutorial discretion as it impacts upon the sentences imposed upon offenders. As Miles AJ recognised, it could not be seriously argued that a person should receive a reduction in sentence because a co-offender is not charged or where, for some reason, the charge does not proceed. Why then should a sentence be reduced because another offender is charged with a less serious offence or a lesser number of offences? How does the court inform itself of the reasons why the prosecutor acted as he or she did? Does the court interfere even if the prosecutor’s actions were completely justified? 
     
      
    37 If the disinterested observer is to be consulted then that observer should understand the reasons why the prosecutorial discretion was exercised as it was. If this observer also understands that the courts do not generally supervise the legitimate exercise of prosecutorial discretion or seek to address the results of its exercise, then the observer would feel no disquiet about the different sentencing outcomes. But if such disquiet does arise, it is a result of the prosecutor’s actions and not the sentences imposed by the court. 
     
      
    38 In my opinion there is no justifiable sense of grievance arising from the proceedings against Du or the sentence imposed upon him. 
     
      
    39 In relation to Lam, the Judge himself took into account disparity arising from that sentence. But I fail to see where the justifiable sense of grievance could have arisen that the Judge needed to address or that this Court should further address. Lam was sentenced after pleas of guilty. He had made a record of interview in which he gave his account. He was dealt with as a person of prior good character. There was a pre-sentence report in which Lam blamed his financial problems for his offending but in which he also accepted responsibility for his conduct. He gave evidence on sentence further explaining his involvement in the offence. There was a psychological report in evidence stating that Lam had impaired judgment at the time of the offending because of clinical depression. 
     
      
    40 Judge Morgan, on the material before her, understood that she was to form a view as to Lam’s role in the enterprise. She found, after considering his evidence before her and what he had said to the police and others, that he played a minor role in the importation and was at the “lowest level”. Her Honour concluded that his role was “akin to a courier”. He was “simply to find a person who would take delivery of the container and that person and the offender were then to arrange a storage unit”. He was also, her Honour concluded, “at the lower end of the supply charge”. His involvement was because of threats made to him by persons to whom he owed money. Notwithstanding a finding by her Honour that the supply offence fell within the midrange of objective gravity, her Honour declined to apply the standard non-parole period for these reasons. The judge gave him the benefit of a discount of 20 per cent for the pleas. Her Honour also found special circumstances. 
     
      
    41 In light of those findings the sentence imposed by her Honour was a significant one. The sentence before discount was a non-parole period of 9½ years and an overall sentence of about 14½ years. How then can it be said that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in that he went to trial and yet received a sentence less than that imposed upon Lam despite the 20 per cent discount awarded to Lam? The answer is said to be in the facts found by the Judge sentencing the applicant. 
     
      
    42 As has been noted, the Judge found that the applicant’s role in the enterprise was less than that of Lam, although the Judge also found that it was significant, given the commercial nature of the offence and the sophistication inherent in the importation of such a large amount of the drug. The Judge was not persuaded that the applicant’s role extended beyond the one day, during which he spent about an hour unpacking and re-packing statues.  
     
      
    43 According to these findings, it follows, so the applicant submitted, that the Judge accepted that the applicant’s criminality was below the midrange of objective seriousness. The applicant goes further and maintains that his criminality was low on that scale. Thus, it is submitted that a non-parole period only six months less than that imposed upon Lam is not consistent with such a low level of criminality, relative to that of Lam.  
     
      
    44 This submission confuses the objective gravity of the offence itself, with the criminality of the applicant, as reflected by his role in the offence. The Judge notes the distinction at 11.5 of the remarks on sentence. In any event, it is not altogether clear that the Judge determined that the offence did not fall within the midrange of objective gravity. A specific reference is made to the Crown’s submission that the offence was of that character, and to the applicant’s counsel’s submission that there were reasons justifying a departure from the standard non-parole period. Ultimately, the Judge said “I do not consider that the standard non-parole period should apply here.” Nowhere does the Judge reject the proposition that the offence was within the midrange of objective gravity. On the contrary, the remarks are consistent with the acceptance of the Crown’s submission, and the adoption of the reasons advanced by the applicant’s counsel for the departure from the standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    45 In my opinion, a proper reading of the whole of the remarks on sentence leads to the conclusion that the Judge sentenced the applicant on the basis that the non-parole period to be imposed was necessarily influenced by the standard non-parole period, in the sense that it continued to operate as a guidepost or benchmark. Accepting that it was open to the Judge to find that the applicant’s role exhibited less criminality than that of Mr Lam, there is no disparity between the sentences imposed upon each of them when the sentencing exercise is viewed in this way.  
     
      
    46 The remaining ground of appeal may be dealt with briefly. The applicant and his wife have three children, aged 6, 3 and 2 at the time of the appeal. An affidavit from the applicant’s wife establishes that their youngest son, born in February 2006, has been diagnosed with a gene abnormality of which severe global developmental delay is the primary symptom. The applicant’s wife first noticed marked differences in his behaviour compared to children of a similar age in about May 2007. The boy was assessed by a paediatric physiotherapist on 15 August 2007 and referred to a clinical geneticist in January 2008. It is accepted that the condition was not known to the applicant at the time of sentence and that evidence should be received by the Court in support of this ground of the appeal.  
     
      
    47 The gene abnormality afflicting the applicant’s son requires intervention and assistance with learning, physiotherapy for his motor development, occupational therapy and speech therapy. A comprehensive program has been devised, with the help of a number of agencies. The boy attends child care on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. On Tuesday, he participates in a program at home. The applicant’s wife receives a carer’s allowance and she has been referred to the Autism Support Group. In August 2008, the applicant’s wife was diagnosed with major depression. Not surprisingly, the applicant’s wife is experiencing difficulty in caring for their children without the applicant’s help.  
     
      
    48 The applicant’s argument on the hearing of the appeal on this ground was expressed somewhat differently than the contents of the affidavit might suggest. The hardship to the applicant’s wife was relied upon, yet only in a secondary sense. The primary argument was that the applicant’s time in custody would be more onerous than that of a prisoner who was not burdened with the worries associated with a disabled child. It was submitted that this factor, had it been known at the time of sentence, may have justified a finding of special circumstances. 49 In Eken v R [2007] NSWCCA 320, a submission that leniency ought be extended to an offender was rejected in circumstances where the offender (who himself suffered from a mental illness) had been primarily responsible for the care of a severely physically and intellectually disabled adult brother, who was confined to a wheelchair and required 24 hour care. In that case, other family members had taken over that responsibility since the offender’s incarceration. Hidden J, with whom Handley AJA and Hoeben J agreed, pointed out that, where family members other than an offender were available to care for a gravely ill or disabled child, however onerous the task, the Court generally failed to find exceptional circumstances : see also Roberts v R [2007] NSWCCA 112 ; Elsobky v R [2006] NSWCCA 168 ; Le v R [2006] NSWCCA 136. 
     
      
    50 The applicant does not suggest that he was ever the primary caregiver for his children. I accept that the applicant’s incarceration has placed a considerably greater burden upon his wife in the care of their children, but the family is receiving appropriate support from community agencies and health professionals. As regrettable as the situation is, the hardship to the applicant’s wife does not constitute exceptional circumstances. 
     
      
    51 The alleged hardship to the applicant is not of the kind occasionally endorsed by the courts, namely, serving a sentence on protection, serving a sentence as a former law enforcement officer, or serving a sentence as a foreign national without the support of family and friends. These categories underscore the fact that the conditions of custody must be significantly more onerous, not merely that the prisoner experiences custody differently. Nor is the alleged hardship, in my view, sufficiently unusual to qualify as “special circumstances”. It would not be uncommon amongst the prison population for family members, particularly elderly parents, to be ill or disabled. Given that the underlying purpose of a finding of special circumstances is to benefit the rehabilitation of an offender (see R v Huynh [2005] NSWCCA 220), there is no logical connection between the concerns of the applicant as a parent and the need for a longer period under supervision. This ground of the appeal has not been made out. 
     
      
    52 I propose the following orders :- 
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal granted. 
      
     2. Appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court following his plea of guilty to one count of aggravated robbery. The circumstance of aggravation was the infliction of actual bodily harm. That offence attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. A further offence, which appeared on a Form 1 document, namely that the applicant allowed himself to be carried in a conveyance that had been taken without the consent of the owner, was taken into account on sentence. The sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period of 2 years imprisonment with the total term of imprisonment being one of 4 years. 
     
      
    2 The applicant’s co-offender had earlier been sentenced by another judge. That offender, who stood for sentence in respect of the same offences, received a non-parole period of 18 months imprisonment with the total term being 3 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 The sole ground of appeal is that “the applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance when comparing his sentence with that imposed upon his co-offender”. 
     
      
    4 As there was no dispute about the facts of the matter, they can be briefly stated. 
     
      
    5 On 5 February 2007 the victim was contacted by a woman who offered him accommodation in Kempsey. That night the victim drove to Kempsey where he met the woman at a service station. There she introduced him to her companion who was the applicant. The three of them then travelled to premises in South Kempsey where the co-offender was in attendance. The victim stayed overnight at the premises. 
     
      
    6 The following morning the applicant, the co-offender and the victim went for a drive in the victim’s car. The victim was directed to drive to an area of bushland. The three men then got out of the car and walked some distance along a track. Without warning the victim was attacked from behind by the applicant who punched him a number of times. The co-offender joined in and placed the victim in a headlock. Whilst the co-offender held the victim, the applicant removed his wallet which contained $800, a Westpac card and personal papers. The offenders demanded the victim’s PIN number and the assault continued until he provided them with a number. As it happened, the victim provided them with a bogus number. 
     
      
    7 The applicant and his co-offender then departed. The victim was made to walk but was informed where he could find his car. The victim hitchhiked to Kempsey and reported the matter to police. Later that day the co-offender was arrested at the premises in which the assault upon him had taken place. In the ceiling cavity police recovered the victim’s wallet and his personal papers but the $800 was missing. The victim’s car with the keys in it was also recovered. 
     
      
    8 The applicant was arrested at the same premises about a week later. He was subsequently granted bail but failed to appear at his committal hearing. In due course he was arrested and the sentence to which reference was made earlier was backdated to take into account the period of time which the applicant had spent in custody prior to being arrested. 
     
      
    9 As a result of the attack, the victim suffered a fractured rib and several abrasions and bruising to his face and head. 
     
      
    10 The applicant was born in Bathurst. He was educated to Year 9 but had problems with literacy. Because he has only limited intellectual capacity he was teased at school by other children and got into fights. His relationship with his mother was a difficult one and as a result he ran away from home. Whilst at school he began consuming alcohol and cannabis but later progressed to amphetamines and heroin. At the time that he committed the present offences the applicant was using heroin and speed at a cost of $400 - $500 a day. He attributed his offending conduct, and indeed earlier offences he had committed, to his dependency upon illicit drugs. 
     
      
    11 The applicant does not have any formal trade qualifications and what employment he has had has been in unskilled positions. He and a former partner have three children, who at the time of sentence, were aged between 2 and 6. The applicant has had no contact with them since the breakdown of that relationship several years ago. The evidence reveals that the applicant is estranged from his family and that he has received no visits whilst he has been in gaol. The applicant gave evidence that he wanted to enter a methadone program and to undergo rehabilitation for his drug problems. 
     
      
    12 The applicant indicated his intention to plead guilty some weeks before the trial was listed to commence. For that reason, the sentencing judge allowed him a discount which his Honour described as being “towards the lower end of the range indicated in the guideline judgment of R v Thomson and Houlton”. The sentencing judge was not persuaded that the applicant was truly remorseful for his actions and nor was his Honour prepared to find that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    13 The sentencing judge described the applicant’s antecedents in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        The offender was born on 15 June 1979 and so he is now twenty-eight. He has a criminal history that commenced in the Children’s Court when he was sixteen. It includes offences such as stealing, receiving, having a knife in a public place, assault, contravention of an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order and property damage. For these types of offences he received probation and bonds, fines and periodic detention. For an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm he was imprisoned for eight months in 2005. There are drink driving and other traffic offences as well. He has a record in Victoria for car theft. He has various offences on his Queensland record. In Western Australia there is an offence of robbery in company that brought three months detention in the Children’s Court in 1996. 
        
       
       
        
        These records of previous offences shows in the offender a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law, such that considerations of retribution and personal deterrence should be given a greater emphasis in the sentencing exercise. I do note however that the offence for which he presently stands for sentence is of significantly more seriousness than all of his previous offences, except perhaps the matter in Western Australia I have referred to. 
        
       
       
        
        Another matter to particularly note about the offender’s criminal history is the fact that on 22 January 2007, only a fortnight before committing the offences with which I am concerned, the offender was placed on a good behaviour bond for a driving offence. It was a condition of the bond that he accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. That obviously had no impact upon the offender. Committing an offence whilst in the community on conditional liberty is well recognised as a serious aggravating feature. 
        
       
      
    14 It was against that background that the sentencing judge came to consider the issue of parity. The sentencing judge referred to the objective gravity of the offence and properly concluded that it was a serious one. His Honour also concluded that upon the material before him there was no basis for differentiating between the respective roles of the applicant and his co-offender particularly given that they were involved in a joint enterprise. 
     
      
    15 Although the remarks on sentence in respect of the co-offender were not before the sentencing judge other relevant material, including the co-offender’s antecedents, were in evidence in the applicant’s proceedings.  
     
      
    16 The co-offender was 46 at the time of sentence. He too had a criminal record which commenced in the Children’s Court when he was 13. The sentencing judge observed that it “contains some quite serious offences but most of his offending was in his younger years. I note that [the co-offender] was also on conditional liberty at the time of the offences, he having received a suspended sentence bond a month before for two counts of assault.” In fact the co-offender’s record contained convictions for stealing, break and enter, drug offences, armed robbery and a number of instances of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He had committed offences in five jurisdictions. 
     
      
    17 The sentencing judge was informed by the Crown that the co-offender had pleaded guilty after the jury had been empanelled for his trial and that he had, as a consequence, received a 15% discount from the otherwise appropriate sentence. The Crown informed his Honour that the co-offender had received an additional discount of 25% on sentence for his offer to give evidence against the applicant. 
     
      
    18 It is common ground that the latter information was incorrect. In fact a combined discount of 25% to reflect his plea of guilty (which was assessed as being worth 15%) and his assistance to the authorities was extended to the co-offender. 
     
      
    19 The sentencing judge concluded that “whilst there might be fine differences between the position of each offender, I have come to the view that parity should apply and this means [the applicant] should receive the same sentence as that imposed upon [the co-offender], aside from the discount [the co-offender] received for his undertaking to assist authorities”. The sentencing judge assumed that the earlier judge “had selected a starting point of five years as appropriate and that without the discount for assistance the sentence would have been in the order of four years”. 
     
      
    20 It was upon that basis that the applicant received an overall sentence of 4 years imprisonment. The sentencing judge determined, consistently with the sentence imposed upon the co-offender, to fix the non-parole period at 50% of the overall sentence. 
     
      
    21 In those circumstances the applicant submits that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge is infected by error, albeit one that was caused solely by the inaccurate information provided to him by the Crown. It is submitted that this court should intervene and re-sentence the applicant in such a fashion as to reflect the sentencing judge’s clear intentions. 
     
      
    22 I accept that submission and am fortified in doing so by the very responsible attitude taken by the Crown Prosecutor who appeared in this court. She acknowledged that that was the appropriate course for the court to take. The starting point for the co-offender’s sentence was 4 years imprisonment before the overall discount of 25%, to which he was entitled, was applied. Accordingly, I am of the view that the same starting point of 4 years should apply in the applicant’s case before providing him with a discount for his plea of guilty which, as the sentencing judge said, should be “towards the lower end of the range” of 10% - 25%.  
     
      
    23 In re-sentencing I have had regard to the contents of an affidavit sworn by the applicant. It is not necessary to refer to the contents of it other than to indicate that he has been spending his time in custody productively and that he is taking steps which may provide some optimism for his eventual rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    24 I propose the following orders. 
     
      
       
      1 Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      2 Allow the appeal. 
       
       
      3 Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court. 
       
       
      4 Sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 1 year 8 months with the total term of imprisonment being 3 years 4 months with both terms to commence on 14 November 2007. 
       
       
      5 The total term of imprisonment will expire on 13 March 2011 and the applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 13 July 2009. 
       
      
    25 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree. 
     
      
    26 JAMES J: I also agree. 
     
      
    27 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The orders of the court will be as proposed by Buddin J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: On 29 October 2007 the appellant, David Darley Dowe, was arraigned before his Honour Judge Hulme SC and a jury and charged that between 14 February 2005 and 24 February 2005 he did knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely, cocaine, being an amount not less than the commercial quantity for that drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drugs Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985 (the DMT Act). To this offence the appellant pleaded not guilty. The trial commenced on 29 October 2007 and concluded on 15 November 2007 when the jury returned a verdict of guilty.  
     
      
    2 On 7 March 2008 the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 years comprising a non-parole period of eight years to date from 9 May 2005 and to expire on 8 May 2013 and a balance of term of three years. The appellant appeals only against his conviction.  
     
      
       
      Factual overview 
       
      
    3 From December 2004 a Joint Task Force (the JTF) comprising the New South Wales Police, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commission) was investigating the activities of a group of persons involved in the importation and supply of cocaine. The JTF received information from a Commission registered informer codenamed “Tom” that on 8 October 2004, 10kg of cocaine had been imported into Australia by a syndicate comprising, among others, one Shayne Hatfield (Hatfield).  
     
      
    4 Tom had sold 3kg of the cocaine imported in October 2004 prior to his leaving Australia in December 2004. He told investigators that he had buried the balance of 7kg at Wahroonga and that it was possible that Hatfield would want that cocaine sold prior to a further importation, which was anticipated to occur in late February 2005. On 6 February 2005 Tom met with Hatfield and one Gilbert Gedeon (Gedeon) and arrangements were made for Gedeon to purchase 2kg of the cocaine for $340,000, with the sale to take place on 8 February 2005. 
     
      
    5 On 7 February 2005 Tom took investigators to the area where the remaining 7kg of cocaine from the October importation had been buried. This was seized and taken to the Australian Government National Measurement Institute for analysis. It was thereafter in the possession of the Commission which was supervising the investigation. It was decided that the cocaine would be sold as if Tom were still an active player in the syndicate rather than working with the authorities, as was the case. 
     
      
    6 On 10 February 2005 Hatfield and Tom met with one Robert Pavan (Pavan). An arrangement was made for Tom to sell Pavan 1kg of the cocaine for $160,000. As it turned out this transaction did not proceed until 23 February 2005.  
     
      
    7 Pursuant to s 6(1) of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997 (the LECO Act), on 22 February 2005, Phillip Alexander Bradley (Bradley), Chief Executive Officer of the Commission, authorised Mark Williams Standen (Standen), a law enforcement officer within the meaning of the LECO Act, to conduct a “controlled operation” within the meaning of that Act. That operation was to be conducted in accordance with the plan of that operation accompanying the application for the authority made by Standen pursuant to s 5(1) of the LECO Act (the operation). The objective of the operation was to obtain evidence of criminal activity being the commission of offences under s 25(2) of the DMT Act.  
     
      
    8 The authority so granted was numbered 05/01038 (the Dowe Authority). It authorised Standen not only to conduct the operation but also to engage in a “controlled activity” being the possession of 1kg of cocaine and its supply to Tom. It also authorised Tom to engage in such an activity being the possession of 1kg of cocaine and its supply to Pavan and/or persons acting on his behalf or at his request, at Newtown, in exchange for $160,000. The Dowe Authority was in force for a period ending at 6.20pm on 25 February 2005. 
     
      
    9 Pursuant to the Dowe Authority, at about 8pm on 23 February 2005, police gave Tom a vacuum-sealed bag containing 1kg of cocaine which had been placed in a plastic David Jones bag. At about 8.30pm that evening Tom met Pavan in Newtown and a conversation occurred which was recorded by a listening device. Tom then walked to a lane opposite St. John Street, Newtown and a short time later a vehicle driven by one Ian Finch (Finch) reversed into the lane. The appellant was sitting in the passenger seat of that vehicle. 
     
      
    10 A short time later Tom walked into the lane, approached the vehicle and placed the bag containing the cocaine into its boot. He then removed a box containing $170,000 and the vehicle drove away. A short time later Finch stopped the vehicle then got out and opened the boot and checked the contents of the bag containing the cocaine. He returned to the driver’s seat and drove to the Sydney Harbour Casino at Pyrmont where the appellant alighted from the vehicle and entered the Casino. Finch then drove home and parked the vehicle in his garage. 
     
      
    11 After Tom had placed the bag containing the cocaine in the boot of Finch’s car and removed the money therefrom, he met up with Pavan a short time later and a financial transaction took place. On 24 February 2005 Finch met with Pavan. They went to the boot of Finch’s car whereupon he handed Pavan the 1kg of cocaine. The police observed all of the foregoing. 
     
      
    12 Thereafter the police intercepted calls between Finch and Hatfield, the appellant and Finch, and between the appellant and Pavan. In particular, conversations took place between Finch and the appellant with respect to the quality of the cocaine that had been purchased from Tom on 23 February. On 4 March 2005, Pavan met with the appellant and thereafter the appellant rang Finch and a conversation again took place with respect to the quality of the cocaine purchased from Tom compared with that previously supplied. 
     
      
    13 On 6 March 2005 the appellant and Finch again spoke about the quality of the cocaine purchased from Tom compared to that supplied on earlier occasions. On 9 May 2005 JTF executed numerous search warrants and Finch, Gedeon, the appellant and Pavan, amongst others, were arrested and charged. Finch pleaded guilty and gave evidence for the prosecution.  
     
      
       
      The authorities issued under the  
      LECO Act 
       
      
    14 I have already referred at [8] above to the Dowe Authority issued by Bradley on 22 February 2005 which permitted Standen, then Assistant Commissioner of Investigations for the Commission, to provide 1kg of cocaine to Tom so that he could supply it to Pavan or another person at his request. In fact, Bradley had issued a number of similar authorities during the course of the investigation. One of those was Authority No. 05/00556 issued by Bradley on 7 February 2005 and pursuant to which Tom supplied 2kg of cocaine to Gedeon on 8 February 2005 (see [4] above (the Gedeon Authority). Gedeon, like the appellant, had been charged with an offence under s 25(2) of the DMT Act for knowingly taking part in the supply of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely cocaine. 
     
      
    15 The law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation apparently considered that through Tom they were presented with a unique opportunity to infiltrate an organisation of syndicated drug importers and to identify their supply and distribution chains. In order to maximise the prospects of apprehending and prosecuting as many persons involved in that criminal activity as possible, the agencies utilised Tom to engage in a series of controlled operations purportedly authorised pursuant to the LECO Act.  
     
      
       
      The legislative scheme 
       
      
    16 The LECO Act makes provision for controlled operation applications (s 5), the determination of such an application (s 6), the form of authority (s 8), the duration of an authority (s 9), the variation of an authority (s 10), the cancellation of an authority (s 12), the effect of the authority (s 13) and the lawfulness of controlled activities and ancillary activities (ss 16, 17 and 18). Relevantly, the Act also expressly provides that certain activities cannot be authorised thereunder (s 7).  
     
      
    17 The provisions of the LECO Act of relevance for present purposes were as follows:

        … 
        
       
       
        
        5(2A) In any application, whether formal or urgent, the applicant must provide the following particulars:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a plan of the proposed operation, 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the nature of the criminal activity or corrupt conduct in respect of which the proposed operation is to be conducted, 
          
         
         
          
          (c) the nature of the controlled activity in respect of which an authority is sought, 
          
         
         
          
          (d) a statement of whether or not the proposed operation, or any other controlled operation with respect to the same criminal activity or corrupt conduct, has been the subject of an earlier application for an authority or variation of an authority and, if so, whether or not the authority was given or variation granted. 
          
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        6(1) After considering an application for authority to conduct a controlled operation, and any additional information furnished under section 5 (3), the chief executive officer:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) may authorise a law enforcement officer for the law enforcement agency concerned to conduct the operation, either unconditionally or subject to conditions, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) may refuse the application. 
          
         
        … 
         
        (3) An authority to conduct a controlled operation may not be granted unless the chief executive officer is satisfied as to the following matters:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that criminal activity or corrupt conduct has been, is being or is about to be conducted in relation to matters within the administrative responsibility of the agency, 
          
         
         
          
          (b) that the nature and extent of the suspected criminal activity or corrupt conduct are such as to justify the conduct of a controlled operation, 
          
         
         
          
          (c) that the nature and extent of the proposed controlled activities are appropriate to the suspected criminal activity or corrupt conduct, 
          
         
         
          
          (d) that the proposed controlled activities will be capable of being accounted for in sufficient detail to enable the reporting requirements of this Act to be fully complied with. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) In considering the matters referred to in subsection (3), the chief executive officer must have regard to the following:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the reliability of any information as to the nature and extent of the suspected criminal activity or corrupt conduct, 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the likelihood of success of the proposed controlled operation compared with the likelihood of success of any other law enforcement operation that it would be reasonably practicable to conduct for the same purposes, 
          
         
         
          
          (c) the duration of the proposed controlled operation. 
          
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        7(1) An authority to conduct a controlled operation must not be granted in relation to a proposed operation that involves any participant in the operation:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) … 
          
         
         
          
          (b) engaging in conduct that is likely to seriously endanger the health or safety of that or any other participant, or any other person, or to result in serious loss or damage to property. 
          
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) It is a sufficient defence to criminal or disciplinary proceedings arising from conduct that has been engaged in by the defendant in reliance on an authority that has been cancelled if the defendant satisfies the court or tribunal before which the proceedings are being heard:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that the defendant engaged in the conduct in good faith for the purposes of, and in the course of, a controlled operation for which the authority had been in force, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) that, had the authority been in force when the defendant engaged in the conduct, the conduct would have been lawful by operation of section 16, and 
          
         
         
          
          (c) that the defendant was unaware, and could not reasonably be expected to have been aware, that the authority had been cancelled. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        13 While it has effect, an authority for a controlled operation:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) authorises each law enforcement participant to engage in the controlled activities specified in the authority in respect of the law enforcement participants, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) authorises each civilian participant (if any) to engage in the particular controlled activities (if any) specified in the authority in respect of that participant. 
          
         
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        16 Despite any other Act or law, an activity that is engaged in by a participant in an authorised operation in the course of, and for the purposes of, the operation is not unlawful, and does not constitute an offence or corrupt conduct, so long as it is authorised by, and is engaged in accordance with, the authority for the operation.” 
        
       
      
    18 Provision is also made in Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (which includes s 15M) for the authorisation of controlled operations for obtaining evidence with respect to Commonwealth offences. Both the LECO Act and Part 1AB contain parallel provisions for the conduct of controlled operations. It was common ground in the present case that no certificate for such an operation under s 14M of the Commonwealth legislation had been obtained. It was also common ground that both Part 1AB and the LECO Act were enacted as a result of the judgment of the High Court in Ridgeway v The Queen [1995] HCA 66; (1995) 184 CLR 19 (Ridgeway). It will be necessary to refer further to this decision later in these reasons. Finally it was also common ground that the protection of s 16 of the LECO Act did not extend to any offence under Commonwealth law. 
     
      
       
      The validity of the Gedeon Authority and the Dowe Authority (the Authorities) is challenged 
       
      
    19 The Commission was issued subpoenas for the production of documents during the course of committal proceedings with respect to the appellant in March 2006, and Bradley as the Commissioner was subpoenaed to attend and give evidence. The issue of the subpoenas was opposed on the ground that the reasons for the issue of the Dowe Authority were not relevant and any challenge to its legal validity should be instituted in the Supreme Court by way of judicial review proceedings pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970. 
     
      
    20 Accordingly, on 11 April 2006 the appellant and Gedeon commenced judicial review proceedings in the Supreme Court, ultimately claiming, inter alia, that the Authorities were ultra vires and invalid. 
     
      
    21 On 13 April 2006 the appellant and Gedeon were committed for trial. The appellant’s first trial commenced on 26 April 2007 before her Honour Judge Murrell and a jury.  
     
      
    22 In the meantime, on 6 March 2007 the Supreme Court proceedings of both the appellant and Gedeon were determined by Hall J, who affirmed the validity of the Authorities: Dowe v Commissioner of New South Wales Crime Commission [2007] NSWSC 166; (2007) 169 A Crim R 43 (Dowe No. 1). Relevantly for present purposes, his Honour held that the Authorities were not issued in contravention of s 7(1)(b) of the LECO Act.  
     
      
       
      The first trial of the appellant before Judge Murrell 
       
      
    23 As I have observed, the appellant’s first trial commenced on 26 April 2007. He was originally indicted on three counts of knowingly taking part in the supply of a commercial quantity of cocaine and entered pleas of “Not Guilty” to each count. On the first day of the trial application was made to exclude the evidence obtained pursuant to the Dowe Authority. In support of that application, evidence on the voir dire was given over a period of some four days. In her judgment of 4 May 2007 (R v Dowe [2007] NSWDC 92) Judge Murrell identified (at [11]) five questions for her determination of which four are presently relevant: namely:  
     
      
       
      (1) whether on and after 7 February 2005 the cocaine was handled illegally or improperly at least until 22 February when the Dowe Authority was issued; 
       
       
      (2) whether prior to 22 February 2005, the police had a “ 
      reasonable 
        
      excuse 
      ” for possessing/handling the cocaine or whether their possession/handling thereof was illegal under s 233B of the  
      Customs Act  
      1901 (Cth) and/or under the  
      DMT Act 
      ; 
       
       
       (3) whether any evidence was “ 
      obtained 
      ” illegally/improperly or “ 
      in consequence of 
      ” an illegality/impropriety within the meaning of s 138(1) of the  
      Evidence Act  
      1995. 
       
       
      (4) whether the Crown had established despite any illegality/impropriety, that the evidence would nevertheless be admitted pursuant to the discretionary provisions of s 138. 
       
      
    24 Her Honour answered the first question, insofar as it related to the improper handling of the cocaine, in the affirmative. She held (at [15]) that the cocaine was a prohibited import so that by the operation of s 229(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) it was forfeited to the Crown. Having been so forfeited, it became “special forfeited goods” within the meaning of s 183UA(1) of that Act. After analysis, the 7kg of cocaine came into the possession of Standen who, by coincidence, was an officer of the AFP. However, the cocaine was an AFP exhibit to which the AFP Exhibits Guidelines applied. Her Honour found (at [19]) that no consideration was given to following those Guidelines although Standen was aware of them as well as the Commonwealth legislation relating to the authorisation of controlled operations.  
     
      
    25 Her Honour’s finding with respect to Standen’s evidence on this issue was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “20. When it came to applying for a controlled operation authority, according to Mr Standen, passing consideration was given to seeking a Commonwealth authority under Part 1AB 
          
        of the  
        Crimes Act  
        1914 
          
        but that option was rejected because the proposed controlled operation ‘ 
        had the flavour of a State supply’.  
        Given that, prior to applying for any controlled operation authority, the AFP had been excluded from the process of determining how to deal with the 7kg of cocaine, I find that no serious consideration was given to seeking a Commonwealth authority. Had the matter been given serious consideration, then it would have become apparent that no Commonwealth authority could be granted because the cocaine was unlikely to remain under the control of the police at the end of the operation: s 15M(3 
        ) Crimes Act  
        1914. 
        
       
       
        
        21. In short, Mr Standen and other officers attached to the joint task force failed to acknowledge that the drug was forfeited to the Commonwealth Crown and failed to treat it in accordance with the AFP Exhibits Guidelines, which apply to Commonwealth drug exhibits.”  
        
       
      
    26 Standen was also a special officer for NSW and had the duties of a NSW police officer. He was aware, her Honour found, of the NSW legislation with respect to the processing of the cocaine as a NSW drug exhibit. However, he failed to process the drug in accordance with NSW drug exhibit procedures. This, her Honour held (at [26]), was not unlawful but was, at most, an impropriety. Applying the relevant authorities on the meaning of “impropriety” in s 138 of the Evidence Act, her Honour held that Standen’s conduct whereby he failed to manage the 7kg of cocaine under either the NSW or Commonwealth schemes for the management of drug exhibits, so qualified as it was deliberate and was clearly inconsistent with minimum standards. 
     
      
    27 With respect to Question 2, she noted (at [33]) the concession of the Crown that unless the police and Tom could establish a “reasonable excuse” for possession of the cocaine under s 233B(1AAB) of the Customs Act, up until the issue by the Dowe Authority, the possession of the drug contravened s 233B(1)(iv) and/or (v) of that Act. However, her Honour held (at [37]) that prior to 22 February 2005 (being the date of issue of the Dowe Authority), there was no “reasonable excuse” for the conduct that was otherwise rendered unlawful by s 233B of the Customs Act. 
     
      
    28 Nevertheless, having found that it was appropriate to deal with the cocaine under NSW legislation, her Honour determined (at [41]) that as a consequence of the decision of Hall J in Dowe No. 1, the existence of a valid NSW controlled operation authority not only provided protection in relation to conduct which would otherwise have involved State offences, but also provided a “reasonable excuse” for what would otherwise have been unlawful conduct under the Customs Act. She therefore concluded that 
     
      
       
        
        ”between 7 February and the grant of the controlled operation authority on 22 February, police possession and handling of the drug was illegal but from the [date] of the grant of authority it was not unlawful.” 
        
       
      
    29 As I understand her Honour’s reasons, her finding of “reasonable excuse” for the purposes of the Customs Act was referable only to the period subsequent to the grant of the Dowe Authority. 
     
      
    30 With respect to Question 3, her Honour noted (at [45]) that challenged evidence would be excluded only where there is a causal connection between the illegality/impropriety and the obtaining of the impugned evidence. The former must have “produced” the latter. Her Honour then held: 
     
      
       
        
        “46. The impropriety of failing to follow the Federal or State scheme for the management of drug exhibits did not impact upon the events of 23 February, let alone ‘produce’ any significant evidence. On 2 February, the NSW Police Commissioner approved in principle the course of conduct which was followed on 23 February. I infer that, had a s39RA 
          
        direction [under the  
        DMT Act 
        ] been sought, it would have been granted. 
        
       
       
        
        47. Nor did the offences against the  
        Customs Act  
        and the  
        DMT Act  
        impact upon the events of 23 February. For practical purposes, the events of 23 February and thereafter were unaffected by the preceding failure to adhere to the NSW scheme for dealing with drug exhibits, which was itself an impropriety, and which resulted in the police possession of drugs being illegal prior to the grant of the controlled operation authority. 
        
       
       
        
        48. The accused has not established that any relevant evidence was ‘obtained’ improperly or in contravention of Australian law, or ‘in consequence of’ an impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.” 
        
       
      
    31 In the foregoing circumstances her Honour found it unnecessary to consider Question 4 insofar as it involved the exercise of the discretion contemplated by s 138(1). However, she did comment (at [49]) that  
     
      
       
        
        “there are many factors which may have militated in favour of admitting evidence of the events of 23 February and thereafter. Inter alia, the relevant offences [with which the appellant was charged] are very serious and no mala fides has been demonstrated on the part of the police.” 
        
       
      
    32 Having rejected the appellant’s application to exclude the evidence obtained prior to the issue of the Dowe Authority on 22 February 2005, the trial continued and at the close of the Crown case on 21 May 2007, her Honour directed the jury to return verdicts of not guilty in relation to the first two counts on the indictment and, with respect to the third count, discharged the jury and ordered a retrial.  
     
      
       
      The appeal from the decision of Hall J 
       
      
    33 On 9 August 2007, the Court of Appeal comprising Spigelman CJ, Basten JA and Handley AJA, heard appeals by the appellant and Gedeon from the decision of Hall J upholding the validity of the Authorities. On 19 October 2007 both appeals were dismissed by majority (Spigelman CJ, Handley AJA agreeing) and Basten JA dissented: Dowe v Commissioner of New South Wales Crime Commission & Anor; Gedeon v Commissioner of New South Wales Crime Commission & Anor [2007] NSWCA 296; (2007) 177 A Crim R 44.  
     
      
    34 Before the Court of Appeal the challenge to the validity of the Authorities was founded upon s 7(1)(b) of the LECO Act which prohibited the granting of an authority to conduct a controlled operation that, relevantly, involved any participant in the operation  
     
      
       
        
        “(b) engaging in conduct that is likely to seriously endanger the health or safety of that or any other participant, or any other person …” 
        
       
      
    35 It was contended that the question posed by s 7(1)(b) with respect to whether or not any authorised conduct was “likely to seriously endanger the health or safety” of persons was a jurisdictional fact in the sense that it was a matter for the Court, on the evidence before it, to determine. That contention was rejected by the Chief Justice (at [32]) who held that the precondition in s 7(1)(b) operated  
     
      
       
        
        “as an emphatic instruction to the decision-maker but it is not a jurisdictional fact of a character which must exist in truth, and may be determined by a court on the basis of evidence adduced to the court but which was never before the decision-maker.” 
        
       
      
    36 The alternative basis of challenge was one of Wednesbury unreasonableness. The Chief Justice identified two issues under this head. The first was whether the word “conduct” in s 7 was to be narrowly interpreted so as to refer only to the act of handing over the cocaine and without reference to its subsequent use. The second was whether the demanding test of irrationality or unreasonableness was met in the particular circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    37 With respect to the first issue the Chief Justice observed (at [49]): 
     
      
       
        
        “If the subsequent distribution to end users of the cocaine fell within the scope of the prohibited ’conduct‘ in which a participant would engage pursuant to an authority, within the meaning of s7(1)(b), it was not, and could not be, contended that the health of those users was not ‘seriously endangered’. The only issue was whether his Honour was correct to confine the scope of the conduct so that it did not so extend.”  
        
       
      
    38 The critical issue, therefore, was the identity of the persons upon whom the relevant effect was to occur. That turned upon the words “any other person” in s 7(1)(b). At [54] the Chief Justice held: 
     
      
       
        
        “The words ‘ 
        any other person 
        ’ should be read  
        ejusdem generis 
         with the reference to ’participants’ in the controlled operation so as to be confined to persons proximate to, that is, in the physical vicinity of, the operation upon whom the authorised conduct directly impinges.” 
        
       
       
      Accordingly, the majority held that s 7(1)(b) did not extend to the end users of the cocaine which was proposed to be sold pursuant to the Authorities. 
       
      
    39 Basten JA agreed with the Chief Justice (at [73]) that the relevant jurisdictional fact was the satisfaction of the Commissioner so that the matter was not one for determination by a court if and when the authority was challenged. However, his Honour disagreed with the majority with respect to the proper construction of s 7(1)(b). In his view, once it was accepted that the relevant conduct (the supply of cocaine) was likely to result in consumption of the drug and that consumption of it would or was likely to endanger the health of the consumer, it followed both as a matter of construction and in terms of the policy underlying the legislation, that that was a factor which was required to be taken into account. If it was taken into account, then absent some specific circumstance, which had not been identified by the parties, the authority could not be granted: see at [81]. Accordingly, his Honour concluded (at [86]) that the Authorities could not have been properly granted as the grant would in each case have been prohibited by s 7(1)(b).  
     
      
       
      The second trial of the appellant before Judge Hulme SC 
       
      
    40 The second trial of the appellant on the third count commenced on 31 October 2007 before Judge Hulme SC and a jury. Although it proceeded on the basis of the majority decision of the Court of Appeal given on 19 October 2007, the appellant asserted in his written submissions that it also proceeded on the basis of the rulings of her Honour Judge Murrell on 4 May 2007, it being contended that the only application to exclude the pre-22 February evidence in the second trial was with respect to matters not previously litigated. However, I am not convinced that this is correct although Judge Hulme acknowledged that the arguments advanced before Judge Murrell were more wide-ranging than those which were advanced before him. Nevertheless, it seems to me that at least Questions 23 and 4 before Judge Murrell (see [23] above) was again agitated before Judge Hulme.  
     
      
    41 In this context much of the evidence given on the voir dire before Judge Murrell related to this issue. Although the trial judge noted that Judge Murrell’s judgment was before him, he acknowledged the necessity for him to make his own findings on the evidence to which he had been directed and, on the basis of the submissions he had heard, for him to come to his own conclusions with respect thereto. 
     
      
       
      The decision of Judge Hulme on the application to exclude pre-22 February evidence 
       
      
    42 As noted by his Honour in his judgment of 15 November 2007 on the application to exclude the evidence obtained prior to 22 February 2005, the focus of the appellant’s submissions was on the asserted illegality under the Customs Act of the NSW authorities dealing with cocaine which had been unlawfully imported and, pursuant to s 229(1)(b) of the Customs Act, forfeited to the Crown. As his Honour noted, that asserted illegality was the unlawful dealing in forfeited goods contrary to s 233B(1) of the Customs Act. 
     
      
    43 Both before Judge Murrell and the trial judge, the Crown conceded that unless the police and Tom could establish a “reasonable excuse” for possession of the cocaine under s 233B(1AAB) of the Customs Act, up until the issue of the Dowe Authority, their possession of what was a prohibited import contravened s 233B(1) of that Act.  
     
      
    44 With respect to that issue (Question 2 before Judge Murrell), the trial judge made the following finding: 
     
      
       
        
        “Given that the activities relating to the possession and conveying of the cocaine were done by investigating officials and their agent [Tom] in the pursuit of evidence to enable prosecution of persons involved in serious criminal activity concerning a dangerous drug, I would have thought ‘ 
        a reasonable excuse 
        ’ would be well established and so no offence was committed. The fact that the activity involved the use of a civilian informant and that some of the drug might find its way into the community might well have been a concern for the AFP for policy reasons, but it does not alter the view I have formed on this reasonable excuse issue.” 
        
       
       
      This finding was contrary to that of Judge Murrell to which I have referred at [27] above. 
       
      
    45 The trial judge then considered whether, if he be wrong with respect to his finding on the issue of “a reasonable excuse”, the pre-22 February evidence was obtained “in consequence of” a contravention of an Australian law within the meaning of s 138(1)(b) of the Evidence Act (Question 3 before Judge Murrell). On that issue he inclined to the view that the necessary causal connection was established 
     
      
       
        
        “on the rather simplistic basis that if it was not for the possessing and the conveying of the cocaine by the authorities and their agent, much of the evidence that the Crown now seeks to rely upon to establish the guilt of each of the accused would not have been obtained.” 
        
       
      
    46 This finding was inconsistent with that of Judge Murrell to which I have referred at [30] above. His Honour then addressed the issue posed by s 138(1) as to whether the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting it given the manner in which it had been obtained (Question 4 before Judge Murrell). In so doing he referred in some detail to the evidence given on the voir dire before Judge Murrell, particularly by Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan (Phelan) of the AFP on the one hand and Standen on the other. His Honour referred to Phelan’s evidence to the effect that whilst the AFP would not accept the appropriateness of the proposed trafficking in cocaine, it regarded the matter as one for the NSW police and the Commission. As far as Phelan was concerned, he had no issue with the illegality of it. He said “As far as I was concerned, it was legal at the time”. His Honour considered that Phelan was saying that whilst the AFP would not countenance itself being involved in the proposed operation, he saw nothing wrong with the State authorities conducting the operation for the purpose of apprehending those involved in an offence against State law. 
     
      
    47 The trial judge then referred to Standen’s evidence to the effect that although the Commonwealth authorities had some jurisdictional control over the cocaine, nevertheless what was involved was the conduct of State authorities who had jurisdiction in relation to State offences and that it was in respect of the investigation of the latter that he, Standen, had sought and obtained the Dowe Authority. His Honour also referred to Standen’s evidence that he did not think it was necessary to obtain a Commonwealth controlled operation authority. He understood Standen’s evidence to be that he had turned his mind to that possibility but had made a deliberate decision that such an authority was not required. 
     
      
    48 His Honour next referred to the evidence of Standen whereby he agreed that possession of a prohibited import was unlawful under Commonwealth law in the absence of a reasonable excuse. However, he, Standen, did not at any stage consider that he might be in breach of that law.  
     
      
    49 Much was made before the trial judge of the question as to whether there was a dispute between the Commonwealth and State authorities regarding the proposed controlled operation involving the sale of the cocaine. His Honour considered that the gist of what Standen had said was that he was clearly aware that the AFP would not have any direct involvement in such activity but that their opposition did not extend to withdrawing their officers from the JTF. They were content to have them continue to act in the background in what might be described as passive support of the operation.  
     
      
    50 It was submitted at trial on behalf of the appellant’s co-accused (and adopted by the appellant) that his Honour should find that Standen deliberately chose not to obtain an appropriate controlled activity authority from the Commonwealth authorities because he knew that such an authority would not be granted. Hence he either deliberately or recklessly flouted the law in this respect. It was submitted that to permit the pre-22 February evidence to be given in these circumstances would be to give tacit curial approval to deliberate or reckless illegal behaviour that should not be countenanced. It was submitted that the considerations referred to in s 138(3) such as the probative value of the evidence and the other matters therein referred to which might otherwise militate in favour of admitting the evidence “fell by the wayside” when compared with how easily the law could have been complied with by Standen in light of his deliberate decision not to do so. 
     
      
    51 The trial judge rejected these submissions in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am not satisfied that Mr Standen deliberately chose not to obtain a controlled operation authority. In my view his focus was, in the main, on obtaining sanction in respect of activity that might otherwise be prescribed under New South Wales criminal law and that is well understandable as the activity envisaged fell squarely within the confines of that law. It would be, in my view, a remarkable state of affairs that New South Wales investigating officers should obtain Commonwealth sanctions whenever contemplating controlled operations involving the supply within New South Wales of prohibited drugs that could be expected to have been imported, or highly likely to have been imported, such as heroin and cocaine, particularly when the target of such operations are persons suspected of involvement not in any Commonwealth criminal offence but of purely State criminal offences.” 
        
       
      
    52 On the issue of whether he should exercise his discretion to admit the evidence, the trial judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Given my view of Mr Standen’s approach to the matter as indicated earlier, I am clearly convinced that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that was obtained in the way it wa[s]. I am not of the view that the contravention of the law, if there was one, was either deliberate or reckless. The probative value and the importance of the evidence is high and it relate to the alleged commission of very serious offences by persons suspected of ongoing involvement in such serious criminal activity. The gravity of the contravention, if there was one, is minor in the scheme of things in that it may at best be regarded as an innocent and understandable mistake as to the state of the law. …” 
        
       
      
    53 Finally, his Honour summarised his views in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “To summarise, my first view is that there was no contravention of Australian law and so the provisions of s 138 are not engaged. If however, I am wrong in this view I am steadfastly of the view that it is appropriate in the circumstances of this case to exercise the discretion to admit the evidence nonetheless.” 
        
       
      
    54 Although the trial judge’s reasons for admitting the evidence objected to are dated 15 November 2007, the application to exclude the evidence was rejected by his Honour on 31 October 2007 upon the basis that he would give his reasons at a later time. The trial then proceeded until 15 November 2007 when the jury convicted the appellant of the offence with which he was charged. 
     
      
       
      The Dowe Authority is held invalid by the High Court 
       
      
    55 On 16 November 2007 (being the day following his conviction), the appellant filed an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal given on 19 October 2007. The special leave application was, on 18 April 2008, referred by Gleeson CJ and Gummow J to a court of six Justices which heard the application on 30 July 2008 and delivered judgment on 4 September 2008: Gedeon v Commissioner of New South Wales Crime Commission; Dowe v Commissioner of New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] HCA 43; (2008) 82 ALJR 1465. 
     
      
    56 In a joint judgment the Court granted special leave to appeal and declared each of the Authorities invalid. Three submissions were advanced to the Court by the appellant and Gedeon. The first was that the prohibition in s 7(1)(b) of the LECO Act was concerned with the existence of the Commissioner’s power to grant an authority rather than with the exercise of a discretion to do so. It was, therefore, a “jurisdictional fact”.  
     
      
    57 The second was that the reference in s 7(1)(b) to “any other person” was not, contrary to the view taken by the majority in the Court of Appeal, confined to persons in the physical vicinity of the authorised conduct; rather, that phrase encompassed harm to other persons which was the foreseen and expected consequence of the conduct in question.  
     
      
    58 The third submission was to the effect that s 16 of the LECO Act did not render lawful conduct that, while unlawful at common law or under NSW statute law, was also made unlawful by Commonwealth law. The Court rejected this submission. Nevertheless it recognised (at 1473 [41]) that there was a need for approval under both the State and Commonwealth statutory regimes if full protection for those involved was to be obtained. Further, the absence of a necessary approval under either scheme would be sufficient to raise at trial the operation of s 138 of the Evidence Act. However, s 138 apart, authority under the LECO Act (if otherwise valid) was effective without a certificate under s 15M of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 
     
      
    59 On the other hand, the Court upheld the first two submissions. At [46] it noted that s 7(1) was expressed in terms of prohibition and thus delimited the scope for any exercise of authority by a chief executive officer. The provision conveyed the notion of a contraction in the content of what would be the power otherwise conferred by s 6. If it be established upon a “collateral” attack decided by way of a ruling at trial under s 138 of the Evidence Act that, for example, the authority in question was in relation to a proposed operation involving a participant engaging in conduct that was likely to seriously endanger the health or safety of that or any other participant or any other person, then the grant of the authority was beyond power. 
     
      
    60 Notwithstanding the Chief Justice’s construction of the words “any other person” which I have set out in [38] above, in the High Court counsel for the Commission submitted that the expression “any other person” was limited to those involved in the operation in question. However, the Court noted (at [52]) that the emphasis in s 7(1)(b) was upon exposure to the risks of danger or peril rather than upon the materialisation of that risk. After referring to the passage from the judgment of the Chief Justice which I have recorded at [37] above, the Court noted (at [55]) that s 7(1)(b) used the term “likely” and did not speak in terms of the serious endangerment as a necessary consequence of engagement in the conduct authorised.  
     
      
    61 I mention these findings as the evidence of Standen tendered at the trial and upon which the appellant relies in the present appeal referred to the fact that cocaine was far less dangerous than other drugs such as heroin and that no deaths from cocaine had ever been recorded. I shall return to this and other evidence of Standen relating to his understanding of s 7(1)(b) later in these reasons. 
     
      
    62 The Court concluded this issue in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “57. A reasonable person in the position of the defendant would have foreseen that the conduct of the activities the subject of the Authorities would involve a risk of seriously endangering the health of some at least of the numerous class of end purchasers of the cocaine. The contrary is impossible to reconcile with the legislative judgment, reflected both in federal and State law, prohibiting respectively the importation, supply and possession of such drugs. That prospect was sufficient to attract, as the legislative response to such a situation of risk, the prohibition in par (b) of s 7(1) of the LECO Act.  
        
       
       
        
        58. The submission by the Commission that the phrase ""any other person"" is limited to participants in the operation reads down the ordinary meaning of that phrase and does so with the consequence of leaving the State exposed to the possibility of civil liability to a range of third parties, a hazard the legislature wished to avoid.” 
        
       
       
      The appellant’s ground of appeal 
       
      
    63 The appellant’s sole ground of appeal was stated in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was a miscarriage of justice as the trial of the applicant proceeded on the basis that the supply to him and others of 1 kilogram of cocaine was pursuant to a lawful controlled operation authority when in fact that authority and the subsequent supply were improper, unlawful and in contravention of Australian laws: as a consequence evidence relating to that operation should not have been admitted at trial.” 
        
       
      
    64 It was submitted that the effect of the High Court’s decision declaring the Dowe Authority invalid was that the supply by Tom of the 1kg of cocaine was, in terms of s 138(1) of the Evidence Act, in contravention of an Australian law, namely s 25(1) of the DMT Act, being the same section pursuant to which the appellant himself was charged. It was submitted that there was, in fact, a deliberate, calculated, reckless and wilful breach not only of the Customs Act but also of the DMT Act. This was because Tom, at the behest and with the involvement of the Commission and its officers, had undertaken what they knew, absent a valid authority under the LECO Act, to be the supply of a commercial quantity of cocaine in breach of ss 10 and 29 of the DMT Act. 
     
      
    65 It was thus submitted that in circumstances where law enforcement officers, encouraged by those in higher authority (being the Commissioner of the Commission as well as the Commissioner of Police), had engaged in illegal conduct, considerations of public policy relating to the administration of criminal justice required the exclusion of the post-22 February evidence pursuant to the discretion to exclude such evidence under s 138(1). 
     
      
    66 As in Ridgeway it was submitted that the conduct of the Commission’s officers in the present case, absent a lawful authority, involved grave and calculated criminality which had received approval at the highest level of the Commission and New South Wales Police Service. The unauthorised operation involved the creation of the actual elements of the offence with which the appellant was charged, with the consequence that there was a selective prosecution of the appellant rather than the perpetrators of the unlawful activity which led to that charge in the absence of any real indication of official disapproval or retribution.  
     
      
    67 The appellant’s written submissions thus stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “51. What was done was serious criminal conduct. The achievement of the objective of the criminal conduct, the sale of 1 kilogram of cocaine, combined with the clear breach of the  
        LECO Act 
         and  
        Customs Act  
        make this case an extreme one in which the considerations favouring rejection of the evidence on public policy grounds are overwhelming. Against those considerations, one must weigh the legitimate public interest in the conviction and punishment of the appellant for the criminal offence of which the jury found the applicant guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        52. Had the applicant been in a position to challenge in the proceedings the legality of the controlled operation, and had the trial judge been in a position to rule on the point, the evidence would inevitably be rejected on public policy grounds.” 
        
       
      
    68 In his written reply to the submissions of the Crown, the appellant indulged, with respect, in a deal of hyperbole. Those submissions may be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) There was no innocent breach of the law by the Commission or its officers: a calculation was made that the law would be interpreted in a manner supportive of the approach taken; 
       
       
      (b) There was thus a calculated attempt to stretch the limits of the  
      LECO Act 
      . A calculated risk was taken that the authority granted by the Commissioner would be valid; 
       
       
      (c) The interpretation placed by the Commission upon s 7(1)(b) of the  
      LECO Act  
      was made “ 
      recklessly or unreasonably 
      ”. This was because of what the High Court said in the paragraphs of its judgment which I have recorded at [61] above; 
       
       
      (d) If not a deliberate breach of the  
      LECO Act 
      , the Commission’s conduct was at best reckless as to whether a breach of s 7(1)(b) might occur and its conduct was reckless with respect to the consequences of the supply of 1kg of cocaine on the community in terms of its potential danger to end users; 
       
       
      (e) Given that the conduct in question involved breaches of Commonwealth law that were not protected by a s 15M certificate, the Commission and its officers were therefore guilty of deliberate and wilful breaches of Commonwealth law; 
       
       
      (f) It is a public policy imperative to ensure that those who are charged with, and given special and extraordinary powers with respect to, enforcing the law, obey the law; the public interest in an individual criminal’s conviction cannot be obtained at too high a price; 
       
       
      (g) Questions of public policy must extend to the present situation where the relevant law enforcement agency has acted unlawfully in a manner that put a large number of individual members of the public at risk by allowing the distribution of cocaine previously in its possession, knowing that it would inevitably be consumed; 
       
       
      (h) The conduct of the officers here involved the unlawful and improper collection and storage of the imported cocaine and its supply to Tom for further supply contrary to the disapproval of the AFP; 
       
       
      (i) In the foregoing circumstances there must be consequences for so serious a breach of the limitations placed by the Parliament on the law enforcement agencies under the  
      LECO Act 
      . The balance of competing interests clearly favoured rejection of the evidence to ensure obedience to the law by an agency that had breached the extraordinary powers given to it to enforce the law. This breach of the law was exacerbated by the distribution of 1kg of cocaine to end users for their consumption with potential risk to their health and safety. 
       
      
    69 During the course of oral argument on the appeal, the question was raised as to this Court’s power to entertain what was referred to as an original exercise of the power under s 138(1) to determine whether the impugned evidence should be excluded or admitted. This was because the s 138 application before the trial judge had proceeded upon the basis that the Dowe Authority was valid. Consequently the application before his Honour was confined to an attempt to exclude the evidence of events prior to the grant of that authority on 22 February 2005. The position now faced by this Court involved the exclusion of the evidence obtained after that date which would result, so it was submitted, in an entirely different dynamic with respect to the discretionary factors to be taken into account under s 138(1) and, in particular, s 138(3). 
     
      
    70 The appellant further submitted that this Court could exercise an original jurisdiction under s 138 at least if it was of the view that it was inevitable that the impugned evidence should be excluded and that it would be futile to suggest otherwise. Alternatively, if the Court was not prepared to so find, then the appellant’s conviction should be quashed and a new trial ordered wherein the totality of the alleged unlawful conduct on the part of the law enforcement agencies could be considered afresh in circumstances where the evidence would not necessarily be confined to that which was before the trial judge. In particular, I infer that in any new trial there would be tendered the evidence in the committal proceedings conducted in March 2006, particularly that of Bradley and Standen. That evidence was not before the trial judge although I am prepared to assume that some of it was repeated in Standen’s evidence on the voir dire before Judge Murrell, which was before the trial judge. 
     
      
    71 However, there were aspects of the committal evidence which were not relevant either before Judge Murrell or Judge Hulme as it related to matters which were then academic, at least temporarily, as a consequence of the decisions of Hall J and the Court of Appeal. That evidence related in particular to Standen’s understanding of or attitude towards the requirements of s 7(1)(b) of the LECO Act and which I accept as being relevant to the application of s 138 now pressed upon this Court. I shall refer further to this evidence below. 
     
      
    72 In response to the appellant’s submissions the Crown submitted that the relevant impropriety resulting from the decision of the High Court was neither deliberate nor reckless. To the contrary, the controlled operation was undertaken in the genuine belief that the Dowe Authority was valid. Both the police and the relevant officers of the Commission acted in good faith in the belief that they were at all times acting lawfully under a validly granted controlled operation authority. The Commissioner, Bradley, believed that such an authority could and should be issued by him and, as the High Court noted (at [47]), the decision of Hall J and the majority of the Court of Appeal  
     
      
      
      “appears to have proceeded from a misconstruction of the statutory provisions, in particular of the interrelation between sections 5, 6 and 7.” 
       
      
    73 The Crown further submitted that the fact that the Dowe Authority was declared invalid and related to significant evidence did not render the conduct of the relevant officers as involving “grave and calculated criminality”. Such a submission confused the concepts of deliberately undertaking an act with deliberately doing so illegally. The present case, it was submitted, fell within the former category. Here the act of supplying the 1kg of cocaine was clearly intended but a breach of the law was not. Indeed the relevant authorities held a positive view that they were not acting unlawfully at the time. In fact, they were acting on an understanding of the law which had been subsequently upheld by three Judges of the Supreme Court including the Chief Justice, albeit that the High Court had determined otherwise. They had a genuine and justifiable belief in the validity of the authority under which they acted, albeit that it ultimately turned out to be mistaken. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s submission should be rejected 
       
      
    74 As I have indicated, the appellant relied heavily upon the decision of the High Court in Ridgeway. That case involved what was referred to as a “controlled importation” of heroin into Australia from Malaysia. The prosecution had conceded, and it was clearly the case and never doubted by those involved, that the arranged importation of the heroin contravened s 233B of the Customs Act. It was so described in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in the following terms (at [27]): 
     
      
       
      “It has, at all times, been common ground that the importation of the heroin was contrary to s 233 
      B 
      (1)(b) of the Act which provides that any person who imports into Australia any prohibited imports to which s 233 
      B 
       applies is guilty of an offence under the section. The person who unlawfully brought the heroin into Australia was Chong who, on the facts as disclosed at the trial, was guilty of an offence under s 233 
      B 
      (1)(b) in that he imported into Australia prohibited imports to which s 233 
      B 
       of the Act applied. In truth, however, the whole of the unlawful importation was arranged by and under the auspices of the Australian Federal Police and the police involvement reached upwards to a high level of command. Realistically speaking, the illegal importation of the heroin was ‘controlled’ and effected (through the services of Chong) by the Australian Federal Police. Clearly enough, the objective acts of the members of the Australian Federal Police directly involved in the importation of the heroin by Chong came within s 233 
      B 
      (1)(d) of the Act which provides that any person who ‘aids, abets, counsels, or procures, or is in any way knowingly concerned in, the importation, or bringing, into Australia of any prohibited imports to which this section applies’ is guilty of an offence. In that regard, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions expressly conceded that the Australian authorities ‘had either counselled or at least were prepared to aid and abet’ the illegal importation. The effect of s 235 of the Act was that, in circumstances where a trafficable quantity of heroin was involved, the maximum penalty for each of the offences presumably committed by Chong and members of the Australian Federal Police was imprisonment for twenty-five years and a fine of $100,000.“ 
       
      
    75 Before the High Court Ridgeway had submitted that the effect of the police involvement in the illegal importation of the heroin was that the evidence of his guilt should have been excluded on discretionary grounds. This case was decided before the coming into force of the Evidence Act. Nevertheless, at least since Bunning v Cross [1978] HCA 22; (1978) 141 CLR 54, it had been the common law in Australia that a trial judge had a discretion to exclude prosecution evidence on public policy grounds in circumstances where it had been obtained by unlawful conduct on the part of the police. That discretion was described in the joint judgment in Ridgeway (at [31]) in the following terms: 
     
      
       
      “In its exercise, a trial judge must engage in a balancing process to resolve ‘the apparent conflict between the desirable goal of bringing to conviction the wrongdoer and the undesirable effect of curial approval, or even encouragement, being given to the unlawful conduct of those whose task it is to enforce the law’. The basis in principle of the discretion lies in the inherent or implied powers of our courts to protect the integrity of their processes. In cases where it is exercised to exclude evidence on public policy grounds, it is because, in all the circumstances of the particular case, applicable considerations of ‘high public policy’ relating to the administration of criminal justice outweigh the legitimate public interest in the conviction of the guilty.” 
      
    76 Under the heading “Exercise of the Discretion”, the joint judgment contained the following observations (at [38]):  
     
      
       
      “The relative weight to be given to [the positive and negative considerations] will vary according to the circumstances of the particular case. Thus, the weight to be given to the public interest in the conviction and punishment of those guilty of crime will vary according to the degree of criminality involved. The weight to be given to the principal considerations of public policy favouring the exclusion of the evidence – the public interest in maintaining the integrity of the courts and in ensuring the observance of the law and minimum standards of propriety by those entrusted with powers of law enforcement – will vary according to other factors of which the most important will ordinarily be the nature, the seriousness and the effect of the illegal or improper conduct engaged in by the law enforcement officers and whether such conduct is encouraged or tolerated by those in higher authority in the police force or, in the case of illegal conduct, by those responsible for the institution of criminal proceedings.” 
       
      
    77 A further significant observation of their Honours relevant to the present case was the following (at [39]):  
     
      
      “References in this judgment to an offence being ‘procured’ by illegal conduct on the part of law enforcement officers are intended to refer to two distinct, but possibly overlapping, categories of case. The first category consists of cases in which the police conduct has induced an accused person to commit the offence which he or she has committed. In that category of case, the public interest in the conviction and punishment of those guilty of crime is likely to prevail over other considerations except in what we would hope to be the rare and exceptional case where the illegality or impropriety of the police conduct is grave and either so calculated or so entrenched that it is clear that considerations of public policy relating to the administration of criminal justice require exclusion of the evidence. The other category of case is where illegal police conduct is itself the principal offence to which the charged offence…” 
       
      
    78 The Crown submitted and I agree that the facts in Ridgeway were clearly distinguishable from the present case in the following respects: 
     
      
      
      (a) At all material times the relevant law enforcement officers genuinely believed that there was a valid authority in place; 
       
       
      (b) In applying for and issuing the Dowe Authority, Standen and Bradley respectively applied the law as they understood it to be at the time; 
       
       
      (c) It was only after the High Court ruled on the correct construction of s 7(1)(b) that the Dowe Authority was declared invalid; 
       
       
      (d) Unlike  
      Ridgeway 
      , the conduct of the relevant officers did not bring about the commission by the appellant of the offence with which he was charged: nor was it an element of that offence; in other words, the conduct fell into the first category referred to by the High Court in  
      Ridgeway  
      in the passage which I have recorded at [77] above; 
       
       
      (e) Tom approached the authorities and the conduct which was then undertaken was part and parcel of the ongoing activities of a large scale drug syndicate; 
       
       
      (f) The appellant was neither procured nor entrapped into committing the offence upon which he was convicted.  
       
      
    79 During the course of oral argument it became apparent that the focus of the appellant’s submissions was upon s 7(1)(b) of the LECO Act and, in particular, the deliberate risk that was taken by Standen that the cocaine would be distributed to end users within the community. It was further submitted that as a matter of public policy, the fact that a mistake was made in the present case which led to the distribution of 7kg of cocaine to the community was so grave as to dictate that the relevant discretion should be exercised to exclude the post-22 February evidence. In this context it was submitted that the Commission’s interpretation of s 7(1)(b) was unreasonable notwithstanding that it had been held to be correct by three judges of the Supreme Court including the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    80 The appellant placed particular reliance upon s 138(3)(d) of the Evidence Act, which requires a court to take into account the gravity of the breach of the law which engages s 138(1). In the present case it was submitted that the offence committed by the Commission carried a life sentence. Although the Commission’s motivations might have been pure, and may have been based upon a wrong interpretation of s 7(1)(b), nevertheless a serious crime was committed which had extremely serious consequences. 
     
      
    81 However, the appellant conceded that it was clearly in the public interest that the appellant be convicted as he had chosen to involve himself in the supply of 1kg of cocaine. However, the gravity of the crime committed by the Commission and its agents was one that trumped that of the appellant being convicted. Again, emphasis was placed upon the submission that 7kg of cocaine was intended to be supplied which would inevitably end up in the community causing serious endangerment to its members. 
     
      
    82 Towards the end of the hearing senior counsel for the appellant was referred to a number of assertions in his written submissions in reply to those of the Crown with a request that he provide references to the evidence that supported the assertions in question. 
     
      
    83 In a document forwarded to the Court two days after the conclusion of the hearing, senior counsel for the appellant referred to the assertions contained in paras 7, 9, 10 and 11 of his written submissions in reply and then provided transcript references in the appeal books said to be in support of those assertions. The following 22 “propositions” with appeal book references (which I have omitted), were then advanced in the following terms (the numbering is mine): 
     
      
       
      ”1. Basic plan to sell to end users formulated before the Authority was approved – as aim to arrest the most people. 
       
        
       
      2. Standen aware that Controlled operation should not endanger health and safety generally. 
       
       
      3. Failed to consider in context of known dangers and statutory restrictions. 
       
       
      4. Concern bad publicity not prohibitions in  
      LECO 
       or dangers to community. 
       
       
      5. Sale to end users was not or was only obliquely mentioned in critical documentation. 
       
       
      6. AFP excluded, that could not fit within Commonwealth legislation and objections to sale to end users of cocaine ignored. 
       
       
      7. Joint Taskforce members say that despite their experience they did not even contemplate federal and state offences might be being committed prior to the grant of the authority. 
       
       
      8. It was never intended to deal with the drugs seized in the conventional way. 
       
       
      9. AFP Officers did not draw attention of their authorities that the plan involved distribution of drugs would not be recovered. 
       
       
      10. Basic procedures not followed. 
       
       
      11. Standen prepared to mislead court. 
       
       
      12. Stretch limits of  
      LECO Act 
      : Application and Authority fail to mention sale to end users: does not set out matters which will seriously endanger health safety and simply recites s 7  
      LECO Act 
      . Does not alert Ombudsman to problems and danger. No consideration of contrary position in Commonwealth  
      Crimes Act 
      . 
       
       
      13. False statement in application regarding accountability. Drugs sold could not be accounted for. Drug and money handling procedures and requirements were not followed. 
       
       
      14. No controlled operation sought from time of drug’s seizure. 
       
       
      15. A presumption Certificate would be granted no real consideration of  
      LECO 
       at all. 
       
       
      16. Spoke to Commonwealth DPP but did not seek their advice. Did not speak to State DPP. 
       
       
      17. Did not consider Commonwealth restrictions on dangers etc. a factor. 
       
       
      18. Reckless as to consequences. 
       
       
      19. Always the plan that end users would receive the cocaine. 
       
       
      20. Did not consider that  
      DMT Act  
      was being breached throughout. 
       
       
      21. Actions deliberate. 
       
       
      22. Breach of Commonwealth law – AFP deliberately excluded after 2/2/05.” 
       
      
    84 A number of the above “propositions” were also advanced before the trial judge with respect to the application made to him under s 138(1). I refer in particular to the AFP’s attitude to the proposed controlled operation. The breach of Commonwealth law absent the obtaining of a certificate under s 15M of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) was also a matter that was, to a greater or lesser degree, agitated before the trial judge. 
     
      
    85 The “propositions” which were not relevant before the trial judge due to the decisions of Hall J and the Court of Appeal, were those that I have numbered 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 18 and 19. The evidence in support of those allegations was contained in the evidence given in the committal proceedings in March 2006 before the challenge to the validity of the Authorities was instituted. That evidence established that both Standen and Bradley were aware that there was a probability, if not certainty, that much of the cocaine would be sold into the community to end users although there was the possibility, depending upon the particular circumstances, that some could be retrieved. In fact 1kg was recovered, although the usual plan was to see how events unfolded to determine whether there was any safe opportunity to retrieve the cocaine which had been supplied. Thus the following exchange took place in Standen’s evidence: 
     
      
      
      “Q. If it were possible to retrieve the kilo of cocaine without blowing Tom’s cover then that part of the plan, but otherwise the plan was to let the cocaine run as it were, to be [disseminated] up to its ultimate end user, correct? 
       
      A. Correct.” 
       
      
    86 In Standen’s re-examination the following evidence was elicited: 
     
      
      
      “Q. You were asked some questions earlier concerning general safety issues, we might call them that, in relation to the distribution of cocaine. Did you or others at the Commission to your knowledge weigh up the ramifications of not proceeding in this way? 
       
      A. We did. Yes, we did is the short answer. The volume of cocaine available on the streets is far in excess of the amount involved here and our suspicion, information, belief, whatever, that the people we were likely to catch through this process may well be responsible for much larger quantities of cocaine being made available on the streets than what was involved in these controlled operations.” 
       
      
    87 With respect to Standen’s understanding of s 7(1)(b), the following further evidence given at the committal hearing is of significance in the present context: 
     
      
      
      “Q. …so as far as you were concerned this operation was not going to endanger the health of any other person by way of those drugs ending up on the street, that’s your position isn’t it? 
       
      A. So far as the participants in the controlled activity correct, and not by comparison to as I said the other options. 
       
       
      Q. I’m not talking about the participants here, it says any other person, so you would have had to have gauged and considered the fact that these drugs would end up on the street and that people would use them. Now are you saying that you’d thought of that and obviously decided that that act was not going to endanger any other person’s health? 
       
      A. I did give consideration to that, but that aside it’s still our view, being the Commission, that that section relates to the actual conduct of the operation, not what might happen a month, two months, six months down the track.” 
       
        
       
      
    88 In a similar vein was the following further exchange between the cross-examiner and Standen: 
     
      
       
        
       
      
      
      “Q. …I’ll go back a step. It was at least probable and quite likely that the kilo of cocaine which was the subject of [the Dowe Authority], this application, the one I’m discussing, to be transacted at Newtown would not be recovered by police. Correct?  
       
      A. More probable than not, that’s correct.’ 
       
       
      Q. And in that regard, more probable than not that ultimately it would be disseminated to street level, correct? 
       
      A. Correct. 
       
       
      Q. Your state of mind was that any danger to health or safety of persons unknown but particularly end users who may be in mind, was outweighed as it were in a balancing act by reference to the possible results that you sought to achieve at the end of the whole investigation. That was your state of mind? 
       
      A. It’s not quite a simple as that but that’s certainly part of it, yes. 
       
       
      Q. You considered that the supply of a kilo of cocaine could seriously endanger health or safety of persons who might be expected to use it? 
       
      A. This kilo are you saying? 
       
       
      Q. A kilo of cocaine. 
       
      A. Could. 
       
       
      Q. And this kilo of cocaine was no different to any other kilo except of course that it was reasonably potent because it was a reasonably higher purity, correct? 
       
      A. Perhaps in terms of the commodity but not necessarily in terms of the chain it was likely to follow given the history of these transactions. 
       
       
      Q. Nowhere in either the plan or the application is it made clear that it is more likely than not that the kilo of cocaine to be transacted would indeed proceed through to end use. You agree with me on that? 
       
      A. That’s correct. 
       
       
      Q. Did you think it relevant to include that fact? 
       
      A. As I said before, not particularly so. 
       
       
      Q. You were obviously mindful of the fact that the legislation includes a particular reference to conduct that is likely to seriously endanger health or safety of any person? 
       
      A. Yes, hence the inclusion of paragraph 16. 
       
       
      Q. Yes. And given what you have said about the potential danger of a kilo of cocaine to end users, did you think it not relevant to include that fact, namely that more likely than not the kilo of cocaine could end up on the street? 
       
      A. Well if you was using that, one needs to use the word danger, it talks about seriously endangering health. I have a view about that which was considered. Secondly, this particular kilo of cocaine, following the course, its supply chain as told to us by Tom, was not in my view and it would seem the Commissioner’s view, but you would need to ask him, likely to seriously endanger the health of people likely to be the users of this kilo of cocaine.  
      And lastly, we also have a view about the extent of that particular provision in the controlled operations legislation 
      .” (Emphasis added) 
       
      
    89 In re-examination the following exchanges are pertinent in the present context: 
     
      
       
      “Q. You were asked, you gave in answer to a question about your consideration of the health and safety issue, if I can put it that way, three propositions, not all of which were explored with you. The first was the question of serious endangerment. You said you had a view about this but you didn’t express it. What is your view? 
       
       
      … 
       
       
      A. The view was that, given the information provided, that is that in the previous six months to the February delivery to Mr Gideon [sic] some 200 kilos of cocaine had been distributed through particular nominated and detailed supply routes, that the persons to whom these seven kilos were to be distributed would be the same persons who, on the information available both from Tom and what we previously knew were long time suppliers of cocaine with established networks, the likelihood was, the very strong likelihood that the users would be part of an existing long term supply chain and use chain, it would be going to people who were very familiar with the use of cocaine, people who would if not purchasing this cocaine would perhaps purchase other cocaine and that it was unlikely to be introduced to a new market, for example. They would be people familiar with the cocaine trade, as evidenced by the sale of the 200 kilos in a very short space of time. 
       
       
      Q. You said you believed that i[t] was – you had a belief that in relation to the particular kilo, that is the kilo which was supplied through Mr Dowe and Mr Finch to Mr Hamer that it was not likely to seriously endanger the health of users, is that the same point that you just made in effect? 
       
      A. It is basically the same. We also know that at the time that it left our hands it was in fact cocaine as opposed to a lot of the substances that are out there.” 
       
      
    90 Finally, Standen was referred to that part of his evidence which I have emphasised at [88] above in the following exchange: 
     
      
       
      “Q. And then you said you had a view of this particular provision, that is the one which I think it’s in section 7 of the Act which deals with health and safety which you didn’t express, what was the view which you held of that provision? 
       
       
      A. It’s a view that the words or any other person are to be read in the context of the entire paragraph or the section which relates to the conduct of the operation, controlled activity, the participants such as to ensure that an undercover officer wasn’t to be shot or .. (not transcribable).. was going to be thrown off a cliff or whatever it might and it relates to the actual controlled activity as opposed to what might happen months down the track as in the case of this cocaine.” 
       
      
    91 Although Bradley also gave evidence at the committal proceedings, the appellant did not refer the Court to any of his evidence going to the issue concerning s 7(1)(b). This is so notwithstanding that in the Dowe Authority Bradley stated in cl 5 thereof that he was satisfied as to the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “(b) No participant will engage in conduct that is likely to seriously endanger the health or safety of that or any other participant, or any other person, or to result in serious loss or damage to property.” 
        
       
      
    92 Notwithstanding that Bradley was merely repeating the provisions of s 7(1)(b) it does not appear that he was cross-examined to suggest that he did not hold an honest and genuine belief in the correctness of that statement of satisfaction. A similar statement was made by Standen in para 16 of his application for the Dowe Authority dated 23 February 2005, and which he refers to in the penultimate answer referred to in the exchange which I have recorded at [88] above. 
     
      
    93 In my opinion the evidence to which I have referred amply supports the Crown’s submission to the effect that, relevantly, Standen had a genuine belief that s 7(1)(b), on his understanding of it, did not prohibit the granting of the Dowe Authority. He was joined in this understanding, as I have observed, by Hall J and the majority of the Court of Appeal. I would therefore reject the appellant’s submission that there was anything unreasonable, reckless or careless in the interpretation of s 7(1)(b) which Standen adopted.  
     
      
    94 Further, the evidence to which I have referred above established that as far as Standen was concerned, he did not consider that actual harm would, or was likely to be, caused by the distribution of the 1kg of heroin the subject of the Dowe Authority to end users as that quantity would, no doubt, be broken up into much smaller parcels.  
     
      
    95 In the foregoing context the following observation of Magistrate Heilpern, who presided at the committal proceedings, is apposite. In response to a submission that the Dowe Authority was invalid with the consequence that the conduct of the operation which was undertaken pursuant to it was illegal, the learned Magistrate observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “But if you’re saying let’s imagine quite clearly – well hypothetically let’s say I accept that on the face of it there is a problem with the warrant in that the person who signed the warrant says that he’s satisfied there is to be no harm, and quite clearly from the evidence that I’ve had from Mr Standen it was not an unexpected outcome, and it was a probable outcome and that the cocaine would end up at street level, and we’ve established that there is somewhat around 100,000 discrete dosage uses, or units, as a result of the police operation, what difference does it make to what the application says?” 
        
       
      
    96 There is no doubt that, as it turned out, the conduct of the operation which was purportedly sanctioned by the Dowe Authority resulted in the unintentional commission of an offence, and a serious offence at that. However, I would reject the various epithets attributed to that conduct by the appellant namely, that a calculated risk was taken; that the interpretation placed on s 7(1)(b) was made recklessly or unreasonably; that Bradley and Standen were, at best, reckless as to whether a breach of the law would occur by the supply by Tom of 1kg of cocaine to Finch or that the conduct of the operation was deliberate in the sense that there was an intentional breach of the law or a reckless disregard of whether the carrying out of the operation under the Dowe Authority would result in the commission of an offence.  
     
      
    97 For the foregoing reasons the present case, in my opinion, is clearly distinguishable from Ridgeway. Not only did the relevant activities fall into the first category of cases referred to by the plurality in the passage from their judgment, which I have recorded at [78] above, but also the circumstances in which the illegal conduct was engaged in did not involve any mala fides on the part of those concerned up to the highest level. On the contrary, at all material times the relevant law enforcement officers had a bona fide belief that they were acting lawfully having obtained an authority which, had it been valid, had the effect of rendering the controlled operation undertaken according to its terms, lawful. 
     
      
    98 So far as the other matters relied upon by the appellant are concerned, generally speaking they were agitated before the trial judge on the s 138(1) application whose decision thereon is not the subject of challenge. Furthermore, I see no reason why the appellant should be afforded the opportunity of re-agitating his application to the trial judge based on the voir dire evidence before Judge Murrell with respect to the pre-22 February 2005 evidence upon which the Crown relied. Nor do I consider that that decision might have resulted in a different outcome had the s 138 application extended to the evidence which was gathered as a consequence of the undertaking of the controlled operation the subject of the Dowe Authority. 
     
      
    99 In the foregoing circumstances, when one comes to consider the matters to be taken into account pursuant to s 138(3), the following findings should be made: 
     
      
      (a) The probative value of the impugned evidence was high; 
       
       
      (b) The importance of that evidence is self-evident; 
       
       
      (c) The nature of the offence with which the appellant was charged was that it was one of considerable seriousness as the appellant in fact conceded; 
       
       
      (d) The gravity of the contravention of the  
      DMT Act 
       as a consequence of the invalidity of the Dowe Authority was, in the circumstances, low; 
       
       
      (e) The contravention was neither deliberate nor reckless in any relevant sense; 
       
       
      (f) No proceeding, as far as the Court is aware, has been taken against either Bradley or Standen as a consequence of the contravention and it is highly unlikely that any such action could be justified in the circumstances; 
       
       
      (g) The difficulty of obtaining the impugned evidence without contravening an Australian law was self-evident which is why, in light of  
      Ridgeway 
      , the Parliament enacted the  
      LECO Act 
      . Furthermore, the application for the Dowe Authority dated 22 February 2005 and signed by Standen, noted the necessity of Tom’s assistance who, as a registered informer, needed the protection of an authority granted under that Act. Further, in para 13 of the application, the following appears: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “13. Available methods of investigating the criminal activity that do not involve the use of controlled activity are limited to: 
         
         
          
          The use of electronic and physical surveillance, interrogation of law enforcement databases and informer information. The subjects of the investigation are professional criminals with significant experience and expertise in the conduct of their activities. Law enforcement intelligence suggests that the subjects and their associates have corrupt contacts within law enforcement agencies, government departments and other key organisations. I believe that the continued use of the methods outlined above may alert the subjects to the existence of the investigation, thereby enabling the subjects to suspend or conceal their activities and frustrate the investigation. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        14. I believe that the nature and extent of the criminal activity is such as to justify the conduct of the operation and that the nature and extent of the proposed controlled activities are appropriate to the criminal activity.” (Emphasis in original) 
        
       
      
      
      (h) In para 3(b) of the Dowe Authority issued by him on 22 February 2005 Bradley stated that he was satisfied that: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “the nature and extent of the suspected criminal activity or corrupt conduct was such as to justify the conduct of a controlled operation.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    100 Finally, I refer back to the judgment of Judge Murrell of 4 May 2007, to refuse the application by the appellant under s 138(1) to exclude evidence obtained prior to 22 February 2005. Although the appellant suggested that in a new trial it would be open to him to re-agitate all the issues the subject of her Honour’s decision, it was not suggested on the appeal before us that her Honour’s decision was wrong or, at least, was other than one which she was entitled to reach. It was also submitted that if this Court was to decide the s 138 issue itself, it should “factor in” the findings of Judge Murrell. 
     
      
    101 However, Judge Hulme came to the same conclusion as Judge Murrell as to the admissibility of the pre-22 February evidence but for different reasons. As was the case with the findings of Judge Murrell, there was no challenge on the appeal to the findings of Judge Hulme with respect to that issue. The reasoning of neither judge with respect to their ruling on the admission of the pre-22 February evidence could in any conceivable manner be influenced by the subsequent invalidity of the Dowe Authority. 
     
      
    102 Accordingly, in my opinion there is no merit in the appellant’s submission that due to the invalidity of the Dowe Authority he should now be given the opportunity in a new trial to re-agitate on a further application under s 138(1) the admissibility of the pre-22 February evidence. 
     
      
    103 In the foregoing circumstances I am of the opinion that it is open for this Court, as we were invited to do by both parties, to determine for ourselves whether, notwithstanding the invalidity of the Dowe Authority, the evidence gained as a consequence of its execution should, as a matter of inevitability, be either admitted or excluded. If the Court was of the view that it was inevitable that the impugned evidence would be admitted then it was accepted that there would be no proper basis for the appellant’s conviction to be quashed and a new trial ordered so as to provide him with the opportunity to re-agitate an application under s 138 which would inevitably fail. 
     
      
    104 In my opinion, I have no doubt that in the circumstances to which I have referred, the discretion under s 138(1) to admit the impugned evidence would be exercised in favour of its admission. To suggest otherwise would be an exercise in futility. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    105 For the foregoing reasons in my opinion there has been no miscarriage, let alone a substantial miscarriage, of justice due to the fact that the trial of the appellant proceeded on the basis that the authority pursuant to which he was supplied with 1kg of cocaine was subsequently determined by the High Court to be invalid. I would therefore reject the sole ground of appeal that was advanced and propose that the appellant’s appeal against his conviction be dismissed. 
     
      
    106 JAMES J: I agree with Tobias JA. 
     
      
    107 PRICE J: I agree with Tobias JA.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The applicant (David John Marlin) pleaded guilty to an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent pursuant to s 61 J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    2 He was sentenced for this offence to imprisonment for a non-parole period of three years commencing on 30 September 2005 and expiring on 29 September 2008 with a balance of term of two years commencing on 30 September 2008 and expiring on 29 September 2010. 
     
      
    3 On 28 August 2008 the respondent (State Parole Authority of New South Wales) determined that the applicant “not be released from a correctional centre at this time for the following reason(s) “Need to further address offending behaviour (sexual offending / AOD / violence).”4 On 17 September 2008 the applicant made an application that a direction be given to the respondent pursuant to s 155 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (“the Act”) on the grounds that the information on which the respondent based its decision on 28 August 2008 was “false / misleading / irrelevant.” The applicant, in his application, identified the information he alleged was false, misleading or irrelevant. He did so by marking various parts of the Pre-Sentence Report dated 10 February 2006, the Pre-Release Report dated 17 July 2008 and the Supplementary Pre-Release Report dated 1 August 2008 each of which formed part of the material before the respondent when making its decision. 5 The application came on for hearing before me. The applicant, who appeared without legal representation, made oral submissions in respect of his application. The principal submission made by the applicant was that, though he had tried on many occasions to do the CORE programme at no time during the three and a half years he had been in gaol had he been able to do it. This was through no fault on his part. The programme had been offered to him only a week or two before his first parole hearing [on 1 August 2008] and he had not taken it up as to do so would have jeopardised his prospects of obtaining parole at the earliest available date. The applicant said that he remained prepared to do the programme but wished to be permitted to do it outside gaol. He said he had made arrangements to commence a programme with a clinical psychologist, Katie Seidler, if released. He stressed that he hadn’t been able to do the programme due to no fault on his part and that it was unfair that he had been refused parole on the basis he had not done the CORE programme.  
     
      
    6 The CORE programme is a programme which targets the core issues common to sex offenders. It is a non-residential therapy programme for lower risk sex offenders who continue their regular institutional activities (e.g. education, work release). CORE runs in a group format and can be run two half days per week which takes five months, or one half day per week which takes ten months.  
     
      
    7 The applicant stated, in his submissions, “Firstly I am here hopefully to succeed on release on parole”…. “I am here today seeking reconsideration for me to do an external programme. Just please give me a chance to prove that I can do the right thing.”  
     
      
    8 The applicant’s statements referred to in the previous paragraph evidence a misunderstanding of the court’s role and powers under s 155 of the Act.  
     
      
    9 Section 155 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) If:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the Parole Authority decides that an offender should not be released on parole, and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the offender alleges that the decision of the Parole Authority has been made on the basis of false, misleading or irrelevant information, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the offender may, in accordance with rules of court, apply to the Supreme Court for a direction to be given to the Parole Authority as to whether the information was false, misleading or irrelevant.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Supreme Court may give such directions with respect to the information as it thinks fit.  
        
       
       
        
         
        (3) An application under this section is to be considered by the Supreme Court if and only if it is satisfied that the application is not an abuse of process and that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application.  
        
       
       
        
        (4) This section does not give the Supreme Court jurisdiction to consider the merits of the Parole Authority’s decision otherwise than on the grounds referred to in subsection (1).  
         
        
       
      
    10 In Jim Lee v State Parole Authority of New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 1225 Johnson J said… at [15] “Where the sentence of imprisonment exceeds three years, and a non-parole period is fixed, then the question whether the offender will be released on parole is one for consideration by the State Parole Authority… The State Parole Authority has the authority to release an offender conditionally from confinement in accordance with the sentence imposed upon him. The full sentence of imprisonment stands and during its term the prisoner is simply released upon conditional parole… The grant of parole by a paroling authority is a privilege and not a right”.  
     
      
    11 Section 155 does not provide a form of appeal from a decision refusing parole, and does not permit the Court to set aside the State Parole Authority’s decision and either to substitute its own decision, or to return the matter to the State Parole Authority to hear the matter again. It provides for no more than a direction to the State Parole Authority that the information upon which it acted is of a particular character… On a s 155 application, the Court does not concern itself with questions pertaining to the merits of a decision nor with questions as to what weight is placed upon various factors – see Jim Lee at paragraphs [5]-[7]. 
     
      
    12 In Rozynski v Parole Board of New South Wales [2003] NSWCCA 214 at [13] it was held. “…. information before the Board will not be characterised as false, misleading or irrelevant simply because it was challenged, even if challenged on such a basis before the Board and the challenge determined adversely to the applicant, nor if it is merely incorrect in detail but not false or misleading in substance. This court will need to be satisfied on appropriate (usually new) evidence that information was false or misleading in substance, and that the direction should be given. So far as there is a determination of the Board concerning information said to be false or misleading, before the court will so categorise that information, it will be necessary to satisfy the court that the Board’s determination was plainly, not just arguably, wrong and further that the information was false or misleading and material to the Board’s conclusion” –  
     
      
    13 This court is concerned only with the information which was before the Board – McCafferty v Offenders Review Board (Court of Criminal Appeal 19 June 1995 – unreported).  
     
      
    14 Since the cases I have referred to above were decided subsection 4 has been added to s 155 of the Act. The new subsection commenced on the 20 May 2008. The purpose of it, as stated in the second reading speech in the New South Wales Parliament, was “to make it abundantly clear that the Supreme Court does not have the jurisdiction to review the merits of a decision by the Parole Authority”. Thus even if the court was of the view that the refusal of parole was unfair or unjust it is not a matter that can be remedied by an application under s 155.  
     
      
    15 The issues to be determined on this application are limited to:  
     
      
       
      (a) whether the information identified in the application was “false, misleading or irrelevant” and  
       
       
      (b) whether the respondent based its decision dated 28 August 2008 on that information.  
       
      
    16 The respondent, in its written submissions, dealt comprehensively with each of the matters which the applicant alleged was false, misleading or irrelevant. The applicant also made oral submissions in respect of each of those matters.  
     
      
    17 The information in the reports relied upon by the applicant is considered hereunder.  
     
      
    18 (a) the applicant relied upon the following comment in the Supplementary Pre-Release Report: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           “On 24 July 2008 the offender informed this Service that he did not intend to accept the offer [of a place in CORE Low-Moderate Sex Offenders’ Program, held at Kirkconnell Correctional Centre].” On 25 July 2008 he signed a formal refusal to participate in a treatment programme, however he requested to remain in a waiting list for CORE… Mr Marlin formerly refused the offer of CORE on 25 July 2008.”  
          
         
        
       
       
      (b) The applicant submitted:  
       
       
        
         
          
          “I have not accepted the offer to the low to moderate sexual offenders programme held by Kirkconnell – I had not refused the programme. I just refused to sign my parole away at that time.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (c) The applicant, in an undated letter, which was before the respondent stated: 
       
       
       “To whom it may concern  
       
       
        
         I have a number of reasons why im unable to except the offer into the Low-Moderate Core Program at Kirkonnell Correctional Centre, the main reason being my step father has cancer and we don’t expect him to live much longer. The other reasons are im working here at Long Bay ive settled here I have made good friends here and I have fourtnightly visits from my family and friends here and if I went to Kirkconnell Id have nothing. Ive also been no guarantee of a starting date for the Program or do I have any guarantee that the Program wont be cancelled half way through because the physchologist being offered another job elsewhere. I want to make it clear Im NOT at any time refusing to take part in the moderate – low core Program but with only weeks before my parole sitting im not prepared to sign my Parole away… 
        
       
       
        
       
      (d) The applicant understood that, if he accepted the offer, he would not have completed the programme by his parole date and thus the taking up of the offer would have denied him the possibility of parole at the earliest opportunity.  
       
       
      (e) The information in the report referred to by the applicant is not “false, misleading or irrelevant”.  
       
       
      
    19 (a) The applicant relied upon the following information in the Pre-Release Report:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “records indicate however, that apart from his daughter, the offender had not received any other visits from his children during his incarceration.”  
          
         
        
       
       
      (b) The applicant submitted that this information was false as he had seen his two sons and one of his daughters a few times since being gaoled “but not for a bit over 12 months now.” He referred to difficulties in arranging for the children to see him as they resided in Hay and his ex-wife made contact difficult and expensive.  
       
      
      
      (c) In my opinion, whether the applicant was or was not visited by his children was not information on which the respondent based its decision. The application cannot succeed on this basis.  
       
       
      
    20 (a) The applicant relied upon the following information in the Pre-Release Report as being false: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “On the day of the offence, Mr Marlin reported that he attended a local club and consumed two beers and six pre-mixed drinks over the course of the evening. He did not consider alcohol to be a contributing factor to the current offence nor his previous violent offences. This appears to contradict Service records which state that on a number of occasions the offender had consumed alcohol prior to perpetrating violent offences. Further to this, in a recent telephone interview his mother reported that the offender is more likely to respond violently when under the influence of alcohol.”  
          
         
        
       
       
        
      
     (b) The applicant submitted:  
     
      
       
        
         “…on the day of the offence I had been drinking. I started drinking probably at lunchtime and during the day had a few cans of Bundy rum and on the night of the offence I went to the Western Suburbs Leagues Club with a friend to celebrate her 31st birthday. At that time I only had 1 ½ schooners of beer. I enjoy a beer like anybody else. I don’t feel that I have a problem with alcohol.” – in the last 3 ½ years I haven’t had a beer…. my intention is not to drink again.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
     (c) In my opinion there is no difference of significance between the report and the applicant’s submissions as to the amount of alcohol consumed on the date of the offence.  
     
      
       
      (d) The applicant’s psychologist Ms Seidler had earlier expressed the opinion that it was likely that the applicant was minimising the extent of his alcohol use somewhat and that either his use was more significant and frequent than he reported or he tended to use alcohol as a negative coping strategy at times of emotional stress. In sentencing the applicant the sentencing judge referred to the findings of Ms Seidler as a significant issue which the applicant needed to address. The applicant’s mother had stated “the offender is more likely to respond violently when under the influence of alcohol”. The fact that the applicant had not undertaken any programs regarding the issue of alcohol was something the respondent was concerned about and a factor in its decision on 28 August 2008. In my opinion it has not been demonstrated that the information referred to was “false, misleading or irrelevant”.  
       
      
    21 (a) The applicant relied upon the following information in the Pre-Release Report: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Further Mr Marlin will be referred to the Community Compliance Group for additional monitoring due to the nature of his offences.”  
          
         
        
       
       
      (b) The Community Compliance Group monitors offenders in the community using such methods as compliance checks, electronic monitoring and writing assessment reports.  
       
       
      (c) The applicant in his submissions said that he would be prepared to accept a monitoring device or something like that and to otherwise assist the parole service.  
       
       
      (d) The comment referred to was made in the context of a consideration of how the applicant would be monitored if released to parole. The respondent’s decision not to release the applicant to parole was not based on the availability of such monitoring. This information was not something on which the respondent based its decision.  
       
      
    22 (a) The applicant relied upon the following information in the Pre-Sentence Report:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “unfortunately there are no periodic detention facilities available to the offender who intends to return to his address in Hay.”  
          
         
        
       
       
      (b) The applicant, in his submissions, stated that if he was offered periodic detention anywhere he would avail himself of it.  
       
       
      (c) It has not been demonstrated that the information is false or misleading. It is information relevant to sentence considerations. It is not information upon which the respondent based its decision when it refused parole.  
       
      
    23 (a) The applicant relied upon the following information in the Pre Release Report  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The assessing psychologist reported that, at the time, the inmate did not appear motivated to attend the programs” and “Between 21 November 2008 and 30 January 2009, Mr Marlin attended five sessions of the PREP Programme. He reported exiting the Programme voluntarily for personal reasons. Contact with the Programme Facilitator suggested, however, that the offender had left the programme to avoid disclosure of his offence and considered his exit from that programme a reflection on his poor motivation to address his offending. In interview with the writer, the offender claimed he had left the program due to differences with a fellow inmate and also because he disapproved of the Facilitator.”  
          
         
        
       
       
      (b) It has not been demonstrated that this information was not true in recording what had occurred as a matter of fact (save for the obvious error as to the date) and the opinions of those contacted. The information was not misleading. The applicant’s comments were noted and there was other material before the respondent, including correspondence, which supported the applicant’s assertion he was motivated to attend the programs. Additionally the applicant was represented at the parole hearing and submissions were made on his behalf in this regard. The information in the Pre Release Report was relevant to the respondent’s consideration of the application before it. 
       
       
      (c) In my opinion it has not been established that this information was false in substance, misleading or irrelevant.  
       
      
    24 I have considered the submissions and the material in evidence before me. In my opinion none of the information relied upon by the applicant and upon which the respondent based its decision was false, misleading or irrelevant. Accordingly the application is dismissed.

   JUDGMENT1. The judgment which I am now giving raises a conflict between two very important public interests. One of the public interests is the press covering court proceedings. That includes, of course, members of the press having access to court in order to report on the proceedings. Courts have, in this jurisdiction, been open to the public. The competing public interest which is raised is the interest which the community has in the care and welfare of its children.2. Those competing public interests have been dealt with in the Act of Parliament which specifically covers children who are prosecuted for criminal offences. That is the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. The interests of children who are prosecuted for crimes are acknowledged in that Act of Parliament. In fact, the Act of Parliament requires courts to exercise their functions, having regard to a list of principles contained in s 6 of the Act.3. Amongst those principles are an acknowledgement that “children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance.” Another principle is stated as it being “desirable that children who commit offences be assisted with their reintegration into the community, so as to sustain family and community ties.” 4. One way that the legislation protects children - in acknowledgement that their offending behaviour may have been partly contributed to by their immaturity and their need for guidance and reintegration into the community - is to exclude the general public from criminal proceedings in which a child is a party. Section 10 of the Act makes that provision. 5. However, the Act itself strikes a balance between the two competing public interests which I referred to. It provides that anyone who is not directly interested in the proceedings must be excluded from the court. I have directed that that occur in this case, but the section provides an exception. It says that relevantly any person who is engaged in preparing a report on the proceedings for dissemination through a public news medium is, “unless the court otherwise directs, entitled to enter or remain in the place where the proceedings are being heard.” Hence, there is in stark contrast in that section the disentitlement of members of the public to remain in the court proceedings but a specific entitlement of members of the press to remain in court. The specific entitlement of the press is subject to the court otherwise directing. 6. This judgment is necessary because Ms Maher, who appears for one of the offenders in this case, has made an application to me for just such a direction. She is supported in that application by Ms Gallagher, Ms David and Mr Brasch who appear for the other offenders. Mr Thompson, who appears as Prosecutor, very appropriately takes the position that it is a matter for me as to the order which I make and has drawn my attention to various relevant considerations. 7. The application made by Ms Maher alleges a breach of s 11 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. These sentence proceedings commenced in Parramatta last year. They continued in Sydney on 29 January this year. After the proceedings on 29 January, they became part heard and were adjourned to today. The proceedings on 29 January this year were the subject of items in the public news media. 8. Ms Maher’s application is based upon a claim that two television media breached s 11 of the Act. That provides that the name of a child who is in criminal proceedings – and, I should add, all the offenders in this case are under 18 and therefore children - must not be published or broadcast in a way that connects them with the criminal proceedings. Each of the offenders was, it goes without saying, also a child when the offences to which they have pleaded guilty were committed. The section goes on to explain what it means by the “name” of a child by saying that “a reference to the name of a person includes a reference to any information, picture or other material that identifies the person or is likely to lead to the identification of the person.” 9. Briefly, this case concerns four young men who have pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual intercourse with a child aged between ten and fourteen years. The aggravation claimed by the prosecution is that the offenders were in company. The evidence concerns various acts of intercourse which occurred with the victim of the offences in a number of places, including public places such as toilet blocks connected with parks. 10. Ms Maher’s claim is this. After the proceedings on 29 January this year, Channel Seven and Channel Nine, she said, broadcast television news items regarding the proceedings. The image of her client, her client’s face, was pixilated so that it could not be identified. But she said there was a clear side view without pixilation of her client’s father. She argued further that her client was also able to be identified despite some pixilation of his face. She pointed out that her client and his father were very clearly able to be identified.11. The consequence of that was that her client heard from neighbours and people from whom the family had not heard for years, inquiring about the offender and the offence. He was also approached at his employment. People at his employment did not know about the offences that he was charged with. 12. Ms David says that a similar scenario existed with her client. The images shown on Channel Seven and Nine, she said, could clearly depict her client’s father and her client. Both were pixilated, she acknowledged, but she said it was very clear who they were, especially her client’s father. She said that her client after the television broadcast received communications by text and telephone and personal visits from neighbours and other persons, inquiring about the offence. He was not approached at his work.13. Mr Brasch said that his client was depicted on the same broadcast, so he was instructed, running away from the court house. I should add that the proceedings on 29 January this year were at the Downing Centre and the claims are that these images were obtained outside the court building. His client, he said, was not pixilated and he said as a consequence a number of his friends were able to identify him, but nobody at work. He said that a neighbour who did not know about his client’s involvement in the offences discovered it and an uncle who previously did not know about it discovered it and it has caused some disruption - indeed, he said, a schism within the family. 14. Ms Gallagher says that her client is not in the same category as having been identified as a result of the television broadcast by persons who did not previously know but nevertheless her client was contacted by people after the broadcast of the television footage.15. I should say at this stage that these proceedings are not governed by the laws of evidence. The Evidence Act 1995 does not apply to sentencing proceedings unless a direction or order is made otherwise, and no such direction or order has been made in this case. Accordingly, I am deciding this case upon the information provided to me from the bar table, together with a number of exhibits which have been tendered which represent articles downloaded from the Internet: two from the Daily Telegraph posted on 29 January 2009 and one posted the following day by the Sydney Morning Herald. 16. I heard from all parties as to the application, as I said. I was informed by members of the profession that their experience in the Children’s Court was that magistrates on occasions in high profile cases invite the press to make representations. I decided that because there were such significant and conflicting public interests involved in this case that I would invite any member of the press who was present to express their views. Two members of the press did so. 17. One was a representative of the radio media. He indicated correctly that none of the complaints which was made by any of the legal representatives referred to any radio broadcast and he asks that, if I exclude the press, I make an exception for representatives of the radio media. A second submission was made by Jessica Rich from the Nine Network and she made it clear that she was speaking only on behalf of the organisation by which she was employed, namely the Nine Network. She correctly pointed out, which I accept, that what is said about the broadcast of material by the Nine Network were only allegations of non-compliance. Those persons involved in the production of the news stories assured her that all due care was taken, so far as they were concerned, not to identify any of the offenders or relatives of the offenders. She added the relevant news broadcasts have been downloaded and are being brought to court. I have decided that it is in the interests of justice that I resolve this application now, so that the sentence proceedings can proceed to finalisation.18. There is, or have been, a number of submissions directed to exhibits A1, 2 and 3. It was argued that the headlines of articles published by the Daily Telegraph, which are exhibits A2 and A1, were inappropriate and wrong. They refer to assaults and attackers, but it is acknowledged that there is no allegation that anything published in the print media or electronic media represented any breach of s 11, identifying the offenders. I do not propose to comment any further about those headlines, other than to say that the text of each of the stories does not appear to attract any critical comment.19. Obviously, one response to Ms Maher’s application is - as Mr Thompson pointed out as an available option – to reinforce with members of the press here their obligations under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act not to identify in any way the offenders, and to leave the remedying of any alleged breach of the legislation to those authorities who deal with such matters. I note, for example, that s 11(3) provides that a person who publishes or broadcasts the name of any person in breach of the section is guilty of an offence. Ms Maher and the other legal representatives of the offenders argued that such a response on my part would not be adequate and that what was required was the granting of the application to exclude members of the press. 20. The argument is this. A number of their clients have already been identified by, so they claim, their exposure on television. This has attracted the attention which it is said has already been given by relatives, friends and people at work. What is going to happen next in these proceedings is that I will hear the balance of the arguments about the sentences which I should impose. I will then impose sentences on each of the offenders. The arguments, and especially my remarks on sentence, will canvass obviously the roles which each offender had in the crime or crimes which he committed. That will include some description of the detail of the respective sexual encounters. I will also need to canvass in my remarks on sentence, as any judge does when sentencing an offender, personal information about each offender. That personal information has been made available as exhibits in these proceedings. It includes such things as reports on each offender from the Department of Juvenile Justice and psychological material and other material such as, in one case, a letter from one of the offenders concerning his role in the offence and his reaction to the offence.21. The argument is that now that the offenders have been identified, this further publication of details concerning their role in the offences and aspects of their personal lives will expose that information to the public. It will, as Ms Maher argued, add to the body of information which has already been circulated. That in turn will further damage the interests of the young men who are the offenders in this case. Ms David, for example, acknowledges the damage which has already been done but argues that excluding the press at this stage will control the damage which has occurred. It would be, she argues, very damaging to expose further information and an order of the sort which she and her colleagues is seeking will put, as she said, a lid on that damage now.22. I should record that one of Ms Maher’s arguments was that I could have no confidence that members of the press would comply with any further reminder which I gave them of their obligations under the Act, given what she described as a flagrant disregard by some press representatives of their obligations. I repeat, they are matters which are assertions from the bar table, which of course I accept from Ms Maher, but are not the subject of evidence and have been contested in a sense by the representative of Channel Nine. Nevertheless, as I repeat, I need to make this decision on information which I have now. 23. Ms Maher reminded me of the intention of the legislation which deals with offenders who are children when they commit crimes. The policy basis is that young people act from their immaturity, and to some extent they need protection from themselves. It will damage, so the offenders’ representatives argue, their clients’ prospects of rehabilitation and reintegration into the community if the kind of detail which would be exposed in my remarks on sentence were now published. The information could result in damage to the long-term future of the offenders. 24. An argument against the exclusion of the press, which was ventilated by Mr Thompson, is that the damage has already been done and most of the people who found out were people who were already familiar with the respective families. Ms Maher countered that it did not matter who those persons were, the damage is the exposure of information to anyone as a result of being identified from the proceedings. 25. Another factor which I take into account is that exclusion of the press could of course lead to speculation amongst people who already know about the case and already know the details which have already been the subject of publicity, and that that speculation in itself is undesirable. 26. I have decided to resolve the application by, in a moment, giving the direction which is sought. I repeat, it is a difficult matter to decide because of the clash of two such important public interests. I repeat there is a public interest in members of the community being able to sit in court cases. There is a particular public interest in court cases being able to be the subject of press coverage. Indeed, the sentencing principle which relates to generally deterring other offenders must be connected in some way with the fact that other offenders would learn of penalties imposed on some offenders as a result of reading about cases in the press.27. There is a particular public interest in this case. It is a case concerning sexual offences perpetrated on a young girl in a public place by a group of young men. It is important that members of the public know how the courts deal with such offences. On the other hand, there is the public interest - acknowledged by the legislation - in the community protecting those amongst it who are children.28. I should add - as an aside at this point - this. The victim in this case was also a child. She was thirteen. I have made little mention of her interests in this judgment. Her interests and protection were violated by the crimes committed against her. As it happens, the violators who have all admitted to their crime were also children. When I come to sentence the offenders, I will take into account the victim impact statement which has been given by the victim in this case. Her interests do not feature in this judgment, because the application is made on behalf of the offenders who are children, and the competing interests are between the community’s desire to protect its children, even those who have committed serious offences, and the community’s interests in the public dissemination of information about court proceedings. 29. I have decided to resolve the matter by excluding the press, because I accept the argument that further reporting of the details which will emerge as this case continues and concludes, will have the potential to compromise the objects of the legislation which include the re-integration of child offenders into the community. The legislation struck a balance which was appropriate between these two public interests. But because - on what I am told and what for the purposes of this judgment I accept - of the exposure of the identity of a number of the offenders, it has resulted in the potential for further damage to all offenders contrary to the policy of the legislation. 30. For those reasons, under s 10(1)(b) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 I direct the exclusion from this court of all persons who are engaged in preparing reports on the proceedings for the dissemination through public news media. So, members of the press, I am afraid for the reasons that I have just given, you have got to go.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: By a summons of 25 January 2008, Mr Wang seeks orders that a decision of the Law Society of New South Wales ('the Law Society'), refusing a claim brought under the Legal Profession Act 2004 ('the 2004 Act'), for payment of $130,000 from the Legal Practitioners Fidelity Fund, be set aside and that he be paid that sum from the Fidelity Fund, plus interest.  
     
      
    2 The claim arose out of events which occurred in 2004, when Mr Wang entrusted $130,000 to a solicitor, Mr Andrew Lui, later to be paid to a Mr Yi Li Li, for assisting Mr Wang to obtain a permanent resident visa. It was claimed that it was promised that the money would be repaid, if the visa was not obtained. A visa provided by Mr Li proved to be a forgery, but Mr Wang was not repaid. In 2007, a claim was made on the Fidelity Fund, but was refused by the Law Society. 
     
      
    3 As well as the merits of the appeal there were two other issues raised by the parties. The first, the proper role of the Law Society in these proceedings and the second, whether the provisions of the 2004 Act, applied to the proceedings.  
     
      
       
      The role of the Law Society 
       
      
    4 It was the case advanced for Mr Wang that the Law Society had no role to play as an active contradictor in the appeal brought under s 452 of the 2004 Act. (See R v The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and Ors; ex parte Hardiman and Ors (1980) 144 CLR 13 and Community Television Sydney Limited v Australian Broadcasting Authority and Anor (No 2) (2004) 136 FCR 338.) 
     
      
    5 For its part, the Law Society argued that the Hardiman principle had no application, given the statutory scheme under which the appeal was brought. Such an approach would leave a de novo review of the merits of a claim brought against the Fidelity Fund, to be decided by this Court in proceedings involving no active contradictor, even though the legislation expressly contemplated that the Law Society would perform that role.  
     
      
    6 At the hearing I announced that I could not accept the approach urged for Mr Wang and that I would in due course give reasons for that conclusion. 
     
      
    7 In Law Society of New South Wales v Glenorcy Pty Ltd and Ors (2006) 67 NSWLR 169, the Court of Appeal concluded at [14] that s 90D of the predecessor legislation, the Legal Profession Act 1987 ('the 1987 Act'), required the appeal to be conducted as a de novo review of the merits of the claim. It was not in issue that appeals brought under the 2004 Act, must also be approached on that basis. 
     
      
    8 Section 83 of the 1987 Act required the Law Society to conduct an investigation of Mr Wang’s claim. In Laurent v the Law Society of New South Wales [2000] NSWSC 1103, Adams J discussed the nature of that obligation at [9]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In conducting that investigation the Law Society is not a judicial tribunal. It in(sic) not conducting a criminal or, indeed, any trial. It is not bound by the laws of evidence. It is entitled to have regard to any material which fairly and rationally bears upon the relevant considerations entailed in investigating the claim. That evidence may be hearsay. It may be evidence of similar facts. It may include evidence about other dishonest or improper behaviour by the solicitor in question. These are all questions for the conscientious consideration of the Council. The members of the Committee must bring their own judgment, opinions and experience to bear on the issues. Of course a claimant must be given the opportunity to submit such material as he or she believes is relevant to the investigation but that in no sense delimits the scope of the Society's duty. Of course, it may be that, in a rare case, even following a full investigation a determination positively of honesty or dishonesty or any other necessary element of liability may not be able to be made. If that be the case then, of course, there is no finding as to that matter and it follows no claim on the Fund is established. 
         
         
        
       
      
    9 As was submitted for Mr Wang, it follows that in an appeal such as this, involving as it does a de novo hearing, the rights of a party to the proceedings are quite different to the obligations imposed on the Law Society by s 83 of the 1987 Act, to investigate a claim on the Fidelity Fund. Parties’ rights in appeal proceedings are both wider and narrower. While, on appeal, the parties are bound by the rules of evidence, witnesses must give their evidence on oath or affirmation and they may be cross examined, including as to credit. It is against that background that the argument as to the Hardiman principle must be considered.  
     
      
    10 The High Court’s decision in Hardiman concerned an application to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for approval of the acquisition of shares in a subsidiary of the holder of a commercial television license and the resulting public inquiry conducted by that Tribunal. In the proceedings before the High Court, the Tribunal did not adopt the usual approach of filing a submitting appearance, but instead appeared to present a substantive argument as to the nature and scope of an inquiry under the relevant statutory scheme, as well as to the way in which the particular inquiry had been conducted. At pp 35 - 36, it was observed: 
     
      
       
        
         
        There is one final matter. Mr Hughes was instructed by the Tribunal to take the unusual course of contesting the prosecutors' case for relief and this he did by presenting a substantive argument. In cases of this kind the usual course is for a tribunal to submit to such order as the court may make. The course which was adopted by the Tribunal in this Court is not one which we would wish to encourage. If a tribunal becomes a protagonist in this Court there is the risk that by so doing it endangers the impartiality which it is expected to maintain in subsequent proceedings which take place if and when relief is granted. The presentation of a case in this Court by a tribunal should be regarded as exceptional and, where it occurs should, in general, be limited to submissions going to the powers and procedures of the Tribunal.  
         
        In the result, we would make absolute the order nisi for mandamus. 
        
       
       
      
    11 This approach was followed by Sackville J in Community Television Sydney Limited, where the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal sought an order for costs, it having acted as a protagonist in judicial review proceedings brought under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), in relation to its decision to allocate a broadcasting license to one of the other respondents in the proceedings. His Honour concluded that the Hardiman principle applied, given that the proceedings had raised the prospect of remitter to the Tribunal; that the Tribunal would then have had to decide between the two applicants for the license, they both being parties to the proceedings; and that there was a contradictor present, prepared to advance arguments in opposition to the claim for relief sought against the Tribunal's decision. His Honour took the view that there was only one aspect of the matter in respect of which the Tribunal had properly appeared in the proceedings, consistent with the Hardiman principle and so awarded the Tribunal 25% of its costs of that appearance. 
     
      
    12 Sackville J referred to a judgment of Ashley J in TXU Electricity Ltd v Office of the Regulator-General (2001) 3 VR 93. There his Honour had to consider a ‘one party’ case, observing at [42] - [45]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""[T]he context in which the Hardiman observations were made suggests that the High Court was there giving its imprimatur to the course previously adopted in industrial and court matters, and was probably indicating that in proceedings for judicial review the same course should at least be adopted by decision-makers before whom hearings which were in substance inter partes were conducted. In such cases there would be a natural contradictor. Moreover, there might reasonably be as much concern about partiality or the appearance of partiality if a matter was to be remitted to such a decision-maker as there might be in the case of a court or industrial tribunal to which there was to be remitter. 
         
         
        It cannot be said, in my opinion, that Hardiman plainly extended the then-existing regime to decision-makers in `one party' cases. But there was and is good reason for giving the principle operation in at least some cases of that kind. The cases in which the principle sensibly applies are those in which: 
         
         
         . the decision-maker is bound to apply the rules of procedural fairness; and 
          
         . the application for prerogative relief raises the prospect of remitter; and 
          
         . there is a public interest as would justify the intervention of the Attorney-General. 
         
         
        Even so, the dictum of Brennan J in  
        Fagan [v Crimes Compensation Tribunal 
         (1982) 150 CLR 666, at 681-682] makes it clear that the principle should not be applied if the Attorney-General does not intervene and no `law officer' or `public official' is heard by the court. In the absence of such intervention the decision-maker in such a case should characteristically assist the court, particularly upon the question of power, and in doing so adopt as little of the role of partisan as is possible. 
         
         
        I said a moment ago that there was and remains good reason for giving the  
        Hardiman 
         principle operation in certain `one party' cases. The reason is this: in such a case, where there is prospect of remitter, a concern as to the fact or appearance of partiality could arise. It would not be a concern that the decision-maker was or appeared to be favourably disposed to one of two parties; but rather that the decision-maker was or appeared to be unfavourably disposed to the prosecutor."" 
        
       
      
    13 Ashley J, after an extensive review of the authorities, concluded that in a one party matter where the Attorney General had not intervened, the Court could not deny a decision maker the right to participate fully in the judicial review proceedings. His Honour noted that no case had been cited to him in which a court had precluded a party from participating fully in judicial review proceedings, in order to avoid a breach of the Hardiman principle. Nor was there any such authority referred to in these proceedings.  
     
      
    14 Ashley J also observed at [39], in relation to appeal proceedings: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Distinct from cases in which prerogative relief was sought, there are many reported cases in which decision-makers were parties to, and appeared substantively in appellate proceedings. The role of the decision-makers in such cases was dictated by statute. [See the very many proceedings to which the Commissioner of Taxation, his predecessors, his State counterparts and Collectors of Customs have been parties, and cases involving the Registrar of Trade Marks and the Commissioner of Patents; see also, for example,  
        Repatriation Commission v Law 
         [1981] HCA 57; (1981) 147 CLR 635, and  
        Matthews v Chicory Marketing Board (Victoria) 
         [1938] HCA 38; (1938) 60 CLR 263.] They do not cast light, in my opinion, upon the resolution of the present problem. If there was to be remission to the decision-maker in the event of successful appeal, and if that carried with it any concern about the fact or appearance of partiality, the short answer is that the pertinent statute nonetheless set up a regime in which the decision-maker was made a substantive litigant on the appeal. 
         
        
       
      
    15 In Fagan, the High Court was concerned with a decision made pursuant to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1972 (Vic), where the Tribunal had refused a claim for compensation. The Tribunal appeared in the appeal proceedings in the Victorian Supreme Court and in the High Court. Its role was discussed by Brennan J, who observed at pp 681-2: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In this case the Tribunal appeared by counsel as respondent to contest the appellant's case. Where curial proceedings arise out of a matter which is contested between parties appearing before a tribunal, it is not ordinarily appropriate for the tribunal to appear to contest the curial proceedings brought by one of the parties before it ( 
        Reg. v. Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte Hardiman 
         [1980] HCA 13; (1980) 144 CLR 13, at pp 35-36 ). But where the proceedings before the tribunal are not inter partes, and where the Attorney-General cannot or does not intervene to represent the public interest (cf.  
        Corporate Affairs Commission v. Bradley 
         (1974) 1 NSWLR 391 ) and neither a law officer nor a public official is heard by the court (cf.  
        Reg. v. Cook; Ex parte Twigg 
         (1980) 147 CLR 15 ), it may be desirable that the tribunal should appear by counsel to make such submissions as it thinks calculated to assist the court and, in an appropriate case, to argue against the applicant's case. That is what was done in this case. Here, the Tribunal's function was to determine whether and to what extent a claimant was entitled under statute to a payment out of public moneys. Though the Tribunal was bound to act impartially, it was in a sense the guardian of the moneys appropriated by Parliament to answer the proper claims for compensation under the Act. In proceedings to review its decision, the Tribunal properly represents the public purse, and it was right that the Tribunal should appear by counsel as a party to respond substantially to the application. It follows that the Tribunal should then be treated as an ordinary party in the matter of costs. Therefore I would make an order awarding the applicant his costs against the Tribunal both here and in the Supreme Court. 
         
        
       
      
    16 In this case, the decision maker, the Law Society, was not an administrative tribunal. Mr Wang’s claim did not involve any inter parties contest. Rather, the Law Society had a statutory obligation to investigate his claim and to determine it in accordance with its responsibility to administer the Fidelity Fund and to make payments out of the Fidelity Fund, to claimants who established rights to such payments in accordance with the statutory scheme. Undoubtedly in carrying out those functions, the Law Society was obliged to act impartially. These proceedings then came to this Court as an appeal from the Law Society’s decision to refuse Mr Wang’s claim, not by way of judicial review.  
     
      
    17 It was put for the Law Society that its role in the appeal proceedings was to ‘test the evidence, make submissions about the effect of the evidence as against the provisions of the Act and as to whether this Court should find, on the merits, the plaintiff is entitled to payment from the Fund.’  
     
      
    18 The authorities suggest that in past proceedings such as these, whether brought under the 2004 Act or the 1987 Act, the Law Society has appeared as an active party. There has, to date, seemingly, been no suggestion that the Law Society did not properly have such a role to play. That is not by any means a decisive consideration, but explains why this point only now arises for determination. Even so, it was not suggested for Mr Wang that the Attorney General, or anyone else, could or should have appeared in these proceedings to perform the role which the Law Society seeks to perform. That was the order sought in TXU Electricity Ltd, which was refused by Ashley J. No such relief was sought here.  
     
      
    19 In my view it must be accepted that consistently with the approach taken in Fagan, the Law Society appearing as an ordinary party in the appeal to respond substantially to the relief sought, so as to properly represent the Fidelity Fund which it must administer, is its proper role. 
     
      
    20 That view is directly supported by the statutory scheme, particularly s 454 Court Proceedings, of the 2004 Act, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        454 Court proceedings 
         
         
        In any proceedings brought in a court under section 448 (Subrogation) or section 452 (Appeal against decision on claim): 
         
         
        (a) evidence of any admission or confession by, or other evidence that would be admissible against, an Australian legal practitioner or other person with respect to an act or omission giving rise to a claim is admissible to prove the act or omission despite the fact that the practitioner or other person is not a defendant in, or a party to, the proceedings, and 
         
         
        (b) any defence that would have been available to the practitioner or other person is available to the Law Society Council. 
         
        
       
      
    21 Were the approach urged for Mr Wang correct, s 454(b) would have no work to do in appeal proceedings such as this. The section expressly contemplates that the Law Society will appear in such proceedings in order to run a defence. That, it seems to me, puts beyond doubt that the Law Society may properly play an active role as contradictor in these proceedings.  
     
      
    22 I am unable to accept the argument that the possibility that one of the orders which the Court could make in proceedings such as this, is that the matter would be remitted to the Law Society for reconsideration (s 452(5)(b)(iii)), must lead to the conclusion that like in Hardiman, the Law Society ought not to appear as an active contradictor in the proceedings.  
     
      
    23 While the legislation contemplates remitter, that is not the only remedy provided for and indeed, was not the remedy here urged. Both parties accepted that in this case, the Court would decide the plaintiff’s claim on the basis of the evidence led, although each accepting, in theory, that the Court could come to a different view and could order remitter. The 2004 Act expressly contemplates that the Law Society will appear as defendant in appeal proceedings and the possibility of remitter. As Ashley J observed in TXU Electricity Ltd, such a regime is one entirely open to the Parliament to adopt, if it wishes. 
     
      
    24 Were the Law Society not given such a role, on the approach urged for Mr Wang the result would be that a de novo hearing on appeal would proceed before this Court without any contradictor, leaving it entirely in the hands of the appellant as to what evidence to lead. Such evidence would then, seemingly, remain untested and the Court would be left in the position of being given no assistance, of the kind discussed by Brennan J in Fagan. That would be quite a curious appeal process, one which the legislation itself does not hint at. To the contrary, it contemplates, as I have said, that the Law Society will play an active role as a defendant. 
     
      
    25 It followed that the approach urged for Mr Wang had to be refused. 
     
      
        
       
      Which Act governs these proceedings? 
       
      
    26 Mr Wang’s claim was made in 2007, in relation to events which occurred in 2004, at a time when the 1987 Act was in force. It was considered by the Law Society as a claim required to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the 1987 Act, even though the 2004 Act was then in force. 
     
      
    27 The appeal was brought to this Court in 2008 pursuant to the 2004 Act. A question was raised by the Law Society as to which legislation the appeal had to be determined under, having in mind the transitional provisions which appear in Schedule 9 to the 2004 Act. There, clause 3 makes general saving and transitional provisions in relation to events which occurred before the 2004 Act came into operation (1 October 2005) and clause 22A deals with appeals brought after the 2004 Act came into operation in respect of matters arising under the 1987 Act. It provides: 
     
      
       
        
        22A New appeals or reviews about old matters 
        (1) A matter arising under the old Act may be the subject of an appeal or review made or applied for on or after 1 October 2005 if the appeal or review could have been made or applied for had this Act not been enacted. 
        (2) The appeal or review may be made or applied for under the provisions of either the old Act or this Act (even if the matter could not otherwise be the subject of appeal or review under this Act if the matter had arisen on or after 1 October 2005). 
        (3) The appeal or review may be dealt with under this Act (even if the matter could not otherwise be the subject of appeal or review under this Act if the matter had arisen after 1 October 2005), except in so far as a direction of the Supreme Court or the President of the Tribunal, as the case requires, under this clause otherwise provides. 
        (4) The Supreme Court or the President of the Tribunal, as the case requires, may direct that the appeal or review proceedings be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of:  
        (a) the old Act, or 
        (b) the old Act and this Act as regards different aspects of the proceedings, as indicated in the direction. 
         
          
          Those provisions apply accordingly, and so apply with any necessary adaptations. 
          
         
        (5) The President of the Tribunal may, for the purposes of this clause, direct that the Tribunal be constituted as determined by the President or the Divisional Head of the Legal Services Division, being a determination that is consistent with requirements for the constitution of the Division under the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act 1997 at or at any time before the commencement of this clause. 
        (6) The President may give any such direction at any stage of the proceedings. 
        (7) The Supreme Court or the Tribunal, as the case requires, may make orders declaring how the decision on the appeal or review is to have effect in relation to the provisions of this Act. 
        (8) Any decisions of the Supreme Court or the Tribunal or directions of the Supreme Court or the President of the Tribunal that:  
         
          
          (a) were made or given before the commencement of this clause, and 
          (b) would have been valid had the Legal Profession Amendment Act 2006 (which inserted this clause) been in force at the relevant time, 
          
         
         are taken to have been validly made or given. 
        
       
       
      
    28 It was accepted that Mr Wang had a right to make a claim on the Fidelity Fund under the 1987 Act and also the option of bringing an appeal under either the 1987 or 2004 Acts, but still a question arose as to which statutory scheme had to be applied by the Court, in determining the appeal.  
     
      
    29 The question is not without complexity, but it was common ground that while there will be cases where this issue may have consequences, given the nature of the particular claim and what is raised on the appeal, given changes introduced by the 2004 Act, this case is not one of them. It was accepted that the relief sought on appeal in the circumstances of this case, is available under either statutory scheme.  
     
      
    30 In those circumstances, I do not propose to come to any conclusions as to the matters raised. They are academic, the parties accepting that the same orders are available to be made, no matter which Act governs the proceedings. The question to be determined is whether Mr Wang’s claim on the Fidelity Fund ought to have been granted. 
     
      
       
      The merits of the Appeal 
       
       
      The evidence 
      
    31 Mr Wang’s claim was made in 2007, after he had been deported. It was determined by the Law Society’s Fidelity Fund Management Committee. On 18 December 2007 the Law Society advised Mr Wang's solicitor, Mr Bian, that the claim had been disallowed, the Committee having come to the view that there had been no failure to account by Mr Lui, within the meaning of s 79A of the 1987 Act, because the sum of $130,000 received by Mr Lui had not been received in the course of his legal practice. Further, that even if there had been a failure to account, the Committee ‘was satisfied that the conduct of the transaction with Mr Lui was illegal and that Mr Wang knew or ought reasonably to have known of that illegality’. In coming to that conclusion, the Committee took into account: 
     
      
       
        
         
         . Mr Wang's past experience of the visa application process 
         
          
         . the fact that $130,000 was paid supposedly for a visa based on a fear of persecution  
          
          
         . the imposition of a two week time limit for the visa 
          
          
         . the fact that the agreement made provision for the eventuality that the visa was fraudulent 
          
          
         . its view that Mr Li was not an associate of Mr Lui within the meaning of the Legal Professsion(sic) Act 1987 
         
        
       
       
      
    32 There was no explanation given as to why the Committee had come to the view that Mr Lui had not received the money paid to him in the course of his legal practice. Nor was it entirely clear from the letter, what transaction the Law Society was referring to, when it concluded that the transaction in which Mr Lui had been involved was illegal.  
     
      
    33 After further representations were made by Mr Bian, the Law Society considered Mr Wang’s claim again. More information was sought from Mr Wang, but on 7 August the Law Society again advised Mr Bian that the claim had been refused. It advised that it had discovered that the visa which had been issued to Mr Wang was one of a number of blank visas which had been stolen from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship in Canberra. The Law Society took the view that while it was not suggested in any way that Mr Wang was a party to the theft of the visas, ‘the following matters suggest that Mr Wang may have known that he was not genuinely applying for a protection visa’: 
     
      
       
        
        
         . the fact that a payment of $130,000 was made for an application which attracts a $30 fee 
         
          
         . the fact that the payment was conditional on a visa, being a visa grounded on fear of persecution, being granted within two weeks 
          
          
         . the fact that the parties contemplated in a written agreement the possibility that the visa might be fraudulent. 
         
        
       
      
    34 Still, further comment was invited by the Law Society from Mr Wang, to which Mr Bian again responded, pointing, amongst other things, to Mr Wang’s reliance on Mr Lui as a lawyer, on whom he had relied not to be involved in any illegality and who he had trusted. Mr Wang denied that he knew or ought to have known of the illegality in question. 
     
      
    35 On appeal, the only evidence was that led in Mr Wang’s case. Mr Wang gave his evidence by telephone, from China, with the assistance of an interpreter. Mr Lu was called and also gave his evidence with the assistance of an interpreter. Mr Bian, who represented Mr Wang both in his dealings with the police and the Law Society gave affidavit evidence and was not required for cross examination. The evidence expanded upon the information which had been provided to the Law Society in the claim form and by the subsequent correspondence to which I have referred. 
     
      
    36 The Law Society led no evidence as to its investigation of the claim, or what it had revealed. It was common ground that both Mr Li and Mr Lui had disappeared and were not able to be found.  
     
      
    37 From the evidence, it became apparent why the Committee had reached the view that Mr Lui had been involved in an illegal transaction. He was a sole practitioner, who represented on his letterhead ‘Andrew Lui Lawyers’ that he was a solicitor, a public notary and a migration agent. 
     
      
    38 In his claim to the Law Society, Mr Wang claimed that Mr Lui had provided him with legal services in relation to an application for a permanent resident visa. It was not in contest that Mr Lui was introduced to Mr Wang by Mr Li, to whom Mr Wang had earlier been introduced by an acquaintance as being a migration agent, who could assist Mr Wang in obtaining a permanent resident visa.  
     
      
    39 Mr Wang, a Chinese national, had been in Australia since 1996. He had first travelled here under a one month business visa, which had been arranged for him by Mr Lu, with the assistance of a migration agent. Mr Lu, a friend of Mr Wang’s father, had himself first come to Australia from China as a student and had later obtained permanent residency granted to such students by the Australian Government, in the aftermath of the events in Tiananmen Square in the early 1990s. 
     
      
    40 Mr Wang had remained illegally in Australia after the expiry of his business visa and in 1998 had applied for a protection visa, with the assistance of a migration agent. That application was unsuccessful, but Mr Wang still continued to remain illegally in Australia. 
     
      
    41 In 2004, Mr Wang was introduced to Mr Li. Mr Li told him that he could get Mr Wang a permanent resident visa, which would cost $130,000, but that if he could not get the visa, he would refund all of the money to Mr Wang. In a later conversation Mr Li told Mr Wang that he would 'have to pay a deposit of $35,000'; that he had a ’working partner’ Mr Lui and that ‘even if you won’t trust me you have to trust Mr Lui. Mr Lui is a solicitor and we are good friends.’ Mr Wang later borrowed money from Mr Lu and on 13 February 2004, together they went to see Mr Li and Mr Lui at Mr Lui’s offices, which he and Mr Li appeared to share. 
     
      
    42 In the discussion Mr Li told Mr Wang that he could apply for a permanent visa. Mr Lui said ‘I can guarantee what Mr Li has said. He will guarantee you success with the application for Visa or have your money fully refunded’. 
     
      
    43 Mr Lu paid $35,000 cash to Mr Lui, who provided a typed ‘acknowledgement’ printed on his letterhead, which provided: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""We acknowledge receipt of $35,000.00 this date as trustee for (John) Yi Li Li from Wang Qiuxue for work to be done from Yi Li Li. 
         
         
        In the event that such work is not completed within 2 weeks Yi Li Li is to refund all monies to Wang Qiuxue."" 
         
          
        
       
      
    44 Mr Wang, Mr Lu and Mr Li also signed a handwritten ‘agreement’, written in Chinese, which had already been prepared. It was not written on any letterhead. That agreement provided: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""This agreement is entered into between Yi Li LI and Wen Jun LU: 
         
         
        Yi Li LI will act for Qiu Xue WANG in the matter of immigration application. Wen Jun LU will pay $35,000 as a deposit. This immigration matter shall be finalized in two weeks. If the application fails to be finalized in two weeks, all the deposit shall be refunded to Wen Jun LU.""  
         
        
       
      
    45 Mr Lui also signed this agreement, but as a witness. 
     
      
    46 On about 12 March, Mr Li told Mr Wang that his visa was ready and that he had to pay the balance of the money. Mr Wang and Mr Lu again went together to Mr Lui’s office and paid him $95,000 in cash. Mr Lui again provided a typed ‘acknowledgment' printed on his letterhead. It provided: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""We acknowledge receipt of $95,000 this date as trustee for (John) yi Lil(sic) Li from Wang Qiuxue for work to be done from Yi Lil(sic) Li. 
         
         
        In the event that such work is not completed by 12 May 2004 Yi Li Li is to refund all monies to Wang Qiuxue.""  
        
       
       
      
    47 A second agreement, also handwritten in Chinese, was also then signed by Mr Wang, Mr Lu and Mr Li and witnessed by Mr Lui. It provided: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""This agreement is entered into between Yi Li LI and Wen Jun LU: 
         
         
        Yi Li LI will act for Qin(sic) Xue WANG in his application for permanent residency. The application for Medicare card and Tax File Number shall be finalized between 12 February and 13 May. In two years, Australian Citizenship shall be obtained in two years. If any problem arises during this process, for example, the permanent resident visa is fraudulent, all the fees of $130,000 shall be refunded.""  
         
        
       
      
    48 Mr Wang soon discovered that the visa he was given by Mr Li was a forgery. A few days later, when handling the visa he found that the colour came off. Mr Wang telephoned Mr Li but could not contact him. He then went to the office where he told Mr Lui what had happened. Mr Lui told him that he could also not find Mr Li. Mr Wang asked Mr Lui to refund the money, but Mr Lui told him that he did not have it. Mr Wang threatened legal proceedings. Mr Lui offered to get him another visa, but Mr Wang demanded the money, saying ‘I won’t trust you both regarding further visas. I want my money back’. 
     
      
    49 Mr Wang spoke to Mr Lui on a number of later occasions, always to be told that he could not find Mr Li. In 2005, Mr Wang was deported and now remains in China.  
     
      
    50 Mr Lu’s evidence corroborated that of Mr Wang. Mr Wang had approached him for a loan of $130,000, in order that he could apply for permanent residence through Mr Li, who was working for a law firm. Mr Lu thought that this was a lot of money, but Mr Wang told him that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Wang:  
        I am applying for permanent residency through Mr Yi Li Li, who is a friend of mine working with a law firm. But they want $130,000. I don't have this money would you be able to lend it to me? 
         
         
        Myself:  
        $130,000 is a lot of money. 
         
         
        Wang:  
        I know, but they said they would give the money back if the application was not successful. Mr Li said it would go into the account held by a lawyer whose surname is Lui. The lawyer has an office in China Town. The lawyer will hold the money, and give it back to me if my visa application fails. They said they would sign an agreement with me about his."" 
         
         
        Myself:  
        OK, but you will have to pay it back from your salary over time 
        . 
         
         
        Wang:  
        I will do that . Thank you"" 
         
         
        Myself:  
        I would like to have a word with them about the arrangements."" 
         
         
        Wang:  
        That would be good. They say they want $35,000 upfront"" 
         
         
        
       
      
    51 Mr Lu himself had to borrow money in order to lend Mr Wang the sum he needed. He wanted to speak to Mr Li and Mr Lui about this arrangement and so attended the two meetings with Mr Wang. Mr Lu’s account of the conversation on 13 February, was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Mr Li:  
        The agreement will be that you pay us $35,000 and $95,000 if we obtain the visa. 
         
         
        Myself:  
        Do you promise that if you can't get a visa, we will get the money back?"" 
         
         
        Mr Li:  
        There won't be a problem. 
         
         
        Myself to Mr Lui:  
        Can we rely on you?"" 
         
         
        Mr Lui:  
        Of course you can. We have been successful with many similar cases. We have been doing this work for many years. If you have any problems, come back and see me. 
         
         
        Myself:  
        Is this kind of work legal? 
         
         
        Mr Lui:  
        Of course legal. 
         ""  
         
         
        
       
      
    52 Neither Mr Wang nor Mr Lu were cross examined as to the veracity of their accounts as to their dealings with Mr Li and Mr Lui. They were, however, both cross examined as to their concerns that the transaction might not be a lawful one.  
     
      
    53 Mr Wang’s evidence was that he stayed in Australia, knowing he did not have a valid visa in 1996, after the expiry of his one month business visa and later after his 1998 application for a visa was not successful. He wanted to stay permanently in Australia and was concerned about being deported. He agreed that the arrangement which he made in 2004 was that Mr Li would do the work to get the visa and that Mr Lui would hold the money for safekeeping, while he waited for the visa. Mr Li told him the visa cost $130,000 because it was very difficult to get. Mr Li wanted him to pay cash and he borrowed the money from Mr Lu, who told him that if he could get a visa for $130,000, it was worth it, but Mr Lu was worried that he would get ripped off. 
     
      
    54 Mr Wang also agreed that when he paid the money, he made an agreement that if any problems arose, the money would be repaid. He said that he did not sign the second agreement, when the $95,000 was paid, although the translation of the document in evidence shows that he did sign it. He did then receive the document, which he read. It included a statement that the money would be repaid if the visa was fraudulent. Mr Wang explained that the document had been prepared by Mr Lui and Mr Li. It was they who had used that phrase, not him. The document was not discussed at the meeting, it had been discussed before. He never thought that the visa would be fake. The agreement was to give him peace of mind. 
     
      
    55 Mr Lu’s evidence was that he was a business man and company director. He had engaged an agent to help him get a business visa for Mr Wang in 1996. He had never hired an agent to help anyone else get a visa. He was aware that Mr Wang had stayed in Australia after his visa had expired and that he had been unsuccessful in obtaining another visa in 1998, but he did not know that Mr Wang did not have a visa in 2004, when he came to seek his help.56 Mr Lu explained that he thought it was strange that such a visa would cost $130,000. Initially he did not agree to help Mr Wang to apply for a visa, but when Mr Wang told him that it was to be done by a solicitor, he agreed, because he trusted Australian lawyers. He still wanted to go with Mr Wang to his meeting. He found that the offices they attended were professionally presented, with certificates on the wall and Mr Li told him that he would guarantee that the matter would be successful, otherwise he would refund the money, so he agreed. He was worried that the work was illegal, but since his visit to the solicitor’s office, he did not worry anymore. He had no more worries because Mr Lui was a solicitor. Mr Wang’s father had asked him to check that there was a proper solicitor’s firm and if there was, he should borrow the money and they would try to repay him. After going to the solicitor’s firm, he had no more worries, thinking that for $130,000 a solicitor should not just run away. 
     
      
       
      The parties’ cases 
       
      
    57 It was Mr Wang’s case that the evidence showed that Mr Lui had been involved in a criminal enterprise with Mr Li and that he had taken steps to draft documents in such a way as to disguise his true involvement in the transaction, in which he had provided legal services. The evidence showed that in reality, Mr Li was Mr Lui's associate, as defined in the 1987 Act and that Mr Wang had a proper claim upon the Fidelity Fund, which had wrongly been refused.  
     
      
    58 It would be accepted that the money was trust money; Mr Lui had an unmet obligation to repay the money to Mr Wang and the failure to do so was as the result of Mr Lui’s dishonest omission, or that of Mr Li, as an associate of Mr Lui. 
     
      
    59 It was the Law Society's case that while there was evidence of a relationship between Mr Lui and Mr Li, the evidence did not admit of a conclusion that it was trust money; Mr Lui had not received the money in the course of his legal practice and that Mr Li was not an associate of Mr Lui’s legal practice. 
     
      
    60 It was argued that the evidence showed that the only involvement which Mr Lui had in the transaction was to hold money as trustee for Mr Li, with the related condition that in certain circumstances, Mr Li was to refund the money to Mr Wang. This did not constitute work done or business transacted in the ordinary course of legal practice. The act of holding money as a trustee was not within the realm of activities which may only be undertaken by legal practitioners; any person may hold money on trust. Here there was the bare holding of money, with no associated legal services being provided. Even if Mr Lui’s receipt of the money evidenced an intention to create a legal relationship of some kind, it was not intended to create a retainer to provide legal services. Nor was there evidence of consideration from Mr Li to Mr Lui, as would be expected if it was they who had had a solicitor/client relationship. 
     
      
    61 Even if it could be concluded that the money had been received as trust money in connection with the provision of legal services, the evidence disclosed no relevant default by Mr Lui to pay or deliver the money. It was not entrusted to him for payment or delivery to Mr Wang, but rather for payment to Mr Li. 
     
      
    62 Further written submissions were filed, which it is not necessary here to outline.  
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    63 In its case the Law Society relied on the approach of Hulme J in Laurent v Law Society of New South Wales [2002] NSWSC 655, as to what a claimant had to establish under the 1987 Act: 
     
      
       
        
        20 Putting aside factors not relevant in this case, it is clear from the terms of sections 80 and 79A that for a claim against the Fidelity Fund to succeed, there must be established:- 
         
         
        (i) pecuniary loss because of 
         
        (ii) a failure by a solicitor to account for, pay, or deliver 
         
        (iii) money or other valuable property 
         
        (iv) (which has been) received by, or entrusted to, the solicitor 
         
        (v) in the course of the solicitor’s practice 
         
        (vi) that the failure arose from an act or omission of the solicitor 
         
        (vii) being an act or omission which the Law Society Council finds to be dishonest 
        
       
      
    64 There was no real issue here between the parties as to what was referred to by his Honour in paragraphs (i), (iii) and (vii). For reasons which will become clear, I am satisfied that the other factors here in issue, were established on the evidence. 
     
      
    65 Mr Wang’s claim was dealt with by the Law Society under the 1987 Act, which provided in s 80, that: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The Fidelity Fund is held, and is to be a, by the Law Society for the purpose of compensating persons who suffer pecuniary loss because of a failure to account or a dishonest default. 
         
        
       
      
    66 Relevant to this claim was the definition of ‘failure to account’ appearing in s 79A of the 1987 Act: 
     
      
       
        
        79A Meaning of “failure to account” 
        (1) In this Division, a reference to a failure to account is a reference to a failure by a solicitor to account for, pay or deliver money or other valuable property received by, or entrusted to, the solicitor or an associate in the course of the solicitor’s practice (in the case of an associate, being money or valuable property under the direct or indirect control of the solicitor). 
        (2) This section applies only to a failure to account that arises from an act or omission of the solicitor or associate:  
         
          
          (a) for which the solicitor or associate has been convicted of a crime or an offence involving dishonesty, or 
          (b) which the Law Society Council has found to be dishonest. 
          
         
        (3) A finding by the Law Society Council under subsection (2) (b) that an act or omission is, or is not, dishonest is final and conclusive. 
        (4) This section applies whether the money or other property was received by the solicitor or associate as trustee, agent, bailee or stakeholder or in any other capacity. 
        (5) This section applies whether the failure to account, or the act, omission, conviction or finding of dishonesty, took place before or after the commencement of this Act. 
        
       
      
    67 At the hearing, the parties also advanced submissions by reference to the provisions of the 2004 Act, given the time at which Mr Wang made his claim. Section 436 of the 2004 Act gives a right to make a claim on the Fidelity Fund in respect of a ‘default’. Section 434 provides that this part of the 2004 Act is concerned with ‘a default of a law practice arising from or constituted by an act or omission of one or more associates of the practice’. ‘Default’ is defined in s 419 as: 
     
      
       
        
        default, in relation to a law practice, means:  
        (a) a failure of the practice to pay or deliver trust money or trust property that was received by the practice in the course of legal practice by the practice, where the failure arises from or is constituted by an act or omission of an associate that involves dishonesty, or 
        (b) a fraudulent dealing with trust property that was received by the practice in the course of legal practice by the practice, where the fraudulent dealing arises from or is constituted by an act or omission of an associate that involves dishonesty.  
        
       
      
    68 In the 2004 Act 'legal services' is defined in s 4 as ‘legal services means work done, or business transacted, in the ordinary course of legal practice.’ While there was an issue as to whether or not Mr Li was an associate of Mr Lui’s law practice, (as defined in s 7 of the Act), there was no question that Mr Lui fell within the definition. ‘Trust money’ is defined in s 234 and there was a question as to whether or not the money entrusted to Mr Lui, fell within that definition.  
     
      
    69 It was, however, not in dispute that the evidence showed that Mr Lui and Mr Li were involved together in a scheme in which they convinced Mr Wang to pay over $130,000 to Mr Lui, which it was agreed that Mr Lui was to hold on trust. The scheme involved Mr Wang being provided with a false visa, which, on the Law Society's advice to Mr Wang, it learned had been forged on a blank visa form stolen from a Commonwealth Government Department. That explained why the Law Society came to the conclusion that the transaction in which Mr Lui was involved was an illegal one. That view, undoubtedly, had a proper basis, given the disappearance of both Mr Li and Mr Lui, once the forgery was uncovered and Mr Wang sought the return of the money. 
     
      
    70 There was no suggestion that Mr Wang had actual knowledge of any of these matters. Rather, the Law Society’s view was that given the obvious implausibility of a permanent resident visa being able to be obtained by a migration agent in two weeks, as was promised, in return for the payment of the sum of $130,000, Mr Wang ought to have known of the illegality in which Mr Lui was involved.71 There can be no question that whatever Mr Wang ought to have realised, Mr Lui had actual knowledge of the illegality of the scheme in which he was so clearly involved. The Law Society’s view that Mr Lui was a knowing accomplice in the provision of a false visa is understandable. Mr Lui’s role in this criminal enterprise was the use which he and Mr Li made of Mr Lui’s position as a practising solicitor, to entice Mr Wang and Mr Lu to hand over a large sum of money, for a worthless document. 72 It does not necessarily follow, of course, from the overall illegality of Mr Li and Mr Lui’s scheme, that the transaction in which Mr Lui was involved with Mr Wang was an illegal one. Plainly a legal transaction can be used in order to further an illegal enterprise.  
     
      
    73 Indeed, it was accepted in the Law Society’s case that Mr Lui’s role as a stakeholder was a lawful one, but it argued that the evidence did not show that the money received by Mr Lui, was received in the course of his practice as a solicitor, as the definition in s 79A of the 1987 Act required (and the corresponding provisions of the 2004 Act.) 
     
      
    74 The evidence was that Mr Wang and Mr Lu met with Mr Lui and Mr Li at Mr Lui’s offices, which, it appeared to them, they shared, consistent with Mr Li’s advice that they worked together. In the discussion it was agreed that Mr Lui was to act as stakeholder of the money, holding it on trust, he having assured Mr Lu and Mr Wang that the services which Mr Li was offering to provide Mr Wang were legal. That advice was accepted and Mr Lui then received $130,000 cash, which he acknowledged by the documents he had prepared on his letterhead and which he signed. Thereby, it was acknowledged that Mr Lui’s role was to hold the money on trust, until certain work was performed by Mr Li and that it was to be returned, if the work was not undertaken.  
     
      
    75 That evidence demonstrated, as was accepted by the Law Society, that Mr Lui was to hold the money on trust as a stakeholder. There is nothing illegal about a solicitor acting in such a capacity. On the evidence, I am unable to accept the Law Society’s case that in agreeing to undertake that role, Mr Lui was not doing so in the course of his legal practice.  
     
      
    76 If a solicitor agrees to hold money on trust as a stakeholder, I can see no basis on which it may properly be concluded that the solicitor is doing so other than in the ordinary course of that solicitor’s practice, unless it be the case that the solicitor received the money in the course of some other business entirely. While services of a stakeholder need not be provided by a solicitor, such services are within the range of services which they customarily provide in the course of their practice.  
     
      
    77 That approach is directly supported by various of the provisions of the 1987 Act, which were concerned to regulate solicitors’ receipt of money. Section 61 obliged a solicitor ‘who, in the course of practising as a solicitor in this State, receives money on behalf of another person’ to deal with such money as trust money. In the definitions appearing in s 60, it was provided, as to such receipt: 
     
      
       
        
        (4) A reference in this Division to money received by a solicitor includes a reference to:  
        (a) money coming under the direct control of the solicitor, whether or not by the exercise of an express power or authority or by operation of law, 
        (b) money paid to an associate of the solicitor on the advice of the solicitor, but only if the money is under the direct or indirect control of the solicitor, and 
        (c) money in relation to which the solicitor (whether or not through an associate) has a power of disposal exercisable jointly and severally with the person on whose behalf it was received or a nominee of the person. 
        
       
      
    78 Those obligations were not qualified on the basis that they only arose, if the solicitor who received the money was to provide other legal services. Receiving the money as a stakeholder, was, of itself enough to trigger these statutory obligations. In this respect, what was provided in s 79A may not be overlooked. It specified the circumstances in which ‘a failure to account’ on the part of a solicitor arose, making it clear that:  
     
      
       
        
        (4) This section applies whether the money or other property was received by the solicitor or associate as trustee, agent, bailee or stakeholder or in any other capacity. 
         
        . 
        
       
      
    79 The 2004 Act, if then in force, would have required a similar approach, given the definition of trust money in s 234: 
     
      
       
        
        trust money 
         means money entrusted to a law practice in the course of or in connection with the provision of legal services by the practice, and includes:  
        (a) money received by the practice on account of legal costs in advance of providing the services, and 
        (b) controlled money received by the practice, and 
        (c) transit money received by the practice, and 
        (d) money received by the practice, that is the subject of a power, exercisable by the practice or an associate of the practice, to deal with the money for or on behalf of another person. 
        
       
      
    80 The money Mr Lui received fell within paragraph (d) of the definition and perhaps even paragraph (c). Section 248 which deals with the question of when money is received by a legal practice, makes this conclusion even clearer. It provides: 
     
      
       
        
        248 When money is received 
        (1) For the purposes of this Act, a law practice receives money when:  
         
          
          (a) the practice obtains possession or control of it directly, or 
          (b) the practice obtains possession or control of it indirectly as a result of its delivery to an associate of the practice, or 
          (c) the practice, or an associate of the practice (otherwise than in a private and personal capacity), is given a power to deal with the money for or on behalf of another person. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
       
      
    81 I am unable to conclude that either Act contemplated that such an obligation to deal with the money which Mr Lui received as trust money would not arise, if Mr Lui received the money only as a stakeholder, providing no other legal services, as the Law Society argued. If that view were properly open it would seem to leave a large loophole in these legislative schemes. Solicitors whose only service in a particular transaction was that of stakeholder, would thereby be able to avoid entirely the obligations imposed by the Act as to how they are to deal with money which they receive, in the course of the practice. Thereby those with whom they deal would be deprived of the important protections established by this legislation. 
     
      
    82 Such an approach would appear inconsistent with what was contemplated by both Acts. In my view, the Court should be slow to come to such a construction of this important statutory scheme. 
     
      
    83 In any event, on the evidence in this case there can be no question that Mr Lui, a solicitor, came to have control of this money as the direct result of his position as a solicitor and his advice that the services Mr Li was to provide Mr Wang were legal. There was no evidence that Mr Lui was to hold the money as stakeholder, otherwise than in his capacity as a solicitor, to the contrary, that was why Mr Wang and Mr Lu were convinced to pay the money over. By the acknowledgment under which he received the money, Mr Lui was given power of control over it and its disposal. Mr Lui drafted the terms of the acknowledgement, which specified the basis on which the money was to be held. That also appears to have involved the provision of legal services, as did his advice that the work Mr Li was to undertake for Mr Wang, was legal. There can be no question that such services are services which a solicitor may provide in the course of legal practice. It follows that s 61 of the 1987 Act required Mr Lui to deal with that money as trust money.  
     
      
    84 There was some debate as to who Mr Lui’s services were provided to, it being accepted that the evidence was capable of showing that either Mr Li, or Mr Wang, or both of them, were clients of Mr Lui, although it was the case put for Mr Wang that Mr Li was, in reality, Mr Lui’s agent. 
     
      
    85 Mr Wang certainly claimed that he had received legal services from Mr Lui. That claim was supported by Mr Lu. Why they had such an understanding was apparent on the evidence. They were not prepared to entrust such a large sum of money to merely anyone, not even a migration agent, as Mr Li claimed to be. They understood that they were entrusting the money to Mr Lui, to be held in his capacity as a solicitor. That was the basis on which Mr Li and Mr Lui convinced them to pay the money, Mr Lui also having assured them as to the legality of the services which were being offered to Mr Wang.  
     
      
    86 In its case the Law Society relied upon Swart v Carr [2006] NSWSC 1302, where Palmer J had to consider the question of what evidenced whether a person is 'acting as a solicitor'. From his analysis of the authorities, his Honour concluded that: 
     
      
       
        
        85 From a consideration of these cases, I deduce the following propositions:  
         
          
           
          i) the capacity in which a solicitor has been acting is always a question of fact depending upon the particular circumstances of the case; 
           
           
          ii) one of the relevant circumstances is the antecedent relationship between the solicitor and the other party, if any, particularly if there is a history of an acknowledged solicitor/client relationship; 
           
           
          iii) a critical circumstance indicating that a solicitor has been acting in his or her capacity as a solicitor is that: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            – the solicitor has been acting pursuant to a contract, express or implied, under which the solicitor is to provide services; and 
             
             
            – the services to be provided under the contract include at least some services which require legal knowledge to perform; 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          iv) a material circumstance reinforcing (iii) is that there is an acknowledgement, express or implied, between the parties that the contract of engagement has been entered into wholly or partly because the provider of the services is a solicitor; 
           
           
          v) if a contract which qualifies under (iii) also requires services to be performed by the solicitor for which legal knowledge is not necessary but which are customarily performed by solicitors, those services too will be performed in the capacity of solicitor. 
           
           
          vi) if a contract with a solicitor for services requires the performance of duties which: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            – require no legal knowledge to perform; and 
             
             
            – are not within the range of services customarily provided by solicitors, 
            
           
          
         
         
        it would be unlikely that the solicitor has been engaged in his or capacity as a solicitor. 
        
       
       
      
    87 It was argued for Mr Wang that these tests were not relevant to determining the questions which arise under this statutory scheme. Nevertheless, even accepting the relevance of this approach, the evidence here was well capable of establishing that Mr Lui had agreed with both Mr Li and Mr Wang, to provide the services of stakeholder; that he drafted the terms on which he was so to act, plainly a service involving the exercise of some legal knowledge and that he also gave advice to Mr Wang, as to the legality of the service to be provided by Mr Li. That evidence is sufficient to meet his Honour’s tests. Even if Mr Lui’s agreement to act as a stakeholder had only been with Mr Li, that would have been sufficient.  
     
      
    88 The evidence established that it was only agreed that the service of stakeholder would be provided by Mr Lui, because he was a solicitor and was to hold the money on trust in that capacity. The acknowledgement, provided on Mr Lui’s letterhead and the circumstances in which that document came to be created, make these conclusions unavoidable. That evidence also brings the work within the definition of ‘legal services’ in s 4 of the 2004 Act, earlier quoted. 
     
      
    89 As the Law Society submitted, the terms of the acknowledgment drafted by Mr Lui undoubtedly favoured Mr Li’s position and sought to conceal Mr Lui’s involvement in the scheme. Instead of providing that Mr Lui, as stakeholder, would repay the money to Mr Wang, if the agreed work was not performed by Mr Li, the money was to be repaid by Mr Li. As was argued, of necessity, this meant that the money had to be released by Mr Lui to Mr Li, even if it had to be repaid because the agreed work had not been undertaken by Mr Li. There was, of course, never any intention for that work to be performed or the money to be returned, if the false visa was discovered. The release plainly assisted this criminal enterprise, rather than protecting Mr Wang’s position, by requiring Mr Lui to repay the money direct to Mr Wang, as one might ordinarily expect of a stakeholder. That thereby Mr Li and Mr Lui were assisted in duping Mr Wang, does not lead to the conclusion that Mr Lui was not acting in his capacity as a solicitor, in drafting the terms of the acknowledgement, agreeing to hold the money on trust as a stakeholder, or advising on the legality of the service which Mr Li was to provide.  
     
      
    90 As was argued for Mr Wang, given the underlying criminal enterprise in which Mr Li and Mr Lui were engaged, it is unlikely that Mr Lui drafted the terms of the acknowledgement to ensure that they faithfully reflected the true nature of the relationship between Mr Wang, Mr Li and Mr Lui. Rather, they were drafted to help conceal what Mr Li and Mr Lui intended.91 The 1987 Act obliged Mr Lui to deposit the money into his trust account to hold until the agreed work was performed. That work was never intended to be done. What actually happened to the money is entirely unknown. No doubt that was investigated by the Law Society. It led no evidence, but the inference is that Mr Lui never dealt with it as trust money. The money was certainly not recovered or repaid.  
     
      
    92 Mr Lui claimed, shortly after Mr Wang discovered that the visa was a forgery, only a few days after it was supplied, that he no longer had the money. That situation can only have occurred because the money was not dealt with in accordance with Mr Lui’s written acknowledgements as to the basis upon which he was to hold it, he being involved in the scheme to provide Mr Wang with a forged visa. The second acknowledgement contemplated that Mr Lui would hold $95,000 until the ‘agreed work’ was done. The written agreement described that work as obtaining a visa, a Medicare and tax file number and permanent residency after two years. The money entrusted to Mr Lui was not dealt with in accordance with the agreed terms. Mr Li and Mr Lui set out to dupe Mr Wang. They succeeded. 
     
      
       
      Was there any relevant default by Mr Lui? 
       
      
    93 It was also argued by the Law Society that there was no relevant default in relation to the moneys held by Mr Lui.  
     
      
    94 Given Mr Lui’s obvious involvement in the scheme whereby a forged visa was supplied to Mr Wang, that he dealt dishonestly with the money entrusted to him in the course of his solicitor’s practice, as a stakeholder, on terms other than those agreed, is not arguable. The entire purpose of this scheme was to defraud Mr Wang of $130,000.  
     
      
    95 As I have earlier noted, Mr Lui acknowledged that he was to hold the money on trust until specified work was performed. That work, which included the provision of a valid visa, also contemplated other things being achieved, for example by May 2004, a Medicare card being obtained and a tax file number. Any fair reading of the agreement whereby this work was specified, can only mean that it was work to be performed by Mr Li.  
     
      
    96 The evidence can only leave open the conclusion that there was never any intention to perform the promised work and that Mr Lui dealt fraudulently with the money he received, in the course of his practice as a solicitor, as had been intended from the outset. That was the purpose of Mr Li and Mr Lui’s scheme. 
     
      
    97 On any view that conduct amounted to a default, in the statutory sense. 
     
      
    Should Mr Wang have known of the illegality? 
     
      
    98 That the overall purpose of Mr Li and Mr Lui’s scheme was illegal, does not mean that all of its elements were illegal, as I have explained. Mr Lui’s involvement was to provide an entirely legal service, that of stakeholder. He also advised Mr Wang as to the legality of what Mr Li promised he could do. On that basis, strictly, the question of illegality does not arise. I turn however, to consider the issue as argued by the Law Society, if I be wrong in that approach. 
     
      
    99 In terms of s 80(4)(d), should Mr Wang have known: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ... that the conduct of the transaction with the solicitor was illegal, and the person who made the claim knew or ought reasonably to have known of that illegality? 
         
        
       
      
    100 The evidence revealed Mr Wang’s vulnerable position. He was in Australia illegally, having remained here without a valid visa since 1996. Clearly Mr Li’s offer of the opportunity of obtaining a permanent visa was made in circumstances where Mr Wang had suspicions. He had only paid $1,000 in 1998, when he had unsuccessfully made an earlier application for a visa, with the assistance of another migration agent. That process had taken about a year. Mr Lu, who had not had any experience of applying for a visa since he had assisted Mr Wang obtain a business visa in 1996, nevertheless rightly shared his concerns. He himself had to borrow money, in order to loan the $130,000 to Mr Wang.  
     
      
    101 Mr Li and Mr Lui’s scheme was designed to allay those concerns, by utilising Mr Lui’s position as a solicitor. Mr Wang was told they worked together. He and Mr Lu met with Mr Lui and Mr Li at Mr Lui's offices where they did appear to work together. Not only did Mr Lui’s letterhead indicate that he was a solicitor, but also that he was a migration agent. Had Mr Wang made enquiries, he would have learned that the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) contemplated that Mr Lui, a solicitor, could offer migration legal assistance (s 277). The provision of migration services could have been lawfully provided by Mr Li, if he was a registered migration agent (s 276). The evidence did not explore whether he had such registration, but Mr Li told Mr Wang that he worked together with Mr Lui and Mr Lui advised that the services Mr Li was to provide, were legal.  
     
      
    102 The question which thus arises for determination is whether Mr Wang ought reasonably to have known that Mr Lui, a practicing solicitor in this State, would be engaged in a criminal enterprise, in which he wrongly advised that the service which Mr Li was offering at a cost of $130,000 was legal and that the service he agreed to provide, that of stakeholder, itself an unarguably legal service for a solicitor to provide, was but part of a scheme to defraud him. 
     
      
    103 While $130,000 was no doubt a very large sum for Mr Wang to pay for a permanent resident visa, it is not a sum large enough, one would think, to tempt a solicitor practising in this State, to become involved in a scheme which would risk his reputation, his practising certificate, his livelihood and a criminal conviction. That was certainly Mr Lu’s reasoning. He was an experienced businessman, used to dealing with lawyers in Australia. Mr Wang was not, having worked as a gyprocker while living illegally in Australia. Ought he reasonably have come to some different conclusion? 
     
      
    104 I am satisfied that Mr Wang’s evidence, that he never expected to receive a false visa, must be accepted. It was Mr Lui’s involvement, his advice as to the legality of what was being offered and he agreeing, as a solicitor, to hold the money on trust until Mr Li had done the work necessary to obtain the promised visa, which reasonably provided Mr Wang with the necessary confidence that he was not being involved in an illegal exercise.  
     
      
    105 The evidence cannot properly lead to the conclusion that Mr Wang ought reasonably to have known of the illegality in which Mr Lui was involved. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    106 For the reasons given, I order that: 
     
      
       
      1. The appeal be upheld. 
       
        
       
      2. The Law Society pay Mr Wang $130,000 plus interest from the Fidelity Fund. 
       
        
       
      3. The Law Society pay Mr Wang’s costs of the proceedings.

     Brendan SPROATES v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 BLANCH J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    3 KIRBY J: Application is made by Brendan Sproates for leave to appeal against his sentence. Mr Sproates surrendered himself to the Moruya Police Station on 3 July 2006 and was arrested. He acknowledged his involvement in a shooting at the Wests Leagues Club, Unanderra, in the early hours of 2 July 2006, when a patron of the club, Shane Staff, received serious injuries. 
     
      
    4 Mr Sproates was charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm (contrary to s 33 Crimes Act 1900) (maximum penalty: 25 years imprisonment with a standard non parole period of 7 years). He pleaded guilty. On 3 April 2008, Conlon DCJ sentenced Mr Sproates to imprisonment for 12 years, consisting of a non parole period of 8 years (3.7.06 to 2.7.14) and an additional term of 4 years (3.7.14 to 2.7.18). 
     
      
    5 Before setting out the grounds of appeal, I should describe the circumstances in which the offence was committed and the serious consequences for the victim. 
     
      
      The incident. 
       
      
    6 A number of documents were tendered at the sentencing hearing, relevant to the way in which the incident occurred. There was an agreed statement of facts, as well as the record of interview conducted by the police with Mr Sproates the day after the incident. The account provided by Mr Sproates in that interview was incomplete and, in a number of respects, plainly wrong. The remarks of the sentencing Judge largely incorporated the statement of facts. 
     
      
    7 Both the victim and Mr Sproates attended the Wests Leagues Club on the evening of 1 July 2006. The victim was alone. Mr Sproates was with his two sisters, celebrating his birthday, which was the next day. He was about to turn 25 years old. Mr Staff was a few years older. They did not know each other. Shortly after 3.00am an incident occurred in which two male patrons began fighting. His Honour described what then took place, in these words: (ROS1/2) 
     
      
       
        
         “ ... The altercation was diffused by security personnel. The offender was nearby when that altercation took place but was not directly involved. The offender became agitated and remonstrated with security personnel at which time he was heard to say, ‘Blokes like you deserve a bullet in the head’, and ‘They were being racist, I’m going to put a bullet in your head’. These comments were made towards one of the males involved in the altercation. The victim, Shane Staff, was also in the area at the time of the altercation but was not involved. The offender was directed by security personnel to leave the premises, he initially ignored the direction and returned to the company of a male friend. Security personnel escorted the offender and the friend from the premises. As the offender and his friend were being escorted through the foyer of the premises toward the front door, the offender continued to argue with and goad security personnel. ... ” 
        
       
      
    8 There followed the first interaction between Mr Sproates and the victim, Mr Staff. His Honour said this: (ROS 2) 
     
      
       
        
        “ ... As they walked past the entrance to the poker machine area Shane Staff approached the offender and said words to the effect of ‘Fucking leave him alone, he’s a mate leave him alone’. This comment related to the offender arguing with security personnel. ... ” 
        
       
      
    9 His Honour described what followed: (ROS 2) 
     
      
       
        
        “ ... Shane Staff walked to the foyer of the premises, used a telephone and requested a taxi. 
        
       
       
        
        The man, Staff, exited the premises via the front doors, walked across the driveway outside and sat down on a bench seat. As the offender was escorted through the foyer he received a call on his mobile phone, he was heard to say, ‘You’re out the front, yeah, no worries I’m coming out now’. Upon leaving the club the offender drew a black coloured pistol from the waistband of his pants and approached Staff who was still sitting on the bench seat. A verbal altercation took place between Sproates and Shane Staff and the offender pointed the pistol at him. The man Staff pushed the offender’s hand that was holding the gun away from him. The offender and his friend walked off into the carpark to a maroon Mitsubishi Magna ... that was being driven by another male friend. ... ” 
        
       
      
    10 The events culminating in the shooting were described in these words: (ROS 2/3) 
     
      
       
        
        “ ... Staff stood up and followed the offender. Staff waved his hands in the air and looked towards the security personnel at the front doors of the club. Staff then turned and walked towards the vehicle. Staff yelled words to the effect of, ‘If you’re going to shoot me then shoot me’. While saying this he had his hands outstretched from his body. The offender walked to that vehicle, ... turned and pointed the pistol towards Staff and fired at least one shot in Staff’s direction. Staff yelled, ‘You fuckwit’, and continued to walk towards the offender. The offender fired at least two further shots in the direction of Staff one of which struck Staff in the abdomen causing him to fall to the ground. The offender entered the front passenger seat of the vehicle which was being driven by the male friend.” 
        
       
      
    11 Mr Sproates was driven home by his friend. After he had been dropped off, the vehicle was stopped by the police, because of the manner in which it was being driven. The police had meanwhile identified the vehicle as having been involved in the shooting. It was therefore searched and a .22 calibre bullet casing was found. Later the police also located a further two .22 calibre cartridges at the carpark, as well as two unfired .22 calibre bullets. Mr Sproates, when interviewed, told the police that, on the journey home, he had thrown the weapon away, although he could not remember where (Q 309-310). 
     
      
    12 There were surveillance cameras at the club. His Honour described still photographs taken from the footage, and tendered in evidence, in these words: (ROS 4/5) 
     
      
       
        
        “The last five photographs in exhibit B were taken via CCTV and they showed the offender leaving the club with an associate. The last of those photographs shows the offender outside the club with gun in hand, arm outstretched, obviously pointing it at the victim.” 
        
       
       
      Injuries to the victim. 
       
      
    13 The consequences for Mr Staff were severe. He was taken by ambulance to the Wollongong hospital and admitted to the Intensive Care ward. A bullet had entered the left side of his abdomen near the junction of the chest and the abdomen. It passed downwards to the right and through the left side of the liver, the stomach and the pancreas. It stopped to the right of the spine, in the pancreas. 
     
      
    14 Emergency surgery was then undertaken to stop the internal bleeding. An exploratory laparotomy was performed and various organs repaired. However, the abdominal bleeding continued, so that a second exploratory laparotomy was undertaken the same day. Dr Michael Talbot, one of the surgeons, said this: (Report 16.4.07) 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Staff has certainly been very lucky to have got over his significant injuries. When I performed my operation on him to help control some of his bleeding, virtually every injury had been repaired but it was obvious that he had an injury to his abdominal wall, the left side of his liver, his stomach, his pancreas and some of his large abdominal vessels. It was only due to a fair dose of luck and extremely hard work by Dr Malouf that he is still alive I suspect.” 
        
       
      
    15 Although Mr Staff survived, the consequences for him have been immense. They were described in his Victim’s Impact Statement in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        “Details of personal harm suffered as a direct result of the offence: 
        
       
       
        
        Lost house, 
        
       
       
        
        Lost job (I was working in the mines on a good wage and am now on Social Security benefits supporting my partner and a 2½ year old son). 
        
       
       
        
        Lost good health, had had 17 major operations (chest, Internal Organs, Lost Gall Bladder & follow up operations on these). 
        
       
       
        
        Relationship with partner, son, family members and friends have all been affected. 
        
       
       
        
        There are new medical problems arising almost on a weekly basis. I have just undergone another two operations recently (in the space of a month) and am facing the possibility of further extensive and risky surgery. 
        
       
       
        
        I had to learn to walk again after hospitalisation and the 17 major operations, I lost 26 kilograms in weight and gaining weight is an ongoing problem. 
        
       
       
        
        I returned to the gym to build myself up, but because of the operations I have had to give that up and I don’t know if I will ever work again. This in turn puts more strain on my relationship. 
        
       
       
        
        I have been told by professionals that I experience many of the symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in that I experience nightmares of the original incident and my many hospital stays. 
        
       
       
        
        I experience social isolation and have fears about public places and public transport. 
        
       
       
        
        My sleep pattern has been disturbed since the incident. 
        
       
       
        
        I am in constant pain i.e. lower back pain, pain in the abdomen, chest and many other areas of my body. 
        
       
       
        
        The impact of this incident has had a strong impact on my 2½ year old son. My son lost all speech after the incident seeing me in hospital so ill. 
        
       
       
        
        I am now back driving my car and driving myself to the various appointments instead of depending on other family members and trying to get my life back on track and be as normal as possible given the circumstances.” 
        
       
       
      The Notice of Appeal. 
       
      
    16 The notice of appeal contained the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1: 
         The sentencing judge failed to assess properly the objective seriousness of the offending. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 2:  
        The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the significance of the applicant’s drug and alcohol addiction, and its influence on his conduct at the time of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 3:  
        His Honour gave inadequate weight to the applicant’s subjective case.” 
        
       
      
    17 I will consider each ground in turn. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The sentencing judge failed to assess properly the objective seriousness of the offending. 
       
      
    18 The first ground may be dealt with briefly. The remarks on sentence deal with a number of issues. Counsel for the applicant closely analysed the sequence of issues and the structure of his Honour’s remarks. At one point his Honour dealt with matters of aggravation and matters of mitigation (s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) (“the Act”) (ROS 6/7). His Honour introduced the next issue with the following words: (ROS 7) 
     
     “I now turn to the subjective matters in respect of the offender ... ” 
     
     
      
    19 His Honour thereafter dealt with the subjective matters, including the report of Ms Katie Seidler, a clinical and forensic psychologist. Ms Seidler’s report described in some detail Mr Sproates’ background, his drug taking and abuse of alcohol. She also dealt with issues relevant to the offence, including the circumstances in which Mr Sproates came to be in possession of the firearm which he used that evening. In that context, his Honour interpolated evidence relevant to that issue, saying this: (ROS 10/11) 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender gave evidence in these proceedings. He referred to the incident in the hotel where he and his brother were attending a pool competition, this is the incident well before the present offence. He said that they were attacked by a group of about ten persons, he said he and his brother sustained injuries including bruising to the face area. He said this occurred about twelve months before the present offence and thereafter he said, ‘I didn’t feel the same, I felt down, I didn’t go out that much after that’. He said that when he went out thereafter he was armed with the hand gun. He said he came into possession of that gun about eighteen months before the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        On the night of the offence he said he had been drinking fairly steadily, drinking schooners and Sambucas. He said he was not falling down drunk but he did not have a full memory of the evening. He said his use of ice made him paranoid and edgy, it would make him think that something was going to happen to him. He said he could not remember holding the gun out as shown in the last photograph in exhibit B and he could not remember the victim slapping the gun away.” 
        
       
      
    20 It was said on behalf of the applicant that this was an aspect relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence and yet was “dealt with as if it were itself a subjective matter”. 
     
      
    21 However, I am not persuaded that it is reasonable to read his Honour’s remarks in this way, when they are taken as a whole. To do so is to read altogether too much into the structure of the remarks. Ms Seidler dealt with a number of things, some relevant to the offence and others to the offender. In the context of her report, which his Honour quoted at length, he interpolated other evidence relating to the acquisition of the gun. He did so as a matter of convenience, gathering together Ms Seidler’s comment on the issue and his own. But the subject matter was plainly connected to the offence and was not a subjective matter as his Honour well understood. 
     
      
    22 I believe there is no substance in Ground 1. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: His Honour’s assessment of intoxication and its significance. 
       
      
    23 It is convenient to repeat the formulation in the notice of appeal of the error said to have been made by the sentencing Judge. Ground 2, as expressed, was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the significance of the applicant’s drug and alcohol addiction, and its influence on his conduct at the time of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    24 Attention was drawn to R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, where the Court emphasised that in characterising the objective gravity of the offence, the conduct of the offender and his state of mind are both important ([85]). The Court added: (at 186/7) 
     
      
       
        
        “[86] Some of the relevant circumstances which can be said ‘objectively’ to affect the ‘seriousness’ of the offence will be personal to the offender at the time of the offence but become relevant because of their causal connection with its commission. This would extend to matters of motivation (for example duress, provocation, robbery to feed a drug addiction), mental state (for example, intention is more serious than recklessness), and mental illness, or intellectual disability, where that is causally related to the commission of the offence, in so far as the offender’s capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act, or to exercise appropriate powers of control has been affected:  
        Channon v The Queen 
         (1978) 33 FLR 433 and  
        R v Engert 
         (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. Such matters can be classified as circumstances of the offence and not merely circumstances of the offender that might go to the appropriate level of punishment. Other matters which may be said to explain or influence the conduct of the offender or otherwise impinge on her or his moral culpability, for example, youth or prior sexual abuse, are more accurately described as circumstances of the offender and not the offence.” 
        
       
      
    25 Here, counsel for the applicant, appearing at the sentencing hearing before Conlon DCJ, made the submission that it was a matter of mitigation that the offence was not planned (cf s 21A(3)(b) of the Act). His Honour responded to that submission with these words: (ROS 6) 
     
      
       
        
        “ ... I am of the view little weight can be attributed to this factor as the evidence was that the offender went to the club armed and had been carrying a gun in public for some time. ... ” 
        
       
      
    26 It was conceded on this appeal that such a finding may well be legitimate (App’s submission p5 [11]). Counsel for the applicant, however, added these words:  
     
      
       
        
        “[11] However, it is not then logical to consider elsewhere in the remarks, as a ‘purely subjective’ matter, the reasons why the applicant carried a gun, a subject about which the applicant gave a compelling account in evidence and which can be taken to have been accepted by his Honour in his consideration of the ‘subjective case’.” 
        
       
      
    27 That submission repeats the argument in Ground 1, that his Honour dealt with this material as relevant to the subjective case. For the reasons given, I do not accept that submission. I believe his Honour was conscious of the importance of the applicant’s state of mind in assessing the gravity of the offence and appreciated the relevance to that issue of his intoxication and the circumstances in which he was said to have come into possession of the gun. In the context of Ground 3 below, I will consider the significance of the applicant’s drug and alcohol addiction. 
     
      
    28 I would dismiss Ground 2. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: 
        
      His Honour gave inadequate weight to the applicant’s subjective case. 
       
      
    29 In dealing with this ground, I should first summarise the subjective case presented on behalf of the applicant. Mr Sproates gave evidence, as did his mother. A report was tendered from the Probation and Parole Service and another from Ms Seidler, the psychologist. 
     
      
    30 Mr Sproates is Aboriginal. He is one of seven children. Both parents were heavy drinkers and he was brought up in an atmosphere of domestic violence. His parents separated when he was about eleven years old. He went to live with his father for a time. However, he caught chicken pox after nine months. Without reference to him, his father determined that he should be returned to his mother. He remained angry at his father thereafter and did not speak to him for eight years. His relationship with his father, incidentally, has since been repaired and is regarded as important. The Probation and Parole report said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Both parents confirmed the offender’s restored relationship with his father, and concurred with the offender’s view that the support of his father is pivotal to his success when released from custody.” 
        
       
      
    31 Mrs Sproates was still drinking alcohol to excess when her son returned to live with her. She acknowledged in her evidence that her parenting left something to be desired (T 24: 19.3.08). The family lived in poverty. 
     
      
    32 Mr Sproates left school in Year 10 without having completed that year. He enrolled in several TAFE courses, one in welding and another in Aboriginal arts and culture, but failed to complete either. The Probation and Parole report described his life after he left school in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ ... [he] descended into a lifestyle characterised by chaos, drug abuse and associations with other disconnected young people. Conflict fuelled by substance abuse seemed to be a recurring theme throughout Mr Sproates life involving his family and associates. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender said that these lifestyle issues seriously impeded his ability to secure and maintain stable employment. As a result, the offender said, he has a poor employment history, apart from short term sporadic labouring positions.” 
        
       
      
    33 The applicant began using cannabis at the age of 13 years. He rapidly became a heavy and habitual user. At the same time he drank alcohol to excess. As he got older he experimented with other drugs. The Probation and Parole report included these words: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the six months leading up to the offences currently before the Court, Mr Sproates said he was regularly smoking crystal methamphetamine in cannabis to the extent of approximately $200 to $300 worth between Wednesday and Sunday of each week. In addition to his illicit drug use, he said, the offender drank alcohol heavily in company with his friends, to the extent of approximately one carton each on each occasion. At this point, Mr Sproates said, he was abusing illicit drugs and alcohol to the full extent to which his means would allow.” 
        
       
      
    34 Mr Sproates’ family noticed the effect upon him, which the Probation and Parole report described as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender’s family members described the offender’s violent offence as uncharacteristic of him, however had noticed changes in him in the months leading up to the offences, particularly if drugs were unavailable to him, when he would become withdrawn and aggressive. 
        
       
       
        
        When asked about this, Mr Sproates said that he was inclined to be volatile when he was withdrawing from cannabis more so than other substances. Having been drug free since coming into custody, he said, he has found himself able to sleep and function at a level unfamiliar to him for several years, and is resolved to avoid relapse at all costs.” 
        
       
      
    35 The applicant’s mother, when giving evidence before the sentencing Judge, said that in the period leading up to the shooting she had noticed changes in her son, which she associated with drugs (T 25). She said that her son was not aggressive, but she could tell that he was angry (T 25). The account given by Mr Sproates to Ms Seidler concerning his alcohol consumption and drug taking was broadly the same (Ms Seidler [20]-[25]).  
     
      
    36 Ms Seidler performed various tests and ultimately assessed Mr Sproates as a young man functioning below the average range intellectually. She believed that he suffered from depression and anxiety as a result of a fight some years earlier. She said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “[28]  
        Psychological Assessment: 
         Mr Sproates reported that around the age of 23 years, he and his brother were physically assaulted in a bar fight. Although he was not seriously injured in this incident, Mr Sproates claimed that he became depressed and despondent afterwards, in addition to experiencing elevated levels of anxiety about his personal safety and the motives of others. He stated that this precipitated his being in possession of a firearm after that time. In the context of this alleged depression, Mr Sproates endorsed symptoms of low mood, lethargy, hypersomnia, social withdrawal and reduced appetite. He stated that these symptoms persisted for some time, as a result of which Mr Sproates increased his drug use ... “ 
        
       
      
    37 His Honour described Mr Sproates’ criminal record as “not extensive”. In 2003, he was ordered to perform community service as a result of obtaining money by deception. Following a breach, the order was converted to a term of periodic detention for six months. In 2004, Mr Sproates was convicted of cultivate prohibited plant, possess prohibited drug and goods in custody. He was placed on a s 9 bond to be of good behaviour for eighteen months. 
     
      
    38 His Honour accepted that Mr Sproates was remorseful (ROS 10). He had handed himself in to the police. He said he was shocked by what he had done. His mother said that he asked to see the Victim Impact Statement and would frequently ask how Mr Staff was (T 26) (ROS 12). 
     
      
    39 Once in custody, Mr Sproates had been placed in protection because of threats made against him. His Honour considered the circumstances of incarceration and concluded the protection “will have a very limited impact” on what he considered the appropriate penalty (ROS 12). He allowed a 25 percent discount for an early plea of guilty. His Honour found special circumstances to assist in Mr Sproates’ rehabilitation and because it was his first time in custody. 
     
      
    40 His Honour did not expressly deal with the issue of rehabilitation, although it may be accepted that Mr Sproates’ prospects were reasonable. He appeared to have insight into the adverse effect upon him of drugs and alcohol. He had resolved to avoid both upon release (Ms Seidler [25]). The Probation and Parole Service said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Sproates is a young man who, having participated in the unfettered abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs from an early age, found himself in a situation in which he was highly intoxicated, paranoid, in possession of a firearm, and in a situation of conflict. 
        
       
       
        
        Having come to an understanding of these factors, Mr Sproates found it unsurprising that the events of the evening unfolded as they did. He took full responsibility for the offences in terms of his level of intoxication, drug use and resultant paranoia, and having possession of the firearm. 
        
       
       
        
        Having been entirely frank and straightforward throughout the interview process, Mr Sproates concluded that his ability to recover a law abiding lifestyle and healthy relationships with his family lies in his ability to remain abstinent from alcohol and illicit drugs. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender’s family were united in their support of the offender, and were similarly united in their condemnation of his drug use and previous lifestyle.” 
        
       
      
    41 Counsel for the applicant, on this appeal, described the subjective case as “compelling”. The maximum penalty was 25 years. His Honour’s starting point, to reach an aggregate sentence of 12 years (allowing a 25 percent discount for the plea of guilty), was 16 years. In these circumstances, the following submission was made: (Applicant’s subs [20]) 
     
      
       
        
        “[20] If proper weight was given to these matters it is difficult to see how it could be that, at the last point before reduction for the utilitarian value of the plea, the head sentence was 16 years.” 
        
       
      
    42 The Crown responded by submitting that the subjective case was “not particularly compelling”. There was no reason to believe that his Honour overlooked any aspect of it. He had placed the offence “towards the upper end of the range, just short of the worst category” (ROS 7). The subjective material operated to ameliorate the sentence that might otherwise have been imposed. 
     
      
    43 Further, the Crown drew attention to the structure of s 33, where the maximum penalty was 25 years with a standard non parole period of 7 years. Commenting upon that section, McClellan CJ at CL in Anderson v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 211, said this: (at [17]) 
     
      
       
        
        “By providing a standard non-parole period of 7 years but a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment it is apparent that the Legislature had in mind that for offences falling above the middle range the penalty should increase by a greater amount for increasing degrees of seriousness than is the case for offences falling below the middle range. By this structure the Legislature has indicated that the punishment for offences at the higher end of the range of seriousness must be proportionately greater when compared with the maximum penalty than offences falling toward the lower end of the range.” 
        
       
      
    44 Dealing with these submissions, it may be accepted that there was a strong subjective case. The evidence was set out at length in his Honour’s remarks. There is no reason to doubt that the subjective case was carefully considered. However, the subjective case had to be evaluated in the context of the offending conduct and the consequences for the victim. 
     
      
    45 Mr Sproates gave evidence before the sentencing Judge that he had set out for the club, with his sisters, at about 7.00 or 8.00pm. He had taken the drug “ice” beforehand. He said this: (T 12: 19.3.08) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. How long before you went out had you used the ice that evening? 
         
        A. Through that day and that afternoon.’ 
        
       
      
    46 He was then asked the following: (T 12/13) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. How does ice make you feel Mr Sproates? 
         
        A. Paranoid really. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. On this evening were you paranoid? 
         
        A. Just edgy. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say you’re paranoid what are you paranoid about? 
         
        A. Just like, just getting into fights, things like that, that’s about it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Getting in a fight? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q: What, that is if you’re affected you’d be inclined to involve yourself in a fight more easily because you’re affected by it, is that what you mean? 
         
        A. No, that’s not what I mean, I just want to stay out of trouble. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well your counsel asked you how did it make you feel and you said, ‘paranoid or edgy’? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        O’REILLY: Q: So do you think something is going to happen to you when you’re on ice? 
         
        A. Yeah.” 
        
       
      
    47 Once at the club, Mr Sproates drank schooners and one or two Sambucas (T 12). He went home at midnight to get more money so that he could continue drinking (T 11). He then returned to the club. The incident occurred shortly after 3.00am. When interviewed by the police the day after the shooting, Mr Sproates said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “A161 Yeah, I was bloody pretty pissed. 
        
       
       
        
        Q162 All right. On a scale of things, how would, when you say you were pretty pissed, how, how pissed would you say you were? 
         
        A Like, I don’t know what bloody, the Sambucas too, because, I don’t know, bloody, I can still walk straight and stuff but I’m just bloody pissed ... “  
        
       
      
    48 In the same interview, Mr Sproates was asked about the gun. He said that when he took it from home it was already loaded (Q66). He was then asked the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q68 All right. Whereabouts had you got the gun from? 
         
        A Don’t wanna – that I can’t answer. 
        
       
       
        
        Q69 Why is that? 
         
        A I just don’t want to say. 
        
       
       
        
        Q70 OK. When had you got the gun? 
         
        A Probably, it’s been a fair while actually. 
        
       
       
        
        Q71 So, are we talking weeks or days or - ? 
         
        A Probably a couple of years. 
        
       
       
        
        Q72 So, what was the purpose in having that gun on you last night, sorry, night before last? 
         
        A Protection. 
        
       
       
        
        Q73 Have you been carrying it for protection for some time? 
         
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q74 And protection against whom? 
         
        A I’m not quire sure who they are. Bloody me and me brother got bashed at the Unanderra Pub about nearly a, I don’t know, might have been probably nearly, yeah, probably two years now, and ever since that then whoever, because I, I was really pissed that night too and I wasn’t really sure who they, like, who they was and that and them same people have been hassling me ever since. 
        
       
       
        
        Q75 Who are these people? 
         
        A There’s only one, one bloke I, like, sort of recognise and that from the pub and that was, I don’t know, I just know his first name’s Steve.” 
        
       
      
    49 Mr Sproates said that as a result of the fight he had bruising. He did not seek medical attention (Q 85). Nor did he report it to the police (Q 83). 
     
      
    50 Having been arrested and placed in custody, Mr Sproates was interviewed by the Probation and Parole Service for the purposes of preparing their report (dated 14 September 2007). The report included a somewhat different account in relation to the gun: (p 4) 
     
      
       
        
        “When asked how he came to be in possession of the firearm, Mr Sproates said that he obtained it from a criminal associate approximately two years previously for self protection at a time when he was fearful of his safety. When asked to explain what he was thinking about at the time, Mr Sproates said he had developed enemies through his participation in the drug sub-culture when previously residing in the area, and he obtained the firearm at a time when his drug related paranoia was escalating. 
        
       
       
        
        As his poly drug abuse became more entrenched, Mr Sproates said, he became increasingly paranoid about his safety and formed the habit of carrying his firearm with him on most occasions when he left his residence.” 
        
       
      
    51 The report continued: (p 4) 
     
      
       
        
        “When asked what he had thought about since his arrest, Mr Sproates said that he found his current predicament to be an unsurprising culmination of criminal associations, rampant substance abuse and drug related paranoia.” 
        
       
      
    52 His Honour found that the offence had been aggravated by the fact that a gun had been used (s 21A(2)(c)). He also found it involved a grave risk of death (s 21A(2)(ib)). The offence was the more serious because of the devastating consequences for the victim. In R v Mitchell & Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296, Howie J said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “[27] A very important aspect of an offence under s 33 is the result of the offender’s conduct. The nature of the injury caused to the victim will to a very significant degree determine the seriousness of the offence and the appropriate sentence. This is not to underestimate the intent component of the offence, after all that is the element that makes the offender liable to a maximum penalty of 25 years as opposed to 7 years for a s 35 offence. But there is less scope for variation in the nature of the intention to do grievous bodily harm when determining the seriousness of a particular instance of the offence than there is for variation in the nature of the injury inflicted. It should be borne in mind that, if the victim had died, the respondents would have faced a charge of murder. The injury suffered by the victim was, as her Honour noted, little short of death.” 
        
       
      
    53 Counsel for the applicant acknowledged the difficulty in relying upon drugs or alcohol as a matter in mitigation, referring to R v Coleman (1990) 47 A Crim R 306, per Hunt J at 327 and R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at 397/8, [273]-[274]. In R v Coleman, Hunt J said this: (at 327 )  
     
      
       
        
        “ ... The degree of deliberation shown by an offender is usually a matter to be taken into account; such intoxication would therefore be relevant in determining the degree of deliberation involved in the offender’s breach of the law. In some circumstances, it may aggravate the crime because of the recklessness with which the offender became intoxicated; in other circumstances, it may mitigate the crime because the offender has by reason of that intoxication acted out of character. (I have not intended by those examples to limit the extent to which intoxication may be taken into account; see, generally,  
        Sewell and Walsh  
        (1981) 29 SASR 12 at 14-15; 5 A Crim R 204 at 207.) Where the reason for the offender’s intoxication is a self-administered drug rather than alcohol, the cases suggest that that fact may well be more likely to aggravate than to mitigate. 
        
       
       
        
        But that is not this case. The only evidence is that the appellant had been an alcoholic over a long period of time. At the same time, however, it is clear from the appellant’s record and from the medical evidence led that the violence which he exhibited on this occasion was sadly not out of character. In all of those circumstances, in reassessing the appropriate sentence to be imposed I would not place much weight upon the appellant’s intoxication in mitigation, but I would not take into account in aggravation.” 
        
       
      
    54 The applicant asserted, in submissions, that the circumstances which led Mr Sproates to carry a gun, in combination with the drug ice which made him “paranoid and edgy”, affected his culpability such that there had been error. I disagree. Even accepting, as his Honour did, the explanation in respect of the gun, it did not operate to mitigate significantly the offence. Mr Sproates had gone to the club with a loaded gun in his waistband. The gun was capable of firing multiple bullets. He had a long history of drinking to excess. He ingested drugs during the course of the evening, which he knew made him paranoid and edgy. When involved in an altercation inside the club, he made threatening remarks on two occasions suggesting that those with whom he disagreed “needed a bullet in their heads”. After his exchange of words with Mr Staff, he had approached the victim outside the club when he was sitting on a bench waiting for a taxi. He had withdrawn a loaded pistol from his waistband and pointed it at Mr Staff when at close range. Ultimately, having returned to his friend’s car, he had fired not one, but three bullets, one of which struck the victim. Whilst it was incautious of the victim to follow him and engage with him, his Honour found, appropriately, that there had not been provocation in law. No doubt the three shots represented an escalation in the level of his aggression exhibited that evening, but they cannot be considered to have been out of character. Objectively, the offence remained very serious, as characterised by his Honour. 
     
      
    55 Returning to the asserted error in Ground 3, his Honour did not, in my view, give inadequate weight to the applicant’s subjective case. 
     
      
    56 I would dismiss Ground 3. 
     
      
       
      Order. 
       
      
    57 The orders I propose are that: 
     
      
       
      1. leave to appeal be granted; and 
       
       
      2. the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him following his conviction by a jury in the District Court. There is no appeal against those convictions.  
     
      
    2 The indictment upon which he was convicted contained four counts. In respect of the first two counts, each of which involved an offence of take and drive a conveyance, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 2 years imprisonment to commence on 2 March 2006 and to expire on 1 March 2008. Those sentences were ordered to be served concurrently with each other. In respect of the fourth count, which was an offence of malicious damage, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment to commence on 2 March 2006 and to expire on 1 March 2009. The maximum penalty for each of those three offences is 5 years imprisonment. In respect of count 3, an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal which was committed in company, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 years imprisonment with a total term of 8 years imprisonment. Those terms were each fixed to commence on 2 March 2007. The non-parole period will thus expire on 1 March 2013 at which time the applicant will be eligible for parole. The total term will expire on 1 March 2015. The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years applies. Two other counts of malicious damage, which appeared on a s166 certificate, each attracted a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment to commence on 2 March 2006. The total effective non-parole period is thus one of 7 years whilst the total term is one of 9 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 The sentencing judge made a number of factual findings for the purpose of sentencing the applicant. As there is no challenge to those findings, it is possible to briefly sketch the background to these offences. 
     
      
    4 A tabletop truck belonging to QIK Transport Pty Limited was stolen from Berkeley Vale depot on the Central Coast some time after close of business on 5 August 2004. The truck was subsequently located the following day behind the Caltex Service Station at Chittaway Bay. Located in the truck were two hard hats, a knife and a glove. None of these items had been in the truck prior to its being stolen (count 1). The truck sustained damage amounting to $1300 (that damage gave rise to the first of the two matters on the s 166 Certificate). 
     
      
    5 On 6 August 2004 a bobcat was stolen from premises at Kooindah Waters. The doors of the truck belonging to QIK Transport were then used as a ramp in order to load the forklift. The doors were later discovered at the premises (Count 2). The damage to the bobcat and the cost of repairs to it totalled $800 (that damage and cost of repairs gave rise to the second matter on the s 166 Certificate). 
     
      
    6 At 4.50 am on 6 August 2004 two men arrived at premises within a shopping centre known as Homemakers Super Centre at Tuggerah in a tabletop truck. The incident was recorded by CCTV. The registration number of the truck was observed and it was established that it belonged to QIK Transport. The bobcat referred to in count 2 was on the back of the truck. The two men then unloaded the bobcat. They were then seen to put on hard hats. One of the men got into the bobcat and drove it through the glass doors of the premises. The other male followed the bobcat into the premises. The bobcat was then used to remove the ATM from the floor of the building. It was carried outside and placed on the truck. The men departed in the truck but left the bobcat at the premises. The ATM was ultimately located by police on 18 August in a paddock at Somersby. It had been cut open and the contents removed. The ATM was valued at $9000 and an alarm (presumably damaged) was valued at $2000. There was $44,340 in the ATM at the time it was stolen. None of that money has been recovered (Count 3). 
     
      
    7 As a result of the incident, the glass doors and entryway to the Super Centre were damaged. The offenders had ruptured the hydraulics to the bobcat and as a result hydraulic fluid had been spilt throughout the centre. A number of tables and chairs in the food court area had been crushed. The offenders had also run into gyprock walls and the large palm trees that had been in the centre had been moved. One palm tree had been damaged to such an extent that it had to be removed completely. Pavers and a downpipe which were outside the entry to the Super Centre were also damaged. The total cost of the damage was estimated to be almost $30,000 (count 4). 
     
      
    8 DNA samples were recovered from the band within the hard hat which was left in the truck and from the left hand lever of the bobcat. The samples were compared to hair samples taken from the applicant. DNA evidence led at the trial linked the applicant to the offences. 
     
      
    9 The applicant gave evidence at the trial in which he sought to provide an innocent explanation for the DNA evidence. He also relied upon an alibi. As to that evidence the sentencing judge made these observations: 
     
      
       
        
        I am not surprised the jury rejected the offender’s explanation in relation to the DNA or his alibi, having regard to the circumstances and the offender’s general demeanour in the witness box. It was not surprising in my view that the jury found the offender guilty of all those offences, a conclusion with which I agree. 
        
       
      
    10 The applicant was born on 10 October 1971 and is now 37. He was 32 at the time of the offences. He grew up in a close and loving family as the eldest of five children. Tragically two of his brothers have died. It appears that he never enjoyed school and that his education was characterised by truancy and disruptive behaviour. Towards the end of year 7 he left school and did not return.  
     
      
    11 The applicant began smoking cannabis on a daily basis when he was about 12 or 13. By his mid teens he was using amphetamines and then LSD. At the age of 19 he became a heroin user although since 2003 it seems that he has been on a methadone program. 
     
      
    12 At the time of sentence the applicant had been married for about 11 years. The evidence reveals that he is regarded as a good father to his five step-children who remain supportive of him. A report prepared by Ms Anna Robilliard revealed that the applicant was suffering from depression for which he is currently taking medication. Whilst he has been in custody the applicant has been working as a head sweeper. Whilst two institutional conduct charges have been recorded against him, it would appear that his attitude and behaviour has otherwise been regarded in a positive light by prison staff. Furthermore, he has completed a number of courses whilst in custody.  
     
      
    13 The applicant has a significant criminal history. In 1987 in the Children’s Court he received a recognisance and probation for driving a stolen vehicle and entering enclosed lands. The following year in the District Court he was placed on another recognisance for being armed with intent to commit a felony. In 1989 in the Children’s Court he received a control order for 12 months in respect of 6 counts of break, enter and steal and 4 counts of stealing a motor vehicle together with other offences of dishonesty. In the same year he received a term of 9 months imprisonment for breaching the recognisance imposed upon him in the District Court. Later that year other relatively minor drug and driving offences were disposed of either by way of pecuniary penalty or probation. In 1990 the applicant received a fixed term of 14 days for escaping from custody. In 1992 he received a minimum term of 14 months imprisonment with an additional term of 12 months for an offence of break and enter with intent. In 1995 in the Local Court he was fined $500 for goods in custody. In 1996 in the District Court two further offences of break, enter and steal led to the imposition of a total minimum term of about 15 months. In 1998 his parole was revoked and he was ordered to serve the balance of parole, a period of 11 months and 4 days. In February 1999 in the District Court the applicant was sentenced to a minimum term of 10 months 11 days with an additional term of 1 year 9 months for attempting to steal a motor vehicle and using an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension. In October 1999 in the District Court the applicant was sentenced to a minimum term of 4 years 6 months with an additional term of 18 months for robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon (a number of other matters on a Form 1 being taken into account on sentence). In 2001 in the Local Court the applicant was sentenced to 14 days imprisonment for escaping lawful custody. In November 2005 in the Local Court the applicant was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 months for two counts of destroying property. Offences of driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner and driving recklessly attracted shorter concurrent sentences. The non-parole period for those offences expired on 2 March 2006. The offences, the subject of this application, were ordered to commence on that date. 
     
      
    14 As the sentencing judge observed, the applicant has spent a considerable period of his life in custody. In fact it seems that the longest period that he has spent at liberty as an adult is 11 months. It is unsurprising in those circumstances that he has rarely engaged in gainful employment. 
     
      
    15 The sentencing judge quite properly observed that: 
     
      
       
        
        [h]is criminal record demonstrates that the current offences are not an aberration, but represent a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law and an escalation in the degree of seriousness of the offending behaviour. His record also deprives the offender of considerations of leniency and to my mind reflect poorly on prospects of rehabilitation. 
        
       
      
    16 The applicant’s criminal record also meant that considerations of personal deterrence assumed greater significance than would otherwise be the case. 
     
      
    17 As I observed earlier, a standard non-parole period was applicable in relation to count 3. The sentencing judge concluded that the offence lay above the mid-range. In so concluding, the sentencing judge referred to the very substantial amount of money which had been taken and never recovered. His Honour also concluded that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity. In doing so the sentencing judge referred to the efforts which the offenders must have undertaken in order to find appropriate vehicles and equipment with which to achieve their objective. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        The timing of the offence was considered obviously, in the early hours of the morning. Under cover of darkness, the premises were no doubt chosen after time was spent analysing the risks of detection and the response time of the security or police. In that regard the operation was quick and efficient and demonstrated a level of planning of the upper level of the range. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        It is also relevant to observe that there has, of recent times, been a spate of what are described as ram raids, and to my mind this points to the need for sentences for these type offences to have a significant element of deterrence. 
        
       
      
    18 The sentencing judge took into account as an aggravating factor the fact that the applicant was on parole at the time these offences were committed on 6 August 2004. The applicant had been released on parole on 1 November 2003 for the offence of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. His parole period was not then due to expire until 2 May 2005. It is to be noted that he was still on parole when in September 2004 he also committed the offences of destroying property and the driving matters for which he was sentenced in the Local Court in 2005. 
     
      
    19 His Honour was unable to discern any mitigating factors. He noted that because the applicant continued to maintain his innocence in relation to these offences, he was not entitled to any reduction of sentence for having demonstrated remorse. 
     
      
    20 In structuring sentences in the manner in which he did, the sentencing judge had regard to the principles enunciated in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. He explained his reasons for declining to make a finding of “special circumstances” in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        There is little objective evidence to suggest the rehabilitation will be effective warranting adjustment of the non parole period. The offender has had multiple opportunities to demonstrate such willingness and has serially ignored the opportunities offered to him. The period on parole will provide him with such opportunity if he is minded to take advantage of it. 
        
       
      
    21 There is no complaint about the individual sentences which were imposed. The sole ground of appeal is that the sentencing judge “erred in failing to take into account the effect of cumulation in determining the non-parole period”. The way in which the sentences were structured meant that the sentences imposed in respects of counts 1, 2 and 4 were all subsumed within the sentence imposed in respect of count 3. That sentence, in turn, was accumulated upon the other sentences but only to the extent of 12 months. In the final analysis as I have said the total non-parole period is 7 years and the total term is one of 9 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    22 Section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that “the balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period of the sentence unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being more”. The proportion which the non-parole period bears to the total term is 77.7%. That means that the balance of the term is less than one-third of the non-parole period. It was against that background that the applicant submitted that “the failure of the sentencing judge to refer to the effect of cumulation in relation to the setting of the non-parole period suggests that this factor was overlooked by the sentencing judge”. 
     
      
    23 It may be accepted that there have been instances in which this Court has intervened where there has been an error of the kind which is asserted in the present case. Counsel for the applicant referred to R v Lyndon [2003] NSWCCA 152; R v Ibrahim [2005] NSWCCA 43 and Dunn v R  [2007] NSWCCA 312 as providing three such examples.  
     
      
    24 It is true that the sentencing judge in the present case made no specific reference to this particular issue. That is not however the end of the matter since s 44(2) does not prohibit a court from setting a period for the balance of the term which is less than one-third of the non-parole period. Each case inevitably turns on its own facts. So much is clear from the decision in Ibrahim (supra). There the sentencing judge had declined to find special circumstances but nonetheless produced an overall non-period of 45 months which was 90% of the total sentence of 50 months. In that case I said, with the concurrence of Grove and Bell JJ, that: 
     
      
       
        
        [t]he Crown referred us to two cases in which this Court dismissed appeals where it had been complained that the non-parole period was excessive by reason of the fact that it exceeded 75% of the overall term. In  
        R v Lupton 
         [2003] NSWCCA 200, the proportion was 80% and in  
        R v So 
         [2004] NSWCCA 362, it was of a similar order. However, it is pertinent to observe that in  
        Lupton 
        , the actual period to be spent on parole by the offender was 2 years, whilst in  
        So 
         it was 2½ years. It would appear moreover, that in each of those cases, the sentencing judge had specifically considered the question of the appropriate period of time which the offender was to spend on parole and the related question of the minimum period for which the offender was to be incarcerated. The sentencing judge in the present case simply made no reference to that issue or to the effect of the sentences which had been imposed a matter which, as I have said, his Honour seems not to have considered. (at par 17) 
        
       
      
    25 As is readily apparent, the departure from the normal statutory proportion in the present case is relatively minor. Moreover, his Honour took some care in selecting the overall non-parole period which, in his view, the objective gravity of the applicant’s offending conduct and his antecedents, warranted: see R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704. His Honour was also satisfied that as against the overall non-parole period which he had selected, a period of 2 years on parole was perfectly adequate in all the circumstances. I detect no error in his Honour’s determination so far as either of those periods is concerned.  
     
      
    26 Accordingly, even if the sentencing judge did err in the manner which is asserted, I remain unpersuaded that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    27 GROVE J: I agree. 
     
      
    28 PRICE J: I agree with Buddin J. 
     
      
    29 GROVE J: The orders of the Court will be as proposed by Buddin J.

      JUDGMENT - On application to exclude evidence – s 138 Evidence Act 1995 – belief of searching officers based on reasonable grounds – s 465 Crimes Act, (Victoria) – seizure of computer and discs – right of retention – power to make copy 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application made on behalf of Khaled Cheikho to exclude certain evidence sought to be relied on by the Crown at trial. Khaled Cheikho is one of five men accused of conspiring to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. The trial is now in its fourth month. 
     
      
    2 The Crown case includes an allegation that there was, in 2004-05, an association between the accused and a number of men from Melbourne. It is said the Melbourne men held similar extremist views to their own. One of the Melbourne men is known in this trial as Sheikh Bakr. He is alleged to have been the spiritual guide and advisor to the other Melbourne men, and to a number of the Sydney accused. Sheikh Bakr's associates in Melbourne included three men known in this trial as Aimen, Ahmed and Ezzit.  
     
      
    3 On Friday 17 September 2004 police officers executed a search warrant issued under s465 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic). The warrant was executed at the home of Aimen, whose address was unit 1/56 Birchwood Boulevard, Hoppers Crossing. A number of items were seized. Included among those items was a laptop computer and four compact discs. An analysis of the material found on one of the discs revealed that it contained documents known as the White Resistance Manual, The Terrorists Handbook, The Vortex Cookbook, the Car Bomb Recognition Guide and CIA Field Guide Methods For Explosives Preparation. There was also a video clip entitled ""Mortar Attack Afghanistan"".  
     
      
    4 The Crown has indicated that it wishes to produce in evidence the CD and details of its contents. The evidence is said to be admissible as part of the Crown's circumstantial case in proof of the existence and nature of the conspiracy set out in the indictment. Evidence of the relationship between Sheikh Bakr, Aimen and some of the Melbourne men with the Sydney accused is also said to be relevant on the same basis. In particular, it is said that weapon-caching techniques, detailed in the White Resistance Manual, appear to have been adopted as part of the implementation of the Sydney conspiracy. In addition, Khaled Cheikho is said to have downloaded a copy of the Terrorist Handbook on 24 December 2004, a further circumstantial factor in the Crown case. 
     
      
    5 Aimen was charged in the Victorian Supreme Court with possession of items that were connected with preparation for a terrorist act, knowing of the connection. One of those charges related to Aimen's possession of the CD containing the material I have described. Aimen was convicted of these charges in 2008, and he was sentenced in the Victorian Supreme Court on Wednesday 4 February 2009. It appears there was no challenge to the tender of the CD and its contents during the Melbourne trial.  
     
      
    6 Mr Lange of counsel presented the arguments on behalf of Khaled Cheikho in these proceedings. Counsel's primary argument was that the warrant had been executed in such a way that the evidence was obtained improperly and contrary to the dictates of the Victorian legislation. In addition, counsel argued that various actions subsequent to the seizure were either improper or illegal. As a consequence of these matters, Mr Lange submitted that the evidence should be excluded in this trial.  
     
      
    7 The Crown, through Mr Richard Maidment QC, opposed the exclusion of the evidence. The Crown submitted that no illegality or impropriety had taken place and that, in any event, the Court should exercise its discretion to permit the Crown to lead the evidence. 
     
      
       
      A detailed examination of the factual situation 
       
      
    8 The factual situation is rather complex. It will be necessary to go into some little detail concerning the events which took place in September 2004, and during the months that followed the crucial event.  
     
      
    9 The background to the issue and execution of the search warrant is to be found in intelligence that came into the possession of the authorities in July 2004. Melbourne police were informed that a terrorist attack was imminent in Victoria. There was a need to take immediate and urgent action. A task force was formed in late July 2004. It was formed at the Australian Federal Police headquarters. It involved a cooperative tasking, in Victoria, of police from the Victorian Police Force and members of the Australian Federal Police. The Task Force was known as Operation Pendennis. One of its leaders in Victoria was Detective Senior Sergeant Chris Clark. His AFP counterpart was Federal Agent Russell George. The investigation involved up to fifty members from both agencies. (Pendennis had its own New South Wales counterpart, but it is not necessary for this decision to give any detail about the New South Wales operation.) The Victorian side of Operation Pendennis involved the investigation of some thirteen individuals who were reasonably believed to have been involved in terrorist related activities. The three Victorian men I have named, and Sheikh Bakr, were among those who were considered to be persons of interest.  
     
      
    10 The immediate and urgent task facing Operation Pendennis was to discover whether there was an imminent terrorist attack. If such an attack was planned, it was necessary to discover its target or targets and to obtain urgent information about the likely perpetrators.  
     
      
    11 Telephone conversation intercepts were placed on the services operated by Aimen, Ahmed and Ezzit. In addition, listening device warrants were obtained. One of those was placed in a garage at the home of Ezzit. A conversation was intercepted on 10 September 2004 that gave considerable insight into the activities and intentions of the three men. It was clear from the contents of those conversations that Aimen and the others were involved in car theft and car re-birthing, as it is sometimes known. More importantly, the conversations credibly suggested that the criminal activities involved in re-birthing cars were being undertaken in order to obtain funds for terrorist purposes. Ezzit had expressed concern to the other men that, since the stolen car parts were being kept in his garage, he would be at considerable risk of being apprehended by the police. I will give a few examples: 
     
      
       
        
        “ER: I don't give a shit about whose garage man...stupid.  
        
       
      
      
       
        
        AR: What's stupid? You doing it in Allah's cause, is that stupid?

        AR: What can I do, man? What more proof do you want? You think we can just go and get the weapons and walk off? We need money to get it. Praise is to Allah. Slowly, you have patience, man.” 
         
        
       
      
    12 Later Aimen said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Allah's merchandise is dear...is expensive, man. The pleasures of Allah is expensive” 
        
       
      
    13 The conversation continued: - 
     
      
       
        
         
        “AR: If you've got a better way of getting money, mate, I'll go for it.  
         
         
        AJ: He's worried, he's worried about having it here...in a tin shed.  
         
         
        AR: You'll point a gun at a kuffir's head and shoot him but you won't put the stolen car here.” 
         
         
        
       
      
    14 Later the men were discussing what might happen if they were sent to prison. The following conversation is recorded: 
     
      
       
        
        “AR: What do you mean it's for nothing...you know if even you did go to prison for this, every day you are in prison, what is it, every hour? When you do it in Allah's cause. How much is it? It's better than what? Sixty years or something?  
        
       
      
      
       
        
        AR: Sixty months or something.  
         
         
        AJ: ...one day and night in Allah's cause is better than rising for sixty months.  
         
         
        AR: Praise is to Allah.  
         
         
        AJ: Or sixty years.  
         
         
        AR: You know this, this is in your garage in Allah's cause. Every day and night it's in here, praise is to Allah, the reward you're getting.” 
        
       
      
    15 And, finally, there is a reference again to the religious justification for their criminal activities: 
     
      
       
        
        “ER: I don't know, man, I swear to Allah I don't know. I got to speak to the Sheikh, man.  
         
         
        AR: I think you need to speak to him too mate. Cause, man, you think this is not right.  
         
         
        ER: He showed me, he goes... 
         
         
        AR: He showed you, you know who Ibin Taymiah is?  
         
         
        ER: The blood and the money is lawful, all right?  
         
         
        AR: Praise is to Allah, is the Satan coming bro.  
         
         
        ER: But it does, but it doesn't say if it means during the war. That is during the war...they bombed the Australian embassy.  
         
         
        AJ: Then what, before it. If it was (forbidden in Islam)...taking it would be.  
         
         
        ER: Now, at the start didn't you ever feel... 
         
         
        AJ: Nuh.  
         
         
        ER: Don't you think to yourself, praise is to Allah, what am I doing this and its (forbidden in Islam).  
         
         
        AJ: Nuh.  
         
         
        ER: That's what's going through my head now about this. Only about this. Don't think about anything else. Only about this.  
         
         
        AJ: You know what? Don't think there is this one over here. Think, listen, say ""how am I going to gather what I need to go in Allah's cause? What can I, how can I gather it?"" Okay? How do you think the brothers in Chechnya...how do you think they gather? They go steal just like this. You don't see, you only see those nice macho videos where they're all holding AKs and all were shooting. You don't see what they do behind.  
         
         
        ER: I've seen it.  
         
         
        AJ: They don't do it every single day man. They do this. They take. You see all those nice, a hell for the Russians. It is not the nice pretty picture you see all the time.  
         
         
        ER: Yeah, I know.  
         
         
        AJ: The brothers put their lives at risk by doing this not by fighting. It's like, it's...exercise during the day. This is the real stuff.  
         
         
        AR: Praise is to Allah...if there's another way to get it, tell us and we'll go get it.  
         
         
        AJ: There isn't, there isn't.” 
        
       
      
      
       
      
    16 Detective Senior Sergeant Murray said that he formed the clear view, arising from this conversation, that there was a link between the stolen car and re-birthing activity, on the one hand, and the investigation into possible terrorist offences, on the other. The car re-birthing was a means to an end, that is, to generate funds to support the terrorist activities. Detective Senior Sergeant Murray said that there were several objectives in obtaining warrants for the searches of premises scheduled to be carried out on 17 September 2004. The most important objective was to get a reliable idea of the level of preparedness that the group may have had in relation to their terrorist planning. Secondly, there was an objective to disrupt the car re-birthing activity but, clearly, it was the less urgent of the two objectives.  
     
      
    17 Detective Senior Sergeant Murray described their task as endeavouring to locate ""a smoking gun"". This was a colourful phrase he used to describe the need to discover urgently whether there was in truth an imminent terrorist attack planned. The strategy employed to meet the two objectives was to utilise the services of the Victorian Motor Vehicle Theft Squad. Their task would be to obtain and execute a warrant under s465 of the Victorian Crimes Act. A warrant of this kind was to be executed at Aimen's premises to locate anything there that would, arising from a belief on reasonable grounds, afford evidence as to the commission of the car re-birthing offences. Secondly, other police involved in the Task Force operation were to obtain a second covert warrant and attend the premises for the purposes of locating material directly relevant to the urgent task confronting Operation Pendennis, namely, to seek out whether there was an immediate terrorist plot. (It is necessary to exercise some discretion in mentioning this second warrant and I will say nothing further about it other than to mention that, as it has turned out, it has little to do with the legal arguments ventilated concerning improprieties in relation to the s465 warrant. For that reason, it can, in general terms, be put to one side in this discussion.) 
     
      
    18 A s 465 search warrant was issued by a local magistrate, Mr A J Maughan, at 4.43pm on 16 September 2004. It identified the place of the proposed search as 1/56 Birchwood Boulevard, Hoppers Crossing. The ""reasons for search - suspected offence"" were stated as ""theft of motor car"". The name and description of the “article, thing or material” was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Stolen motor vehicle, registered number PKT 337, a black coloured Honda Prelude and/or parts, documents pertaining to the theft or sale of stolen motor vehicles and all computer storage media including floppy diskettes, tapes, hard discs, compact discs, or other devices containing data related to the theft and sale of stolen motor vehicles. All computer hardware, software, leads and cables necessary for proper operations of the computer systems.” 
        
       
      
      
    19 The warrant authorised Detective Acting Inspector O'Halloran of the Organised Crime Squad, or all members of the Police Force, to break, enter and search the premises for “any article, thing or material” of any kind named or described in the warrant, and to bring the things seized before the Court so that the matter might be dealt with according to law. It also authorised the arrest of any person apparently having possession, custody or control of the article, thing or material.  
     
      
    20 The police arrived at Aimen's premises at about 7.45am on 17 September 2004. Detective Senior Constable Gregory Teesdale was at the time performing duties with the Organised Motor Vehicle Theft Squad. It was he who spoke to Aimen at the front door of the premises and gave him a copy of the search warrant. Aimen, after some discussion, admitted that he had a gun in his bedroom under the mattress. Officer Teesdale and other police went with Aimen to his bedroom and located a .45 calibre automatic handgun and a clip loaded with rounds underneath the mattress. This was seized. A number of other items were also seized in the bedroom. They included a laptop computer and four compact discs. These were all found on the bed. There were several other items as well, but there is no need for me to record these.  
     
      
    21 Detective Senior Constable John Clark was given the task during the search of taking photographs and keeping an exhibit log. He, Teesdale and the others, had attended a briefing session prior to the execution of the search warrant. Detective Senior Sergeant Murray described the briefing that was given to the police officers involved in the search.  
     
      
    22 Obviously enough, they had been briefed on the aspect of the search that related to the car theft and re-birthing. However, they were given further information in relation to the Pendennis Task Force and its objectives. It is a reasonable inference from the evidence of Detective Senior Sergeant Murray that the searching officers were told that the car re-birthing was being carried out to obtain funds to support terrorist projects. Their primary task, however, was to look for evidence that best fitted the bill to assist them in furtherance of their precise investigation. That is to say, evidence that was directed at offences of theft arising from the car re-birthing activities.  
     
      
    23 Secondly, however, they were, as I have said, briefed about the bigger issue, that is the terrorism investigation. They were told that it would be expected that if, in the course of their duties, they came across items that might fall outside the scope of their warrant but which would be evidence to support the commission of other crimes, they were to use their powers to seize those items as well.  
     
      
    24 Detective Senior Sergeant Murray put his expectations in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. That may assist to prove terrorist offences in addition to any offences under the Victorian Crimes Act legislation? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That's right, and I would expect any detective worth his salt to do that in any typical search by - if he sees evidence that may afford evidence to another crime, to seize such an item.” 
        
       
      
      
       
      
    25 At the search scene, Detective Senior Constable Clark prepared the exhibits log. It showed that the search had commenced at 7.50am and that it was completed by 11am. The items found in the bedroom were logged separately. Item 7 in the log were the four compact discs found in the main bedroom. The log is signed by Aimen indicating that he had been given a copy of the Property Seizure Record and that he had agreed it was a true record of property seized from his premises. The log recorded, in all, some fourteen items. Photographs taken included the weapon which was found under the mattress, the computer which was found on the bed, and the four discs which were found also on the bed near the computer. There were also pieces of car bodies found around the premises which, plainly enough, had a direct link to the alleged criminal activity.  
     
      
    26 As required by the Victorian legislation, the police immediately took the materials that had been seized and appeared with them before Mr Maughan, the local magistrate. The record shows that police came before the Magistrate at 11.48am on 17 September 2004. Aimen had been arrested and this is noted on the return for the search warrant. It is my understanding that he was charged with offences relating to the car theft activity and bailed to appear before a Local Court on a later day. The Magistrate noted the exhibits as ""per the attached log"". He then gave certain directions regarding the items which had been seized. He directed that items numbered 1 to 14 in the log be retained “in the possession of police pending production at Court, if required”. This direction plainly extended to the four compact discs which were item 7 on the log. Secondly, he directed that ""items numbered 1 to 14 may be conveyed to the Victoria Police Forensic Services Centre for analysis"". The direction continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “I understand that these items may be altered from their original state as a result of analysis/testing.” 
        
       
      
    27 In the case of the computer (item 2) the Magistrate directed that this could be conveyed to the Computer Crime Squad for analysis “or by the relevant authority”. Once again, he stated his understanding that the computer might be altered from its original state as a result of analysis/testing.  
     
      
    28 Detective Senior Sergeant Murray said that he was aware of the physical nature of the items that had been seized on the day of seizure. He had not been involved in the actual search and seizure itself although, plainly enough, he had been involved in the pre-search briefing given to police. There were a number of warrants being executed on the same day, and he was briefed as to what items had been located or found as a result of each search. He said the most important task he had immediately, after the conclusion of the searches, was to look for the smoking gun. He had to determine whether anything that had been found revealed an intended target for an immediate terrorist attack. The items, he said, were ""vetted and we made an assessment of the materials"". He said they were satisfied, no doubt with some relief, that there was no smoking gun.  
     
      
    29 Although the search had located ""items of interest"" the police were satisfied that nothing that had been found demonstrated that there was an immediate intended target or an immediate plan to carry out a terrorist attack.  
     
      
    30 Detective Senior Sergeant Murray went on to describe the steps he had taken in relation to the computer and the four CDs located at Aimen's premises. The exhibits which had been placed before Magistrate Maughan were, after his directions had been given, taken by Detective Senior Constable Clark to the Organised Crime Squad office. At those premises the exhibits were taken to a locked room for checking by Detective Acting Sergeant Teesdale. This officer took possession of the seized property and, after checking, lodged it with the Exhibit Management Unit. As I understand it, this unit is located at the St Kilda Road Police Complex, at 412 St Kilda Road, Melbourne.  
     
      
    31 Detective Senior Sergeant Murray said that, although the direction which had been obtained from the Magistrate relating to the computer contemplated that the analysis of its contents might be conducted by an authority other than the Victorian police, the direction for the four CDs had not been altered to give this flexibility. It had directed that the CDs might be analysed at the Victoria Forensic Science Centre. I gathered the impression from the police evidence that it was more in the nature of an oversight that the direction for the CDs had been expressed differently than had the direction relating to the computer. Nonetheless, the position, in relation to both the computer and the CDs appeared to Detective Senior Sergeant Murray to be that there was likely to be a backlog in getting the Victorian Forensic Group to examine and/or make copies of the material on any of the items seized. Officer Murray said that this was the reason he had the wording changed in relation to the computer. Time had been of the utmost importance, and so he was concerned to outsource the interrogation to other agencies if that would provide a more prompt answer to the immediate urgent question facing the operation.  
     
      
    32 Detective Senior Sergeant Murray was sufficiently concerned to attempt to have the St Kilda Police Complex reopened over the weekend so that the outsourcing of the analysis could take place urgently. He was unsuccessful in this endeavour. On Monday morning, however, he was able to arrange for access to the items and to have them copied. This task was undertaken by one Peter Constantinou. He was a senior computer examiner with the Australian Federal Police. He was centrally located at the Forensic Services office of the Federal Police at LaTrobe Street, Melbourne. As Detective Senior Sergeant Murray made clear, it was no part of Mr Constantinou's task to analyse anything either on the computer or on the CDs. His task was limited to making relevant copies and providing an urgent report which would describe the material located, whether it be the hard disc of the computer or the material on the compact discs.  
     
      
    33 On the Monday morning, Mr Constantinou went to the St Kilda Road Police Complex with Federal Agent Clinton Towers. On the 19th floor he had been introduced to a Victorian police officer Detective Senior Constable Warren Chapman. The latter gave instructions to Mr Constantinou enabling him to conduct various forensic procedures. There is no need for me to itemise every procedure carried out by Mr Constantinou.  
     
      
    34 The one matter relevant to the present argument is that he created exact image copies of the four compact discs. In the course of doing that, he utilised a well known forensic procedure known as “Twin Tagging”. This is done to preserve the continuity and legitimacy of the copying procedure. A Twin Tag was fitted to one of the compact discs which bore the number 131277. This was the relevant disc containing material involved in the present argument. At the conclusion of the forensic procedures, the original compact disc remained in the possession of the Victorian police. It never left their possession. Mr Constantinou, with Federal Agent Towers, took with him the copy of the disc 131277. This was taken to the AFP office in LaTrobe Street, Melbourne. Mr Constantinou transferred the images on to the secure AFP network which was itself located within a secure area, and only accessible to authorised AFP personnel.  
     
      
    35 On 21 September 2004, he accessed the secure AFP network and transferred a complete copy of the images to a series of archived CDs. This, he described, as being a standard computer forensic procedure. He further described in detail the steps he had taken to ensure continuity of the exhibits he had created. A considerable time later, on 10 February 2006, Mr Constantinou again accessed the secure AFP network where the imaged files were stored. He extracted data from the network that related to, for example, the specific Twin Tag reference allocated to the relevant CD he had examined on 21 September 2004. He then created a copy of that data which he transferred to a series of CD-ROMs. He provided the reference to the relevant CD-ROM. He lodged the archived CDs marked with the relevant AFP reference number with Giuseppe Nicastri, who was then working in the Information Coordination Section of the Melbourne office of the AFP. In the final part of his report, Mr Constantinou identified the material found on the CD which I have set out at the commencement of this decision.  
     
      
    36 I now return to the sequence of events involving Detective Senior Sergeant Murray. Once the copying had been done, he said the police were involved in a ""fairly rapid vetting process"". This was the important task of ascertaining whether the material demonstrated that an imminent terrorist attack was likely. The material examined satisfied the police that that was not the situation. Consequently, the next part of the police Task Force investigation was the establishment of more long-term electronic surveillance and other types of surveillance. I took Mr Murray to say that further consideration was not given to the contents of the CD, other than it being noted as potentially relevant to more long-term terrorist charges. The sequence of the officer's evidence is found at transcript 2156 where it appears as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. That was designed to look for the smoking gun?  
        
       
       
        
        A. Just for that - entirely. Keeping in mind, I should emphasise that, you know, this exercise did take place relatively quickly; but, moreover, we were - once that exercise was completed, we were certainly refocussing and channelling our energies on other more important areas of the investigation, and that is electronic surveillance, et cetera, et cetera.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you endeavoured to have the vetting process take place at the earliest reasonable opportunity after the copying had taken place?  
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. And what did you learn as a result of the vetting process?  
        
       
       
        
        A. Well, the vetting process revealed that - you know, I keep using the phrase, but it adequately describes that there was no smoking gun, and we were happy to, I suppose, move the investigation on to the next phase and progress it from there. That is not to say there was nothing of relevance. There was certainly material of relevance, but nothing which was going to bring us closer to making any arrest.  
         
         
        Q. For instance, did you learn at that stage that the CD we are talking about contained The Terrorist Handbook, White Resistance Manual, Car Bomb Recognition Guide and that sort of material?  
        
       
       
        
        A. I may or may not. I have no specific recollection of that. Suffice to say that if I had learned I, again, would have been interested. It would have been nice to know, but, again, we were fairly focussed at that time on an imminent act, not the possession of a thing.  
         
         
        Q. If I can perhaps ask you this question. As to your state of mind at that time vis-à-vis the CDs, particularly the CD I just referred to, did you have a state of mind one way or the other as to whether the CD may have some evidentiary value to your investigation continuing or to some charges arising from your investigation?  
        
       
       
        
        A. By the very nature of the materials that you have described, the Vortex Cookbook, the White Supremacist Manual, et cetera, even though the investigation was in its infancy that clearly has some relevance and is clearly - may have some potential evidentiary value at some later stage. So, yes, that was identified as something which potentially we may use at a later stage. 
        
       
      
      
    37 The same topic was raised in Mr Lange's cross-examination of Detective Senior Sergeant Murray: 
     
      
       
        
        ”Q. My learned friend asked you about the vetting process that took place. To be fair you have said your recollection isn't 100% on this point, but let me ask you the following: You had come to an arrangement with the AFP that they would undertake the task necessary to deal with the electronic material?  
        
       
       
        
        A. Correct.  
         
         
        Q. And it was Mr Constantinou who, on the following Monday, made images of the CDs?  
        
       
       
        
        A. Correct.  
         
         
        Q. He then, on 21 September, lodged various copies with various people, is that fair to say?  
        
       
       
        
        A. I wouldn't dispute that, no.  
         
         
        Q. He himself had a look at the images that he made to provide some information to you as to what the contents were, is that right?  
        
       
       
        
        A. He may have, yes.  
         
         
        Q. If you don't remember, please just say so, but was the information that he gave you on 20 September or thereabouts that of the four CDs, one was blank, one contained a Power Point presentation, one contained a number of zip files and one contained some further data?  
        
       
       
        
        A. He may have, yes.  
         
         
        Q. You've told us that you are not entirely sure who you dealt with during this period, but other than Mr Madden and Mr Constantinou, was there anyone else from the Australian Federal Police Forensic Service that you dealt with?  
        
       
       
        
        A. Again that's some enquiries I could undertake. I have no specific recollection of other individuals, but most certainly there probably were others assisting or supporting, yes.  
         
         
        Q. As you are here today you can't recall?  
        
       
       
        
        A. I can't recall a specific name over and above Mr Constantinou, no.  
         
         
        Q. And Mr Madden later on--  
        
       
       
        
        A. That's correct, yes.  
         
         
        Q. --during the preparation. On 8 February Mr Constantinou again examined the CDs. Was that at your direction?  
        
       
       
        
        A. The 8 February 05?  
         
         
        Q. 2006, forgive me.  
        
       
       
        
        A. 2006? Whether it was via my direction, it certainly would have come through me at some stage, so I would have been a party to the process, yes.  
         
         
        Q. And it was at that stage that he informed you about the directory structure and the precise contents of the CD?  
        
       
       
        
        A. Just to understand what Mr Constantinou's role is, yes he would report on directory structures et cetera et cetera. We would have others, though, doing the vetting processes, that is, people actually looking for items of evidentiary worth. That's not his role.  
         
         
        Q. He is a forensic person?  
        
       
       
        
        A. Correct.  
         
         
        Q. He makes copies?  
        
       
       
        
        A. Correct.  
         
         
        Q. He translates the electronic information into some form of representation so that other officers can determine the evidential value?  
        
       
       
        
        A. Correct.  
         
         
        Q. Without the information that he provides, obviously other Australian Federal Police Officers or Victorian Police Officers cannot determine the evidential value of items such as CDs?  
        
       
       
        
        A. No, that's not the case.  
         
         
        Q. That's not the case?  
        
       
       
        
        A. No.  
         
         
        Q. Can you tell us who else had access to those CDs?  
        
       
       
        
        A. Well, if I just clarify myself there, it's not the case because what Mr Constantinou is doing on a forensic level is getting the CD data to an acceptable evidentiary standard, that is, acceptable in a Court of law. The process of identifying, for instance, a document could be quite easily done by any member of the task force, that is, they see a Vortex Cook book sitting there, the forensic mechanism was left to Mr Constantinou to, I suppose, transpose or elicit that in some forensic capacity so it makes sense in a Court of law. So just so if I can - so others could have and would have undertaken that exercise, not Mr Constantinou.  
         
         
        Q. But again to be fair to you, you don't know, sitting here today, whether any other officer looked at the CD and made that determination prior to Mr Constantinou's information of 8 February 2006?  
        
       
       
        
        A. Well, I can categorically say that prior to that we had been involved in the vetting process. I can't at this point tell you who it was, but what I can categorically say is that we certainly had a handle on the types of material that were located on those CDs”. 
        
       
      
      
       
      
    38 As it happened, Aimen appeared before the Werribee Magistrates Court on 27 January 2005. On that day, he pleaded guilty to offences arising from the activities detected by the Stolen Motor Vehicle Squad. I am not aware of the penalties imposed upon him, but it appears there was no appeal from the sentence imposed.  
     
      
    39 Detective Senior Sergeant Murray gave evidence that his operation wanted the group members to believe that this had been simply a car re-birthing investigation. In other words, he did not wish to “tip his hand” to the Melbourne men in case they became aware that surveillance was being conducted as part of a terrorist investigation. For that reason, he determined that the original CD should be returned to Aimen. In the light of Aimen's plea to the stolen car offences, the CD was not of any use, and certainly of no further use, in relation to those charges. The CD was in fact returned to Aimen on 6 June 2005. (Mr Murray was “chided” by Mr Lange over the delay between January and June 2005 but he said that, in his experience, a period of six months post conviction was not an unduly lengthy time for the return of property seized as evidence.) 
     
      
    40 An additional complication then occurred. It is not quite clear why this occurred. But it seems that ASIO had taken (or, at least, may have taken) a different view than had the Victorian police. On 22 June 2005, the CD (and other items) were seized by ASIO under a new search warrant issued on its behalf. Detective Senior Sergeant Murray said he became aware of this on the day of seizure. Having become aware of it, the Operation Pendennis Task Force later executed its own search warrant on ASIO to recover the item. This occurred, it appears, in January 2006. By that time, indeed, by June 2005, the investigation into the Melbourne group had gathered considerable momentum. Prior to November 2005, a fairly clear view had by then been held as to the nature of the offences to be alleged against the Melbourne men. The men were arrested and charged in that month. With the prospect of a trial in mind, the importance of the materials on the CD became more significant and they were then more closely scrutinised and examined in terms of their evidentiary value, along with other circumstantial material gathered in the 14-month period between September 2004 and November 2005.  
     
      
    41 A Victorian police officer attached to the joint Task Force, one Paul Madden, was given the task of looking carefully at the material on the CD (and other material) with a view to it becoming part of a brief of evidence against those charged with terrorism offences in Melbourne as a result of the Melbourne investigation. Aimen himself was one of those charged in November 2005 with possessing the relevant CD, knowing that it was connected with a terrorist act. There was a second charge relating to another CD which is not relevant to the present discussion. As I have said earlier, Aimen was eventually found guilty in relation to both charges.  
     
      
    42 Officer Madden gave evidence which, broadly speaking, supported the evidence given by Detective Senior Sergeant Murray. Mr Madden had been seconded to the joint Task Force in about August 2004. He confirmed that the imaged files contained on the relevant CD were, with other material, loaded into a system known as GEMS. This is an acronym for ""General Evidence Management System"". It is a software program where material in electronic form, once loaded, cannot be altered or changed and, as such, becomes a management system for recording evidence that has been loaded into it. He believed that the CD was loaded into GEMS in late 2004, shortly after it had been imaged by Mr Constantinou.  
     
      
    43 Mr Madden was informed of the sequence of events culminating in the “reseizure” of the seized CD pursuant to the ASIO warrant on 22 June 2005. He was also aware that the CD had been subsequently recovered by the Task Force from ASIO in early 2006. Mr Madden provided a statement on 20 February 2006 which confirmed his examination of the material within GEMS, being the images obtained by Mr Constantinou in September 2004.  
     
      
    44 The purpose of his statement was to identify, for trial purposes, more precisely the material contained on the CD. Mr Madden also confirmed that the evidence in the 2008 trial against Aimen had included the material seized during the 17 September 2004 search. It included the original CD. He also confirmed that the contents of the CD had been loaded into GEMS specifically for the purpose of the Task Force investigations being conducted by Operation Pendennis. Mr Madden, so it seems, had been endeavouring to come to grips with GEMS from about mid-2005. The program was not one that he had been familiar with, and there was a substantial volume of material that required a considerable time for the purposes of examination and the preparation of statements. He confirmed, however, that other investigators had examined the material prior to his involvement. He said he knew there were people from Canberra who were involved in the investigation for a short time who did examine the contents of the material in GEMS. They were not specifically involved, however, with the day-to-day aspects of the investigation. 
     
      
       
      The arguments advanced on behalf of Mr Cheikho 
       
      
    45 Mr Lange relied upon five specific improprieties to support his argument that the material should not be allowed at trial. These were:  
     
      
       
      (a) The seizure of the CDs was made without any investigation as to their contents at the time they were taken from the premises. The consequence of this was that the seizing officers had not been able to form a belief that they were related to the terrorism investigation or, for that matter, the car theft investigation.  
       
       
      (b) The passing of the material to another agency, namely the Australian Federal Police, was unauthorised and contrary to the direction given by Magistrate Maughan on 17 September 2004.  
       
       
      (c) the passing of the material to the Australian Federal Police involved a breach of the direction that the CDs should be given to the Victorian Computer Forensic Services Group. 
       
       
      (d) The copying or imaging of the CD was unauthorised, or at least not specifically permitted by the Magistrate’s direction. 
       
       
      (e) It had been improper for the police to retain the CD at all, and its retention was certainly improper after the purpose relating to the motor vehicle investigation had lapsed in January 2005. In the alternative, it was improper for the police to retain the CD itself beyond a reasonable time, and improper to retain the copies or images beyond a reasonable time.  
       
      
    46 Mr Lange argued that all or any of these improprieties ought lead the Court to conclude that, in the exercise of its discretion, the proper application of s138 of the Evidence Act (NSW) should result in the evidence being excluded. 
     
      
       
      Principles to be applied 
       
       
      Section 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 
       
      
    47 There is no dispute between the parties as to the primary principles to be applied. This is an application to exclude evidence at trial, where the principal contention is that the items seized were improperly or illegally obtained or retained. The issue is one to be ultimately determined having regard to the provisions of s138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).  
     
      
    48 The dictates of s138, the ambit and thrust of its discretions, and the authorities bearing on its proper construction and application, are set out in a number of earlier pre-trial decisions I have given (see, for example, R v Elomar [No 6], 16 December 2008, at (28)-(35); R v Baladjam [No 48], 30 September 2008, at (247)-(254)). 
     
      
    49 As I am virtually mid-trial at the present time, and as this decision is required promptly, I will simply ask that those earlier decisions be regarded as incorporated in, and part of, this judgment. 
     
      
       
      Section 465 of the Crimes Act 1958 (VIC) 
       
      
    50 The threshold and immediate questions, however, require an examination of the terms of s 465 Crimes Act 1958 (Vic). Section 465 is relevantly in the following terms: - 
     
      
       
        
        “465(1) Any magistrate who is satisfied by the evidence on oath or affidavit of any member of the police force of or above the rank of senior sergeant that there is reasonable ground for believing that there is, or will be within the next 72 hours, in any building, receptacle or place - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) any thing upon or in respect of which any indictable offence has been, or is suspected to have been, committed or is being, or is likely to be, committed within the next 72 hours; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) any thing which there is reasonable ground to believe will afford evidence as to the commission of any such offence; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) any thing which there is reasonable ground to believe is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any indictable offence against the person, for which the offender may be arrested without warrant - 
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
        may at any time issue a warrant authorising some member of the police force or other person named therein to search such building, receptacle or place for any such thing and to seize and carry it before the Magistrate's Court to be dealt with according to law.” 
        
       
      
    51 The section, its history, its derivation and characteristics were exhaustively examined by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Allitt v Sullivan (1988) VR 621, especially per Brooking J at pp 634-690. Relevantly for the present argument, the two predominant features of its requirements, so far as the execution of a search warrant is concerned, were said to be: -  
     
      
       
      (a) the officer or officers authorised to search must act reasonably in all the circumstances of the case; and may seize an item only where the officer holds a belief based on reasonable grounds that the item will afford evidence as to the commission of the offence named in the warrant.  
       
       
      (b) the primary obligation on the seizing officer is to bring any item seized before the issuing Magistrate or other Magistrate to be dealt with according to law. 
      
    52 This second feature is discussed by Brooking J at p 638 in the following terms: - 
     
      
       
        
        “A warrant issued under s465 authorises in terms search, seizure and carrying away. Once a thing has been found, identified and seized, then neither the warrant nor the section pursuant to which it was issued says anything in terms by way of authorising the executing officer to retain or use the thing seized. His power and his duty is to carry it before a justice to be dealt with according to law. If the section and the prescribed form of warrant did no more than authorise search for and seizure of the things described in the warrant, then it might be argued with some force that the seizing officer was entitled to retain what he had seized, either by virtue of the warrant...or by virtue of the principles that have been developed by the courts concerning the circumstances in which the police may retain seized articles until the conclusion of criminal proceedings. But I do not see how it can be said that the warrant itself, or s465, authorises retention or use of what has been seized. For such retention or use is inconsistent with the duty imposed by the warrant on the executing officer to carry what has been seized before a justice to be, by him, dealt with according to law...Moreover, having regard to the terms of the warrant and the section, while the principles developed by the courts concerning the circumstances in which the police may retain seized articles pending the conclusion of criminal proceedings will bear, and bear heavily, on what 'dealing' by the justice will be 'according to law', the express provision of the warrant and the statute shows that the rights given to the police by the common law are, so to speak, to be enforced, not directly, but by means of an order for disposition giving effect to them, which is made by the justice before whom the seized property is brought.” 
        
       
      
      
    53 Again at p 639 Brooking J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The power and the duty of the police officer executing the warrant is to take what he has seized before a justice to be dealt with by him according to law. Once he has seized the goods, that is his only power in relation to them. He is not entitled, for example, to retain what he has seized for the purpose of facilitating his investigations instead of taking the seized property before a justice...If the things the subject of the warrant are documents, the warrant gives the officer no power to read them except for the purpose of identifying what he is to seize. Once he has identified and seized the documents, his task is to take them before a justice. How is the justice to deal according to law with what has been seized:...where criminal proceedings have been commenced or are in contemplation the justice should give effect to the common law right of the police to retain possession of property required for the prosecution, the right of the police being, of course, not limited to cases of theft...The cases show that it would be proper to allow the police to retain possession of things seized, not only for the purpose of using them as evidence but also for the purpose of using them in the course of investigation.” 
        
       
      
      
       
      General principles affecting search warrants 
       
      
    54 There is no real dispute between the parties as to the principles applicable to show the correct procedures to be adopted generally upon the execution of a search warrant. Principally these are to be found within the statute creating the right to search premises, but they also derive, in part, from the common law. The principles of general import most relevant to the present argument are the following:-  
     
      
       
      (a) the belief based on reasonable grounds that the item seized will afford evidence of the commission of the relevant offence extends beyond holding a mere suspicion ( 
      George v Rockett 
       (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 115;  
      Joseph Puglisi & Anor v Australian Fishermen's Management Authority 
       (1997) FCA 846 per Hill J).  
       
       
      (b) the requirements of the statute governing the execution of the power to search under a warrant are to be construed strictly and the execution of the warrant itself must be reasonably carried out ( 
      George v Rockett 
       at 1110;  
      Parker v Churchill 
       (1985) 63 ALR 326 at 337 per Burchett J;  
      Reynolds v Commissioner of Police 
       (1985) 2 WLR 93;  
      Bartlett v Weir 
       (1994) 72 A Crim R 511 at 518 per Beazley J).  
       
       
      (c) subject to any statutory requirements, the police may retain items seized for the purpose of a pending investigation and/or criminal proceeding until after the conclusion of the proceedings (see authorities under the following subparagraph).  
       
       
      (d) the common law extends the reach of a warrant to include a power of seizure of evidence, found during the search authorised by the warrant, relating to serious offences not mentioned in it ( 
      Reynolds v Commissioner of Police 
      ;  
      Ghani v Jones 
       (1970) 1 QB 693 at 706;

      Ozzie Discount Software (Aust) Pty Limited v Muling 
       (1996) 86 A Crim R 397). In  
      Ghani v Jones 
       - a case where the search of premises had taken place without a warrant - Lord Denning set out in his judgment five propositions at (708)-(709), which are frequently repeated. These were: 
       
       
        
        “First: The police officers must have reasonable grounds for believing that a serious offence has been committed - so serious that it is of the first importance that the offender should be caught and brought to justice.  
        
       
       
        
        Second: The police officers must have reasonable grounds for believing that the article in question is either the fruit of the crime (as in the case of stolen goods) or is the instrument by which the crime was committed (as in the case of the axe used by the murderer) or is material evidence to prove the commission of the crime (as in the case of the car used by a bank raider, or the saucer used by a train robber).  
        
       
       
        
        Third: The police officers must have reasonable grounds to believe that the person in possession of it has himself committed the crime, or is implicated in it, or is an accessory to it, or at any rate his refusal must be quite unreasonable.  
        
       
       
        
        Fourth: The police must not keep the article, nor prevent its removal, for any longer than is reasonably necessary to complete their investigations or to preserve it for evidence. If a copy will suffice, it should be made and the original returned. As soon as the case is over, or it is decided not to go on with it, the article should be returned.  
        
       
       
        
        Finally: The lawfulness of the conduct of the police must be judged at the time, and not by what happens afterwards.” 
        
       
      
      
       
      
    55 (These propositions were, for example, applied in Tye v Commissioner of Police, and by Bell J in Greer v Commissioner of Police (2002) 128 A Crim R 586.) 
     
      
       
      (e) legislation in similar terms to s465 of the  
      Victorian Crimes Act 
       does not enable or entitle the seizing officer to remove things from the warrant premises with a view to deciding at a later time whether or not to seize them. This limitation flows from the conditions by which the relevant statute governs the execution of a warrant ( 
      Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police & Ors 
       (2002) 124 FCR 384 at 71-73. In that case, the Court (French, Sackville and RD Nicholson JJ) noted that, while it was possible to remove a file, book, bundle or document, which was believed on reasonable grounds to contain material of evidentiary value, provided that any necessary sorting process was carried out with reasonable expedition and that those documents not of evidential value were returned reasonably promptly, it was not open to an executing officer to remove materials for later sorting without consideration of whether or not they might contain evidential material. The Court cited as authority  
      Reynolds v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
      ,  
      Allitt v Sullivan 
       and  
      Bartlett v Weir 
      .  
       
      
    56 In the last mentioned case, Beazley J (at 522) had held unlawful the seizure and retention of computer disks, purportedly pursuant to a warrant under s10 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth):- 
     
      
       
        
        “...without knowing whether they fell within the terms of the warrant, intending to examine them later, without having held, at the time of seizure, the requisite reasonable belief that the goods seized might afford evidence of the commission of a crime.” 
        
       
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    57 The first critical matter is to determine whether Khaled Cheikho has demonstrated that the seizing police officer failed to hold a belief based on reasonable grounds that the CDs found in the bedroom, and in particular the relevant CD, contained data relating to the theft and sale of stolen motor vehicles. In one sense, this is the primary matter to be determined. Mr Lange did not dispute that he carried the onus of demonstrating that an illegality or impropriety had occurred. Counsel's argument fell essentially into two parts. The first was that the evidence before this Court fell short of establishing such a belief based on reasonable grounds. Secondly, the fact that the CD was not ""played"" at the house - the laptop computer had not been taken to the premises - meant that no such belief could have been formed or held at the time of seizure. 
     
      
    58 As to the first matter, I am not satisfied that Khaled Cheikho has demonstrated the absence of such a belief on the part of Detective Senior Constable Teesdale. This is so for a number of reasons. First, the warrant itself had been issued by Mr Maughan upon his being satisfied by either evidence on oath or affidavit that at the premises there were likely to be ""diskettes, hard disks, compact disks, et cetera"" containing data relating to the theft and sale of stolen motor vehicles. The Magistrate's view of the material placed before him is, of course, by no means conclusive, or even indicative, of the belief of the seizing officers. Nor is the fact that the items mentioned in the subpoena were those that may have seemed, at first blush, to fall literally within the terms of the warrant. But each of those matters is germane to the presence of the necessary belief held by the seizing officer, at least as a matter of inferential background. 
     
      
    59 Secondly, the Court is entitled to infer that members of the specialist squad dealing with car theft, including Officer Teesdale, would have been aware of the practice of persons involved in car re-birthing offences to store material relating to their activities on electronic media such as a compact disc. 
     
      
    60 Thirdly, the inference as to Officer Teesdale's belief is all the more strengthened by the overall circumstances of the finding of the four CDs scattered on Aimen's bed near a computer, and the finding of a loaded pistol secreted under the bed itself. There were also other items found and seized both in the bedroom and elsewhere in or about the premises that would have further strengthened the relevant inference in relation to the CDs themselves. This is plain from the items listed on the property seizure record. 
     
      
    61 Fourthly, in conformity with the legislation, the CD and the other items seized were immediately taken before the Magistrate so that the latter might determine what stipulation should be made in respect of each of those items. The Magistrate, for example, might have ordered the immediate return of the items, or some of them, to their owner. He would have done so if they were unrelated to the offence in the warrant. The fact, however, that the issuing Magistrate, confronted with the list of the seized items, and knowing of the arrest of the person against whom the warrant had been issued, ordered, at the request of the seizing officers, that the items be retained by the Victorian Police, pending production in the proceedings against Aimen, further reinforces, even if indirectly, the continued existence of the appropriate inference as to the seizing officers' belief. Of course, the Magistrate's view that the CDs should be retained by the police pending production at court, if required, is not of itself direct proof of the belief held by Officer Teesdale, but it is again an important piece of background material in relation to the drawing of the appropriate inference. 
     
      
    62 Mr Maidment SC argued that the overall circumstances of the police briefing as to the connection between car re-birthing and terrorist intentions, together with the circumstances of the search, enabled a further inference to arise, namely that Officer Teesdale, and Mr Wheatfill, who was present in connection with the second warrant, would have been likely to have shared information as to the items seized by each of them. Sharing of information in this way would have been likely to give rise to the suggestion, not dispelled by any evidence adduced on behalf of Khaled Cheikho, that the CDs were seized in the further belief that they were likely to afford evidence of the commission of another offence, namely an offence against the Commonwealth terrorism legislation. 
     
      
    63 I am not altogether persuaded by this submission. But, at the very least, I do accept that the police at the search, including Mr Teesdale, would have been, or likely to have been, well aware of the connection between the re-birthing activities and Aimen's terrorist proclivities. The possibility, I put it no higher, that the police belief in relation to the CDs rested, at least in part, on Aimen's interest in terrorist pursuits plainly exists as a matter of inference. This inference, however, is perhaps not as firmly grounded as the principal inference to which I have made reference. 
     
      
    64 Whether one looks to the first or the second inference, or perhaps a combination of the two, the fact is that Khaled Cheikho has not satisfied me on the whole of the evidence I have considered that the seizing officer lacked a belief on reasonable grounds that the CD would afford evidence of the commission of an offence. The beliefs held by the police officer were plainly capable of relating the CD to the commission of the offence mentioned in the warrant. Perhaps less obviously, but nevertheless possibly so, those beliefs were capable of extending to a perception that the material would be relevant to the commission of an offence against the terrorist legislation. 
     
      
    65 I should mention here something that is not, strictly speaking, relevant to the resolution of this first question. It is, however, not without practical significance to the overall discussion to note, as an obvious matter, that the content of the relevant CD was in fact both relevant and probative to the offence to which Aimen eventually pleaded guilty at the Werribee Local Court. If he had not pleaded guilty to this offence, and had the burden of proof fallen upon the Crown at his trial, the CD would have been plainly a piece of evidence relevant to the motives underlying the theft of motor vehicles as revealed in the contents of the listening device intercepted at Ezzit's garage on 10 September 2004. The contents of the CD would not have proved the offence but would have been plainly relevant to its proof (Parker v Churchill per Burchett J at 337). The contents of the CD were also relevant and probative in relation to the charges for terrorism offences in respect of which Aimen was convicted in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 2008. 
     
      
    66 Mr Lange's second point, namely that the police did not have the capacity at Aimen's house to examine the contents of the CD, is not without attraction at first glance. But I do not accept that it is sufficient, in the circumstances of this particular matter, to dispel the existence of the inferences I have examined in relation to counsel's first argument. Once again, several points may be made. First, it must be acknowledged that the legislation represented by the terms of s465 of the Victorian Crimes Act is rather outmoded in its concepts. It takes no account, for example, of the revolution represented by the modern computer and its technology. More recent legislation, for example the provisions in the present Commonwealth Crimes Act, allow for the testing and analysis of computer material at the property to be searched. It allows, in addition, the removal of computer and media devices for testing away from the searched property and for later seizure after testing (Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police at (80) to (103)). 
     
      
    67 By contrast, the Victorian legislation is based on the terms of a statute enacted nearly 100 years ago (s 8 Crimes Act 1910). It makes no allowances for the type of procedures I have mentioned in the more modern legislation. It does not follow, however, as an axiomatic certainty, that a belief based on reasonable grounds could not be held in relation to the contents of a particular CD or even a number of CDs located at a particular set of premises. Such a belief might, in particular circumstances, be held, even though the precise contents of the CD were not known or, in technical terms, not capable of being known precisely at the moment of seizure. The situation, inevitably, would be affected by, and perhaps determined by, the information held by police, by operational knowledge, briefing details and the circumstances encountered at the place of search. The present situation is very much one that is influenced by considerations of that kind. 
     
      
    68 Mr Lange relied on two authorities in relation to this argument. The first is Bartlett v Weir, a case counsel suggested was “on all fours” with the present matter. This decision, however, is, in my view, clearly distinguishable from the present.  
     
      
    69 Bartlett v Weir was a case in which the applicant sought a declaration that the execution by the second respondents of certain search warrants had been unlawful. The search warrants related to two separate sets of premises in Tasmania. The validity of the warrants had themselves been attacked but this had been resolved favourably to the issuing authorities in an earlier decision.  
     
      
    70 The proceedings before Beazley J sought not only a declaration, but a claim for damages for wrongful retention of property. There is no need for me to set out all of the factual matters in detail. The following points of distinction should, however, be noted:  
     
      
    71 First, the proceedings were, as I have said, for a declaration and other relief. It was not a case in which the Court was required to exercise a discretion as to exclude evidence at a criminal trial. 
     
      
    72 Secondly, the gravamen of the decision of Beazley J was that the conduct of the search had been very heavy-handed and quite unreasonable. Something like 400 floppy disks had been seized, as well as a number of computers. There was no issue with the proposition that much of the material seized was of a private nature, related to other persons' business affairs, and could not have reasonably fallen within the search warrant. There were other aspects of the search procedure which were plainly unreasonable. There is no need for me to detail them here. 
     
      
    73 Thirdly, and importantly, the seizing officer had conceded that the relevant belief was not held at the premises. Indeed, a decision had been made, prior to the execution of the warrant, to remove the equipment to be seized so that it could be examined at a later time and away from the premises at the leisure of the authorities. In effect, everything that might possibly answer the literal description in the warrant was seized, with the intention being that a decision should be made about the nature of the material and its retention at a later time and place. 
     
      
    74 Fourthly, the material was retained for seven months, even though no proceedings were pending or apparently even contemplated. 
     
      
    75 Finally, there was no evidence before Beazley J that any investigation into the matter was continuing, even at the time, nearly two years later, when the proceedings in the Federal Court were determined. 
     
      
    76 Two points can be made. First, it will be seen that the case before Beazley J was very significantly different from the situation I have examined in the present matter. Secondly, her Honour's decision was not, as I read it, an authority for the proposition that in no circumstances could a belief be held on reasonable grounds that a computer disk, unexamined as to its precise contents at seizure, would afford evidence of the commission of a crime. 
     
      
    77 In the present matter there were only four CDs seized. There is not the slightest suggestion in the evidence that it was a ""willy-nilly seizure"". Of course, the police officer may have been wrong as to his belief. But, in that case, that would have perhaps predicated a need for the CD to be returned. It would not have meant that the seizure was itself illegal or improper. 
     
      
    78 Nor is this a ""bundled-up"" case (the exception mentioned in Reynolds). There is no suggestion that the police simply bundled up the CDs with a view to sorting out later which part was probative of the commission of an offence and which part was not. The positive inference I draw from the whole of the circumstances is that the belief was held that all four CDs contained material relevant to, or probative of, the commission of an offence relating to the theft and re-birthing of vehicles. At the very least, it has not been demonstrated by the applicant in the present matter that such a belief was not held. 
     
      
    79 The second authority relied on by Mr Lange was Trimboli v Onley [No 3] (1981) 56 FLR 321. This was a decision by Holland J. It related to a complex series of cases where the plaintiff had attempted to thwart a search of his premises mid-stream. Once again, the immediate decision concerned a claim for wrongful detention of goods and damages. The plaintiff was by no means successful in his claim, at least in the decision under discussion, and the Court made a detailed set of orders preserving, in effect, the rights of the parties in accordance with the principles stated in the decision. There is no need for me to set out the principles as they are, in the main, those I have already identified. Mr Lange, however, placed reliance on one particular part of Holland J’s decision. At pp336-337, Holland J has stated: - 
     
      
       
        
        “In the present case s. 10 of the Crimes Act permits the grant of a search warrant authorizing the named officer to enter a house ""and to seize any such thing which he may find in the house"". The wording of the English section suggests that seizure must precede removal from the premises. Section 10 does not refer to removal and might be capable of being construed as authorizing seizure of a thing found in the premises to take place at some point of time after removal from the premises such as after removal and possession for a period long enough for an examination. There were items found in the present case that are in point. I refer to the tape recordings, for example. Their contents could not be known unless they were played back on suitable equipment which the defendant did not have with him at the time. Undeveloped films would be another example. The ""electronic device"" might need examination by an expert to ascertain its function before a decision could be made. Notwithstanding that such examples favour, from a practical point of view, a power to remove and keep possession for examination before deciding upon seizure or return of the property, I do not think that either the statutory provision or the terms of the warrant here in question ought to be construed as giving any such authority. We are in a field where, in my opinion, one would expect such authority to be directly and expressly conferred by the statute if it was intended to be given. I think that the impression conveyed by a first reading of s. 10 is that both entry and seizure would occur at the same place if there is to be a seizure. I would so construe both the section and the warrant in the present case and hold that the decision to seize must be made and the contemporaneous belief must exist at the premises and before any removal therefrom if the removal and a subsequent detention of the property is to be lawful under the warrant.  
        
       
       
        
        If the views I have expressed are correct, ex post facto justification under the warrant is not possible. If the conditions for lawful seizure did not exist at the time when the goods were removed from the premises, it cannot subsequently arise  
        under the warrant 
         if the conditions afterwards come to be fulfilled. If the defendant did not entertain the requisite belief at the time he removed the goods from the premises he cannot, under the warrant, support a claim to be entitled to retain the goods on the basis of a later belief that he had formed. If he was able to show that the goods were the subject of or were evidence of the commission of a crime and that under the common law should be withheld from the plaintiff or delivered up to prosecuting or other authorities legally entitled to seek possession of them, the court would have to consider that matter but in such case the defendant would not be showing justification under the search warrant.”  
         
         
        
       
      
    80 It will be seen from these paragraphs, however, that Holland J was not stating that a belief based on reasonable grounds could never be held in respect of, for example, a tape recording on an unexamined film roll. Rather, his Honour was examining the proper construction of the legislation then under consideration to ascertain whether it permitted removal and later seizure after an examination had taken place. Holland J was of the view (as am I in relation to the Victorian legislation) that it did not. Moreover, Holland J acknowledged the right to retain goods in circumstances contemplated by the propositions in Ghani v Jones. Trimboli’s case, as a consequence, does not support Mr Lange’s argument. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    81 In the event, however, that I may be wrong in relation to my view that the failure to ""play"" the CD at the premises was not fatal to the existence of a belief based on reasonable grounds, I will at a later point in this decision examine the matter within the terms of the discretion required by s138 of the Evidence Act (NSW). 
     
      
    82 I turn then to consider the subsidiary points relied on by Mr Lange. The next argument related to the fact that the imaging was done by the Federal Police, and that the image made was retained by the Federal Police on their secure network. Mr Lange argued that this was contrary to the direction given by the Magistrate on 17 September 2004. 
     
      
    83 If Mr Lange is right in this particular argument, the ""impropriety"" was of the utmost technicality. The Crown submitted that Mr Lange was not right. The Crown suggested that the direction given by the Magistrate (""items numbered 1 to 14 may be conveyed to the Victoria Police Forensic Service Centre for analysis"") did not preclude the Victorian Police from outsourcing the imaging to the Australian Federal Police. There were good reasons for doing so. Secondly, the AFP and the Victorian Police were involved in a joint task force in relation to Operation Pendennis. Thirdly, the primary purpose of the search process, at least from the point of view of Detective Senior Sergeant Murray, was the need to detect as a matter of urgency an imminent terrorist attack. There is much to be said for the Crown's argument in this regard. Although I am reluctant to find that the police were at fault in this particular aspect of the matter, I will assume for the purpose of the argument that the imaging by the AFP was not expressly sanctioned by the Magistrate. Accordingly, I will revisit this issue when I examine the operation of s138 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    84 It should be noted, however, that I do not accept the subsidiary point made by Mr Lange to the effect that the Victorian Police gave possession of the CD to the AFP. They did not. The CD remained at all times, especially during the testing, in the possession of the Victorian Police Force. The Magistrate's order authorised that retention. 
     
      
    85 The next point was that the retention of the CD and the making of a copy was illegal or improper. In relation to this argument, I accept Detective Senior Sergeant Murray's evidence that a rapid vetting of the material was made very shortly after the seizure and that it revealed that there was no immediate terrorist target. 
     
      
    86 Secondly, I accept that officers connected with Operation Pendennis examined the contents of the CD at or shortly after the vetting process and concluded that the material contained on it would be likely to be relevant to a terrorist prosecution against Aimen if other evidence could be obtained in the course of the subsequent investigation to justify the commencement of criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    87 It should be noted that the contents of the CD really provided the cornerstone of two of the charges against Aimen, namely the charges that he was in possession of terrorist material, knowing of the connection. Mere possession of the material on the CD would not have proved the commission of these offences, but its contents would have been relevant to proof. 
     
      
    88 These findings mean that the police were justified in retaining the CD and they might have retained it, in fact, until the Melbourne prosecution against Aimen for terrorist offences had concluded. They did not do so, but this was so for a tactical reason. The CD was returned to allay suspicion while further surveillance of Aimen and his associates took place. I accept that the CD was returned not because it was of no further value to the investigation but because its return might lead the Melbourne terrorists into thinking that their activities had gone undetected. 
     
      
    89 The passage in the fourth of the propositions of Lord Denning (Ghani v Jones) clearly contemplates the police may make a copy, and this is the case particularly if there is an intention to return the original. As it happened, the CD was not necessary for the car theft prosecution because of the plea of guilty. It was necessary in one sense to retain it for the terrorist charges laid in November 2005, but the police decided to take a risk in that regard by returning the CD to Aimen in early June 2005. The risk was taken, as I have said, to allay the suspicions of Aimen and his associates. I am not aware of the actual reason for the change of approach which led to the ASIO reseizure of the CD from Aimen on 22 June 2005, but I do not consider that the reseizure affected the legality or otherwise of the copying which had been done back in September 2004. The power of police to make a copy of a document seized has been confirmed by the decision of Bell J in Greer v Commissioner of Police. The present situation is not a case where it could be said that the purpose of the photocopying was to deal with the property otherwise than for the purpose of the powers conferred by the warrant, or for the purpose of retaining evidentiary material relevant to a serious offence outside of the terms of the warrant. 
     
      
    90 The final point argued by Mr Lange was that it was improper for the police to retain the CD after the motor vehicle theft prosecution concluded in January 2005. But, as I have said, prior to that time the decision had been made to retain the CD and the copies for the purpose of the ongoing investigation into the terrorist offences. In accordance with the well established principles I have mentioned, it has not been demonstrated that the police acted improperly in that regard. Indeed, it is not without practical significance to note that no proceedings were ever instituted by Aimen to recover the property from the police. Nor were there any allegations by his very experienced lawyers at trial, to suggest that any of the matters I have dealt with in this decision warranted or could possibly have warranted the exclusion of the evidence against him at trial. 
     
      
       
      Application of the discretion under s 138 of the Evidence Act 
       
      
    91 On the basis that any of the matters raised and argued by Mr Lange may be thought to be improprieties or illegalities, it is necessary for the Crown to persuade the Court to admit the evidence. 
     
      
    92 The evidence of the contents of the CD is, plainly enough, probative of the charge against Khaled Cheikho as part of the circumstantial case sought to be made by the Crown. There are two principal ways in which the evidence is probative to the charge. The first is that the relationship of Aimen to some of the accused, his and their relationship with the cleric, Sheikh Bakr, and the association between all of them, is relevant, especially to the mental element of the alleged offence and proof of the terrorist nature of the preparatory actions by some of the Sydney accused. In addition, the evidence is relevant to rebut the defence case that Khaled Cheikho’s actions and words including his possession of extremist material, is innocent. Secondly, the weapon-caching section of one of the books on the CD is alleged to be reflected in the activities of some of the Sydney accused in taking steps to conceal weapons, especially towards the end of the alleged conspiracy period. It might also be mentioned that Khaled Cheikho's downloading of one of the publications contained on the CD is alleged to be an indication of “sharing” extremist material between a member of the Melbourne group and one of the Sydney conspirators. All these matters are relevant to the proof of the Crown’s circumstantial case against all the accused, including Khaled Cheikho. 
     
      
    93 Mr Lange submitted, however, that this evidence is not unduly important in the trial against the Sydney men. He argued that it was only of “marginal relevance”. I agree that it is only a small part of the Crown case and that it is not, by any means, the most important part of the evidence against the Sydney accused. The principal evidence against them will be the allegations of their own individual activities, including their possession of extremist and jihadist material in one form or another. It is not, however, trivial or unimportant evidence. 
     
      
    94 The offence charged against each of the accused is a very serious one, carrying as it does a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The legislature has, by virtue of the maximum penalty, recognised that the more serious of terrorism offences are properly to be regarded as among the worst of those in the criminal calendar. 
     
      
    95 I do not regard any of the alleged improprieties or contraventions as being serious. I do not accept that any of the alleged improprieties or contraventions was deliberate or, for that matter, reckless. Mr Teesdale plainly believed that he was entitled to seize the four CDs in Aimen's bedroom. The worst that can be said is that the fact that he did not test those CDs at the premises before seizing them could possibly lead to a conclusion that he did not have reasonable grounds for the belief he held. On the other hand, the search was reasonably conducted and it was moderate in every respect. There is not the slightest suggestion that the police in any way intentionally transgressed or trampled upon Aimen's rights. Nor has Aimen ever complained that they did. The arrangement to obtain duplicate images of the CD was done for proper reasons and it was purely an oversight, at most, that the Magistrate was not asked to expressly sanction the procedure that was adopted. The retention of the original CD and the copies was justified having regard to the ongoing terrorist investigation. In any event, the police were certainly entitled to assume that they had that entitlement, and it has not been demonstrated that their actions in that regard were in any way deliberate or reckless. In my opinion this extends to each and every aspect of the matters alleged by Mr Lange in his argument. 
     
      
    96 None of the other matters mentioned in s 138(3) require discussion. The only one that was faintly emphasised in argument was the matter contained in subs (3)(h). Mr Lange submitted that there would be no difficulty with the police tendering in evidence the CD, which had been reseized by ASIO (and later obtained by the AFP through a second warrant), rather than relying upon the original seizure of the CD or the images taken and created in September 2004. This argument is something of a two-edged sword for Mr Lange. If there is no need for the police to rely upon the 2004 seizure at all, and if it is accepted that the prosecution may tender the CD on the basis that it was later obtained by ASIO, and then later by the AFP using appropriate procedures in 2005, one wonders why the application has been brought at all. I rather suspect that counsel is hoping to “knock-out” the original seizure in the expectation that some flaw in the second seizure will be later brought to light. If so, the defect, if any, in the second seizure has not been identified during the present argument. 
     
      
    97 I prefer to answer counsel’s reliance upon s 3(h) by simply making two observations. First, I am not satisfied that there is any connection whatsoever between any alleged impropriety relating to the first seizure and retention of the CD and the subsequent decision by ASIO to reseize the CD under its own warrant. While the evidence has not explained that subsequent decision to me, I am perfectly satisfied that there is no suggestion that it was done as some type of cover-up for an earlier defect or impropriety. There is no suggestion to that effect at all in any of the evidence or the arguments. Secondly, in the circumstances of the present matter, I am satisfied that subs (3)(h) has very little role to play. To the extent it does, it does not favour exclusion. 
     
      
    98 The Court's task is to balance any alleged impropriety in obtaining evidence against the public interest in successfully prosecuting alleged offenders. The asserted breaches here are either quite innocent or inadvertent. The breaches, if any, were not deliberate or reckless. The offence alleged against the accused, on the other hand, is very serious indeed. Although the evidence is not of great importance in the Crown case, I am persuaded overall that the Crown has established that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting it, notwithstanding the breaches or possible breaches which may have occurred.  
     
      
    99 In those circumstances, I hold that the evidence should not be excluded and may be admitted at trial.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I will ask Price J to deliver the first judgment.  
     
      
    2 PRICE J: On 7 May 2007 the applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to a single count on an indictment which alleged an offence of aggravated robbery contrary to s 95(2)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 20 years. The circumstance of aggravation was the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm.3 On 10 May 2007 the applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment containing two counts. The first count alleged a robbery in company contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 20 years. The second count alleged an aggravated break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act. This offence also carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment but has a prescribed standard non-parole period of 5 years. The circumstances of aggravation was that the offence was committed in company. 4 The applicant asked the Judge to take into account on sentence two offences of money-laundering contrary to s 73(2) of the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989. The maximum penalty for these offences is 20 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    5 The applicant was sentenced on 15 February 2008. In respect of the count of aggravated robbery (hereinafter referred to as the first count) he was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months commencing on 1 October 2008 and expiring on 31 March 2013. For the count of robbery in company (hereinafter referred to as the second count) the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 7 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months commencing on 1 April 2007 and expiring on 30 September 2011. In respect of the count of break and enter with intent (hereinafter referred to as the third count) he was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 1 October 2005 and expiring on 30 September 2008.6 The total effective sentence was imprisonment for 10 years 6 months commencing on 1 October 2005 and expiring on 31 March 2016 with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months commencing on 1 October 2005 and expiring on 31 March 2013, the date upon which the applicant is eligible for release to parole. The two offences on the Form 1 were taken into account by the Judge in the sentence imposed for the second count.7 The facts of the first count may be summarised as follows: At about 3.20 am on 10 January 2005 the victim, a joint proprietor of a fruit store, left his home with the intention of travelling to his business premises. Whilst he was walking towards his motor vehicle, one of the applicant’s co-offenders punched him numerous times to the head. With the assistance of another co-offender, the victim was restrained on the ground and his hands were tied behind his back with cable ties. The applicant waited nearby where he acted as a ‘lookout’ for police. He was in a position to assist his co-offenders if required. A number of towels were placed over the victim's head by the co-offenders who forced him into the passenger seat of his vehicle. One of the co-offenders then drove the victim's vehicle away. The applicant remained in the area in a black Nissan Skyline. 
     
      
    8 The victim managed to get out of the vehicle whilst it was being driven and ran from it screaming for help. He, however, was tackled to the ground by one of the co-offenders and was returned to the vehicle where more cable ties were applied to his wrist. Further cable ties were applied to his ankles at a park in North Narrabeen. A resident of a nearby house observed the Nissan Skyline and a small dark blue hatchback and recorded the Nissan's number plate. Soon after, the victim was driven to a car park at Collaroy Beach where a co-offender had demanded that he hand over the keys to his store. He was then punched to the head area at which time he surrendered the keys. Duct tape was placed over his mouth and over the top of his face, threats were made to him and his family and his elbows were cable tied to the headrest of the front passenger seat. He was told to stay at that location for an hour and not to move. A short time later, the victim escaped from the vehicle, obtained assistance and the police were called. The applicant was arrested two days later. The applicant's role in the commission of the offence was to act as a lookout.9 A summary of the facts of the second and third counts is as follows: At about 2.00 am on 24 May 2004, the victim, a proprietor of a grocery business, was woken in the bedroom of his home by the sound of a number of males who had gained entry to his home by forcing the front door. He was told not to move, to co-operate and he would not get hurt. The victim felt an object pressed against his forehead. He was then rolled over onto his stomach and his hands were taped behind his back. A beanie was placed over his head. He was interrogated by the intruders as to where he kept his cash and jewellery and about the alarm code and door lock code of his business premises. He was threatened with violence and again felt an object pressed against his temple. The victim told the intruders the code to the alarm and door lock. He gave them the safe key and told them that the swipe key was in his vehicle. His wrists and ankles were tied with belts. The victim heard one of the intruders leave the house and then heard a car drive off.  10 The applicant's role was to wait outside the premises and keep a lookout. 
     
      
    11 Later on in the early hours of the same morning, the victim's store was broken into. The alarm was deactivated and entry was gained by use of the key code. A video was removed from the closed circuit television monitor within the office. The safe was accessed using the key taken from the victim's house and an amount of $58,557 in cash was removed. 12 Whilst the victim was bound he overheard a number of telephone conversations which suggested that the intruders who had remained were communicating with the person or persons who had entered the store. About half an hour later, the victim heard what he believed to be the same vehicle he had heard earlier return to his home. He was told by the intruders to wait a couple of hours and that they would telephone triple 0. The intruders then left. The victim was able to free himself and alert police. 
     
      
    13 The applicant had been employed at the victim’s grocery store between 4 September 2003 and 30 April 2004. 14 The offences of money laundering on the Form 1 concerned the electronic transfer of money which was stolen in the commission of the offence being count 3 and the use of the stolen money to purchase a motor vehicle.15 The applicant, who was born on 5 January 1976, was raised in India. He came to Australia in September 1996 to study. He had completed his secondary schooling in India at the age of 17. He left Australia in October 1999 but returned on a student visa in November of that year. Following his arrival in Australia he had been employed in various occupations. It seems that he had completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1998 from the University of Dehli by correspondence whilst he resided in Australia. He had a child who was about two years old with his partner who remained supportive of him.16 Both the pre-sentence report and the psychologist's report which were tendered during the proceedings on sentence referred to the applicant's gambling problem. He had told the psychologist that he began to gamble in 1999 and became addicted within two months. He had accumulated debts as a result of his gambling. He said that he stopped gambling in 2005 when his partner became pregnant and had not gambled since. The author of the pre-sentence report wrote that although the applicant had acknowledged a problem with gambling he had taken no remedial action either in the community or while on remand to address this problem. 
     
      
    17 The applicant told the psychologist he began to have a problem with alcohol in 2003 which lasted for about one and a half years and had moderated his drinking from about mid 2004. The psychologist noted that he had not undertaken any alcohol rehabilitation. Psychometric testing which was conducted by the psychologist revealed that the applicant was of above-average intelligence. Formal testing indicated that the applicant had a low likelihood of recidivism.18 His Honour was of the view that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend. At the time of sentence the applicant was 32 years old. The pre-sentence report reveals that he was on a bridging visa and his ongoing status in Australia was uncertain. He has no prior criminal convictions. For the pleas of guilty his Honour allowed a utilitarian discount of 15 percent. His Honour found special circumstances. 
     
      
    19 The first ground of appeal complains that the Judge erred in that considering the principle of totality he partly accumulated the sentence on counts 2 and 3 whereas in the proper exercise of his sentencing discretion the Judge should have imposed concurrent sentences. The applicant submitted that those sentences were committed on the same day and were, in reality, one episode of criminality committed in a short space of time. 
     
      
    20 This Court's attention was drawn to what was said by Howie J in Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1 at [27]: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.” 
         
        
       
      
    21 It was said for the applicant that the sentence on count 3 comprehends and reflects the criminality for the offence on count 2 and the sentences should have been concurrent.  
     
      
    22 It is evident from the Judge's sentencing remarks that he carefully considered the principle of totality. His Honour considered that he was obliged to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then to consider questions of concurrence or accumulation as well as the question of totality: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610.23 His Honour said (ROS) at 30: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In considering questions of accumulation and totality, I have particularly taken into account also that the offences in count two and three form part of an unbroken course of conduct."" 
        
       
      
    24 The sentence for count 2 was partially accumulated on count 3 commencing as it did 18 months after the commencement of the sentence for count 3. 25 His Honour's view that the offences in counts 2 and 3 formed part of an unbroken course of conduct did not mandate the imposition of concurrent sentences. Whilst the intrusion into the victim's bedroom (the subject of count 2) was plainly designed to obtain information to enable the victim's store to be broken into, the criminal acts which were involved in the commission of this offence were of themselves of a serious kind. The break and entering into the victim's store involved separate criminal acts which involved the removal of $58,551 in cash. 26 The Judge found that the applicant's role was that of a lookout.27 It was, in my opinion, open to the Judge to determine that the sentence for either of counts 2 or 3 could not encompass the criminality of both offences. I do not detect any error in the partial accumulation of the sentences and Ground 1 of the appeal is rejected. 28 The remaining ground of appeal is the applicant's complaint that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. In oral submissions, it was submitted for the applicant that the total sentence of 10 years 6 months was a crushing one. 29 The totality principle is designed to avoid a court imposing a ""crushing sentence"" in the sense that ""it will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release"": R v MAK, R v MSK [2006] NSW CCA 381 at [17].30 In a considered judgment, the Judge detailed the gravity of the offending which his Honour found was not diminished by the fact that the applicant's role could be described as a ‘lookout’. As the Judge pointed out, the applicant was involved in a joint criminal enterprise and his role was fundamental to the carrying out of the offences. His Honour was mindful that the offences involved successful business persons and called for a strong measure of deterrence. 
     
      
    31 The overall sentence, whilst a heavy one, is not, in my opinion, a crushing sentence. I am not persuaded that the sentence was outside the legitimate range of sentencing discretion. 32 The Court was referred to the ongoing uncertainty of the applicant's status in Australia upon release. It is not for this Court to speculate as to the steps which might be taken by the Commonwealth authorities upon his release or whether the uncertainty of his status might impact upon his eligibility for release to parole.33 Accordingly, I propose the following orders:1. Leave to appeal against sentence be granted;2. Appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    34 GROVE J: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    35 BUDDIN J: I also agree.  
     
      
    36 GROVE J: The orders of the Court will therefore be as proposed by  
     
      
      Price J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: Leith Gordon Bagshaw (the applicant) has brought three applications for leave to appeal against judgments or rulings of judges in the District Court. The applications are brought pursuant to s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Mr Bagshaw has pursued the applications in person. It is necessary to appreciate the limits to the jurisdiction exercisable pursuant to that provision and it should be noted that the first issue is the necessity to demonstrate that leave is warranted. Ordinarily a factual error does not satisfy the requirements to found a grant of leave: R v Matovski (1989) 15 NSWLR 720. 
     
      
    2 I will in due course deal with the applications in sequence and they can be referenced by the identity of the particular judge concerned but first some background needs to be sketched.  
     
      
    3 On 12 October 1993 the applicant was made bankrupt upon a creditor’s petition. He was discharged from bankruptcy on 14 May 2002. The Crown allegations are that between 1995 and 1999, without disclosing the extant bankruptcy, he entered various agreements to obtain goods, services or credit and he was consequently charged with seven counts contrary to s 269(1)(ac) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966. The charges were listed for trial at Sydney District Court on 24 February 2006. The applicant did not appear for trial and a bench warrant for his apprehension was issued. It was executed in March 2008 when he was arrested in Queensland and remanded to New South Wales.  
     
      
    4 Thereafter a series of listings occurred in the District Court and at these the applicant was represented by counsel, Richard Killalea. On 10 April 2008 the applicant was arraigned before Sweeney DCJ and he pleaded guilty to four of the counts in the indictment and not guilty to the remaining three counts. Subsequently he has made application to reverse the pleas of guilty but this was refused by Syme A/DCJ. The applicant has not been sentenced on those counts and the refusal is the subject of one of the applications before the Court.  
     
      
    5 The trial on the three counts upon which the applicant has pleaded not guilty was scheduled to commence before Puckeridge DCJ on Monday 3 November 2008. Since the pleas before Sweeney DCJ the applicant has no longer been represented by counsel and he has appeared in person. In the absence of the jury panel he sought to ventilate several complaints and to that end he presented a notice of motion. This handwritten document presented the following prayers: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Prosecutor the stand down for breaching code of ethics. 
        
       
       
        
         2. Release from bail. 
        
       
       
        
         3. Release bail money to rightful owner.” 
        
       
      
    6 The motion was supported by an affidavit by the applicant. The assertions therein were substantially repeated in a written submission in support of the application to this Court which I will set out.  
     
      
    7 Puckeridge DCJ did not accede to the prayers in the notice of motion, however, in the course of exchange between counsel, the applicant and the Bench his Honour expressed concern about the understanding by the applicant of the irrelevance or otherwise of the Federal Criminal Code to the three charges in the indictment which was scheduled for trial. In short, the application of the Code would seem to place upon the prosecution an additional ingredient of proof to what would be required if the Code did not apply. His Honour adjourned the hearing in order to enable the applicant to seek appropriate advice. 
     
      
    8 It is not an issue before the Court at present but it can be observed that the application of the Criminal Code to offences against the Bankruptcy Act was achieved by an amendment inserted by the Parliament in the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Act 2001 which had a provision as to its commencement specifying 28 days after receiving Royal Assent. Assent was given on 6 April 2001 and the commencement date was therefore 4 May 2001. The latest date of offences charged against the applicant is in 1999 and the Criminal Code therefore does not apply to them. 
     
      
    9 The document filed by the applicant sets out grounds and these are stated thus: 
     
      
       
        
        “Judge Puckeridge erred on the notice of motion – re Bolster. 
        
       
       
        
        Grounds – overwhelming evidence 22.8.08.  
        
       
       
        
        It is not a common phrase. 
        
       
       
        
         Further submissions will be added.” 
        
       
      
    10 In accordance with the usual practice the applicant was required to file written submissions and in relation to this matter they were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        SUBMISSIONS AGAINST THE DPP BARRISTER RE MR BOLSTER 
        
       
       
        
        1. He has deliberately lied to the full Court. In his submission to the full Court before Simpson, McClellan, Bishop (sic) he stated that he had a full and complete set of the original documents.  
        Puckeridge 
         made him present all the documents to the Court. The documents he presented were not originals or complete. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          a. Where are the false taxation documents? 
           
          b. Where are the rest of the documents of the other application? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2. He lied on further submissions to the Full Court, 2nd June AFP documents which have been stolen from the Court files. He also misled the District Court by putting up the false Taxation documents. He stated to the District Court he could find me to serve me but put up a chronology which contained my address. When Bagshaw told the Judge Burman (sic) he was withdrawing his guilty pleas. Bolster outside the Court referred to me that a  
        Leopard never changes his spots 
         which convicted me. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Before Judge Puckeridge he led with the same accusations, re transcript. 
        
       
       
        
        4. When Judge Blackmore asked him what happened to the documents out of the Court file he just shrugged his shoulders. The Judge said he would take  
        Bagshaw at face value 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        5. Outside the Court Bolster indirectly abused me again. 
        
       
       
        
        6. In a  
        fit of rage Bolster before the Judge Puckeridge 
         he described me as a cunning, conniving and manipulating self litigant. This is an example of his inability to control himself, re transcript. 
        
       
       
        
        7. He refused to put Robyn McLean AFP into the witness box, clearly shows it is a cover up. 
        
       
       
        
        8. It is clear any submission to the Court that he is out of his depth. The DPP is only a Prosecutor. The case actually stems from the two private trustees and two government trustees who were struck off. The AFP were only investigation. It had to come from somewhere. 
        
       
       
        
        9. Bolster failed to turn up on the 15th December. That is contempt of Court. I asked the full Court not to take any submission from the DPP, Barrister, Bolster and I will spell it out on the day.” 
        
       
      
    11 In oral submissions the applicant contended that Puckeridge DCJ had held that the proceedings were a miscarriage of justice. As the transcript of his judgment shows, what his Honour said was that if the trial went ahead when the applicant did not understand the legal significance of the application or non-application of the Criminal Code “there could be a miscarriage of justice.” For that reason he adjourned the scheduled commencement of trial. 
     
      
    12 So far as the “leopard” issue is concerned, his Honour determined that the words, even if spoken as the applicant asserted, would not be a ground for removing Mr Bolster as counsel for the prosecution. In fairness to Mr Bolster it should be recorded that there was before the District Court an affidavit by Ms Aitken, solicitor, which included in reference to this: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 23 May 2008 following the mention of the proceedings in Court 3.1, I had a conversation with Bagshaw and Paul Bolster of Counsel during which 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Bolster said to Bagshaw words to the following effect, ‘We will also be sending you a tendency notice’. 
        
       
       
        
        Bagshaw said ‘What’s that?’ 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Bolster said ‘It puts a person on notice that at the hearing we will seek to rely on a number of other facts to prove another related fact. All of the facts involve the same conduct or type of conduct. It is a bit like the old saying that a leopard never changes its spots 
        . 
        ’ ” 
         
          
         
        
       
      
    13 The reference to a previous hearing before this Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Simpson and Hislop JJ) advances nothing other than repeated unsubstantiated assertion by the applicant.  
     
      
    14 As can be seen other matters of complaint also refer to assertions of fact and, if they can be shown to be relevant, any dispute can be determined at trial. Challenges to factors articulated by the applicant do not give rise to relief pursuant to s 5F. No error in his Honour’s refusal to disqualify the prosecutor has been shown. 
     
      
    15 So far as the applications in respect of bail are concerned, it has been held in this Court that such are not matters of judgment or order given in the proceedings within the meaning of the expression in s 5F: R v Nanai [2000] NSWCCA 204. The power vested thereby is not exercisable. 
     
      
    16 The foregoing observation should not be taken to imply that the applicant has established anything appropriate for a grant of leave. On any basis the application in respect of the rulings by Puckeridge DCJ should be dismissed. 
     
      
    17 As abovementioned the applicant moved in the District Court to withdraw his pleas of guilty to the four counts. It was heard by Syme A/DCJ. The grounds of appeal have been expressed by the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Judge Syme erred 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        1. Placing me on time limit during cross examination. 
         
        2. Verballed me. 
         
        3. Stopping me when cross examination of criminality taking place. 
         
        4. 11.11.08 Refusing to accept psychology report when I was told to provide one on 6.11.08. 
         
        5. She had a set against self litigants.”  
        
       
      
    18 The written submissions by the applicant were in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “SUBMISSION ON BEHALF OF JUDGE SYM 
        
       
       
        
        1. She was a Magistrate and not a Judge when ruling on my case. She does not have the same power as a Judge. 
         
        2. She cannot place you on a time limit re transcript, this is manipulation on behalf of the Crown. 
         
        3. She verballed me when she lost control of the Court as a Magistrate. Why was she there? 
         
        4. She failed to let me cross-examine my own Barrister when she could see I was trying to expose my Barrister of aiding the DPP. 
         
        5. Clearly my Barrister was the instigator of my guilty pleas knowing the DPP was sitting on false documentation. 
         
        6. My Barrister will be placed in the witness box before the Federal Court. Re documentation attached. 
         
        7. The Magistrate erred in cross examination of the Barrister when she told the DPP prosecutor that I was assisting them. This is biased. Re transcript. 
         
        8. She did not have the power to refuse the Menzies report (Psychologist) or MRRC Psychologist report. This is an example of her incompetence on sitting on the Bench. 
         
        9. She had a set against self litigants. She was  
        pugnacious 
        . She turned the Court  
        into disrepute 
        . 
         
        10. She failed to endorse Bench warrant against Senator Heffner where the political stature where the money has gone. Read transcript.  
         
        It is clear as a Magistrate she should not be in this position and take the Law true course. 
         
        As a Senior Judge, Puckeridge had the clear view that it was a malicious prosecution. She was out of her  
        depth 
         in this case. 
         
        This Magistrate is totally biased against self litigants. Her smirk and smile is as venomous as a rattle snake in the grass as she was clearly over the DPP like a rash. She was not neutral.” 
        
       
      
    19 A qualified person may be appointed an acting judge of the District Court by the Governor in accordance with s 18 of the District Court Act 1973. Syme A/DCJ was qualified and the fact that she had previously been appointed as a magistrate did not disqualify her. Duly commissioned, she possessed the powers and authorities of a Judge of that Court and was deemed by the statute to be such: See s 18(3). 
     
      
    20 A hearing had proceeded before her Honour on 30 October 2008 and there was a resumed hearing on 11 November. On the latter date she gave reasons for dismissing the application to reverse the plea. Those reasons show that her Honour correctly focussed her attention upon the relevant issues. Inter alia, she stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “…..there is no evidence that the applicant did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered. All of Mr Bagshaw’s submissions to me today make it clear that he understands exactly the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered; he has addressed me at length in relation to the issue of bankruptcy, and he has addressed me at length in relation to whether other people knew he was bankrupt or not when certain contracts were entered into. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, there is no evidence that the plea was not a free and voluntary confession. I have listened to the tape where the pleas were entered. I find as a question of fact, there being an absence of other evidence, that the pleas were free and voluntary, and because of the comments he made after each plea I find that he specifically understood which charge he was pleading guilty to and which charge he was pleading not guilty to. 
        
       
       
        
        Thirdly, whether the plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt; there is no evidence that the applicant has put before me to suggest that is the case. Fourthly, whether there was a ‘mistake or other circumstance affecting the integrity of the pleas as an admission of guilt’; Mr Bagshaw refers to this issue in his affidavit, he refers to having documents, he refers to there being documents which he says he has. Those documents are not before me, he has chosen not to tender them. I do not know where they are and therefore count 4 cannot be satisfied. 
        
       
       
        
        Point 5, where the plea was induced by a threat or other impropriety when the applicant would not otherwise have pleaded guilty; again Mr Bagshaw has in his submissions today suggested that these prosecutions are malicious. There is nothing in the evidence that he has put before me that suggests this is anything other than an assertion by him. 
        
       
       
        
        Sixthly, that the plea of guilty must either be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it was not a true admission of guilt. The circumstances of this case, Mr Bagshaw was represented by competent counsel. Counsel had time to speak to him beforehand, counsel addressed the court on several occasions before Mr Bagshaw was brought up from the custodial setting. There is no evidence to suggest that the plea was made in those circumstances. Finally, if the person who entered the plea was not in possession of all the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt; there is no evidence to support that, and in fact the evidence again suggests the exact opposite. 
        
       
       
        
        For all of those reasons whilst I have considered Mr Bagshaw’s application carefully, I am of the view that he has not satisfied the onus which should be on the balance of probabilities to satisfy me that the plea of guilty should be withdrawn.” 
        
       
      
    21 Complaint is made of the ruling by her Honour to limit the time during which the applicant was seeking to adduce evidence from his former counsel Mr Killlalea. Her Honour plainly was vested with power to give such a direction: Evidence Act 1995 ss 26 and 192. A reading of the transcript shows the persistent failure of the applicant to direct questions to relevant matters and no error in her Honour’s exercise of power has been shown. The applicant, as he was entitled, informed her Honour that he was not prepared to waive privilege attaching to advice which Mr Killalea had given (transcript 30 October 2008 page 3). This obviously reduced to a very small compass any evidence that Mr Killalea could relevantly give. 
     
      
    22 The applicant told her Honour that he had not seen Dr Menzies until a consultation on the Tuesday prior to the hearing on 30 October. He did not on that occasion produce a report but an adjournment was granted and it was produced at the resumed hearing on 11 November. It is significant that her Honour had given directions concerning service of any report. A copy of it is in the documents placed before this Court although her Honour rejected the tender. As the reasons for rejection are based, in part, upon the content, or absence of content, of the rejected document it can be examined. It can be observed that the report is dated 29 October 2008, the day before the applicant obtained an adjournment. The document is addressed “To Whom It May Concern”.  
     
      
    23 As stated, her Honour rejected the tender. The document is extremely short and its content will demonstrate why her Honour correctly applied the authority of Makita (Australia) Pty Limited v Sprowles (2000) 52 NSWLR 705. The entire content is: 
     
      
       
        
        “ TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Leith Bagshaw and I met on 28.10.08. 
        
       
       
        
        He recounted a long and complex series of events over the previous ten years. 
        
       
       
        
        At interview we most specifically talked about his mental state while incarcerated for 4 weeks from mid March 2008. Mr Bagshaw’s 34 years old son died by suicide 6 weeks earlier. It is highly probable that Mr Bagshaw was not in a clear state of mind when he pleaded Guilty to Charges on March 24, 2008.

        ” 
         
        
       
      
    24 No case for intervention by this Court in respect of the judgment or orders of Syme A/DCJ has been shown. 
     
      
    25 The third challenge arises out of a listing hearing which was conducted before the Chief Judge, Blanch J. 
     
      
    26 The grounds of appeal are stated by the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the 15h Dec the Chief Judge Blanch erred in a error of judgment. 
        
       
       
        
        1. He refused to hear a partly heard notice of motion back before Judge Puckeridge to have the case struck out. 
        
       
       
        
        2. He is clear he is biased against me. 
        
       
       
        
        1A. This is the third time he has refused a self litigant justice. 
        
       
       
        
        2A. In 2004 he stated Bagshaw I will jail you one way or the other. 
        
       
       
        
        3A. He stated in 2008 a notice of motion that the false documentation was a load of rubbish. 
        
       
       
        
        4A. He called me a liar and then had to retract it concerning pro bono. 
        
       
       
        
        5A. I asked him to release $20,000 funds, he only released half, and again tried to push it to trial. A Senior Judge Puckeridge stated it was a malicious prosecution and a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        Puckeridge stated the criminal code fits in this case as the code states recklessness or other avenues of terminology Bagshaw carried out what the trustee told him to do and completed the job. So Bagshaw is either a employee or agent for the trustee, both trustees have been struck off and PKF has removed trustee Phil Jefferson has been dismissed for fraud. 
        
       
       
        
        Judge Blanch ignored that the DPP failed to attend Court and Bolster, the barrister for the DPP failed to attend. 
        
       
       
        
        I ask the Full Court to release the other $10,000 and strike to case out and reward costs and damages.” 
        
       
      
    27 The written submissions in support of this application are: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        FURTHER SUBMISSIONS AGAINST JUDGE BLANCH 
        
       
       
        
        1. He refused to let the full $20,000 bail money be released because the DPP and Barrister failed to turn up. He is in contempt of Court. 
        
       
       
        
        2. He refused to allow the amended notice of motion to go back to Judge Puckeridge because he knew Puckeridge would strike it out. It fits into the Criminal Code as it is all prior 2000 and Puckeridge states it is a malicious prosecution and a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        3. As the Criminal Code states that it is recklessness Bagshaw carried out what two trustees instructed Bagshaw to do to complete all contracts. Bagshaw is either an agent or an employee. 
        
       
       
        
        4. It is now clear that the Chief Judge is pushing two areas because he worked for the DPP and is now working as a senior Chief Judge which now becomes a  
        Conflict of Interest 
        . Further more he cannot set a trial date as other side, DPP, is not there. This is an example as all the Judges (six) made amendments that we will never get a fair trial. Read previous Full Court Submissions of all the Judges comments.” 
        
       
      
    28 As previously noted an application to vary bail is not a subject for relief from this Court pursuant to s5F.  
     
      
    29 There is no error manifest in his Honour’s refusal to vacate the trial hearing date. 
     
      
    30 As can be seen particularly in the foregoing recitations of grounds and submissions filed by the applicant, he has cast numerous aspersions upon various judges as well as upon counsel conducting the prosecution. I have hesitated about incorporating reproductions in these reasons of what the applicant had written but in full context the absence of merit emerges with unmistakable clarity and I have done so for that reason. 
     
      
    31 That I have not paused to deal with all matters in detail should not be taken as a tacit acceptance of an entitlement of the applicant to engage in calumny but the irrelevance of what has been stated in much of the material presented is self evident to any exercise of jurisdiction by this Court pursuant to s 5F. There is nothing in the material to justify the intemperate language which the applicant has chosen to use.  
     
      
    32 These three applications are entirely unmeritorious and I propose that leave to appeal in each case should be refused.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    2 KIRBY J: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    3 HALL J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s.5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the severity of a sentence imposed upon her in the District Court of New South Wales on 27 February 2008. 
     
      
       
      Offences charged 
       
      
    4 The applicant was charged and pleaded guilty to two counts of supplying a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, contrary to s.25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and one count of ongoing supply of the same prohibited drug contrary to s.25A of that Act. 
     
      
    5 The three offences, to which the applicant pleaded guilty, were recorded on the indictment in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        [Count 1]: On 3 November 2005 at Doonside in the State of New South Wales, [the applicant] did supply a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine.  
        
       
       
        
        [Count 2]: Between 30 November 2005 and 29 December 2005 at Doonside in the State of New South Wales, [the applicant] did on three or more separate occasions during a consecutive period of 30 days, namely 1 December 2005, 5 December 2005, 6 December 2005, 9 December 2005, 13 December 2005 and 15 December 2005 supply a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, for financial reward. 
        
       
       
        
        [Count 3]: On 15 December 2005 at Doonside in the State of New South Wales, [the applicant] did supply a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine. 
        
       
      
    6 The maximum penalty for offences under s.25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, being Counts 1 and 3, is 15 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for offences under s.25A of that Act is 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
       
      Sentences imposed 
       
      
    7 The sentences imposed by the District Court in respect of the three offences were in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        [Count 1]: A fixed term of three months imprisonment to commence on 27 February 2008 and expire on 26 May 2008. 
        
       
       
        
        [Count 2]: A non-parole period of one year, three months and 15 days to commence on 27 February 2008 and expire on 10 June 2009, with an additional term of two years to commence on 11 June 2009 and expire on 10 June 2011. 
        
       
       
        
        [Count 3]: A fixed term of nine months imprisonment to commence on 27 February 2008 and expire on 26 November 2008. 
        
       
      
    8 The sentence in respect of Count 2 took into account the matter on the Form 1, that being the possession of 111.9 grams of cannabis on 15 December 2005 contrary to s.10(1) of the Act. 
     
      
    9 The overall sentence imposed represented a term of imprisonment of three years and six months with a non-parole period of one year and six months, this sentence however being reduced to take into account the two months and 16 days spent in pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    10 In the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal, dated 25 September 2008, the following grounds of appeal appear:- 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The applicant suffers a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed upon her with the sentence imposed upon her co-offender, Matthew Iddles. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) His Honour was in error in finding that the offence contrary to s.25A  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         1985 was aggravated by the fact that the offence was committed for financial gain (s.21A(2)(o)  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         1999) when this factor was an element of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) His Honour was in error in finding that the offences were aggravated in that each of them were part of a planned or organised criminal activity within the meaning of s.21A(2)(n)  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         1999. 
        
       
      
    11 I will set out below the facts giving rise to the offences before considering the appeal grounds raised by the applicant. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    12 The agreed facts for the purpose of the sentencing hearing were in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In May 2005 Operation Mantura was established by the Bass Hill Target Group to investigate the supply of prohibited drugs by the applicant and Matthew Iddles (‘the co-offender’) in the Blacktown area. On the 27th May 2005 a controlled operation was authorised. 
        
       
       
        
        About 11.55 am on Thursday 3rd of November 2005 a Police Undercover Operative (‘Steve’) attended the location of 60 Adelphi Crescent, Doonside and engaged in a conversation with the applicant. A short time later she handed ‘Steve’ a small resealable bag containing methylamphetamine. ‘Steve’ then handed the accused $100 and left the location. 
        
       
       
        
        The methylamphetamine was later weighed at .015 grams and subsequently analysed to have a purity of 14%. [Charge 1] 
        
       
       
        
        About 11.20 am on Thursday 1st December 2005 ‘Steve’ attended 60 Adelphi Crescent, Doonside and at the front door of the premises had a conversation with a young girl who appeared to be approximately 12 years old. The young girl said, ‘What are you after?’ ‘Steve’ said ‘A hundred of gas!’ ‘Steve’ then observed the child walk over to the applicant who was standing inside the premises. The applicant handed the young girl a plastic container in the shape of an egg. ‘Steve’ saw the child open the container which contained approximately ten small plastic resealable bags containing a clear liquid substance. The child then handed ‘Steve’ one (1) small plastic bag containing methylamphetamine. ‘Steve’ then handed the child $100. A short time later ‘Steve’ left the location. The methylamphetamine was later weighed at 0.7 grams. 
        
       
       
        
        About 4.35 pm on Monday 5th December 2005 ‘Steve’ attended 60 Adelphi Crescent, Doonside and engaged in conversation with the applicant. A short time later Bowden handed ‘Steve’ a small plastic resealable bag containing methylamphetamine. ‘Steve’ then handed the accused $100 and then left the location. The methylamphetamine was weighed at 0.9 grams. 
        
       
       
        
        About 3.37 pm on Tuesday 6th December 2005 ‘Steve’ attended 60 Adelphi Crescent, Doonside where he was engaged in a conversation with the applicant who handed ‘Steve’ a small plastic resealable bag containing methylamphetamine. Steve then handed the applicant $100. The methylamphetamine was weighed at 0.6 grams. 
        
       
       
        
        About 3.33 pm on Friday 9th December 2005 ‘Steve’ attended 60 Adelphi Crescent, Doonside where he engaged in a conversation with the applicant. A short time later the applicant handed ‘Steve’ a small plastic resealable bag containing methylamphetamine. ‘Steve’ then handed the accused $100. The methylamphetamine weighed at 0.6 grams. 
        
       
       
        
        About 4.22 pm on Tuesday the 13th December 2005 ‘Steve’ attended 60 Adelphi Crescent, Doonside. ‘Steve’ engaged in conversation with the applicant. A short time later the applicant handed a small plastic resealable bag containing methylamphetamine which was subsequently weighed at 0.8 grams. 
        
       
       
        
        About 10 am on Thursday the 15th December 2005 ‘Steve’ attended 60 Adelphi Crescent Doonside and engaged in a conversation with the applicant who handed him a small resealable bag containing methylamphetamine. He then handed to the co-offender $100. The methylamphetamine was found to weigh 0.7 grams. 
        
       
       
        
        The total of the previous 6 supplies is 4.1 grams. [Charge 2] 
        
       
       
        
        About 10.30 pm on Thursday 15 December police executed a search warrant at the premises 60 Adelphi Crescent, Doonside. The applicant and Matthew Iddles were arrested and cautioned. They were taken to Blacktown police station and placed into custody. They were offered the opportunity to return to the premises whilst the search warrant was being executed by they declined to do so and gave permission to the police to search the premises 60 Adelphi Crescent in the applicant’s absence. 
        
       
       
        
        The applicant participated in a short record of interview. As a result of the search of the premises a number of drug exhibits were seized and later analysed and found to be 5.66 grams of methylamphetamine. Those drugs were packaged in different sizing and pricing for the purpose of supply from the premises. [Charge 3] 
        
       
       
        
        Also located in the premises were 111.9 grams of cannabis the possession of which constituted the offence which is set out in the Form 1.” 
        
       
      
    13 The applicant was 35 years of age at the time of the commission of the offences and was aged 37 years at the date of sentence. She was in a de facto relationship with her co-offender, Matthew Iddles. 
     
      
    14 The relevant subjective matters are set out in the written submissions for the applicant. They include the following. 
     
      
    15 The applicant is a mother of five children, the youngest of whom is to her co-offender, Iddles. The ages of the children at the date of sentence were 17, 14, 9, 8 and 17 months.  
     
      
    16 The applicant left school in 1985 before obtaining her school certificate. She subsequently obtained TAFE qualifications to work in child care assistance. She previously had a difficult upbringing and had an unhappy childhood. She had obtained employment at a local childcare centre as a teachers’ aide over seven year period in a casual capacity. 
     
      
    17 In her previous marriage, it is said that she was subject to domestic violence. The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant was again the subject of violence in her relationship with the co-accused. 
     
      
    18 The applicant was the principal provider and carer of the family unit. 
     
      
    19 The sentencing judge accepted that she had been an excellent mother towards her children, this having been verified by the assistant principal of the school to which her children attended. 
     
      
    20 In relation to the applicant’s background, she commenced drug use at the age of 16 years and progressed to using heroin following her mother’s death when she was 17 years of age. At the age of 18 years, she went onto the methadone programme but at the age of 28 years she withdrew from it. She was on the methadone programme at the date of sentence. 
     
      
    21 Reports of Steve Henkleman, psychologist, dated 19 September 2007 and 25 February 2008 were tendered on the sentencing hearing (Exhibit 3). Mr Henkleman expressed the opinion that the applicant suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder due to the domestic violence to which she had been subjected and additionally suffered from major depression and a panic disorder. 
     
      
    22 Following her arrest on 15 December 2005, she remained in custody for two months and 16 days before being granted bail (she was released from custody on 2 March 2006). 
     
      
    23 She gave birth to her fifth child on 30 March 2006. 
     
      
    24 At the time of the offences, the applicant was on a recognisance from Penrith Local Court on one count of shop lifting. At the time of sentence, she was on bail in relation to a drive whilst disqualified charge. 
     
      
       
      The co-offender 
       
      
    25 On 4 December 2006, Matthew Iddles, her co-offender, was sentenced in the District Court at Penrith by Acting Judge Viney. He pleaded guilty to one count of supply prohibited drug on an ongoing basis contrary to s.25A(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act and three counts of supply prohibited drug contrary to s.25(1) of that Act. In addition, he had a number of offences taken into account on a Form 1. Three of those offences were counts of supply prohibited drug contrary to s.25(1) of the Act, one count of possess prohibited drug contrary to s.10(1) of the Act and one count of conduct drug premises contrary to s.14(1) of the Police Power (Drug Premises) Act 2001 and one count of conduct drug premises contrary to s.36Z(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. 
     
      
    26 The co-offender, in relation to the offence of supply prohibited drug, supplied an undercover operative on four occasions between 8 November and 17 November 2005. On three occasions, the operative paid $100 for amounts of methylamphetamine varying from .28 grams to .42 grams. On one occasion, the operative paid $200 and received .68 grams of methylamphetamine. 
     
      
    27 The three other counts for which Mr Iddles was to be sentenced related to two acts of supply and one deemed supply. The actual supplies occurred on 9 December 2005 and 15 December 2005 when the sale was made to an undercover operative for the amount of $100. On the first occasion, .33 grams of methylamphetamine was supplied and on the second, .17 grams of methylamphetamine was supplied. The third supply related to a deemed supply concerning methylamphetamine found at the premises on 15 December 2005 during the execution of a search warrant. 
     
      
    28 The total weight of methylamphetamine was 5.66 grams. 
     
      
    29 The Form 1 offences taken into account on the ongoing supply charge related to a charge of supplying a prohibited drug (cannabis) on 24 August 2005 for the sum of $50. The cannabis weighed 3.4 grams. 
     
      
    30 A second matter on the Form 1 concerned a charge of supply prohibited drug (cannabis) on 30 August 2005 for the amount of $50. This involved the sale of 2.7 grams of cannabis. The undercover operative also purchase .3 grams of methylamphetamine for $50 (the third supply charge on the Form 1). 
     
      
    31 The possess prohibited drug related to 111.9 grams of cannabis found during the execution of the search warrant. 
     
      
    32 The remaining two matters on the Form 1 related to organising and conducting drug transactions from the premises at Doonside and between 1 December 2005 and 15 December 2005 supplying, organising and conducting drug transactions from the co-offender’s premises. 
     
      
    33 The co-offender was sentenced as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) A non-parole period of 18 months’ imprisonment from 15 December 2005 to 14 June 2007 with an additional term of two years from 15 June 2007 to 14 June 2009. In respect of that sentence, the District Court took into account the matters on the Form 1. 
       
       
      (2) On the other three charges of supply prohibited drug, the co-offender was sentenced to fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months, concurrent with the non-parole period on the first charge to commence on 15 December 2005 and to expire on 14 December 2006. 
       
       
      The remarks on sentence concerning the applicant 
       
      
    34 In his remarks on sentence on 27 February 2008, the sentencing judge addressed the question of parity, noting that Mr Iddles was clearly a co-offender in relation to the offences concerning the applicant and had been sentenced on 4 December 2006. His Honour observed that, whilst the actual offences for which he stood for sentence were not the same as those concerning the applicant, they were in general terms “very similar to the current offences”. His Honour further observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… It is perfectly plain that the two of you were operating an enterprise whereby drugs were supplied from the relevant premises as Doonside …” 
        
       
      
    35 The sentencing judge noted that Mr Iddles was 26 years of age at the time he committed the relevant offences and was, therefore, nine years younger than the applicant. He had an extensive criminal record and it appeared that he has also suffered significantly from depression and other mental health problems. His Honour then stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… I am satisfied also that Mr Iddles’ role in these offences was greater than yours and the reason I have come to that conclusion is this, Mr Iddles quite clearly was a user, he needed to sell these drugs in order to finance his habit and purchase drugs for his own use. You are not a user, but you were involved in them. Now that has a two-fold effect, first of all it indicates to me that Mr Iddles was the more dominant person in the supply of these drugs and I accept your evidence that, although you fully accept that you were responsible for your own actions, you were to some extent subject to pressure from him and, looking at it from the other perspective, you were engaged in an enterprise for financial gain, whereas he was engaged in an enterprise in order to finance an illicit habit. You each have mental problems, so it seems to me that overall there was not much to choose between you in relation to that. When I view the matter taking all the factors into account, it seems to me that a sentence very much the same as that which was imposed on Mr Iddles is appropriate. Were I to do otherwise, it seems to me, that either you or he would have a legitimate sense of grievance, but I think the various factors tend to counterbalance each other so that an appropriate sentence is one that is very similar to that of Mr Iddles.”  
        (Remarks on Sentence, pp.12 to 13) 
        
       
      
    36 The sentencing judge considered whether the applicant was acting under duress at the time of the offences for the purposes of its potential relevance as a mitigating factor pursuant to s.21A(3)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. His Honour did not accept that the applicant had acted under duress but he stated “… nevertheless I am satisfied that you were influenced in committing this offence by Mr Iddles and to that extent I do take it into account as an ameliorating factor …” (Remarks on Sentence, p.14). 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The applicant suffers a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed upon her with the sentence imposed under her co-offender, Matthew Iddles 
       
       
      (1) The parity principle 
       
      
    37 In Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606, Gibbs CJ at 609 observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender, and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence, have to be taken into account. The fact that one co-offender has received a sentence which is more severe than that imposed on a co-offender whose circumstances are comparable would provide no reason in logic for reducing the former sentence, if the only question were whether that sentence, viewed in isolation, was manifestly excessive … 
        
       
       
        
        It may be said that the very existence of the disparity reveals that an error must have been committed, but I would prefer frankly to acknowledge that the reason why the court interferes in such a case is that it considers that the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words, to give the appearance that justice has not been done. The decision whether the existence of a disparity calls for intervention is a matter which lies very much within the discretion of the Court of Criminal Appeal.” 
        
       
      
    38 In Lowe (supra), Mason J at pp.210 to 211 observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Just as consistency in punishment – a reflection of the notion of equal justice – is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice, so inconsistency in punishment, because it is regarded as a badge of unfairness and unequal treatment under the law, is calculated to lead to an erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice. It is for this reason that the avoidance and elimination of unjustifiable discrepancy in sentencing is a matter of abiding importance to the administration of justice and to the community …” 
        
       
      
    39 In the present case, the question is whether, as between the applicant and her co-offender who received a comparable sentence in respect of the offences in question, in particular, the offence under s.25A of the Act, there were differentiating circumstances. If such are established, then the lack of disparity between the sentence may be taken as bespeaking error: Lovelock v The Queen (1978) 33 FLR 132 at 136 to 137 per Brennan J. 
     
      
    40 In Lowe (supra), Dawson J observed at p.623:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… There is no rule of law which requires co-offenders to be given the same sentence for the same offence even if no distinction can be drawn between them. Obviously where the circumstances of each offender or of his involvement in the offence are different then different sentences may be called for. But justice should be even-handed and it has come to be recognised both here and in England that any difference between the sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence ought not be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the offender with the heavier sentence or to give the appearance that justice has not been done …” 
        
       
      
    41 Dawson J added that, on any view the interference of a court of appeal is not warranted unless the disparity is such that the sentence under appeal cannot be allowed to stand without it appearing that justice has not been done “… the difference between the sentences must be manifestly excessive and call for the intervention of an appellate court in the interests of justice …” (at p.624). 
     
      
    42 In Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295, Dawson and Gaudron JJ at 301 observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated. On some occasions, different sentences may indicate that one or more of them is infected with error. Ordinarily, correction of the error will result in there being a due proportion between the sentences and there will then be equal justice.” 
        
       
      
    43 Accordingly, in general terms, it may be stated that the parity principle involves a question of due proportion between the sentences of co-offenders and that that is a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality. 
     
      
       
      (2) Factual findings 
       
      
    44 In considering Ground 1 (parity), it is necessary to refer to the evidence and findings made concerning the respective roles and criminality of the applicant and her co-offender. 
     
      
    45 The documentary evidence adduced at the hearing on behalf of the applicant included the following:- 
     
      
       
      (1) A Pre-Sentence Report dated 27 September 2007 written by Terri Roumanous, Probation and Parole Officer. 
       
       
      (2) Report of Steve Henkelman, psychologist, dated 18 September 2007. 
       
       
      (3) Report of Steve Henkelman dated 25 September 2008. 
       
       
      (4) Character references (three references). 
       
       
      (5) Report of Ms Jacqui Marquis, Child and Family Case Worker dated 4 December 2007. 
       
      
    46 The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge on 27 February 2008 and was cross-examined by counsel appearing for the Crown. 
     
      
    47 The particular findings of significance are those concerning the co-offender’s role as against that of the applicant. As earlier noted in the extract from the remarks on sentence, these included the following:-  
     
      
       
      (1)  
      “… I am satisfied that Mr Iddles’ role in these offences was greater than yours …” 
       and his Honour stated reasons for that conclusion. 
       
       
      (2) That the co-offender  
      “… was the more dominant person in the supply of these drugs …” 
       (Remarks on Sentence, p.12). 
       
       
      (3)  
      “… I accept your evidence that, although you fully accepted you were responsible for your own actions, you were to some extent subject to pressure from him …” 
       (Remarks on Sentence, pp.12 to 13). 
       
       
      (4) Whilst the sentencing judge did not accept that the applicant had acted under duress, he stated as noted above  
      “… nevertheless I am satisfied that you were influenced in committing this offence by Mr Iddles and to that extent I do take it into account as an ameliorating factor” 
       (Remarks on Sentence, p.14). 
       
      
    48 The evidence established that the applicant’s personal relationship with her co-offender was one in which she occupied a subservient position. This is reflected in the finding made by the sentencing judge:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Again it would appear that your relationship has been marked by considerable violence towards you …”  
        (Remarks on Sentence, p.8) 
        
       
      
    49 Added to this is the finding that the co-offender was the more dominant person in the supply of the drugs and that in relation thereto that she was subjected to pressure from him. In estimating the full impact the relationship had upon the applicant’s culpability it is necessary that there be a proper appreciation of the applicant’s personal condition. At a critical period, namely, September 2005, she recommenced the methadone maintenance programme. She was by then pregnant with her last child. As the Pre-Sentence Report dated 2 October 2007 recorded (p.2), the applicant commenced on the programme at that time “as a result of her depression and developed dependency to methadone”. The author of that report, Terri Roumanous, Probation and Parole Officer, referred to the applicant’s personal position in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Bowden did not dispute the police facts and stated that she takes full responsibility for her behaviour. Conversely, the offender justified and minimised her actions by stating that she was involved in a relationship characterised by domestic violence, therefore she felt that by selling the illicit substances it would prevent an argument from occurring within the relationship. The offender maintains that she did not engage in the current offences for financial gain.” 
        
       
      
    50 A little later in the same report (p.3), Ms Roumanous stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Bowden presented with significant mental health issues. Whilst admitting her actions were wrong, she continuously justified these given feelings of intimidation by her partner.” 
        
       
      
    51 The applicant gave evidence that she became pregnant in about July 2005 and throughout that that year she remained in an abusive relationship with Mr Iddles and that she had always been intimidated by him. 
     
      
    52 In his detailed report dated 18 September 2007, Mr Henkelman, psychologist, recorded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… Ms Bowden stated that she feared that if she did not co-operate, that the undercover policeman would then contact her de facto and tell her de facto that Ms Bowden refused to co-operate. Ms Bowden was very fearful of ongoing violence if she did not co-operate. She stated that she wanted to do ‘anything’ to avoid the attacks and the violence. Ms Bowden stated that she received no financial gain from supplying and all the proceeds from this went to her de facto. Ms Bowden stated that her only interest in participating in this activity was quite simply to avoid being assaulted by her de facto. Ms Bowden stated that at the time of the offences she had recommenced on methadone, as indicated, as she was not coping. Ms Bowden stated that in retrospect she can acknowledge that her behaviour was irresponsible and she is extremely remorseful for her actions.” 
         (p.6) 
        
       
      
    53 The effect of the applicant’s evidence was that, although she accepted responsibility for her actions, Mr Iddles’ drug-affected behaviour and the disturbance it caused was, in the applicant’s experience, ameliorated if he had access to drugs. In her evidence in chief, she stated that, at the time she was pregnant “… and going through depression it was easier for me to do what he wanted …” (Remarks on Sentence, p.15). In cross-examination, the applicant was asked about the abusive relationship and she gave evidence that meeting his demand for drugs had the effect of alleviating problems associated with his conduct. She gave evidence on this aspect in cross-examination:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. If you had refused to help Matthew Iddles with his supply of drugs, what do you say would have been the result? You say you felt intimidated according to the author of the Probation Report, what were you concerned about? 
         
        A. It was more if he was on drugs, he was – it was more bearable, it was just easier, you know, if he was racing around trying to get drugs, then I’d have to deal with things like worrying about my kids’ PlayStations being hocked or my daughter’s friends’ phones being stolen which had occurred in the past. You know, like I know that he didn’t force me to do it, you know, like I’m not saying he forced me to do it, but it was just easier to deal with than have to worry about the other consequences. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So was it intimidation that he was exerting or was it other pressure because you were worried about him stealing from your children? 
         
        A. I’ve always been intimidated by Matthew, I still am to this day. I’m intimidated by Matthew, but I just don’t know why. I – you know that’s the part of why I’m receiving counselling, that’s the part of why I’m receiving counselling, that’s the therapy that I’m receiving from my social worker and my psychologist.” 
         (Remarks on Sentence, p.27) 
        
       
      
    54 The only conclusion to be drawn from the findings made and the evidence to which I have referred is that the applicant was not a fully functioning equal partner with Mr Iddles in their relationship generally or, in particular, in relation to their drug dealing including the offences to which she entered guilty pleas. The assessment by the learned sentencing judge of her culpability as against that of her co-offender clearly had to take into account both the co-offender’s more dominant role in relation to the illegal enterprise and the subject offences and his more dominant position in the personal relationship with the applicant in which he meted out violence which the sentencing judge accepted operated to pressure and influence her. On these findings, it is impossible, in my opinion, to conclude that her culpability was similar to that of Mr Iddles. Not only was the co-offender the principal offender in terms of objective culpability, but the applicant’s relationship and personal circumstances rendered her vulnerable to his demands. The sentencing judge having found that his conduct had an effect upon her in terms of “pressure” and “influence”, there plainly was a marked disparity in the circumstances between them. 
     
      
    55 Apart from those circumstances, the sentencing judge placed the applicant on an equal footing with her co-offender in terms of culpability by taking into account what were said to be counterbalancing factors. These included the financial gain which the applicant supposedly made from the drug supplies. In that respect, he stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… You were engaged in an enterprise for financial gain, whereas he was engaged in an enterprise in order to finance an illicit habit …” 
        
       
      
    56 The sentencing judge concluded the passage by saying:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… I think the various factors tend to counterbalance each other so that an appropriate sentence is one that is very similar to that of Mr Iddles.” 
         (Remarks on Sentence, p.13) 
        
       
      
    57 On the evidence and the way in which the sentencing proceedings were conducted, in my opinion, it was not open to the sentencing judge to find as a counterbalancing factor that the applicant financially benefited in contrast to Mr Iddles who, it was found, committed the offences in order to finance his illicit habit. 
     
      
    58 The applicant’s motivation for engaging in the drug supplies was specifically addressed in two reports tendered before the sentencing judge. I have referred to one of these earlier. In the report by Ms Roumanous of 27 September 2007, under the heading “Attitude to the Offence(s)” (p.3), she recorded, inter alia:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… she was involved in a relationship characterized by domestic violence, therefore she felt that by selling the illicit substances, it would prevent an argument from occurring within the relationship.  
        The offender maintains that she did not engage in the current offences for financial gain 
        .”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    59 In Mr Henkelman’s report of 18 September 2007 (p.6), it is recorded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… Ms Bowden was very fearful of ongoing violence if she did not cooperate. She stated that she wanted to do ‘anything’ to avoid the attacks and the violence.  
        Ms Bowden stated that she received no financial gain from supplying and all the proceeds from this went to her defacto 
         …” 
         (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    60 The applicant was cross-examined on one particular aspect of Mr Henkelman’s second report. However, she was not challenged at all in relation to her statements to Ms Roumanous or to Mr Henkelman that she had not, in fact, gained financially from engaging in the offences but that the financial gains received were for the benefit of Mr Iddles. I am of the opinion that the sentencing judge was in error when he stated, “… you were engaged in an enterprise for financial gain, whereas he was engaged in an enterprise in order to finance an illicit habit …”. That finding assumed importance for it clearly operated as a factor, in the sentencing judge’s words, that counterbalanced the matters that were favourable to the applicant. The finding as to financial gain was directly material to the sentencing judge’s ultimate conclusion that an appropriate sentence for Count 2 was one that was similar to that imposed upon the co-offender by Acting Judge Viney on 4 December 2006.  
     
      
    61 There is a further and separate matter requiring comment. As earlier noted, the applicant was, at the time of the offences, subject to a s.9 bond in relation to shoplifting offences and was on bail in relation to a drive whilst disqualified charge. The sentencing judge found that the offence was aggravated in accordance with the provisions of s.21A(2) by the fact the offences were committed whilst she was on conditional liberty (s.21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). 
     
      
    62 In Frigiani v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 81, Howie J at [24] observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear that the prior matter was relevant in two ways. Firstly, it was an aggravating factor because the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced was committed in breach of a good behaviour bond. That is an aggravating factor listed in s.21A(2)(j) regardless of the conduct in respect of which the bond was imposed.  
        However, it is generally considered to be more aggravating when the conduct is similar to that for which the offender is being sentenced. 
         The second paragraph of his Honour’s remarks quoted above reflects this fact.” 
         (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    63 In the present case, the s.9 bond had not been imposed in respect of a drug offence but, as earlier indicated, related to a shoplifting offence. Whilst it was an aggravating factor, it was not, in my opinion, a significant counterbalancing one in determining the applicant’s culpability as compared to that of her co-offender. 
     
      
    64 In summary, the evidence established that there was a significant disparity in the circumstances of the applicant and the offender. Those circumstances were central to the assessment of their respective culpability. The applicant’s co-offender, by reason of the matters discussed above, was the principal in the enterprise associated with the offences. On the evidence it was not correct for the sentencing judge to find that the applicant derived financial gain in contrast to the co-offender who was offending to finance a drug habit. The applicant openly admitted that she knew what she was doing in committing the offences and they were objectively serious offences. The evidence was, however, that she was influenced and pressured to commit the offences for the benefit of her co-offender. In making her sentence the equivalent of that of her co-offender in respect of the s.25A offence, the sentencing judge erred. The applicant has, accordingly, established Ground 1 of the appeal. The sentence imposed should be set aside and the applicant should be re-sentenced. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: His Honour was in error in finding that the offence contrary to s.25A, Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 was aggravated by the fact that the offence was committed for financial gain (s.21A(2)(o) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) when this factor was an element of the offence 
       
      
    65 In relation to the offence contrary s.25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the submission was that financial gain was an element of the offence and that it was, accordingly, an error of law by his Honour to have taken it into account as an aggravating factor in respect of the offence under that section: Regina v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 at [22]; Regina v Johnson [2005] NSWCCA 186. The Crown properly conceded that there was, in this respect, in relation to Count 2 “a technical error which, in the context of this case was of little consequence”: Crown’s Written Submissions, paragraph 35. 
     
      
    66 It was contended by Ms Cox of counsel for the applicant that the error did impact upon the sentence imposed upon the applicant, given that the sentence for the offence contrary to s.25A was “the real effective sentence imposed upon the applicant (given that all other sentences were made concurrent with the sentence)” (Applicant’s Written Submissions, paragraph 69). 
     
      
    67 I will return to the significance of this error below. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: His Honour was in error in finding that the offences were aggravated in that each of them were part of a planned or organised criminal activity within the meaning of s.21A(2)(n), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
       
      
    68 It was contended on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge was in error in regarding the offences for which the applicant stood to be sentenced as being aggravated by the fact that they were part of a planned or organised criminal activity within the meaning of s.21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    69 In this respect, it was contended for the applicant that there was, in the circumstances of the case, nothing out of the ordinary in the way the applicant and her co-offender went about the business of selling drugs. The amounts involved in the sales were small. It was contended that overall, it was a small scale operation where the level of planning involved was no more than that which amounted to an inherent characteristic in the offence of ongoing drug supply: Elyard v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 43. This, it was said, was not a case, for example, involving a drug trafficking organisation capable of supplying large amounts of different types of drugs to order.  
     
      
    70 I am of the view that there was an error as the applicant contends in relation to the issue of “planned or organised criminal activity”. 
     
      
    71 In Regina v Yildiz [2006] NSWCCA 97, Simpson J at [37] to [39] considered the circumstances in which the degree of planning may be taken into account as an aggravating feature. Her Honour observed that by s.21A(2) the fact that an offence is part of a planned or organised criminal activity is a matter a sentencing judge is obliged to take into account as an aggravating feature but the Court is expressly enjoined against taking into account any aggravating feature if it is an element of the offence charged. That injunction, as her Honour observed, had been extended to circumstances that are “an inherent characteristic” of the offence charged: Elyard (supra) per Howie J. Her Honour, however, further observed at [37]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… But this principle does not mean that the degree to which the ‘inherent characteristic’ exists in relation to a particular offence may not, where it exceeds the norm, be taken into account as an aggravating factor.” 
        
       
      
    72 I do not consider that the evidence in the present case enabled the sentencing judge to evaluate the planning involved in the offences as exceeding that which was inherent in the offence. In that respect, the observations of Simpson J in Yildiz (supra), in my view, apply in this case:- 
     
      
       
        
        “39. As in  
        Elyard 
        , there was no evidence that would permit a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the degree of planning in this case exceeded what would ordinarily be expected of an offence of this kind – that is, the degree of planning that would be inherent in the possession of a large quantity of drugs for the purpose of supply. I therefore conclude that what was said was an error …” 
        
       
      
    73 Ms Cox also relied upon the observations of Howie J (with whom Simpson and Buddin JJ agreed) in Fahs v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 26:- 
     
      
       
        
        “21. The aggravating factor under s.21A(2)(n) is that ‘the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity’. The wording of this provision seems to me to convey more than simply that the offence was planned. The fact that there was a ‘level of planning in the offences’ as found by the Judge does not necessarily give rise to the aggravating factor in s.21A(2)(n). In  
        R v Wickham 
         [2004] NSWCCA 193 the Court stressed the importance of making findings under s.21A in accordance with the words of the provision. 
        
       
       
        
        22. Had the only relevant factor been the existence of planning in the commission of the offence, there might have been a valid argument that planning was an inherent characteristic of every offence involving on-going or commercial drug trafficking: see  
        Elyard v R 
         [2006] NSWCCA 43. But it is not an inherent characteristic of supplying drugs that it is ‘part of a planned or organized criminal activity’ in the sense that those words convey. For example, I do not believe those words apply to the normal street dealer who purchases drugs from various sources simply to obtain the wherewithal to purchase drugs for his own use. Therefore, in an appropriate case this aggravating factor can be taken into account when sentencing for drug trafficking offences. In this case it would have been open to the Judge to find that such a factor existed in respect of each of the offences because it was clear that the applicant was committing the crimes as part of a drug trafficking organisation capable of supplying large amounts of different types of drugs to order.” 
        
       
      
    74 Notwithstanding the Crown’s reliance upon the observation of the sentencing judge that it was plain that there was a significant operation of supplying drugs being conducted from the premises in question and the fact that the drugs were readily supplied upon request on a number of occasions and the other matters to which the Crown refers, I do not consider that the sentencing judge was entitled to regard the evidence as supporting the application of s.21A(2)(n). His Honour did not express any reasons for his conclusion that it did apply and, in my opinion, there were no matters established by the evidence that would establish planning beyond that which is involved as an element or an inherent aspect of the offences charged. Accordingly, this ground of appeal, in my opinion, should be upheld. 
     
      
    75 The effect of the error to which Ground 2 refers, in my opinion, compounds the error in relation to Ground 1, whilst the error in relation to Ground 3, though not directly impacting upon the parity issue, still represents a significant error in sentencing. 
     
      
    76 The applicant was granted leave to file and, in the event of the appeal being successful, that she be entitled to rely upon the affidavit of Ashleigh Bowden affirmed on 11 November 2008 and the affidavit of Bianca Tighe, solicitor, affirmed on 12 November 2008. Those affidavits have been read. 
     
      
    77 The orders I propose are as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      (2) The appeal be upheld. 
       
       
      (3) The sentences imposed in respect of Count 2, ongoing supply of prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) contrary to s.25A(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
       be set aside and the applicant be re-sentenced by this Court. 
       
       
      (4) That in respect of Count 2, the applicant be sentenced to a non-parole period of one year to commence on 27 February 2008 and to expire on 26 February 2009 with a balance of term of one year and six months to commence on 27 February 2009 and to expire on 26 August 2010. 
       
       
      (5) Pursuant to s.50(1) of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      , an order directing the release of the applicant on parole at the end of the non-parole period specified in order (4) above, namely, 26 February 2009. 
       
      
    78 The balance of the total term of imprisonment exceeds one third of the non-parole period by reason of the finding of special circumstances which the sentencing judge determined which finding was properly made given the need for a lengthy period of supervised parole to assist in the applicant’s rehabilitation and the fact that she has dependent children, one of whom is of a very young age. 
     
      
    79 In accordance with the order proposed in paragraph [77(5)], the applicant is to be released to parole forthwith.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I will ask Price J to deliver the first judgment.  
     
      
    2 PRICE J: On 28 February 2008 the applicant in the District Court adhered to the pleas of guilty which he had entered in the Local Court to six charges which had been commenced by Court Attendance Notices. 
     
      
    3 The first charge alleged a break, enter and steal between 2 April 2007 and 3 April 2007 contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment. The second charge alleged a demand property with menaces with intent to steal, whilst in company on 8 April 2007 contrary to s 99(2) of the Crimes Act. This offence also carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. The third charge alleged a robbery in company on 8 April 2007 contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment. The fourth charge alleged malicious damage to property between 2 April 2007 and 3 April 2007 contrary to s 195(1) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is 5 years imprisonment. The fifth charge alleged a demand property with menaces with intent to steal on 14 May 2007 contrary to s 99(1) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment. The sixth charge alleged a robbery on 14 April 2007 contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 The applicant asked the Judge to take into account on sentence two matters on a Form 1, namely a receiving on 6 May 2007 and a larceny on 14 May 2007.  
     
      
    5 The applicant was sentenced by the Judge on 13 March 2008. In respect of charges 2 and 5, he was sentenced to fixed terms of 2 years imprisonment to date from 30 May 2007 and to expire on 29 May 2009. In respect of charges 4 and 6, fixed terms of 18 months imprisonment to date from 30 May 2007 and to expire on 29 November 2008 were imposed. A fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years to date from 30 May 2009 and to expire on 29 May 2011 was imposed for charge 1. For charge 3, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 30 November 2009 and to expire on 29 November 2012 with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months to expire on 29 May 2015. 
     
      
    6 The total effective sentence was 8 years commencing on 30 May 2007 and expiring on 29 May 2015 with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months commencing on 30 May 2007 and expiring on 29 November 2012, the date upon which the applicant is eligible for release to parole. 
     
      
    7 The two offences on the Form 1 were taken into account by the Judge in the sentences imposed for the third charge.  
     
      
    8 The facts of the offences were stated by the Judge in his remarks on sentence in accordance with the Crown brief which had been tendered without objection. The facts have been conveniently summarised in chronological order in the Crown’s written submissions as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Charge 1: Between 5pm on 2 April 2007 and 7am on 3 April 2007 the applicant broke into a multi-storey residential unit complex in Johnson Street Mascot, which was undergoing renovation and refurbishment. Entry was gained to all nine units in the complex and a quantity of items, including mainly whitegoods and furniture, was stolen. The goods were valued at a total of $8,282. 
        
       
       
        
        Charge 4: During the break and enter a number of whitegoods and door locks were damaged. The replacement cost of the damaged items was $10,460 and the labour costs involved in repairing damage occasioned to the premises was $5,616. 
        
       
       
        
        Charge 2: At about 9pm on 8 April 2007 the applicant approached two males who were waiting at a bus stop on Botany Road at Mascot. He engaged the males in conversation and asked them if they would fight if someone tried to take their wallets. The applicant made a phone call and was joined by another male. The applicant then demanded the victims’ wallets and the victims ran from the scene. 
        
       
       
        
        Charge 3: At about 9.30pm on 8 April 2007 the applicant and another male approached the victim, a 16 year old male, when he was standing in a phone box in Mascot. The applicant said to the victim, “We don’t want to fight you we just want your money” and the victim replied, “I don’t have any”. The applicant searched the victim and robbed him of his mobile phone which was in his pocket.  
        
       
       
        
        Charge 6: At about 9.40pm on 14 April 2007 the victim, a pizza delivery driver, delivered food in Macintosh Street, Mascot. As the victim was returning to his vehicle he was approached by the applicant, who said, “Show me the money”. The victim said, “I don’t have any money” and the applicant said, “You just made a delivery”. The victim tried unsuccessfully to stop a passing motorist, at which time the applicant grabbed a pencil case from him which was used to carry money. The applicant took $60 from the pencil case and walked away. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Charge 5: At about 1.03pm on 14 May 2007 the applicant entered the BP service station on Botany Road, Mascot. He approached the two attendants and asked to be given a packet of cigarettes on credit. The request was declined and the applicant walked to the fridge where he removed a bottle of coke and drank from it (the theft of the soft drink constituted the offence of larceny on the Form 1). The applicant became angry when he was refused credit and he said to the attendants, “If I come back with a mask what will you do?” One of the attendants replied, “That is not the proper way”. The applicant said, “If I come back with a mask you will have to give me money. I can shoot you”. The applicant was very aggressive and was pacing back and forth in an intimidating manner, causing both attendants to fear for their safety. They believed that the applicant was threatening to return to the premises and commit an armed robbery. In an attempt to diffuse the situation one of the attendants gave the offender two of his own cigarettes. The applicant left the store and the police were called.  
        
       
       
        
        The applicant was arrested approximately 40 minutes later when he was crossing the road directly outside the service station. At the time of arrest the applicant was wearing a pair of almost new Nike running shoes which were later identified as the proceeds of a demand money with menaces incident that occurred in King Street, Mascot on 6 May 2007 (the possession of the shoes constituted the offence of receiving on the Form 1).  
        
       
      
    9 The applicant was born on 15 January 1986 and was 21 years old at the time of the offending. Evidence of his subjective circumstances was put before the Judge by way of a report of Mr Tim Watson-Munro, a psychologist, a pre-sentence report dated 13 February 2008 and the oral evidence of the applicant himself. 
     
      
    10 When the applicant was born his mother was 14 years old. Because of her drug use, he was removed from her care and placed in a succession of foster homes. He was re-united with her at the age of twelve after she had established that she had ceased using drugs. He told the psychologist that his time in foster care was highly traumatic in the context of his strong desire to be with his mother whom he viewed “like an older sister”. He described a range of behavioural problems during his formative years which caused him to be placed in a number of special behaviour schools. Having attained year 9 standard, he left school at the age of 16 years and then worked night shift in a bakery for 5 years. He also worked briefly as a film extra and as a general hand in a hamburger store. During a period of unemployment prior to his arrest, he was in receipt of unemployment benefits which enabled him to develop his talent as a singer/songwriter.  
     
      
    11 The applicant has a long standing problem with both alcohol and illicit drugs. He told the psychologist that he had started drinking alcohol at about the age of 13 and had a protracted history of alcoholic blackouts. At about the age of 16, he commenced using crystal methylamphetamines (Ice) which he continued to use up until the time of arrest. He had also used cannabis, cocaine and ecstacy. The applicant told Mr Hannagan, the author of the pre-sentence report, that he had committed the offences to support a burgeoning drug habit which was out of control. 
     
      
    12 The psychologist noted a complex developmental history and attendant to this long standing issues with drug abuse. He opined that the applicant had been severely traumatised by placement in foster care at a very young age and there was no doubt that this accounted for his continuing insecurities, depression and anxiety as an adult. The psychologist observed that the applicant had been drug-free whilst in custody and appeared to be more focussed upon his rehabilitation and insightful to the dynamics behind his problems.  
     
      
    13 Mr Hannagan wrote that the applicant had been attending AA meetings and had received counselling whilst in custody. He reported that people who knew the applicant well had been impressed at the way the applicant had taken constructive advantage of his time in custody resulting in a marked improvement in his attitudes. Mr Hannagan expressed the opinion that the applicant’s prognosis for refraining from re-offending was optimistic if his present attitudes persisted. 
     
      
    14 During his testimony before the Judge, the applicant expressed his shame for what he had done and his deep sorrow for having put people in fear by his actions. He said it would not happen again.  
     
      
    15 The Judge accepted that the applicant was remorseful. His Honour sympathetically considered the applicant’s subjective circumstances and found that the attempts at rehabilitation, the need for continuing rehabilitation together with his relative youth and first time in custody were special circumstances enabling him to vary the statutory ratio. For the pleas of guilty, his Honour allowed a utilitarian discount of 25 per cent.  
     
      
    16 The applicant’s prior criminal history, his Honour remarked, included an offence of break and enter in 2002 and an offence of destroy and damage property on 8 November 2005 for which he was placed on a s 9 bond to be of good behaviour for 18 months. His Honour observed that the applicant was in breach of this bond when the first four offences were committed. The break and enter offence to which the Judge referred was dealt with in the Children’s Court.  
     
      
    17 The first ground of appeal complains that the sentence imposed for the offence of robbery in company (charge 3) is manifestly excessive. The applicant pointed out that the starting point of the sentence was approximately 7 years 4 months before an allowance for the utilitarian discount for the plea of 25 per cent was made. 
     
      
    18 It was submitted that the sentence should have been towards the lower end of the sentencing guideline promulgated in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 which identified a common category of case having the following features:  
     
      
       
        
        “(i) Young offender with no or little criminal history; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; 
        
       
      
     (iii) Limited degree of planning; 
     
      
     (iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; 
     
      
       
        
        (v) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; 
        
       
      
     (vi) Small amount taken;  
     
      
       
        
        (vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.” 
        
       
      
    19 For an offender with those characteristics, the guideline sentence promulgated was a head sentence of between four and five years. This range takes into account a 10 per cent discount for the plea. The guideline judgment which applies to offences of robbery in company as well as to offences of armed robbery is intended to be a relevant guidepost in the exercise of sentencing discretion and as pointed out by Spigelman CJ in Legge v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 244 at [59] was “not a tramline”.  
     
      
    20 The factors identified in (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) apply to the present case. The victim was in a vulnerable position being alone at night in a telephone box. Violence was threatened verbally and by the presence of the applicant and his co-offender. A mobile phone was taken. Whilst the applicant is a young offender with a limited criminal history, an aggravating factor was the commission of the offence whilst on conditional liberty. 21 On the other hand, the reduction for the guilty plea was 25 per cent. 
     
      
    22 His Honour was also asked to take into account two matters on the Form 1. They were, however, minor matters of dishonesty involving the theft of a bottle of coca-cola and the receiving of a stolen pair of running shoes. Form 1 offences of such a nature could not have significantly impacted upon the sentence to be imposed.  
     
      
    23 No reference was made by the Judge in his sentencing remarks to the guideline identified in Henry. He imposed a head sentence of 5 years 6 months after making allowance of 25 per cent for the plea. The sentence was above the high end of the range specified in Henry and could not in my respectful opinion be justified by the factor of aggravation and the Form 1 offences. There was also to be considered the applicant’s remorse and the positive steps taken by him towards rehabilitation. 
     
      
    24 In my respectful opinion, the sentence imposed for charge 3 was outside the legitimate range of sentencing discretion and I find the first ground of appeal established.  
     
      
    25 The remaining ground of appeal is that the total effective sentence is manifestly excessive. The particular complaint is that the sentences imposed for charges 1 and 3 are cumulative upon the sentences for charges 2 and 5.  
     
      
    26 For charge 2 (demand property in company) and charge 5 (demand property with menaces) concurrent fixed terms of 2 years imprisonment were imposed each to date from 30 May 2007. For charge 4 (malicious damage to property) and charge 6 (robbery) concurrent fixed terms of 18 months imprisonment were imposed which were also to date from 30 May 2007. The sentences for charges 4 and 6 were wholly subsumed within the sentences for charges 2 and 5. Each of these offences involved separate criminal acts and separate victims and his Honour’s approach to the structure of these sentences could be regarded as generous to the applicant. A measure of partial accumulation might have been called for.  
     
      
    27 For charge 1 (the offence of break, enter and steal) the fixed term of 2 years imprisonment was wholly accumulated on the sentences for charges 2 and 5. The sentence for charge 3 (robbery in company) was partially accumulated upon the sentence for charge 1 commencing as it did 6 months after the commencement of the sentence for the first charge.  
     
      
    28 Questions of concurrence or accumulation are a discretionary matter for the sentencing Judge but that “discretion is generally circumscribed by a proper application of the principle of totality”: R v MMK (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 at [13].  
     
      
    29 It is clear from what was said by the Judge that he considered the principle of totality. His Honour considered that he was obliged to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then to consider questions of concurrence or accumulation as well as the question of totality: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610.  
     
      
    30 Charges 1 and 3 each involved separate criminal acts of a serious kind. Concurrent sentences had been imposed for the other charges. It was, in my opinion, open to the Judge to determine that the sentence for charge 1 should be wholly accumulated on the sentences for charges 2 and 5 and the sentence for charge 3 should be partially accumulated on the sentence for charge 1. I do not detect error in the structure of the sentences. As a consequence of the length of the sentence for charge 3, I am, however, satisfied that the total effective sentence was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    Re-sentence  
     
      
    31 In my respectful opinion some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The sentence for charge 3 should be reduced from 5 years 6 months to 4 years 6 months. The non-parole period for that sentence should be reduced from 3 years to 2 years.  
     
      
    32 For the reasons given by his Honour I maintain the finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    33 The total effective sentence that I propose will be 7 years commencing on 30 May 2007 and expiring on 29 May 2014 with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months commencing on 30 May 2007 and expiring on 29 November 2011.  
     
      
    34 Accordingly, I propose the following orders:  
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
      
     2. Appeal against sentence allowed in the following respect: 
     
      
       
      Quash the sentence imposed for the offence contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act (the third charge). In lieu thereof, taking into account the Form 1 offences impose a sentence of a non-parole period of two years commencing on 30 November 2009 and expiring on 29 November 2011 with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months expiring on 29 May 2014.  
       
      
     3. In all other respects confirm the sentences imposed by the Judge.  
     
      
       
      The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release to parole is 29 November 2011.  
       
      
    35 GROVE J: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    36 BUDDIN J: I also agree.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I agree with Rothman J. 
     
      
    2 ROTHMAN J: On 17 March 2006, a jury found Steven John Berrier not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. He had been charged with murder following the stabbing of Mr Lucas Bruin on 19 April 2004 at Prospect. Mr Berrier pleaded not guilty and was tried before Hidden J and a jury, the trial lasting just under four weeks.  
     
      
    3 The Crown asserted, at the trial, that Mr Berrier had stabbed Mr Bruin deliberately, with an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm, without provocation and not in self-defence. Mr Berrier conducted the trial on the basis that the stabbing was not intentional, and the evidence at the trial raised issues as to self-defence and/or provocation. His Honour directed the jury on, amongst other things, provocation, excessive self-defence and manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act.  
     
      
    4 Justice Hidden sentenced Mr Berrier on 21 December 2006. He did so on the basis of provocation manslaughter, rejecting the submission of Mr Berrier that the sentence should be based on excessive self-defence, and accepting the Crown submission that Mr Berrier should be sentenced on the basis of provocation. His Honour Justice Hidden imposed a custodial sentence, being a non-parole period of 6 years, commencing 19 April 2004 and expiring on 18 April 2010, with a balance of term of 3 years, expiring on 18 April 2013.  
     
      
    5 Mr Berrier appeals the sentence imposed by Hidden J on the following bases: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) the sentencing judge erred in determining an appropriate sentence when he held that of two bases for manslaughter, namely excessive self-defence and provocation, provocation calls for a heavier sentence and proceeded to sentence the offender on that basis; 
         
         
        (b) the sentencing judge failed to take into account material considerations when assessing the circumstances of the offence (and the offender) relevant to determining an appropriate sentence; and 
         
         
        (c) the sentence is manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
    6 It is necessary to deal, more fully, with the facts and the basis of the findings of his Honour, before dealing with each of the grounds of appeal, which grounds also address the application for leave to appeal.  
     
      
    Facts and Remarks on Sentence 
     
      
    7 There had been a history of animosity between the applicant, Mr Berrier and the deceased Mr Bruin, relating to the intertwining relationships of Mr Bruin’s close friend, Mr Flynn, who was the former partner of Mr Berrier’s partner. One matter of significance, mentioned by his Honour, was that the deceased, Mr Bruin, became aware of an allegation that the applicant, Mr Berrier, had mistreated his stepchild, being the child of Mr Berrier’s partner and Mr Flynn. At the time, Mr Flynn (the father of Mr Berrier’s stepchild) was serving a term of imprisonment.  
     
      
    8 On the afternoon of 19 April 2004, Mr Berrier was walking with his partner, pushing the stepchild in a pram. Mr Bruin approached and confronted Mr Berrier, accusing him of having hit the child. There was a fight, in which the two men exchanged punches. Mr Bruin went to a house (“Mr Todd’s house”) in the vicinity, which was not his own.  
     
      
    9 Mr Berrier’s partner, angry over the fighting in front of the child, went to Mr Todd’s house to see Mr Bruin and to confront him about the matter. Mr Berrier went to his partner’s mother’s house (where his partner was, at that time, living) and obtained a knife.  
     
      
    10 Mr Berrier approached Mr Bruin at Mr Todd’s house and asked him if he wanted another fight. It seems (according to Hidden J) that Mr Bruin did not notice the knife – it had been concealed in Mr Berrier’s sleeve. Mr Bruin picked up a piece of wood and chased Mr Berrier. Mr Bruin had to jump clear of a car, driven by Mr Berrier’s father, that had turned into the street after which Mr Bruin returned to Mr Todd’s house.  
     
      
    11 Mr Berrier’s case at trial was that he had carried the knife for his own protection and attended at Mr Todd’s house out of concern for his partner. He asserted that he was fearful of the deceased. After Mr Bruin, piece of wood in hand, chased Mr Berrier, swinging the wood towards Mr Berrier, he, Mr Berrier, turned towards Mr Bruin and produced the knife, holding it in front of him, in order to persuade Mr Bruin to “back off”. Mr Berrier’s case was that, in essence, Mr Bruin impaled himself upon the knife. Clearly, the jury rejected this account.  
     
      
    12 On sentence, counsel for Mr Berrier submitted that he should be sentenced on the basis of Mr Berrier’s account of the circumstances, except insofar as his account included the allegation regarding the involuntary nature of the act. On that basis the act was “an act in self-defence”, the response being unreasonable: s 421 of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    13 Evidence adduced by the Crown presented a different scenario. That evidence suggested that Mr Bruin had discarded the piece of wood and was in the front yard of the house trying to break a branch that was lying on the ground.  
     
      
    14 Mr Berrier approached him from behind, causing several onlookers to call out to warn Mr Bruin. Holding nothing in his hands, Mr Bruin rose, turned to face Mr Berrier, and was stabbed. All Crown witnesses described one or more stabbing actions. However, the knife penetrated Mr Bruin’s body only once. Justice Hidden accepted the version of events given by the witnesses, rather than the version of events suggested by counsel for Mr Berrier. This version of events, accepted by his Honour, was clearly open to his Honour and the events were proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    15 His Honour then described the submissions as to the manner in which he should treat the verdict of the jury and the basis upon which the verdict was reached. Counsel for Mr Berrier argued that, as earlier stated, sentencing should occur on the basis of excessive self-defence. On the other hand, the Crown submitted that sentencing should occur on the basis of manslaughter by provocation. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The issue is by no means academic because counsel were agreed – and I share their view – that, of the two bases, provocation calls for a heavier sentence. I would not sentence him for manslaughter by provocation unless I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that is the appropriate basis. I am so satisfied.” 
        
       
      
    16 Further his Honour was satisfied, as he was entitled to be, on the evidence before the Court, that Mr Bruin was “unarmed at the time he was stabbed”. However, his Honour gave Mr Berrier the benefit of the doubt on the question of whether he, Mr Berrier, armed himself with the knife for a defensive or an aggressive purpose. His Honour found the provocation in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The provocation arose from the background of animosity between him [Mr Berrier] and the deceased, the fight earlier in the afternoon, and the aggression displayed by the deceased in chasing him with a piece of wood. In all likelihood, the deceased was intending to renew his aggression when he was attempting to break off a piece of branch immediately before being stabbed. I accept that the offender had been drinking earlier in the afternoon and was to some extent disinhibited by alcohol.” 
        
       
      
    17 His Honour, as one would expect of an extremely experienced sentencing judge, discussed in his Remarks on Sentence the victim impact statement and the subjective case of the offender. Those comments on the subjective case included a reference to the absence of any substantial criminal record, the length of time he has been in custody since his arrest for the charge in question, his early childhood and relationships. His Honour also noted the testing by Mr Berrier’s psychologist that disclosed that Mr Berrier had a level of intellectual functioning that was very low, falling at the upper end of the developmentally disabled range. The Remarks on Sentence also repeated the psychologist’s description of Mr Berrier’s personality as being of “a prominently paranoid disposition”; a man of low esteem, with strong needs for affection and support from others; and with feelings of vulnerability, apprehensiveness, suspicion and defensiveness. His Honour commented that the “personality profile and those intellectual deficits may provide some explanation for his crime”. His Honour found special circumstances.  
     
      
    18 The foregoing, as is obvious, is derived predominantly from his Honour’s remarks on sentence.  
     
      
    Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in determining an appropriate sentence when he held that of two bases of manslaughter, namely excessive self-defence and provocation, provocation calls for a heavier sentence and proceeded to sentence the applicant on that basis 
     
      
    19 The fundamental basis for this alleged error of his Honour is that his Honour was determining a general approach to manslaughter and a grade of seriousness depending upon the nature of the manslaughter and whether, relevantly, it is manslaughter because of excessive self-defence or provocation.  
     
      
    20 As I read the comments of his Honour, his Honour was not setting out a general principle, or a general approach to determining the seriousness of a manslaughter offence. His Honour was faced with two fundamentally inconsistent versions of the circumstances of this particular offence. There may have been further particular differences, even within those versions. His Honour’s determination that it was provocation, and therefore more serious, related to: firstly, the jury’s acceptance of the Crown case that the act of stabbing the deceased was voluntary; and, secondly, his Honour’s acceptance that at the time Mr Berrier stabbed Mr Bruin, Mr Bruin was not armed and was not posing a threat to Mr Berrier (and Mr Berrier did not believe that his conduct was necessary to defend himself).  
     
      
    21 On the other hand, the acceptance by his Honour that provocation was the basis upon which Mr Berrier was convicted of murder necessarily involved an acceptance by his Honour: that the conduct of Mr Bruin induced a loss of self control on the part of Mr Berrier; and, the conduct of Mr Bruin was such as could have induced an ordinary person in Mr Berrier’s position to have lost that self control and to have formed the intent, relevantly, to inflict grievous bodily harm.  
     
      
    22 There is no general, or necessary, difference in culpability in manslaughter, depending upon whether self-defence or provocation is the basis of the verdict. The culpability for each offence depends on the particular circumstances of the offence. His Honour does not find otherwise. His Honour’s comment related to the particular circumstances of this offence. The only issue for determination was whether Mr Berrier had a belief of the necessity to defend himself and that, in turn, depended upon a number of factors including whether Mr Bruin was armed at the time of the stabbing. Given the level of provocation that had existed, and continued to exist, in the particular circumstances of this case, had Mr Bruin been armed with the piece of wood, it would have been a significant factor in the categorisation of the seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    23 Manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life (R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510) and, in the circumstances of this case, on the findings of his Honour, involved an intention to cause grievous bodily harm ameliorated by the existence of provocation. A sentencing judge must be careful not to double count the ameliorating effect of the existence of provocation. 
     
      
    24 Moreover, manslaughter, more than most, is an offence for which there is an extremely wide range of culpability and a correspondingly extremely wide range of appropriate sentences: Salah v R [2009] NSWCCA 2 at [37]; R v Warren Alan Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377; (2005) 160 A Crim R 1, per Spigelman CJ at [133]-[135]; R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349; R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397; R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal, Gleeson CJ, 12 December 1995, unreported). In Blacklidge, Gleeson CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied in such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability.” ( 
        Blacklidge 
        , per Gleeson CJ at p 3.) 
        
       
      
    25 Further, it is trite to remark that each case of manslaughter must depend upon its own circumstances, the range of sentencing being notoriously wide and unable to be categorised, as a matter of general description, into self-defence, provocation and/or unlawful and dangerous act. One can well imagine an offence in any one of such categories being better or worse than examples in the other categories.  
     
      
    26 If his Honour, as is submitted, were to have found that, as a universal or general rule, the necessary consequence of categorising any manslaughter as manslaughter by provocation, as distinct from excessive self-defence, involved categorising the crime as a more serious offence, his Honour would have been incorrect. That, however, is not what his Honour said or did. His Honour was referring particularly to the versions put forward by the Crown and Mr Berrier, and not proposing a general principle. It is noteworthy that his Honour was a member of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 when the Court remarked: 
     
      
       
        
        “The argument for the appellant advanced on this appeal appeared to assume that a case of provocation manslaughter is necessarily, or at least ordinarily, worse than a case of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. We do not accept that. Each case depends upon its own circumstances. The range of sentencing available in the case of manslaughter is notoriously wide. There have been cases where provocation manslaughter has resulted in non-custodial sentences.” ( 
        R v Isaacs 
        , 
          
        per Gleeson CJ, Mason P, Hunt CJ at CL, Simpson and Hidden JJ, by the whole Court, at 381E.) 
        
       
      
    27 As already stated, his Honour’s comment was made in reference to the particular circumstances of this case and, in those circumstances, was open to his Honour and was correct.  
     
      
    28 A finding that the manslaughter was the result of excessive self-defence would have involved a finding that all of the aspects of provocation, otherwise held to exist, continued to exist. In addition, the deceased would have been armed with a piece of wood, which was swung at Mr Berrier, and caused Mr Berrier to believe that stabbing Mr Bruin was necessary to defend himself. Those additional facts are material and would, if they were held to exist, have lessened the culpability of the offence, in these circumstances. This ground of appeal is rejected.  
     
      
    Ground 2: Failure to take into account material considerations 
     
      
    29 Essentially, the material considerations which, it is said, his Honour failed to take into account are: the degree of violence or aggression displayed by Mr Berrier; the level of intellectual functioning; the prominently paranoid personality; and Mr Berrier’s level of intoxication.  
     
      
    30 The submission of the applicant, on this ground, is without merit. I have set out the comments of his Honour as to how Mr Berrier obtained the knife and the purpose for which he was carrying it. Further, I have summarised the circumstances, as his Honour found them, that developed: the lack of premeditation; the reaction to the provocation that was occurring; and, an intention confined to the infliction of grievous bodily harm. His Honour, as earlier summarised, also remarked upon the fact that it was only one stab wound, although, a possibility existed that there were two attempts to stab, only one of which was successful.  
     
      
    31 Counsel for Mr Berrier cited the judgment in R v Alexander (1994) 78 A Crim R 141 at 144 in which Hunt CJ at CL listed three matters to be taken into account when determining an appropriate sentence in provocation manslaughter cases. They were: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) the degree of provocation offered (or, alternatively, the extent of the loss of self-control suffered), which when great has the tendency of reducing the objective gravity of the offence [e.g.  
        Regina v Morabito 
         (1992) 62 ACrimR 83 at 86], 
        
       
       
        
         
        (2) the time between the provocation (whether isolated or cumulative in its effect) and the loss of self-control, which when short also has the tendency of reducing the objective gravity of the offence [e.g.  
        Morabito 
        ], and  
        
       
       
        
         
        (3) the degree of violence or aggression displayed by the prisoner, which when excessive has the tendency of increasing the objective gravity of the offence [e.g.  
        Regina v Kinmond 
         (1982) 5 ACrimR 413 (CCA, WA); at 414, 417;  
        Regina v Collingburn 
         (1985) 18 ACrimR 294 (Full Court, Victoria) at 304].” ( 
        Alexander 
        , 
          
        at 144, per Hunt CJ at CL.) 
        
       
      
    32 A proper analysis of his Honour’s remarks on sentence in this case would show that his Honour accepted a high degree of provocation and a short time period between the provocation and the loss of self-control. No complaint can be made of these two factors, which his Honour plainly took into account.  
     
      
    33 Further, his Honour discussed, at length, the circumstances of the stabbing, which, necessarily, required consideration of the degree of Mr Berrier’s violence or aggression. Moreover, his Honour did not find that there was an excessive degree of violence or aggression displayed by Mr Berrier. It is necessary for the applicant to show error on the part of the sentencing judge. The third aspect in the particular matters listed by Hunt CJ at CL in Alexander does not require a sentencing judge to list all of the matters, which are not taken into account. It may have been error, if his Honour were to have taken into account an excessive degree of violence or aggression, if there were not an excessive degree of violence or aggression. His Honour did not err by failing to mention that he is not taking into account an excessive degree of violence or aggression, in circumstances where his Honour has not found violence or aggression to an excessive degree.  
     
      
    34 It should also be noted that Alexander’s case, and the comments of Hunt CJ at CL, do not suggest that each of the three matters listed (and recited above) are relevant in each case. Nor does it suggest that other matters are not relevant. Each occasion for sentencing, in manslaughter by provocation, will depend upon the particular facts of the case and that which the sentencing judge considers relevant. If an irrelevant consideration is taken into account, or a relevant consideration is not taken into account, then there may be error. The applicant has failed to show that, in relation to the comments on violence or aggression, his Honour failed to take into account a relevant factor. In this case, the degree of violence or aggression was neutral. It was not excessive. There was, however, the use of a weapon. The degree of violence or aggression neither aggravated nor mitigated the seriousness of the offence and his Honour has not erred in this regard.  
     
      
    35 Likewise, the applicant has failed to show any factor, which was relevant, that has not been taken into account. The other matters raised in submissions, and on the appeal, are matters expressly referred to by his Honour in his Honour’s remarks on sentence and were, clearly, taken into account by his Honour in determining the sentence imposed. This ground of appeal also fails. 
     
      
    Ground 3: Manifest excess 
     
      
    36 As already stated, manslaughter is an offence for which there is an extremely wide range of culpability and, necessarily, a wide range of sentences that may be imposed. There is no one correct sentence and judges will differ, in detail, on the sentence to be imposed in particular cases. Nevertheless, even for manslaughter, with a wide range of sentences available, there is a range which, if it were exceeded, warrants interference by an appeal court.  
     
      
    37 However, as has been stated on a number of occasions, interference by an appeal court is not permitted, unless error has been identified or is manifest. In the current proceedings, no error of principle, or error in the finding of fact, has been identified. The applicant relies, in this third ground of appeal, on manifest error. Manifest error is displayed when the sentence imposed is, relevantly, manifestly excessive and, in that regard, the applicant is required to show that the sentence is outside the range available.  
     
      
    38 Manslaughter is regarded as one of the most serious of crimes, because it involves the felonious taking of human life. The legislature has set a maximum sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment for the worst case. His Honour, as already noted, imposed a 6 year non-parole period with a balance of term of 3 years. Clearly, his Honour did not impose a sentence on the basis that this was an offence of manslaughter in the worst category of case.  
     
      
    39 Notwithstanding the wide range of sentences in manslaughter cases, there is a necessity to determine whether the sentence imposed on this offender, in this circumstance, was outside the applicable range and, therefore, excessive.  
     
      
    40 His Honour had the benefit of hearing the evidence in the trial and, as a consequence, assessing the seriousness of the matter. While attention has been drawn to the statistics published by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales, care must be taken in the application of those statistics to manslaughter cases, because of the necessary variations involved in the particular circumstances of each case. Likewise, it is difficult, without regard to significant detail, to compare different sentences for different offences. There is no principle of parity between offenders, other than co-offenders. However, an examination of the cases and their circumstances, proffered by the Crown and the applicant, do not show that the sentence imposed by his Honour was outside the range available.  
     
      
    41 Further, to the extent necessary, I would comment that, pursuant to the terms of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Court would need to be satisfied that another, relevantly lower, sentence was warranted. I am not so satisfied.  
     
      
    42 In my view, no identifiable error has been disclosed and the sentence imposed by his Honour was not manifestly excessive. The grounds of appeal fail and the appeal should be dismissed.  
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    43 I would propose that the Court make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal be granted; 
       
       
      (ii) The appeal against sentence be dismissed.  
       
      
    44 PRICE J: I agree with Rothman J.

    JUDGMENT1 A week ago on 20 February 2009 I made an order under s 10(1)(b) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 directing the exclusion from court in these proceedings of all persons who are engaged in preparing reports on the proceedings for the dissemination through the public news media. I made that order for reasons which I delivered at the time and which are now published under R v AA, AS, MH, and OM [2009] NSWDC 25.2 Today Mr Sibtain of counsel sought leave to appear for his clients, the Seven Network Operations, Nine Network and Nationwide News. I granted him leave.3 His application, after having been granted that leave was, in effect, for the media to be permitted to remain in court. He was re-agitating the application made last week for the exclusion of the media under s 10(1)(b). I regarded the re-agitation of that issue as appropriate because the media were not represented by counsel last week. I do not propose to repeat the matters which are set out in my judgment delivered last week. 4 Today the application made by Ms Maher was supported by evidence. She called her client. He gave evidence of what he had seen on television on 29 January 2009. I do not need to refer to that evidence because we saw the footage. He gave evidence that when he returned home that evening he turned on the television and saw what he described. Within two minutes he received a phone call from a school friend, whom he had not spoken to for some two years, who said he saw him on TV. There is some question about whether that school friend might have known in any event about this offender’s involvement in the proceedings. However, ten minutes later he received another phone call from somebody he used to work with some months before, who said he had seen the offender and his father on television. Later in the same evening the offender went outside and saw a neighbour. The neighbour told him that he had seen him on television. The offender had no reason to believe that either the former workmate or the neighbour had any information about his, the offender’s, involvement in the offence.5 The offender went to work the following day. When he arrived at work two of his bosses approached him and told him they had seen him on TV. Once again, the offender had not provided any information about his involvement in the offence, nor did he have any reason to think that those at work knew about it. One of the bosses commented that the offender’s involvement in the crime must be the reason why he had so many days off. He was given two weeks’ notice. He also gave evidence that footage which was shown on Channel Nine is still on the Nine MSN website. 6 Mr Sibtain called Jessica Rich, a journalist with the Nine Network. She was the person who reported on the story on 29 January 2009 for her network and, as she said, put the story together. She confirmed that a DVD, which was tendered through her and became exhibit A3, was, with one exception, a full copy of what was broadcast on 29 January 2009. The exception was the introduction by the newsreader, who accompanied that introduction by a couple of paragraphs of narrative. She confirmed in cross-examination that Sky News would have similar footage to Channel Nine and that the Nine MSN site would, as far as she was concerned, not exercise any editorial discretion over information which they received from the Nine Network.7 I viewed exhibits A4 and exhibit A5, the Channel Nine and Channel Seven news broadcasts respectively, on 29 January 2009. I, myself, was not left with the impression that the offenders were able to be readily identified. The process of blurring or pixelating the features of persons on TV was used in the broadcast and they were used in respect of each of the offenders.8 Nevertheless, I am left with the position that the offender who gave evidence was contacted and spoken to by people who, so far as he knew, did not know about his involvement in the offence. As Ms Maher, who appeared for that offender, pointed out, there was clearly a temporal connection between the news broadcast and those approaches and observations. I would be satisfied that the persons who approached the offender knew of his involvement as a result of what they had seen on television. Indeed, a number of the persons said as much by making reference to what they had seen on the news. 9 In agitating his application, Mr Sibtain reminds me of the fundamental importance of the right of public access to the courts and the significance of that right being expressed, or being exercised, by members of the press. He referred me to John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v The District Court of New South Wales (2004) 61 NSWLR 344, a decision of the Court of Appeal, and to An Application by John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited re MSK, MAK, MMK and MRK [2006] NSWCCA 386, a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, and to a judgment of Studdert J in R v LMW [1999] NSWSC1111. Mr Sibtain also referred me to other authorities referred to in those respective judgments. 10 One principle he extracted from the authorities was that an order prohibiting the publication of evidence, for example, to be valid must be really necessary to secure the proper administration [of justice] in proceedings before it. Another principle referred to was that it is only in highly exceptional circumstances - where the presence of the public or public knowledge of the proceedings is likely to defeat the paramount duty of the courts - that the courts may proceed in camera. Mr Sibtain argued that those necessary and exceptional circumstances must be the starting place for my consideration of his application and that it is not merely a matter of a balancing exercise in weighing up the respective merits of the various public interests at stake. He points to the fundamental constitutional importance of the right of public access to the courts as having some predominant weight in my approach to his application.11 I find that the TV stations which made the broadcasts which I viewed clearly took some effort not to identify the offenders involved, but I also find that those efforts were not completely effective. I have evidence before me, which I accept, of the fact that one of the offenders was contacted by the persons to whom I have referred, who did not know about his involvement in the offences. Mr Sibtain argues that I need to see that in the context that the persons who contacted him may have some prior knowledge of him in the sense of knowing him as a person and therefore being able to more readily identify him on television. In referring to the obligations on his client to comply with s 11 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, he points to a need to avoid extreme or ludicrous examples of what might lead to exposure of persons whose identity is meant to be suppressed. Section 11(5) provides that the name of a person includes “a reference to any information, picture or other material that identifies the person or is likely to lead to the identification of the person.” He submits, and I accept, that the test is an objective one. Nevertheless, I do not accept that the test is in some way limited to persons who do not know already the identity of the person whose identity is meant to be concealed. He did not make that submission in terms but, in my opinion, the purpose of the legislation, or at least this provision in the legislation, is to protect the identity, or prevent the disclosure of the identity, of young persons to anyone who may know them or otherwise. Indeed, it may be that more damage is done by the disclosure of information about a young person to those who know him. An example may well be in the context of employment. 12 The obligations of anyone, not just the media, are to comply with the provisions of the Act. It clearly provides that nothing is to be published that identifies the young person or is likely to lead to the identification of the person. That requires some judgment and assessment and consideration of the real likelihood that the publication which is to be made would lead to the identification of the person. As I say, it seemed to me that the media involved in this case clearly went to some effort to comply with their obligations under the law but, at the same time, I find that those efforts were not effective enough in the case of the offender, whose evidence I have heard, to prevent his identification.13 I approach the resolution of this application by focussing on my task. My task is to apply the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. In particular, the application is made under one of the provisions of that Act. I am asked by Ms Maher, and supported by counsel for the other offenders, to exclude the press. What I am being asked to do is to exercise a specific statutory power. The Act is not a general Act such as the Crimes Act or the Criminal Procedure Act. The Act is a piece of legislation which deals specifically with children and with the interests of children. The specific focus of the Act is with children who have committed crimes and are being prosecuted. 14 To my mind, in making my decision, I need to give weight to the public interest in the press reporting on these proceedings. That weight I referred to in the judgment which I delivered earlier and is able to be more clearly articulated by reference to the authorities which have been drawn to my attention today. One of the authorities, namely John Fairfax v The District Court, at [19] of the Chief Justice’s judgment, referred to the exceptions to the principle of open justice being few and strictly defined. His Honour went on to say: “It is now accepted that the courts will not add to the list of exceptions but, of course, Parliament can do so, subject to any constitutional constraints.” 15 There is no suggestion of any Constitutional constraint on Parliament so far as the provision in question in this case is concerned. But the point made by the Chief Justice was emphasised by Ms Maher: that we are dealing with a specific piece of legislation where Parliament has turned its mind to a particular interest in the community and made specific provision. The entitlement of the press to remain in court is, as I said last week, established by s 10(1)(a)(b). It is established, perhaps because of the provision in s 10(1)(a) which excludes persons from the proceedings, but then provides, by way of exception, that members of the press are entitled to remain unless the judge otherwise directs.16 I accept Ms Maher’s submission that I should interpret the exercise of the power which I am asked to exercise, or approach the exercise of the power which I am asked to exercise, by reference to the principles set out in s 6 of the same Act. She, for example, refers to the provision in s 6 regarding the desirability to allow the employment of a child to proceed without interruption and the desirability of a child to reside in their own home and the desirability of children to be reintegrated into the community. Her submission I accept because s 6 provides explicitly that a “person or body that has functions under this Act is to exercise those functions having regard to the following principles”. I therefore have regard to the s 6 principles and, in particular, the ones referred to by Ms Maher. 17 As it happens, in the evidence before me one of the offenders has been confronted by a neighbour with information about his involvement in the offence and has also been confronted in his employment. The protection which is meant to be afforded by the legislation, by reference to those principles regarding the home and the employment, has, in this case, been compromised.18 I am still convinced by Ms Maher’s argument. I still regard the further reporting of details which will emerge from my remarks on sentence as having the potential to compromise the objects of the legislation. They include the matters which I have referred to just then by reference to Ms Maher’s citation of s 6. The information which would be forthcoming as a result of a reporting of the details which will be contained in my remarks on sentence will, in my opinion, result in the potential for further damage to the offenders, which will affect some of the aims of the legislation in protecting them, as under-aged persons, from exposure to the public. 19 I will make a couple of concluding observations before I announce my order. I found the judgment of Studdert J in LMW to be, with respect, very helpful. I do note, however, that it appears that his Honour was dealing with an application to order persons to leave the court whilst evidence of a particular witness was being given. His Honour emphasised the importance of approaching the exclusion of members of the public by reference to the need for that to happen only in wholly exceptional circumstances and, in that case, his Honour could find nothing which measured up to that criterion which would warrant his exercising his power. I regard the question in this case to be broader, namely the interests of the offenders which are designed to be protected to the extent that Parliament regards as appropriate by the laws which it has made in this Act, and I regard that protection as having been compromised and, more importantly, as likely to be further compromised by further publication of information. 20 One final observation is, I repeat, that nothing that I have said should be construed as suggesting that I have formed the view that any of the news media has committed a breach of s 11 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. I repeat, it seemed to me that they made some effort to conceal the identity of the persons but, as it happens, those efforts were not effective enough - given the evidence which is before me - to result in this offender not being identified. 21 For the reasons which I have just given, I therefore direct that any person who is engaged in preparing a report on the proceedings for dissemination through a public news medium is to leave the court.22 There is one other thing I have not ruled on. I propose to re-open the court for the announcement of my sentence. When I sentence these offenders, I propose to allow the media back in. That is because there will be nothing in the terms of the sentences themselves which, in my opinion, would compromise the objects of the Act in the ways that I have referred to. So, in due course, I will re-open the court to the media.23 SIBTAIN: Your Honour, may I raise one matter, and I hope your Honour doesn’t understand any discourtesy from what I am putting?24 HIS HONOUR: No, go ahead.25 SIBTAIN: In your Honour’s reasons, your Honour referred to the evidence of one of the offenders as to identification.26 HIS HONOUR: Yes.27 SIBTAIN: I understand, from what your Honour has just said, that you will be sentencing all the offenders at the same time.28 HIS HONOUR: I will.29 SIBTAIN: Did your Honour intend to exclude the media during the sentencing of those who have not been identified as well?30 HIS HONOUR: Yes.31 SIBTAIN: As your Honour please.32 HIS HONOUR: All right, anything else on the application?33 MAHER: No.

     JUDGMENT 
    1 BEAZLEY JA: I will ask Blanch J to deliver the first judgment.2 BLANCH J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court on 23 April, 2008. The applicant was charged with two offences:1. Using a carriage service, namely an internet service, between 1 March 2005 and 7 March 2007 to access child pornography material contrary to s474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code (Cth), which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.2. Possess child pornography material, being 17 compact discs, 2 computer hard drives and 25 colour printed A4 pages containing child pornographic images and videos, contrary to s91H(3) of the Crimes Act (NSW) for which the maximum penalty is 5 years imprisonment.3 On the first count he was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment commencing on 23 July, 2008. There was a recognizance release order after one year upon him entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour for three years.4 On the second offence he was sentenced to six months imprisonment from 23 April, 2008.5 The effect of the sentences was 21 months imprisonment but released after 15 months on a three year recognizance. He will be released on that recognizance on 22 July, 2009.6 On 8 March, 2007 the Australian Federal Police executed a search warrant at the applicant’s premises and seized:1. 8 compact discs from a lounge chair in the rumpus room of the residence.2. A computer located in the rumpus room and in day to day use at the time of the search – this computer contained a Seagate hard drive. 
     
      
      3. 17 compact discs in the applicant’s bedroom. 
      
    3. A computer in the applicant’s bedroom (the applicant stated that it was an older computer no longer in use). This contained an IBM hard drive.4. 26 colour images printed on A4 pages in a laundry basket in the applicant’s bedroom.7 A preliminary examination of the material revealed in excess of 130,000 images, videos and movie files, some of which were examined. Of the items examined there were 3,235 child pornography images and 77 child pornography videos identified. The sentencing judge saw some of the material and said that they included images of “… very young children engaging in sexual acts with adults. Some apparently show very young girls, of seven years of age or younger, apparently engaging in fellatio with middle aged men. Others show vaginal to penile contact between girls of that age and men of middle age.”8 The judge also referred to the fact that the applicant admitted to police that he had been collecting the material for about five years but noted that the Commonwealth offence came into force in early 2005. The sentencing judge categorised the offences as “… of at least mid range.”9 The subjective case put on behalf of the applicant included the fact that he was born in July 1978, had no prior convictions and was always fully employed. On his behalf there was tendered a Probation and Parole Service report which described him as emotionally immature and without having had any adult relationships. He had been seeing a psychologist, Gerard Webster, whose report was also tendered. He reported the applicant had made considerable progress in gaining insight into his behaviour and he recommended on-going treatment. Mr Webster gave evidence before the sentencing judge and was examined and cross-examined at length. The applicant also gave evidence as did the applicant’s mother.10 The first ground of appeal argued is that the sentences are manifestly excessive. This Court examined cases relating to the offence of importing child pornography in the case of R v Gent (2005) 162 A Crim R 29. The offence in that case was one of importing contrary to s233BAB(5) of the Customs Act, 1901. The maximum penalty, however, was also ten years. In the judgment of Johnson J at page 38 there is a quotation from Kennedy J in R v Jones (1999) 108 A Crim R 50 at 51 where it was said: 
     
      
      “In recent times the insidious impact of child pornography has come to be better understood. The problem is an international one, which has been significantly aggravated with the advent of the Internet.” 
      
    11 Johnson J went on to consider a number of statements from a number of cases in Australia and elsewhere all pointing out that child pornography was a significant crime because it exploited young people and it was not a victimless crime because the collection of such material simply encourages others to corrupt children in order to produce the material. The cases also stress that general deterrence must be an important factor when sentencing. A reading of the cases clearly indicates that a total sentence of 15 months of actual imprisonment could not be described as an excessive penalty. The maximum penalty available to the sentencing judge was up to 15 years imprisonment and looked at against that scale, the sentences actually imposed are, in my view, more properly classified as moderate. I note the judge in imposing the sentence discounted the sentence by 25% to give the applicant the maximum benefit for his plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity. I would reject this ground of appeal.12 The second ground of appeal argued is that the “judge failed to adequately take into account the appellant’s strong subjective case.” The sentencing judge on the other hand examined the report and the evidence of Mr Webster in detail. He was well aware of the fact that it was recommended there should be on-going treatment and that the applicant had no prior convictions. The judge also noted that he was assessed as not having a robust character and would find difficulty in prison. The judge considered his contrition, his co-operation, his full admissions, his age and his mental condition and that he had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. The judge, in my view, gave careful consideration to all the subjective features in this case and no error is apparent in the sentencing process. I would reject this ground.13 The third ground argued was “the sentencing judge failed to impose an appropriate period of custody for the Commonwealth and State offences, having regard to the full term of the sentence for the Commonwealth offence.”14 The contention is that the usual proportion between the head sentence and the non-parole period is 60 to 66% in Commonwealth sentences. In this case the 18 month sentence is cumulative on 3 months of the State sentence, the effective total sentence is 21 months and the non-parole period is 15 months. 15 On the other hand in this case the proportion of the sentence for the Commonwealth offence to be served was in fact 66%. Although that is disturbed by the 3 month accumulation, in my view the proportion of the sentences to be served in custody is not outside an acceptable range even if both the sentences were for Commonwealth offences. The ratio of 60 to 66% is a general guide and is not a statutory ratio. I would reject this ground.16 The fourth ground argued is that the sentencing judge “erred in failing to make the sentences wholly concurrent.” That issue was a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge and it should be seen in the context that the Commonwealth offence occurred between 2005 and 2007 and in respect of the State offence, the applicant admitted he had been collating the material for about five years. These offences are different offences and in view of the applicant’s admission, it was entirely appropriate for there to be some accumulation in respect of the State charge. I would also reject this ground.17 In my view, there is no merit in the challenge made to the sentences and accordingly, I would refuse leave to appeal and dismiss the appeal.18 BEAZLEY JA: I agree.19 HOWIE J: I also agree.20 BEAZLEY JA: The orders are those proposed by Blanch J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: On 18 July 2008 I joined in the orders of the court dismissing the Crown appeal. I have read the reasons of Hidden J in draft with which I agree. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: This is a Crown appeal against sentence, which was heard 18 July 2008. The appeal had been brought against an order of a District Court judge, under s11(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, adjourning sentence proceedings and releasing the respondent on conditional bail. Such an order is appealable because it falls within the extended definition of “sentence” in s2(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The Court dismissed the appeal on the day of hearing, undertaking to give its reasons later. These are my reasons for joining in that decision. 
     
      
    3 In the morning of 28 October 2007 the respondent, a young woman with a dysfunctional background and an intellectual disability, committed an armed robbery at a service station at Young. That is an offence under s97(1) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 20 years. She pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was committed to the District Court for sentence. The matter came before the District Court at Wagga Wagga on 8 April 2008 and was adjourned to 15 April, when the sentencing judge received a body of evidence. It was on that day that the order under s11 was made. 
     
      
    4 His Honour did not adjourn the proceedings to a specified date, as required by s11(1). However, no point was taken about this before us and it was common ground that his Honour had made a s11 order amenable to the jurisdiction of this Court. 
     
      
      Facts 
      
    5 On the occasion of the offence the victim, a service station attendant, was serving a customer at a fuel pump when he saw the respondent approaching the premises. He observed her to be short and overweight, and he noticed that she was wearing what was described in the statement of facts as a plastic gargoyle-type face mask and that her stomach was protruding from under her shirt. The victim commented to his customer, jokingly, that the respondent looked as if she was about to rob the business. However, as the respondent walked into the store he became concerned and asked the customer to follow him inside. 
     
      
    6 Once inside, the respondent brandished the knife and demanded money. The victim was fearful and held a clipboard to his chest to protect himself. He invited the respondent to take what she wanted. She opened the till and took a number of $10 and $20 notes. She left the store and the victim dialled the emergency number. 
     
      
    7 A second customer, who arrived at the service station as the respondent was leaving, followed her in his car. At one stage her saw her remove her mask and a little later he observed her walk towards a block of flats. Police later attended those flats. The respondent was arrested but she denied any involvement in the offence. However, when the flat she occupied was searched, the knife which she had used was found, together with notes totalling $60. 
     
      
    8 It is not entirely clear how much money was stolen. Particulars of the charge set out in the court attendance notice assert that it was $1,100. However, according to the statement of facts, the till had contained “a cash float totalling $500.” I do not consider that anything turns on this in the disposition of the appeal.  
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    9 The respondent was 19 years old at the time of the offence and is now 21. Her criminal history comprised entries in the Children’s Court: an offence of demanding property with menaces, dealt with in 2004, and related offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and resisting an officer in the execution of his duty, dealt with in the following year. These were disposed of by non-custodial orders, and her first experience of prison was upon her arrest for the present offence. She was refused bail at that time and remained in custody for about a month and a half. She was then granted bail in the Supreme Court with conditions which included a nightly curfew and daily reporting to police.  
     
      
    10 His Honour had before him a pre-sentence report, together with a psychiatric report which had been prepared for the respondent’s appearance in the Children’s Court in 2005. The respondent gave evidence.  
     
      
    11 Her parents separated when she was eleven years old, and she remained with her father. She was the second of three children. Her upbringing was marred by family conflict and violence, by her parents’ drug use and by her mother’s mental health problems. Her father formed a new relationship, and she also had what the author of the pre-sentence report described as “adjustment issues” relating to her stepmother. Her brother had been imprisoned for theft, an uncle had been sentenced to a lengthy term for homicide and another uncle had committed suicide.  
     
      
    12 Her education was limited, and she left school in her mid teens. She had a learning disability and was placed in “intermediate” classes. Her condition led to her being taunted and derided by other students. The psychiatrist concluded that she had “a mild to moderate intellectual disability.” He observed her “limited understanding and vocabulary” during his interview with her. 
     
      
    13 She herself had abused a variety of drugs, including alcohol, since the age of 13. She had been in a couple of relationships with men, which had been bedevilled by drug and alcohol abuse and some violence. 
     
      
    14 The Probation and Parole officer, whose report was prepared at the end of March 2008, summarised her background and its bearing upon the offence in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        Ms Pulliene is a 20 year old woman with a mild to moderate intellectual disability which, in conjunction with her dysfunctional upbringing, has contributed to her sometimes chaotic lifestyle of periodic abuse of alcohol, ongoing use of illicit drugs, failed domestic relationships, periods of family conflict and some anti-social behaviour. Ms Pulliene’s offence occurred at a time when she was involved in substance abuse and a poor domestic relationship. Her offence may also reflect, in part, Ms Pulliene’s diminished ability to properly rationalise the impact of her behaviour at this time. 
          
        
       
      
    15 By the time of the sentence proceedings on 15 April 2008, things had improved somewhat. While she was in custody she had had some drug and alcohol counselling, but she did not pursue counselling when she was released on bail because she believed she did not need it. However, between her initial appearance before his Honour on 8 April and her second appearance on 15 April she had resumed counselling through the local Area Health Service. She gave evidence that she had moderated her drinking and had recently stopped using cannabis. 
     
      
    16 She had previously enrolled in TAFE literacy courses, but had never finished them. However, again in the week prior to her appearance on 15 April, she had re-enrolled in such a course. Pursuant to her bail conditions, she was living with a woman who was the mother of a friend of hers. This appears to have been a satisfactory arrangement and she had been observing her bail conditions, including the curfew. 
     
      
    17 On 15 April both her mother and her stepmother were present in Court, supporting her. In evidence she expressed remorse for her crime, as she had earlier to the Probation and Parole officer. 
     
      
    18 His Honour addressed some questions to her while she was in the witness box. In the course of those questions he referred to the conflict with the law of her brother and her uncle, observing that she had “a lot of work to do” because she was “on the very edge of becoming a criminal….” He said to her “…what I’m thinking about doing today is to give you an opportunity of proving …that you’re not going to go down that road.” In the course of giving brief reasons for making the s11 order, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        It is true that the offender has had the opportunity in the past of some assistance by way of counselling – drug and alcohol particularly – and teaching to read and write, from which she has not benefited. This is perhaps the last opportunity that this young lady is ever going to have to get her life into some kind of order.  
        
       
      
    19 As I have said, his Honour released the respondent on conditional bail. Those conditions maintained the requirements of residence, curfew and reporting to which she was then subject, but added conditions that she attend TAFE conscientiously and follow the course, that she attend for drug and alcohol counselling and that she comply with any request for urine testing.  
     
      
    20 In addition, his Honour took an unusual course. He decided that he would monitor the respondent’s progress during the period of the adjournment. Because he had been dealing with the matter on circuit in Wagga, he directed a telephone conference on 26 June 2008 between the representatives of the Crown and the respondent in Wagga and himself in Sydney. The purpose of the telephone link-up was to receive up to date information about the respondent’s accommodation with the woman to whom I have referred and, generally, about her compliance with the conditions which his Honour had imposed. That conference took place and subsequently, through informal communication with his Honour in chambers, 16 October 2008 was set as the date for the resumption of the sentence proceedings. The present appeal, of course, was heard and disposed of before that day. 
     
      
    21 There is no need to examine what took place during that telephone conference. In written submissions filed before the hearing of the appeal, the Crown prosecutor submitted that it was an irregular procedure, because it purported to be part of the sentence hearing but was not conducted in open court and was not officially recorded. In written submissions in response, senior counsel for the respondent argued that it was not a sentence hearing but was an accepted mechanism for a court to exercise management over part-heard matters. 22 In the event, the issue was not pressed at the hearing. The source of this Court’s jurisdiction is the s11 order made on 15 April 2008. The telephone conference of 26 June is not a proper subject for appellative review. Nor would this Court wish to comment upon administrative procedures adopted by District Court judges in the disposition of cases before them. As to the use of a telephone link-up, there might be much to be said for resort to electronic communication between the judge and the parties to a proceeding in appropriate circumstances, particularly in a court administering justice in a large number of regional centres.  
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    23 In the event of the appeal succeeding, the Crown prosecutor did not ask this Court to re-sentence the respondent. The orders sought were that the s11 order be quashed, that the matter be remitted to the sentencing judge so that the sentence proceedings could be resolved as soon as practicable, and that the grant of bail be revoked. 24 Put shortly, the Crown’s position was that a s11 order was uncalled for because, as it was put in written submissions, on 15 April “there was sufficient evidence then before the Court to permit appropriate findings to be made of the relevant objective and subjective circumstances.” The Crown prosecutor referred to R v Trindall [2002] NSWCCA 364, 133 A Crim R 119, in which Smart AJ, delivering the leading judgment, observed at [64] that an order under s11 “is likely to arise for consideration in a relatively small number of cases,” and that “such a remand should not be granted unless there are good reasons for concluding that it is likely to assist the court in determining whether an offender should be sent to jail or in fixing the length of the sentence or the non-parole period.” 
     
      
    25 The approach to a s11 order was also considered by Howie J, again delivering the leading judgment, in R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381, 134 A Crim R 174. After referring to Trindall, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        [29] As Smart AJ identified, the discretion conferred upon a sentencing judge by s 11 can be a valuable sentencing tool when used in an appropriate case for the purpose of arriving at a sentence which is just both for the offender and for the community. But the section can only be utilized in a principled way and upon proper material placed before the court otherwise it becomes an instrument of injustice, either by raising false expectations in the mind of the offender as to the sentence which will ultimately be imposed upon him or by becoming the justification for the imposition of a sentence which fails to meet legitimate expectations of the community as to the punishment to be imposed upon the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        [30] The exercise of the power given under s 11 will inevitably result in delay in the finalisation of the prosecution of the offender. …Unless the further delaying of the sentencing of the offender is wholly justified in order to ensure that the sentencing discretion is properly exercised, there will be a miscarriage of justice. … 
        
       
      
    26 It was also the Crown’s position that the effect of the s11 adjournment was merely to stave off the inevitable, that is, the imposition of a custodial sentence. Reference was made to the familiar guideline for sentence for armed robbery to be found in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346 at [161] ff. In oral argument, the Crown prosecutor put as a “primary submission” that a full time custodial sentence was required. However, he acknowledged that alternatives to full time custody could not be ruled out because of the features of the present case which distinguished it from the typical case considered in Henry. Quite apart from the respondent’s early plea of guilty, her difficult background and her tentative steps towards rehabilitation, her intellectual disability was capable of invoking the approach to the sentence of people suffering mental illness or disability explained in cases such as R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 and R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255. 
     
      
    27 In my view, this was clearly a case where it was open to the sentencing judge to take the course he did. From the material before his Honour it was apparent that he was dealing with a young woman from a troubled background who had shown signs of rehabilitation but whose prospects of it, at that stage, were far from predictable. To use a hackneyed expression, she could fairly be seen to be “at the crossroads.”  
     
      
    28 It was appropriate that her capacity for reform be tested over a reasonably lengthy period before the sentence for her crime was determined, and the delay that this involved was in the interests of justice. Particularly was this so because, in the unusual circumstances of her case, a full time custodial case might not have been inevitable. In Legge v R [2007] NSWCCA 244, a case in which this Court reduced a custodial sentence for armed robbery to a level significantly below the Henry guideline so as to enable the offender’s immediate release, Spigelman CJ reminded us at [59] that “a guideline is not a tramline.” 
     
      
    29 Accordingly, no error having been shown in his Honour’s approach, the Crown appeal could not succeed. 
     
      
    30 FULLERTON J: I also joined in the orders of the court on 18 July 2008 and I also agree that the Crown appeal should be dismissed.

    1 The plaintiff, by summons filed in this court on 17 January 2006, sought, inter alia, the following orders against the defendant: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. An order pursuant to section 10 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act, 1990 [“the Act”] that no person is to dispose of, or attempt to dispose of, or otherwise deal with or attempt to otherwise deal with any interest in property (within the meaning of ‘interest in property’ as defined in section 7 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990) of Johnson Bazi, including the interest in property in the property described in Schedule One hereto… 
        
       
       
        
        5. An order pursuant to s 10(4) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act, 1990 that the Public Trustee take control of all the interest of Johnson Bazi in the property described in Schedule One hereto... 
        
       
       
        
        7. An order pursuant to section 27 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 that Johnson Bazi pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived from the illegal activities of Johnson Bazi that took place not more than six (6) years before the making of this application… 
        
       
       
       Schedule One 
       
       
        
        1. Cash in the amount of approximately $365,000 produced to the New South Wales Crime Commission on 24 June 2005 pursuant to section 17 of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 by Travelex Limited. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Cash in the amount of approximately $54,000 produced to the New South Wales Crime Commission on 24 June 2005 pursuant to section 17 of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 by Travelex Limited.” 
        
       
      
    2 On 17 January 2006 the orders sought in paras 1 and 5 of the summons were made. No order was made at that time in respect of the order sought in para 7 of the summons. The orders were made upon evidence the defendant was suspected of being engaged in serious crime related activity as defined in s 6 of the Act. The serious crime related activity involved offences of making and using false instruments with intent, for which offences he was convicted on 30 January 2006.  
     
      
    3 On 28 May 2007, upon application by the plaintiff, this court (Studdert J) made orders in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. I grant leave to the plaintiff to amend the summons to seek an order pursuant to s 22 of the  
        Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
         forfeiting to and vesting in the Crown the interests in property of Johnson Bazi in the property described in the schedule to these orders. 
         
         
        2. There is to be judgment for the plaintiff on its claim for an assets forfeiture order in respect of the interests of the defendant in the property specified in the schedule to these orders. 
         
         
        3. Leave is granted to the defendant to apply for orders under s 25 and/or s 26 of the statute within six months after the assets forfeiture order takes effect. 
         
         
        4. The assets forfeiture order is stayed for a period of six months and thereafter if orders under s 25 or s 26 or both are sought until the disposition of the application for those orders. 
         
         
        5. Judgment is to be granted to the plaintiff on its claim for a proceeds assessment order against the defendant for an amount to be assessed. 
         
         
        6. The defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs of these proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        The schedule for the purposes of these orders I identify as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        Cash in the amount of $430,000 plus interest earned thereon produced to the New South Wales Crime Commission on 24 June 2005 pursuant to s 17 of the  
        New South Wales Crime Commission Act 
         1985 by Travelex Limited.” 
         
        
       
      
    4 By notice of motion filed on 22 November 2007 the defendant sought: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. A declaration that it is more probable than not that the whole of the value of the defendant’s interest in property being cash in the amount of $430,000 plus interest earned thereon produced to the New South Wales Crime Commission on 24 June 2005 pursuant to s 17 of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 by Travelex Limited that has been forfeited under an assets forfeiture order made on 28 May 2007 is not attributable to the proceeds of an illegal activity. 
        
       
       
        
        2. An order that the defendant is entitled to be paid the whole of the proceeds of sale of the defendant’s interest in such property.” 
        
       
       
      The present application  
       
      
    5 On 3 October 2008 the defendant filed a notice of motion in which various orders were sought. It is that notice of motion which is presently before the Court. The orders sought relate to: 
     
      
       
      (a) the making of provision for reasonable legal expenses pursuant to s 10(5) of the Act; 
       
       
      (b) alternatively, provision for reasonable legal expenses pursuant to the ancillary provisions in s 23(4) of the Act; 
       
       
      (c) the grant of leave to make application pursuant to s 26 of the Act; 
       
       
      (d) the amendment of the notice of motion filed on 22 November 2007 in respect of the application pursuant to s 25; 
       
       
      (e) the fixing of a hearing date for the quantification of the proceeds assessment order.  
       
      
    6 The application for orders relating to the amendment of the notice of motion filed on 22 November 2007 in relation to s 25 of the Act (paragraph 5(d) above) was not pressed in the light of a concession by senior counsel for the plaintiff. The application for orders relating to the hearing of the plaintiff’s proceeds assessment order (paragraph 5(e) above) was also not pressed. 
     
      
       
      Application for provision of reasonable legal expenses pursuant to s 10(5) of the Act 
       
      
    7 The defendant sought an order: 
     
      
       
        
        “that the restraining order in this matter be varied to allow for the reasonable legal expenses of the applicant in defending these proceedings pursuant to s10(5) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 to be paid from $430,000 cash restrained.” 
        
       
      
    8 The defendant also sought a declaration that the reasonable legal expenses of the applicant include solicitor’s costs in defending the proceedings, including those costs to retain an expert accountant, and counsel costs in defending these proceedings, including costs for senior and junior counsel. 
     
      
    9 The plaintiff opposed the order sought by the defendant. The plaintiff’s submissions were directed solely to the question of whether the court had power to make the order sought. The defendant and his solicitor were not required for cross-examination on their affidavits and no submissions were made that if there was power to make the order sought the order and declarations should not be made. In particular it was not submitted the application should be refused on the basis of any of the restrictions in s 16A.  
     
      
    10 The Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        Section 10(5): “A restraining order may, at the time it is made or at a later time, make provision for meeting out of the property, or a specified part of the property, to which the order applies all or any of the following: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) [reasonable living expenses] 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              (b) subject to section 16A, the reasonable legal expenses of any person whose interests in property are subject to the restraining order, being expenses incurred in connection with the application for the restraining order or an application for a confiscation order, or incurred in defending a criminal charge.” 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
     Section 16A of the Act imposes restrictions upon the making of an order for costs under s 10(5). It is unnecessary to detail those restrictions here.  
     
      
       
      A “confiscation order” is defined in s 4 of the Act as “means an assets forfeiture order or a proceeds assessment order.” 
       
      
    11 As is apparent from its terms, s 10(5), for present purposes, is enlivened only where: 
     
      
       
      (a) there is a restraining order;  
       
       
      (b) the provision for reasonable legal expenses can be made out of the property to which the restraining order applies; 
       
       
      (c) the restrictions in s 16A are inapplicable; 
       
       
      (d) there is evidence to justify the exercise of the discretion in favour of the defendant.  
       
      
    12 The plaintiff submitted s 10(5) was not enlivened as: 
     
      
       
      (a) there was no restraining order; 
       
       
      (b) the relevant interest in property was subject to a forfeiture order under s 22, there was no property to which the restraining order applied and out of which provision could be made for legal expenses.  
       
      
    13 The defendant submitted that as the forfeiture order had been stayed when made it had not taken effect, the property remained subject to the restraining order and an order could be made pursuant to s10(5).  
     
      
    14 There are thus two issues for determination namely:  
     
      
       
      (a) was there a restraining order; 
       
       
      (b) was the defendant’s interest in property subject to the restraining order. 
       
       
      Was there a restraining order 
       
      
    15 “Restraining order” is defined in s 4 of the Act as “means an order made under section 10 and in force”. 
     
      
    16 Section 10(9) of the Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “After the first 2 working days of its operation, a restraining order remains in force in respect of an interest in property only while:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) there is an application for an assets forfeiture order pending before the Supreme Court in respect of the interest; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) there is an unsatisfied proceeds assessment order in force against the person whose suspected serious crime related activities formed the basis of the restraining order; or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) there is an application for such a proceeds assessment order pending before the Supreme Court; or 
        
       
       
        
        (d) it is the subject of an order of the Supreme Court under section 20 (Effect on restraining order of refusal to make confiscation order).” 
        
       
      
    17 The plaintiff submitted, in essence:  
     
      
       
      (a) As the first two working days of the operation of the restraining order had passed the restraining order would be in force only if one or more of the matters in subsection 10(9)(a) – (d) was applicable.  
       
       
      (b) None of the matters referred to in subsection 10 (9) (a) – (d) was applicable. 
       
       
      (c) Subsection 10(9)(a) had no application as the application for an assets forfeiture order have been dealt with and the appropriate order made on the 28 May 2007.  
       
       
      (d) Subsection 10(9)(c) had no application as the application for a proceeds assessment order had been dealt with by the court and a proceeds assessment order for an amount to be assessed was made on 28 May 2007.  
       
       
      (e) Subsection 10(9)(b) had no application. The reasons were not articulated in submissions.  
       
       
      (f) Subsection 10(9)(d) had no application as no order had been made by the Supreme Court under s 20.  
       
       
      (g) There being no restraining order in force at the present time no order could be made under subsection 10(5).  
       
      
    18 Defendant’s counsel initially accepted that none of the matters in subsection 10(9)(a)-(d) had application. Subsequently in his submissions the following exchange occurred:  
     
      
       
        
        “Do you accept what Mr Temby has said in relation to 9(c) that an application for the proceeds assessment order is not pending even though it is yet to be quantified.  
        
       
       
        
        Clarke: “I would say it would need to be quantified.” 
        
       
       
      
    19 A proceeds assessment order is defined in s 4 as “means an order made under s 27 and in force”. Section 27(1) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for a proceeds assessment order requiring a person to pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived by the person from an illegal activity, or illegal activities, of the person or another person that took place not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the order, whether or not any such activity is an activity on which the application is based as required by subsection (2) or (2A).”  
        
       
      
    20 In this case the relevant order made on 28 May 2007 was that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Judgment is to be granted to the plaintiff on its claim for proceeds assessment order against the defendant for an amount to be assessed”.  
        
       
      
    No amount has been assessed.  
     
      
    21 In order to be a proceeds assessment order as defined in ss 4 and 27(1) the order must, in my opinion, require a person to pay an amount assessed by the court. Until such amount is assessed the application for such a proceeds assessment order, in my opinion, remains pending before the court and subsection 10(9)(c) has application.  
     
      
    22 If I am wrong in that conclusion then the assessment order made by Studdert J on 28 May 2007 is unsatisfied and subsection 10(9)(b) has application.  
     
      
       
      Was the defendant’s interest in property subject to the restraining order 
       
      
    23 The Act provides: 
     
      
       
       
        
        Section 10(4): When the Supreme Court makes a restraining order, the Court may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, order the Public Trustee to take control of some or all of the interests in property that are interests to which the restraining order relates”.  
        
       
      
    24 The order made pursuant to s 10(4) of the Act on the 17 January 2006 resulted in the Public Trustee taking control of the defendant’s interests in property pursuant to the restraining order see generally sections 21 and 12(1)9(d). 
     
      
    25 The defendant’s submissions, in essence were:  
     
      
       
      (a) Section 23 of the Act provides: 
       
       
        
        (1) “On an assets forfeiture order taking effect in relation to an interest in property:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the interest is forfeited to the Crown and vests in the Public Trustee on behalf of the Crown; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) if the person forfeiting the interest was in possession, or was entitled to possession, of the property, the Public Trustee may take possession of the property on behalf of the Crown.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) An interest forfeited under subsection (1) is to be disposed of by the Public Trustee in accordance with the directions of the Treasurer and the proceeds are to be paid to the Treasurer and credited to the Proceeds Account.” … 
        
       
       
      (b) The assets forfeiture order was made on 28 May 2007. It was stayed for a period of six months and if orders under s 25 or s 26 were made the stay was to continue until the disposition of the application for those orders. The application for an order under s 25 was made and has not yet been disposed of, the stay remains in force.  
       
       
      (c) The plaintiff conceded that the moneys had not been transferred to consolidated revenue and in that sense no forfeiture had occurred pursuant to the forfeiture order. Senior Counsel for the plaintiff stated “… a restraining order was made on 17 January 2006 and I mention that in that restraining order it was ordered that the Public Trustee take control of the interests of Mr Bazi and that property and that is where the money sits.”  
       
       
      (d) As the forfeiture order had been stayed the moneys continued to be held pursuant to the restraining order made on 17 January 2006. Thus the court has power to make the orders and it would be appropriate to do so.  
       
      
    26 In NSW Crime Commission v Ibrahim [2002] NSWSC 791 Sperling J said at ([16]): 
     
      
       
        
        “The orders made on 9 April 2001 included orders staying execution of the assets forfeiture orders for six months from the date on which they were entered. An order takes effect as of the date the orders were made: Pt 4 r 30 [sic SCR pt 40 r 3]. The orders staying execution served to prevent the Public Trustee from taking possession of and disposing of the property before 18 October 2001. The stay orders did not prevent the forfeiture orders from taking effect.”  
        
       
      
    27 Rule 36.4(1)(a) of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 is to similar effect to part 40 r 3 of the Supreme Court Rules in that it provides:  
     
      
       
      “a judgment or order takes effect: 
       
       
      (a) as of the date on which it is given or made.”  
       
      
    28 Thus, whilst the forfeiture order had effect by reason of the operation of the rules such effect was limited to e.g. providing a time for the operation of ss 25(4) and 26(4). The stay orders, whilst they continued in force, prevented the execution of the forfeiture order.29 The concessions made by senior counsel for the plaintiff (see paragraph 25(c)) above confirm the defendant’s interest in property continues to be held pursuant to the restraining order made on 17 January 2006. 
     
      
       
      
    30 In my opinion the court has power to make an order pursuant to s10(5) of the Act in the circumstances of this case and it is appropriate to make such an order.  
     
      
       
      Application for provision of legal expenses pursuant to the ancillary provisions in s 23 
       
      
    31 The defendant sought: 
     
      
       
        
        “An order that the forfeiture order in this matter, as currently stayed, be varied to allow for the reasonable legal expenses of the applicant in defending these proceedings pursuant to s23(4) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 to be paid from $430,000 cash proposed to be forfeited.” 
        
       
      
    32 Section 23(4) of the Act states: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Supreme Court may, when it makes an assets forfeiture order or at any later time, make any ancillary orders that the Court considers appropriate. For example, the Court may make ancillary orders for and with respect to facilitating the transfer to the Crown of interests in property forfeited to the Crown under such an order.” 
        
       
      
    33 In Koala Motels Pty. Limited v. Chief Licensing Inspector (1977) 18 ALR 12 at 14 Muirhead J said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Generally speaking,  
        “ancillary” 
         orders of their nature are supplementary or incidental to the main relief or principal relief granted.”  
        
       
      
    34 The defendant submitted “legal expenses incurred in excluding from restraint are, in the circumstances of stayed forfeiture orders, ancillary to forfeiture.” 
     
      
    35 The plaintiff submitted that to make a legal expenses order would be inconsistent with the forfeiture order which had been made and would not be ancillary thereto. The example contained in s 23(4) is clearly an ancillary order as it facilitates the forfeiture order. It would be inapposite to so describe costs orders.  
     
      
    36 In my opinion it is doubtful that the costs orders sought could be made under the ancillary order power in s 23(4). I agree with senior counsel for the plaintiff that the example contained in s 23(4) illustrates that the type of ancillary order contemplated by the legislature was one which facilitated the forfeiture order and that it would appear inapposite to so describe a costs order. Furthermore the restrictions in s 16A would have no application if the costs order was not part of the restraining order. The scheme of the Act is such that it is probable that power to make provision for legal expenses is limited to the power conferred expressly by s 10(5) of the Act. However it is unnecessary for me to express a concluded opinion on this question having regard to my conclusion that the defendant is entitled to the orders sought pursuant to s 10(5).  
     
      
       
      The grant of leave to make application pursuant to s 26 of the Act 
       
      
    37 The defendant sought leave to amend the notice of motion filed on 22 November 2007 to include an application pursuant to s 26 of the Act.  
     
      
    38 Section 26(1) of the Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “If it is proved that it is more probable than not that a specified proportion of the value of an interest in property that has been forfeited under an assets forfeiture order is not attributable to the proceeds of an illegal activity, the Supreme Court may:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) make a declaration to that effect, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) order that the person who has forfeited the interest is entitled to be paid the proportion of the proceeds of sale of the interest that is specified in the declaration.” 
        
       
      
    39 Section 26(4) of the Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(4) After an assets forfeiture order has been made, an application for an order under this section may not be made by a person:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) if the person was given notice of the proceedings that led to the assets forfeiture order—unless it is made within 6 months after the assets forfeiture order took effect and leave to apply has been granted by the Supreme Court, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) in any other case—unless it is made within 6 months after the assets forfeiture order took effect or the Supreme Court has granted leave to apply after that time.” 
        
       
      
    40 It was common ground for the purpose of this aspect of the application that an assets forfeiture order was made on 28 May 2007; the defendant was given notice of the proceedings that led to the assets forfeiture order; and that leave to apply under s 26 was granted by this court on 28 May 2007 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Leave is granted to the defendant to apply for orders under s 25 and/or s 26 of the statute within six months after the assets forfeiture order takes effect.” 
        
       
       
      and that no express application pursuant to s 26 was made pursuant to such leave. 
       
      
    41 The plaintiff submitted that the forfeiture order took effect on 28 May 2007 and accordingly the defendant would be out of time to bring an application under s 26 and leave to amend the application under s 25 to include an application under s 26 should be refused as it would be futile. 
     
      
    42 The defendant submitted that, by reason of the stay, the forfeiture order had yet to take effect, the application to amend was competent and should be allowed as there was no prejudice to the plaintiff. Alternatively the defendant submitted that as the application under s 25 was brought within time that application should be extended to include an application under s 26. 
     
      
    43 I do not accept the submission that the forfeiture order has not taken effect for the purpose of establishing the commencement of the period specified in ss 25(4) and 26(4).  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    44 However the defendant, within time, has brought an application under s 25 of the Act in respect of the whole of his interest in the property. It may be that such an application would permit the court to make an order in respect of a lesser interest if the evidence fell short of establishing an entitlement to the whole sum. I consider the issue arguable and accordingly will permit the defendant to amend the application under s 25 to include an application under s 26. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    45 (1) The restraining order in this matter be varied to allow for the reasonable legal expenses of the defendant / applicant in defending these proceedings pursuant to s 10(5) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act to be paid from $430,000.00 cash restrained. Such costs to include solicitors costs, the reasonable costs of retaining an expert accountant and counsel’s fees including fees for senior and junior counsel.  
     
      
       
      (2) I grant leave to amend the notice of motion filed 22 November 2007 so as to seek the following prayers: 
       
       
        
        (a) Leave, if necessary, be granted to the defendant/applicant to make application pursuant to s 26 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) A declaration that pursuant to s 26(1)(a) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 it is more probable than not that a specified proportion (as determined by the Court) of the $430,000 seized from Tavelex Ltd is not attributable to the proceeds of an illegal activity.  
        
       
       
        
        (c) An order that pursuant to s 26(1)(b) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 that the proportion specified and declared by the Court at (b), above be paid to the defendant/applicant.  
        
       
       
        
        (d) An order that any interest accumulated on that proportion specified in (b) above be paid to the defendant/applicant.  
        
       
       
       (e) Damages.  
       
       
       (f) Costs.  
       
        
       
      (3) The plaintiff is to pay the defendant’s costs of this application.  
       
       
      (4) The proceedings will be listed before the Registrar on 6 March 2009 for directions.

    1 GROVE J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 BLANCH J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    3 KIRBY J: On 17 May 2005, Rachid Ourdi (the applicant) was arrested and charged with five offences, which may be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Counts 1 & 2:  
        Entry of a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence (namely, stealing) in circumstances of aggravation, that is, knowing people were within the dwelling, contrary to s 111(2)  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 (“the Act”) (maximum penalty: 14 years imprisonment). 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 3, 4 & 5:  
        Breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing a serious indictable offence (namely, stealing) in circumstances of aggravation, that is, knowing people were there, contrary to s 112(2) of the Act (maximum penalty: 20 years imprisonment with a standard non parole period of 5 years). 
        
       
      
    4 After a little over three months, the applicant was granted conditional bail on 29 June 2005. On 18 September 2007 he was arraigned before Boulton DCJ and a jury. He pleaded not guilty to each charge. On 26 September 2007, after a short trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on each count. 
     
      
    5 On 7 December 2007, Boulton DCJ sentenced Mr Ourdi as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Counts 1 & 3:  
        Imprisonment for a term of 7 years to commence from 15.8.07 comprised of a non parole period of 3 years to expire on 14.8.10 and a balance of term of 4 years to expire on 14.8.14. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4:  
        Imprisonment for a term of 7 years to commence from 15.2.08 comprised of a non parole period of 3 years to expire on 14.2.11 and a balance of term of 4 years to expire on 14.2.15. 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 2 & 5:  
        Imprisonment for a term of 7 years to commence from 15.8.08 comprised of a non parole period of 3 years to expire on 14.8.11 and a balance of term of 4 years to expire on 14.8.15. 
        
       
      
    6 The aggregate sentence therefore involved a non parole period of 4 years, and an additional term of 4 years, a total sentence of 8 years. 
     
      
    7 Mr Ourdi seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. Before dealing with the grounds of appeal, I should describe the circumstances in which the offences were committed. 
     
      
       
      The offences. 
       
      
    8 The offences involved stealing from five home units within a 22 storey residential tower block at Bondi Junction. The block had elaborate security which the applicant penetrated. Quite apart from a 24 hour concierge in the main lobby, the following measures were taken, according to a summary of the facts tendered on sentence: (Facts p 1) 
     
      
       
        
        “In order to access the residential premises, an electronic key is required to enter the main doors, past the concierge, through the lobby and on to the lifts. The lifts are operated by the same electronic key, each electronic key can only access the car park, pool level and the level that the resident lives on. The lifts are controlled by a centralised security computer to allow access and the foyer area is monitored by CCTV. 
        
       
       
        
        An individual door key is required to open the main door lock, all units have also been fitted with deadbolts to secure the front door.” 
        
       
      
    9 It was the Crown’s case, accepted by the jury, that Mr Ourdi entered the building by climbing without shoes up the north eastern side of the building. The facts summary said this: (Facts p 1) 
     
      
       
        
        “Some time before 5am, the offender took off his shoes and climbed up on the outside of the north eastern side of the building. He climbed up to level one, on top of a pergola onto the balcony of level two, where he has then climbed on the concrete pylon on the outside of the building accessing each level. (The first level he has accessed being level 3). The paint used in the construction of the tower leaves a powdery white residue on the hands when touched, this powder residue is very delicate and separates from the hand very easily. The markings from hands and feet can be seen on the balcony railings from level three (3) on the north eastern side of the building, going up every level to level nineteen (19).” 
        
       
      
    10 Only certain units were accessible from the north eastern side. Each of the offences concerned units on that side and property stolen from within each unit. An examination by police of the unit block after Mr Ourdi’s arrest revealed powdery white marks on the railings of a number of units, and in some cases such marks on the balcony sliding doors. 
     
      
    11 Count 1 involved entry to a unit on level 4 through an open doorway leading to the balcony. The room adjacent to the balcony was a bedroom and the occupant was asleep. There was a desk next to the bed. Within the desk drawer there was a Rolex watch, a man’s diamond ring and another watch, together valued at $60,000. The occupant recalled stirring as he thought someone was in the unit. However, he assumed it was his flatmate and went back to sleep. Days later he discovered that his property was missing. 
     
      
    12 Count 2 involved the unit on the floor above (level 5). Again, entry was gained through the open balcony door. The door gave access to the main bedroom, where a couple slept, a man and his pregnant wife. There was a bookshelf in the lounge room of the unit where the male occupant had left his wallet and the female her handbag. Cash and credit cards were stolen from each.  
     
      
    13 Count 3 was the more serious offence of aggravated break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence. It concerned a unit five floors above on level 10. The unit was occupied by a couple and their two daughters. A mobile phone and credit cards were stolen. 
     
      
    14 Count 4 involved breaking and entering a unit on level 17. It was occupied by Mr and Mrs Foley, he being a director of a goldmining company listed on the US stock exchange. Within the unit there was a cabinet with four replica gold bars, used for demonstration purposes. Each weighed about five kilograms and was gold plated, the core being lead. Mr Foley was in the habit of waking at 4.00 am to check the value of gold on the US exchange. The statement of facts described what then happened in these words: (Facts p 3) 
     
      
       
        
        “Shortly after going back to sleep, Mr Foley awoke, he saw a man standing in the doorway to his bedroom, looking at him and his wife asleep in their bed about a metre away. He saw the man reached out and picked up one of his replica gold bars located on the cabinet, then walked back out onto the balcony. Mr Foley woke his wife by gripping her on the thigh very hard. Sensing that something was wrong, Mrs Foley awoke, and was informed by Mr Foley that someone was in their unit. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr and Mrs Foley then watched as the man returned and took hold of another replica gold bar from the cabinet, before heading back to the balcony. Once the man had left, they both leapt out of bed and ran to the front deadlocked door of the unit. Opening the door with their keys they then ran out of the unit downstairs to the reception area and raised the alarm by calling ‘000’.” 
        
       
      
    15 Count 5 concerned the unit next door. The owner slept throughout. However, his wallet was moved and cash taken. 
     
      
    16 Mr and Mrs Foley gave evidence at the trial. They each gave a description of the person’s build. Their description was consistent with that of the applicant. Mrs Foley, moreover, went downstairs and saw a person emerge from the fire escape into the grounds of the block. The door to the fire escape could only be opened from the inside. It appeared to be the same person she had seen upstairs in her unit. That person was then chased by the police who, by this time, had arrived at the units. He was seen to discard one of the “gold bars” and was ultimately arrested in Bondi Junction. When arrested, he was found to be in possession of the property and cash that various unit holders later identified as having been stolen from their units. 
     
      
    17 Mr Ourdi, when arrested, exercised his right of silence. A month or so later, however, he agreed to answer questions in a recorded interview. The interview, according to the sentencing Judge, was “riddled with demonstrable falsities and implausible explanations” (ROS 3). Ultimately, at trial, Mr Ourdi accepted that he was at the stairwell of the building. However, he said that he was there in order to receive goods stolen by someone else. He was not the thief. In the face of what his Honour described as an “overwhelming Crown case”, the jury rejected that account. 
     
      
    18 In his remarks on sentence, his Honour found that there was planning, which is a matter of aggravation under s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He said this: (ROS 6) 
     
      
       
        
        “This was a planned criminal activity. The commission of these offences called for a degree of advanced observation and planning and, I might say, considerable daring and skill.” 
        
       
      
    19 The offences under s 112(2), as mentioned, carried a standard non parole period of 5 years where it is determined that those offences are “in the middle of the range of objective seriousness” (s 54A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). In that context, his Honour said this: (ROS 6) 
     
      
       
        
        “The objective level of seriousness then of these offences is quite high. Certainly not at the top of the range, but in my view, above the mid-range of such offences.” 
        
       
       
      Notice of Appeal. 
       
      
    20 The applicant identified four grounds of appeal, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1:  
        His Honour erred in imposing the same sentence in relation to the offences under s 111(2) and s 112(2). 
         
         
        Ground 2:  
        His Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of each of the offences. 
         
         
        Ground 3:  
        His Honour failed to give the applicant adequate credit for the period of quasi custody. 
         
         
        Ground 4:  
        The individual sentences and the effective sentence are manifestly excessive, taking into account the objective seriousness of the offences, including the applicant’s motivation for committing them, his extraordinary subjective case, his prospects of rehabilitation and the period of quasi custody. 
        
       
      
    21 Ground 3 was not pressed. I will consider the remaining grounds in turn. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: His Honour erred in imposing the same sentence in relation to the offences under s 111(2) and s 112(2). 
       
      
    22 Mr Ourdi received the same sentence in respect of each of the five counts (7 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 3 years), the sentences being partially accumulated, so that the total sentence was 8 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 4 years. The applicant drew attention to important differences between the various charges. Counts 1 and 2 were brought under s 111(2) of the Crimes Act, where the maximum penalty was 14 years imprisonment. Counts 3, 4 and 5 were brought under s 112(2) of the Act, where the penalty was 20 years imprisonment and there was a standard non parole period of 5 years. The more serious offence under s 112(2) required the Crown to prove, not simply that the premises were entered, but that they were broken into. The maximum penalty was a relevant point of reference in the sentencing process (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357). Error could therefore be inferred. The applicant, in submissions, said this: (AS p8) 
     
      
       
        
        “Given the different elements of the two offences, the different maximum penalties and the fact that the standard non parole period did not apply to the s 111(2) offences, his Honour erred in not imposing a lesser sentence for the s 111(2) offences.” 
        
       
      
    23 The Crown answered these submissions by suggesting that a shorter sentence under s 111(2) would have made no practical difference. His Honour was plainly aware of the maximum penalty, and referred to that difference in his remarks (ROS 4). He also identified the elements of each offence (ROS 1). The Crown speculated that his Honour probably accepted the submission by counsel then appearing for the applicant, during the sentencing submissions, which was as follows: (30.11.07: T13) 
     
      
       
        
        “Other than someone opening and shutting a door as the purported ‘break’ in relation to the s 112(2) matters, there is absolutely no difference in these offences, for practical sentencing purposes in my submission.” 
        
       
      
    24 Nonetheless, there is obvious force in the submission made by the applicant. The structure of the sentences does not appear to reflect the differences in the various charges. Before expressing a concluded view, I will examine the remaining grounds. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: 
        
      His Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of each of the offences. 
       
      
    25 The statute provided that, in respect of an offence under s 112(2), there was a standard non parole period. His Honour was therefore obliged by s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to consider the objective seriousness of the offences in relation to a mid-range offence. He determined that the objective seriousness was “quite high”, not at the top of the range, but above the mid-range of such offences (ROS 6). 
     
      
    26 The applicant submitted that his Honour’s determination could not be justified. There was error in four respects: 
     
      
    · First, his Honour failed to take account of the range of serious indictable offences that may be committed under this section and that larceny was at the bottom of that range. 
     
      
    · Secondly, his Honour failed to take account of the applicant’s motive in committing the offences, which significantly ameliorated his culpability. 
     
      
    · Thirdly, his Honour took account of circumstances of aggravation which were not available. 
     
      
    · Fourthly, his Honour took account of a number of irrelevant considerations. 
     
      
    27 Dealing with the first of these issues, s 112(2) is an aggravated form of the offence under s 112(1) which, relevantly, is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “112(1) A person who: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) breaks and enters any dwelling-house or other building and commits any serious indictable offence therein ... ” 
          
         
        
       
      
    28 The term “serious indictable offence” is defined by s 4 of the Crimes Act to mean “an indictable offence that is punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of 5 years or more”. The expression therefore comprehended a diverse range of offending, including offences of violence. Here, the serious indictable offence was larceny, punishable by 5 years imprisonment. According to the applicant, his Honour, in determining whether the offence was mid-range or above or below, needed to have in mind the diverse range of indictable offences and larceny’s position at the bottom of that range. 
     
      
    29 The applicant submitted that his Honour only had regard to offences of the same kind, that is offences of break enter and steal. He made reference to the matter of The Attorney General’s Application under s 26 of the Criminal Procedure Act No 1: R v Ponfield and Ors [1999] NSWCCA 435; (1999) 48 NSWLR 327, where the Court of Criminal Appeal considered the provision of a guideline judgment for offences such as those committed by the applicant. His Honour, in his remarks, quoted a passage from the judgment of Grove J (with whom other members of the Court agreed) in that case where his Honour identified factors relevant to the seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    30 Attention was drawn to R v Huynh [2005] NSWCCA 220, where Simpson J rejected a submission that, where the serious indictable offence was larceny, it must necessarily fall below the mid-range in terms of objective seriousness. Her Honour said this:  
     
      
       
        
        “[27] The assessment of where the offence lies in the range of offences of its type is to be made by reference to all of the facts and circumstances of the offence, and to the range of offences of its kind which come before the court. One circumstance which is here of relevance in that assessment is the quantity and value of the property stolen. It is not to the point that the property was recovered. It was, in fact, stolen, before being recovered. The fact that the maximum penalty for stealing barely takes that offence into s 112(2) does not of itself determine where the offence lies in the scale of gravity of offences against s 112(2). Certainly, one might ordinarily expect that offences involving violence would be regarded as more serious than stealing. But that does not preclude a finding that an offence under s 112(2), where the ‘serious indictable offence’ is larceny, being classified as in the middle of the range.” 
        
       
      
    31 In Marshall v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 24, Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing) referred to Simpson J’s judgment in Huynh and added the following:  
     
      
       
        
        “[37] Therefore, in determining whether the offence falls within the mid-range of seriousness, the court has to have regard to the nature of the offence committed in the premises, including its seriousness as against offences of its type generally. Where that offence is larceny, the guideline judgment in  
        R v Ponfield  
        [1999] NSWCCA 435; (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 might assist in determining the relevant factors to be considered in the evaluation of the seriousness of the offence. So the type of premises entered, the nature and value of the property taken, and whether there is substantial damage to, or ransacking of, the contents of the premises will be relevant considerations.” 
        
       
      
    32 The Crown, in response, acknowledged that in characterising the objective seriousness of the offence in relation to the mid-range, there were a number of matters that can be said to be relevant. One was that the section comprehended a diverse range of offences and another that larceny was one of the lesser indictable offences within that range (R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130 at [48]). According to the Crown, whilst his Honour made no reference to either aspect, that does not mean that he did not have them both in mind. 
     
      
    33 Dealing with these submissions, his Honour did not say that he would only consider break entering and stealing offences when determining objective seriousness in relation to a mid-range offence. Nor do I believe it should be inferred. His Honour identified the elements of the offence under s 112(2). He did not do so by adopting a shorthand description such as “break enter and steal”. He referred to the element of “breaking in order to commit a serious indictable offence” (ROS 1). Since the serious indictable offence involved larceny, it was appropriate to refer to R v Ponfield (supra) for the reasons given by Howie J in Marshall v Regina (supra). No doubt, it was desirable that his Honour refer to each of the considerations which have been the subject of the applicant’s submissions (that is, the diverse nature of serious indictable offences comprehended by s 112(2) and the position of larceny within that spectrum). However, I would not find error through having failed to do so unless it were not reasonably open to his Honour to make the finding which was made. Here, for the reasons given in the context of ground 4 below, I believe the finding (“above the mid-range”) was open.  
     
      
    34 The second complaint concerned an alleged failure by the sentencing Judge to take account of the applicant’s “pathological gambling” when addressing the objective seriousness of the offences. His Honour had taken that matter into account in the context of the applicant’s subjective case. However, it was said that it had a wider relevance. It should have been part of the assessment of whether the offence could be characterised as above or below the mid-range (cf R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [86], per Wood CJ at CL (Spigelman CJ and Simpson J agreeing)). The applicant made the following submission: (App’s Subs p 14) 
     
      
       
        
        “[38] In the unusual circumstances of this case, there was a clear link between the applicant’s background and his gambling addiction, which was causally connected to the commission of the offences. ... ” 
        
       
      
    35 The submissions added these words: 
     
      
       
        
        “[40] His Honour overlooked this significant matter when considering the objective gravity of the offence ... ” 
        
       
      
    36 The Crown responded that gambling was rarely a matter of mitigation (R v Henry & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, per Spigelman CJ at [203]; Assi v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 257, per Howie J at [27]). The present case, according to the Crown, was not one of those rare cases. Further, there was no warrant for assuming that his Honour had not given the applicant’s gambling due weight. The submission that it had been overlooked depended upon inference arising from the structure of his Honour’s remarks. In that context, the Crown said this: (Crown Subs p 6) 
     
      
       
        
        [23] ... Whilst his Honour’s assessment of objective seriousness followed a recitation of the facts of the offending and that was in turn followed by a consideration of subjective matters which included references in the psychologist’s report and the pre-sentence report to his gambling, that reasoning entails too strict an approach to his Honour’s thinking process which led to his ultimate assessment. It does not follow that the motive did not affect his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences.” 
        
       
      
    37 In dealing with these submissions, let me first refer briefly to the authorities concerning the relevance of gambling. As a generality, and a matter of social policy, the authorities have markedly restricted the relevance of gambling in the assessment of the criminality of the offender. King CJ said this in  SA Police v John (1995) 79 A Crim R 510: (at 511) 
     
      
       
        
        “There is a degree of public scandal involved in the sight of a legal practitioner who abuses his trust for his own advantage going free. The learned magistrate attached considerable importance to the description of the respondent’s gambling addiction as a disease. That is a description accorded to it by a psychiatrist who gave evidence, and I do not dispute its correctness, but the nature of that disease has to be truly understood. In fact, it was an addiction to the habit of gambling. This Court has said on many occasions that the security of the society depends upon the ability of people to resist temptation which arises out of addictions and other forms of human weakness.” 
        
       
      
    38 His Honour added: (at 512) 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court has said on many occasions, for instance, that addiction to drugs, or addiction to liquor cannot be regarded as a licence to commit crime, and that if persons who are addicted in that way succumb to the temptation to feed their addiction by crimes of dishonesty or any other form of crime, they must expect to answer for those crimes by experiencing the appropriate punishment. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant in the present case suffered the affliction in the end of being addicted to gambling. The addiction, no doubt, arose from a progressive failure to resist temptation to gamble excessively. But he was under no compulsion to take other people’s money to feed that addiction.” 
        
       
      
    39 In R v Henry (supra), Spigelman CJ (Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing) made the following comment in the guideline judgment on robbery, when considering the relevance of drug addiction and other addictions to the culpability of offenders: (at 385) 
     
      
       
        
        “[202] There is no warrant, in my opinion, to assess a crime induced by a need for funds to feed a drug addiction, as being lower in the scale of moral culpability than other perceived requirements for money. 
        
       
       
        
        [203] Counsel making these submissions was driven to accept the proposition that an addiction to gambling, with its attendant need for money, could similarly be the basis for a claim for mitigation. He went further and indicated that an elevated sex drive which also had a physiological basis, could be a mitigating factor for the commission of a rape or for the conduct of a paedophile. In my opinion all these submissions should be rejected.” 
        
       
      
    40 More recently in Anna Le v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 136, Latham J (McColl JA agreeing) said this in the context of the importation of heroin: 
     
      
       
        
        “[32] ... Whether that explanation be the offender’s vulnerability arising out of a drug addiction, or a gambling addiction, it generally does not warrant the extension of leniency. ... “ 
        
       
      
    41 In Assi v Regina (supra) Howie J (the other members of the Court agreeing) expressed the principle in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “[27] ... Although his gambling habit may explain his fall into such serious criminal conduct and give some hope of rehabilitation in the future, it has been held to be a rare case where an offender can seek mitigation of penalty based upon an addiction to gambling, even where it is pathological:  
        R v Molesworth 
         [1999] NSWCCA 43. ... ” 
        
       
      
    42 So there is a rule (where addiction does not operate to mitigate the offence) and there are rare exceptions. Wood CJ at CL provided insight into the exceptions in R v Henry (supra), when he said this in the context of drug addiction: 
     
      
       
        
        “[273] In my view the relevant principles are as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the need to acquire funds to support a drug habit, even a severe habit, is not an excuse to commit an armed robbery or any similar offence, and of itself is not a matter of mitigation; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) however the fact that an offence is motivated by such a need may be taken into account as a factor relevant to the objective criminality of the offence in so far as it may throw light on matters such as: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the impulsivity of the offence and the extent of any planning for it: cf  
          R v Bouchard 
           (1996) 84 A Crim R 499 at 501-502 and  
          R v Nolan 
           (Victorian Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, 2 December 1998, unreported); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) the existence or non-existence of any alternative reason that may have operated in aggravation of the offence, for example, that it was motivated to fund some other serious criminal venture or to support a campaign of terrorism; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) the state of mind or capacity of the offender to exercise judgment, for example, if he or she was in the grips of an extreme state of withdrawal of the kind that may have led to a frank disorder of thought processes or to the act being other than a willed act; ... ” 
          
         
        
       
      
    43 Here the evidence concerning the applicant’s addiction came substantially from the Probation and Parole Report and a psychologist’s report. The Probation and Parole Report included the following:  
     
      
       
        
        “Shortly after his arrival in Australia, Mr Ourdi received a large poker machine payout and his ex-guardian advised that this appears to have had a negative impact on him. She related that she was aware that, on a previous occasion, Mr Ourdi had attempted to retrieve money from a poker machine in which he had earlier lost money. She indicated that the offender often displayed this type of naivety. 
        
       
       
        
        She added that, after his arrest on the current matters, it was discovered that he had made two relatively large withdrawals from an automatic teller machine at Star City Casino in Sydney and it appears that he had hidden his gambling from his wife and his guardian’s family. Mr Ourdi acknowledged that his family were unaware of his gambling. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Ourdi admitted to having a gambling problem and that he became involved in this offence to fund his gambling. He said that it did not matter if he won or lost, it was like something was missing when he was not gambling.” 
        
       
      
    44 The psychologist, whose report was tendered during the sentencing proceedings, considered that Mr Ourdi’s preoccupation with gambling and his difficulty in controlling the urge to gamble, came within the definition of “pathological gambling”. He said this: (p 6) 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Ourdi reported symptoms consistent with pathological gambling. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) (2000) describe pathological gambling as  
        ‘persistent and recurrent maladaptive gambling behaviour that disrupts personal, family or vocational pursuits’.  
        It is noted that individuals with pathological gambling symptoms can take greater risks to acquire financial resources for gambling, and may resort to anti-social behaviour to obtain money (APA, 2000). The course of the disorder is typically chronic. In interview, Mr Ourdi expressed a willingness to enter into specific counselling and treatment for his gambling problem.” 
        
       
      
    45 Mr Ourdi’s gambling does not, in my view, come within the exception. He withdrew funds from his bank account. He then lost those funds gambling. At some later point he went out and committed crimes to obtain money. His crimes were not impulsive. On the contrary, they involved careful observation and planning. They were executed skilfully, with a clear head, as he scaled a 22 storey tower block.  
     
      
    46 There is, moreover, force in the Crown’s submission that it cannot be assumed that his Honour failed to take account of Mr Ourdi’s gambling in making his assessment of the objective seriousness of his crimes. Although he dealt with the issue in the broad context of the applicant’s subjective case, his Honour used the following words, when referring to the pre-sentence report and that of the psychologist: (ROS 9) 
     
      
       
        
        “Reference is made in both to a gambling problem which lies behind his offending behaviour.” 
        
       
      
    47 These words may suggest that, with some charity, his Honour regarded Mr Ourdi’s gambling problem as within the rare exception. But whether that be right or wrong, I would not find error on this material. 
     
      
    48 Moving to the third complaint, relevant to his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences, two issues were identified in the context of his Honour’s discussion of circumstances of aggravation. The first was that his Honour said nothing which suggested that he took into account the diverse nature of circumstances of aggravation, as defined by s 105A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (and the relative seriousness of para (f)) within that range). The circumstances under s 105A(1) included that the offender was armed with an offensive weapon (para (a)), that the offence was committed in company (para (b)), that the offender used violence (para (c)) and other matters more serious, it was suggested, than the circumstance relied upon by the Crown (para (f)) (ie that the offender knew that a person was in the place where the offence was committed). 
     
      
    49 The second issue related to the circumstances identified by his Honour as matters of aggravation. His Honour accepted that the offence was “a planned criminal activity” (s 21A(2)(n) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). He also accepted, without discussion, that s 21A(2)(m) operated as a circumstance of aggravation, namely, that the offences involved multiple victims. The applicant asserted that was an error for the reasons given by Howie J (Grove and Hall JJ agreeing) in Regina v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145; (2005) 65 NSWLR 740, where the following was said:  
     
      
       
        
        “[28] His Honour was also in error in taking into account as an aggravating feature s 21A(2)(m) ‘the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts’. Clearly there were multiple offences before the court and they indicated that there were multiple victims and a series of criminal acts. But the applicant was going to be sentenced for each of those offences and the fact that there were multiple victims and multiple acts of criminality would be addressed by the sentences to be imposed for each of those offences in accordance with the principle of totality. With respect it is illogical to take into account, where there are multiple offences charged, that it is an aggravating factor relevant to each offence that there is a series of criminal acts disclosed by the offences before the court. 
        
       
       
        
        [29] Clearly the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(m) is concerned with the situation where a single offence contains a number of allegations of criminal acts that are part and parcel of a single course of criminal conduct. A charge of this nature will be frequently found in cases of fraud or dishonesty perpetrated against a single victim such as a charge of embezzlement or larceny as a servant. It is also common to charge multiple instances of supplying drugs over a lengthy period of time as one offence under s 25 of the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.  
        Of course there are offences that have, as an element of the offence, multiple acts of criminality, such as an offence of ongoing drug supply under s 25A of the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         or an offence of persistent sexual abuse of a child under s 66EA of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . When sentencing for such an offence, the court must bear in mind the prohibition against taking into account as a matter of aggravation that such is an element of the offence charged.” 
        
       
      
    50 The Crown responded that, while some circumstances of aggravation appeared, prima facie, to be less serious than others, it was necessary to look at what actually happened and what the offender did (Marshall v Regina (supra), per Howie J at [38]). The Crown further submitted that counsel then appearing for Mr Ourdi agreed with the Crown that s 21A(2)(m) had application (T 9), so that there was no error. 
     
      
    51 Dealing with these submissions, the first argument is similar to that advanced in the context of the diverse nature of serious indictable offences comprehended by s 112(2) (supra [31]). My view on this aspect is the same as expressed in the earlier context. One may assume that his Honour was aware of the broad nature of circumstances of aggravation in s 105A. The issue is whether he had those matters in mind when determining the objective seriousness of the particular offence and its place in relation to the mid-range. It was desirable that his Honour advert to that issue to demonstrate that he did have that matter in mind. Again, I would not find error through having failed to mention it, unless it were not reasonably open to make the finding which was in fact made.  
     
      
    52 I agree that, in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences, the sentencing Judge must ultimately look at what actually happened. Someone may be armed with an offensive weapon and force entry into an apartment where nobody is home and later be apprehended by a security guard as he is leaving with stolen property. The danger to members in the community in such circumstances is perhaps less than entry, unarmed, into an apartment where it is known that people are in occupation and asleep. 
     
      
    53 That said, I believe there was error in treating as a matter of aggravation (s 21A(2)(m)), that there were multiple victims, for the reasons identified by Howie J in R v Tadrosse (supra). The Crown, by way of rejoinder, said that there was a compensating error in favour of the applicant, in that his Honour determined that the victims were not vulnerable (s 21A(2)(l)), when in fact they were. It may be inferred he knew they were asleep. The applicant responded that his Honour had not found they were vulnerable and that was the end of the matter. Whilst that may be so, the issue nonetheless arises under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 whether, in those circumstances, some other sentence is warranted in law. Here the offences occurred in a residential tower block after 4.00am and before dawn. They occurred when it may be inferred that the residents were asleep and therefore vulnerable. However, I will postpone the s 6(3) issue until I have considered the last ground (Ground 4) below. 
     
      
    54 I come finally to the complaint that, in determining that the offences were “above the mid-range”, his Honour took into account irrelevant considerations. Three were identified. The first may be quickly dismissed. His Honour described one of the occupants as a “retired solicitor”. His description was accurate. There was no basis for thinking that it influenced his Honour’s determination in any way. 
     
      
    55 The second matter concerns the charges under s 111(2) of the Crimes Act, counts 1 and 2. The Crown was obliged to prove an intent to steal. The fact that goods were stolen was relevant to proving that intent. However, the value of the items stolen was, according to the applicant, irrelevant to an assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. The Crown responded as follows: (p 7) 
     
      
       
        
        “[32] The theft of the watch and its value were relevant. It increased the impact on the victim. It shows that his intent to steal encompassed items of value. It was not an element of the offence but it showed that he in fact carried out his intent. This showed the seriousness of his intent. The fact of theft did not offend De Simoni and did not have to be ignored. Indeed it could not be ignored as it showed the true extent of his conduct.” 
        
       
      
    56 I accept that submission. There was no error. 
     
      
    57 The final matter was that his Honour, according to the applicant, took into account that the two imitation gold bars would, if genuine, have been worth about $500,000 each, as set out in the statement of facts. The Crown responded that the applicant plainly believed that they had significant value, although he would not have been aware of their precise value. 
     
      
    58 Again, I accept the Crown’s argument. There was, incidentally, no objection to the statement of facts. The applicant clearly believed that the “gold bars” were valuable. He went back a second time to obtain another. He carried them out of the building. He only threw them away when he was in danger of being caught. There was no error. 
     
      
    59 The end result is that there was error on one aspect (s 21A(2)(m)): (multiple victims). There were also a number of issues which are best dealt with in the context of Ground 4, to which I now turn. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    60 The applicant was born in October 1980 in the Western Sahara. His homeland was at war and occupied by Morocco. His father was killed when he was four or five years old. He recalled him being laid out for his funeral. He had no recollection of his mother. His early life was spent in circumstances which his Honour accepted were “absolutely appalling” (ROS 8). He lived a nomadic life with his kinsmen, which involved extreme hardship, poverty, hunger and mistreatment. He had no formal education and was illiterate in his native language, Arabic. 
     
      
    61 At the age of approximately 12 years, Mr Ourdi stowed away on a boat bound for Spain. He spent the years that followed in Spain, Italy and France where he lived on the streets. Whilst in France he was placed in an institution, awaiting deportation to North Africa when he “came of age”. Before that time, however, he managed to leave the institution and stowed away on a container ship bound for Australia. 
     
      
    62 One gathers that his presence on the container ship became known and that, once in Melbourne, he was transferred to the Villawood Detention Centre. He was then aged 14 or 15 years. He remained in custody for approximately six months. He was referred to a refugee lawyer, Ms Jill Vidler, who obtained a Protection Visa on his behalf. However, he could not be released in the absence of appropriate accommodation and supervision. Ms Vidler, in these circumstances, with what his Honour described as “unstinting kindness”, offered to act as his guardian. She took him into her family. 
     
      
    63 Mr Ourdi thereafter, until the age of 18, lived in Ms Vidler’s home and was accepted as “a brother” by her children. Her children provided references to his Honour. There were significant problems of adjustment, quite apart from his inability to speak English. Mr Ourdi had been traumatised by his childhood experiences and suffered from nightmares and problems of emotional adjustment. 
     
      
    64 Arrangements were made for Mr Ourdi to attend a local school to learn English. He did so for approximately one year. He is said to have demonstrated a good work ethic. Having left the school, he performed a variety of labouring jobs. Ultimately he was employed as an auto-electrician. References were provided by his employers. He was highly regarded. At the age of 18 he left home and lived in his own residence. 
     
      
    65 Mr Ourdi had a number of criminal convictions, although they were described by his Honour as “minor” (ROS 8). He was convicted of offences of dishonesty in 1999 and entered into a recognisance to be of good behaviour. On a number of occasions he was fined for driving whilst disqualified. 
     
      
    66 In 2001, Mr Ourdi was granted Australian citizenship. He returned to Morocco the same year and later married the daughter of a friend he had made in the Western Sahara. He returned to Australia with his wife. She later became pregnant and was expecting their child at the time he was arrested in May 2005. It was reported that she was shocked since neither she, nor Ms Vidler his former guardian, was aware of his gambling. His wife gave birth to a daughter in September 2005. Mr Ourdi was granted bail before the birth and thereafter complied with the bail conditions, which were relaxed after a number of months. Ms Vidler described the profound effect upon him through the birth of his daughter. She gave the following evidence: (30.11.07, T 7) 
     
      
       
        
        “A. I think he has finally begun to take responsibility for his own actions and the effect that his actions have had on other people. I mean we were like an adopted family and not one from the same cultural background, whereas his wife – and she didn’t have a child at the time, but his wife does come from – speaks the same – speaks Arabic and they have a very good relationship and he realised that he was at risk of losing everything that was most precious to him. It just made him admit to what he’d done, to not be angry about everything, to realise he had to get through it, which is why he’s dealt with gaol quite well.” 
        
       
      
    67 Once Mr Ourdi was sentenced, Ms Vidler, again heroically, took Mr Ourdi’s wife and baby daughter into her home, where they remain pending his release. 
     
      
    68 Reference has previously been made to the report of the psychologist, Mr Anasson, and his opinion that the applicant had symptoms consistent with pathological gambling. He also had other emotional problems, the consequence of his harsh childhood and early life. Mr Anasson said this: (p 8) 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Ourdi does have significant underlying psychological and emotional problems stemming from his formative years which remain unresolved. It is likely that these factors have, in part, contributed to him developing problematic gambling habits and making poor choices which have ultimately resulted in his current offences.” 
        
       
      
    69 Mr Anasson believed that specific counselling and treatment for his addiction would assist him.  
     
      
    70 His Honour accepted that the applicant’s young wife and daughter were likely to have a profound stabilising effect upon his future life (ROS 10). His Honour added: (ROS 10) 
     
      
       
        
        “I have already mentioned that Miss Vidler and her family are ready to continue to support the prisoner and his family. This quite remarkable woman has taken in the prisoner’s wife and child on his incarceration. Her continuing support affords him quite a good chance of rehabilitation when he comes out of custody.” 
        
       
      
    71 His Honour found that there were special circumstances. The only negative finding made, in terms of the applicant’s future, concerned the absence of remorse (ROS 4). Mr Ourdi continued to deny his guilt. The Probation and Parole Service said that he continued to minimise his role in the offence (ROS 4). His Honour, in this context, said this: (ROS 4) 
     
      
       
        
        “ ... A persistence in this attitude in the face of the jury verdict does not, in my view, bode well for the necessary changes that are required to this prisoner’s lifestyle and attitudes.” 
        
       
      
    72 The applicant, in the context of Ground 4, repeated the argument used in respect of Ground 1, that the imposition of the same sentence (7 years) in respect of offences which were markedly different (s 111(2) and s 112(2)) suggested error. Further, the applicant’s “extraordinary subjective case” had not been adequately reflected in the effective total sentence. It was suggested his Honour may only have had regard to the subjective case when determining the issue of special circumstances. It was submitted that, looking at the sentence as a whole, the Court should infer that his Honour had, inappropriately, not taken the subjective case into account in determining whether there were reasons for departing from the standard non parole period (cf MLP v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 271 at [33]; (2006) 164 A Crim R 93). 
     
      
    73 It was acknowledged by the applicant that it was open to his Honour to partially accumulate the sentences. However, the statistics from the Judicial Commission demonstrated that the sentences for the s 111(2) offences were outside the range and the sentences for the s 112(2) offences were towards the top of the range. 
     
      
    74 Responding to these arguments, the Crown acknowledged that his Honour had accepted the applicant’s background as “extraordinary”. He had made a number of favourable findings, including that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. At the same time he plainly had reservations and expressed caution. He noted the absence of remorse and the need to address the problem of gambling. 
     
      
    75 The statistics were, according to the Crown, ultimately of limited value. The upper limit of the sentencing discretion was the maximum penalty, which was 14 years for the s 111(2) offences and 20 years for the charges under s 112(2). In Ma & Pham v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 240, Hulme J made the following observation: 
     
      
       
        
        “[91] Subliminal in the reference to the statistics and the observation that the sentences here fall into the highest end of the range is the proposition that that is indicative of error. The proposition must be rejected. As this Court has said on many occasions, the range extends to the maximum penalty set by Parliament and it is against that that an offender’s conduct must be primarily judged. Certainly, the statistics may at times inspire further reflection on the sentence in a particular case and perhaps give some limited guidance but, of themselves, they do not demonstrate error. Particularly is this so because, within each category, they provide no detail of the cases reflected in them.” 
        
       
      
    76 Attention was drawn to the fact that the sentences in respect of the s 111(2) offences were totally concurrent and therefore had no practical impact upon the length of the sentence. 
     
      
    77 Dealing with these arguments, Mr Ourdi pleaded not guilty to each charge. He went to trial and was found guilty on each count. The standard non parole period under s 112(2) of 5 years had application, subject to his Honour’s determination of the objective seriousness of the offence in comparison to a mid-range offence. That determination obliged his Honour to consider a number of issues, as set out in MLP v R (supra). In broad terms, he was obliged to evaluate the objective seriousness of the offences (including the applicant’s state of mind) and to adjust his assessment (whether up or down) by reference to the subjective case and his determination of whether there were special circumstances. 
     
      
    78 Here, his Honour determined that the objective seriousness of each offence was above the mid-range, suggesting (at that point of the evaluation) a non parole period of more than 5 years. He then addressed the other issues and fixed a non parole period of 3 years. Taking account of totality, he determined an aggregate non parole period of 4 years with a total sentence of 8 years. A number of issues arise. Was it open to his Honour to view the objective seriousness of the offences under s 112(2) as being above the mid-range? If it was, were the determinations that followed within the sentencing discretion that he had? 
     
      
    79 I believe it was open to his Honour to characterise these offences as above the mid-range. The applicant’s target was a high security 22 storey apartment block in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. His Honour inferred that careful observation and planning had been undertaken to penetrate the security system. Mr Ourdi entered the building in the very early hours of the morning under cover of darkness, at a time when the occupants could be expected to be asleep. He audaciously scaled the exterior of the building, moving from floor to floor, rising as high as the twentieth floor. He entered a number of apartments and broke into others. Once inside an apartment, he silently went in search of cash and valuables. In one apartment he searched through the bedside drawer, removing jewellery whilst the occupant lay asleep on the bed alongside. He ultimately entered the apartment of Mr and Mrs Foley on level 17 and silently moved around that apartment in the dark, watched by Mr and Mrs Foley, who were awake. It was, as his Honour said, a “heart stopping experience”. Having obtained two gold bars, he then moved from the balcony to the apartment next door where he continued his harvest of valuables. 
     
      
    80 This was not an impulsive act. It was not a smash and grab raid, over in a minute. It was a bold plan, well thought out and skilfully executed over a significant period of time. But for the chance that Mr Foley was awake, Mr Ourdi may have escaped. In fairness, it should be noted that the property was ultimately recovered. Most of the residents were oblivious to his presence, and discovered that property had been stolen shortly after. Nonetheless, these were daring crimes, planned, professional, and committed one after another. Paying attention to the diverse crimes comprehended by s 112(2) and the different circumstances of aggravation available under s 105A, I believe it was open to his Honour to regard these crimes as above the mid-range. 
     
      
    81 Given that finding, a substantial adjustment was then made after consideration of the subjective case and the issue of special circumstances (reducing the standard non parole period from 5 years to 3). I believe the sentence, overall, was within range. 
     
      
    82 Although it must be acknowledged that the sentences under s 111(2) are more than one would expect, given the sentences imposed under s 112(2), they were, as the Crown points out, wholly concurrent. They did not add to the sentence overall. I do not believe it is necessary, in these circumstances, to restructure this aspect of the sentence. 
     
      
       
      The issues under s 6(3) of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
      . 
       
      
    83 Error has been found in respect of one aspect of Ground 2. The issue therefore arises under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, whether some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. On that question the applicant is entitled to ask the Court to examine, not simply the material relating to his offence and his subjective case (canvassed in the context of Ground 4), but affidavit material describing what has happened since the sentence was imposed (Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455; (2005) 159 A Crim R 154 at [124], per Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreeing) and Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284, per Spigelman CJ at [1]-[19] and Kirby J at [62]). 
     
      
    84 Here there were a number of affidavits. Mr Ourdi has been in custody since 7 December 2007, when he was sentenced. On 16 January 2008, he was classified as suitable for minimum security within the Silverwater Correctional Centre. Four days later, on 20 January 2008, he endeavoured to escape. According to a statement of facts relied upon by the police in respect of charges which have now been laid, Mr Ourdi got over the inner fence line but became stuck, receiving numerous lacerations to his head on the razor wire. He was transferred to hospital. After his recovery, he was taken to the Lithgow Correctional Centre, where he remains. For a time, he was there placed in a maximum security cell. 
     
      
    85 Mr Ourdi described the circumstances which led to his attempted escape in his affidavit in these words: (Affidavit 4.2.09) 
     
      
       
        
        “6. On Saturday 19 January 2008 my wife and daughter visited me. My daughter was sick. After the visit I began to stress about too many things. So much was going on in my head. I needed to talk to my wife. I was worried about my daughter and I was worried my wife might leave me. Usually my wife visits both Saturday and Sunday but that weekend some friends had booked to see me on Sunday so my wife could not. I needed to speak to her but I had no money in my phone account and couldn’t put anything in it until Monday. All these things were going on in my head all night. I was very stressed and depressed and then on Sunday morning without any real thought about what I was going I ran out and attempted to climb the fence. I was cut all over and there was blood everywhere. I walked back into the wing and was taken to hospital.” 
        
       
      
    86 The charges against Mr Ourdi have yet to be dealt with. 
     
      
    87 It is also apparent from Mr Ourdi’s affidavit that he has furthered his education whilst in gaol and undertaken a number of courses. He has also been examined by a psychiatrist, Dr William E Lucas, whose report was tendered. Dr Lucas described the applicant’s background, his nightmares, anxiety and depression. He diagnosed chronic post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He reaffirmed, nonetheless, the impression which the sentencing Judge had that Mr Ourdi’s prospects of rehabilitation were good. He said this: (p 9) 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear that he has made considerable progress over the years and I believe he has the capacity to once again settle in the community, work and maintain his family. ... ”  
        
       
      
    88 Dealing with this material, the attempted escape has no specific relevance to the s 6(3) issues, apart from reaffirming, perhaps, the importance of Mr Ourdi’s wife and child to his rehabilitation. The additional material, including the report of Dr Lucas, simply reinforce the impression which the sentencing Judge had that Mr Ourdi’s prospects of rehabilitation remain good. 
     
      
    89 However, taking account of this material and the applicant’s very strong subjective case, the offences remain very serious. I do not believe some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. 
     
      
       
      Orders. 
       
      
    90 The orders I therefore propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal should be granted; 
       
       
      2. but the appeal dismissed.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: This case concerns an attack by a young man on his stepfather. It was a savage attack with a large knife. The attack could well have resulted in the death of the victim and involved multiple stabbing to the neck, face, left arm and hand of the victim. 2 The victim survived the attack but is left with scars, a hoarse voice and permanent damage to his left hand. 3 The accused is a young man of 25 years. He has no significant prior criminal record. He has one offence of driving in the mid-range prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood, however he has abused alcohol and drugs from the age of 15 years and for many years before the attack he was consumed with resentment towards and hatred of the victim, John McRae his stepfather. 4 The attack occurred at home at 10pm on 30 January 2007 and in the presence of other members of the family of both men. John McRae had been for a run and was sitting with his back to a lounge in the lounge room watching television. The offender sneaked up behind with a large knife in his right hand and attacked the victim from behind. He stabbed him viciously in the neck and face and in the arm. The victim had no chance of repelling the attack. The offender’s mother then grabbed him and pulled him away and he ran out of the house somewhere and threw away the large knife. 5 The victim staggered out of the house and on to the lawn where a neighbour cared for him until an ambulance arrived and took him to hospital where he remained for some weeks in an emergency unit. His wife visited him while he was in hospital and took some photos whilst he was on life support. At that stage she was supporting him.6 When the matter came for trial originally, the offender pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. On the fifth day of the trial after extensive cross examination of the victim, the offender pleaded guilty to the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. I accepted the plea and discharged the jury. It is now my task to sentence him.7 During the cross examination of the victim Mr John McRae counsel for the accused Mr Stuart Littlemore QC put to Mr McRae that he was brutal and cruel, that he had assaulted the accused on many occasions, that he had ill treated him, had locked him in the laundry and treated him as unimportant and useless. Mr McRae denied doing any of these things although he did admit that he administered corporal punishment to the offender at times and that officers of the Department of Community Services had spoken to him on a number of occasions after the offender’s natural father had made complaints about his conduct. 8 The impression I formed of Mr McRae was that he was an honest and fairly definite witness. Evidence was certainly tendered to establish that there were investigations by the Department of Community Services on a number of occasions into allegations put to them by the natural father of the offender. Those documents did not establish that Mr McRae had engaged in brutal conduct on any occasion. 9 The evidence by Mr McRae certainly established the relationship between him and the offender on the whole was not a good one and he admitted there were a number of occasions when there were unpleasant exchanges between them and he agreed he did not have a good relationship with the offender’s natural father, nor with the offender’s maternal grandparents. 10 There is evidence also that before Christmas 2006, Mr McRae took his wife and five children on a trip to London. The offender did not accompany them and when the family was in Singapore, he sent his mother an abusive text message telling her that he hated her and his stepfather and he would see them in court. In a subsequent affidavit of 14 April 2008, the offender in paragraph 53 said: 
     
      
      “That was definitely not about going to court because I intended to attack John McRae, that was because I had been talking about taking them to court for a long time (with my sister Emily and my brother James) I wanted to sue them for all the abuse that I had suffered from them.”  
      
    11 In his affidavit he goes on to set out claims that while his parents, brothers and sisters were away, his sister Emily rang him and told him of Mr McRae acting violently towards his mother and his sister Emily. At the time he was taking a lot of drugs, including speed, ecstasy and marijuana and taking drugs was the only happiness in his life. 12 He recounts a conversation with his mother following the return of the family in which he indicated that he needed one further month to stay at home and then he would leave with Emily. It would seem that his mother, by her reply, was pleased that he was going. Following this he continued to drink alcohol and to take illegal drugs.13 On 24 January 2007 following the break up of a relationship with his girlfriend, he contemplated suicide but did not go through with it. He had a number of verbal disputes with John McRae and claimed that Mr McRae threatened to kill him if he brought a motorbike onto a patio. There was no physical violence between them. He also claimed that on the night of the attack, he drank six pints of beer between 6pm and 9.30pm and three double shots of rum. He also claimed that he had consumed some ecstasy and some speed. 14 When he gave evidence before me on 4 August 2008 he confirmed what he said in his affidavit. The report of Associate Professor Starmer causes me to doubt that the offender drank as much alcohol as he claims because such a large quantity of alcohol drunk in 3 ½ hours, could cause most people to die. I am prepared to accept that he believes he drank this amount of alcohol and I am prepared to accept that he imbibed speed and ecstasy. 15 He is claiming that he did not drink and take drugs on this night for the purpose of attacking his stepfather, indeed his claim is that he did not intend to go home but rather to stay with his girlfriend, but by the time he left the hotel he was feeling angry, he was drunk, but could drive. 16 In his affidavit he claims that when he left the hotel he was feeling angry about everything in his life and particularly about John McRae. He got it into his head that he should go and confront McRae and get him to admit to:  
     
      
      “all the abuse and also to tell me what was happening with their marriage after he used me to try and get her back. I wanted answers because all my siblings were suffering and I wanted to sort out the lies. I was thinking I want to sort out all this bullshit that’s going on. I had no intention of hurting anyone.” (affidavit at paragraph 64) 
      
    17 On the night that he stabbed his stepfather he handed himself into the police and did an interview. He did not admit to stabbing his stepfather during this interview but he did speak about his parents telling lies and he claimed that that was what led to what happened. He also claimed the justice system had not paid off and they, (ie his mother and stepfather) had gone overseas for four weeks and that the two of them (ie his mother and his stepfather) earn millions and he was on his own and struggling to pay his rent. 18 His other claims were: 
     
      
      (1) He parked his car down the road because that was where he normally parked. He did not do this so that he could take John McRae unawares.  
      
     
     
      
      (2) As he came in John McRae looked at him with a smirk on his face.  
      
     
     
      
      (3) He went into the kitchen feeling angry, just wanting to have a verbal fight with his mother and John McRae.  
      
     
     
      
      (4) He never intended to pick up a knife and did not intend to hurt either of them or anyone else.  
      
     
     
      
      (5) He wanted to scare McRae rather than hurt him.  
      
     
     
      
      (6) He hoped by scaring him, McRae would give him the answers as to why he abused all his children all of their lives. He wanted to know why McRae continued to abuse the children after he said that he had changed. He wanted to find this out for the sake of himself and the children. He wanted to know why McRae used him. He wanted McRae to know how it made him feel not going overseas with the family, he wanted McRae to know how unfair it was that all of the children including him, were being dragged into his relationship problems with his wife.  
      
     
     
      
      (7) He recalled picking up a knife, holding it, and deciding to jump over the couch. He said something like, “So you think I’m a fucking liar?”. He was sure McRae said something but does not know what it was and that was all he remembered.  
      
     
     
      
      (8) He recollected leaving the house by the back door with his arm bleeding, still holding the knife, feeling tired with his hands shaking. He met some friends and later went to the police station.  
      
     
     
      
      (9) He hated John McRae but did not want to kill him. He was remorseful about the incident and deeply regrets attacking him and hurting him.  
      
    19 During the course of his evidence at the trial, Mr McRae denied that he smirked at the offender and said that he was not aware of him at all until the attack happened. Mr McRae strikes me as being a fundamentally honest witness and I accept what he says about this matter. Of course it is quite possible that the offender, with his mind disordered by alcohol and drugs, thought Mr McRae was smirking at him. 20 I also accept that the offender may have no memory of precisely what he did. Professor Starmer explains in his report the process by which a person, very heavily intoxicated, may have a blackout and during that blackout period, may do all sorts of things without having any memory of what he has done. In his evidence before me, the offender gave a version which substantially agrees with his affidavit evidence and what he told police. In my opinion what follows from this is that he was motivated to attack Mr McRae for wrongs he considered Mr McRae had done to him and to his brothers and sisters. He was resentful because he had been excluded from an overseas holiday and he was resentful because his parents had lots of money and he had very little. He was not responding to any acts of violence other than perhaps excessive discipline inflicted on him eight years before and at earlier times. He was angry with his mother as well as with Mr McRae.21 In my opinion he picked up a knife intending to cause serious wounds to Mr McRae and he achieved his object. He attacked him without warning and when Mr McRae was in a position of helplessness. It is clear that Mr McRae attempted to use his hands to ward off the attack, and he suffered injuries to his left arm and hand as a result of this, but he had no real hope of resisting the attack and he suffered very serious wounds as a consequence.22 There were no particular acts of violence by the stepfather against him in recent years. Indeed, he was taller than his stepfather and more powerfully built. On the night of the stabbing his stepfather was not engaged in any acts of violence or intimidation directed against Mrs McRae or any of the children. Indeed, when the offender entered the house at about 10pm, his mother was on the telephone and his siblings were all engaged in some sort of quiet activities. His stepfather was sitting with his back to a lounge facing the television set, watching television. He had been on a run, something that he frequently did. 23 There is no doubt that on the night the offender consumed a very large amount of alcohol, both beer and rum, and that he was heavily intoxicated. He also consumed some ecstasy and some amphetamines. It seems likely, to me, that at the time he left the hotel he had no clear intention as to what he was going to do. When he got home, he grabbed a large kitchen knife and without warning, attacked his stepfather. He cannot remember anything of the attack and has expressed deep remorse for what happened. He sent a letter of apology to his stepfather and he said he would never do such a thing again. I am prepared to accept that he is remorseful and that it is unlikely he would ever do such a thing again. The fact that he was intoxicated in no way lessens his responsibility for what occurred. He is an adult and what he did was vicious and deliberate. 24 After the attack, Mr McRae staggered outside the home and called for help. Fortunately for him, a nurse lived nearby and she came quickly enough probably to save his life. 25 Photographs taken by his wife while he was in hospital make it clear he was in a gravely ill situation with life support equipment attached to him. At the time he struck his stepfather, it could not be said the offender was protecting himself or anyone in the household from any violence at the hands of his stepfather.26 There are a large number of affidavits supporting the offender and his claims that his stepfather treated him and other members of the family cruelly. There are also affidavits from the stepfather and people supporting his claim that he treated all of the family well, took them on holidays, provided for them in every way and was in every sense a good father. The Crown Prosecutor did not cross examine any of those persons who made claims in support of the offender. Mr Littlemore did not cross examine any of those who made claims in support of Mr McRae. 27 The affidavits are reminiscent of affidavits in family law proceedings. They are full of claims and counter claims and I am not able to determine where the truth lies. I am not willing to make any finding that Mr McRae treated any member of his family cruelly, although it is possible that he was at times unfeeling in his attitude and that he was someone who liked to control the lives of the family members. 28 Even if Mr McRae had been cruel or unkind to the offender and other members of the family, and even if this conduct had persisted throughout the offender’s childhood and into his adult years, it could provide no justification for what the offender did, nor could it lessen the seriousness of what he did. Sentencing Considerations29 Sentencing the offender presents many problems. The attack was sudden, unprovoked and very violent and could have resulted in the death of the victim. Mr McRae, the victim, has been left with permanent injuries and disabilities which are likely to be lifelong. He was in hospital for a considerable period and has had a number of operative procedures. 30 He had stab wounds to the neck, face, shoulders and his left hand and arm. 31 It was put to me in submissions that the reasons for this attack lay in the fact that the victim had treated him and his siblings brutally over the years and he was acting in some way to protect them. I raised with Mr Stuart Littlemore QC, his counsel, whether he was raising as a partial defence to the seriousness of the charge that the offender was suffering something akin to battered woman syndrome. Mr Littlemore assented to this proposition and I have looked at literature and case law. I attach the material in an appendix to this judgment. 32 None of this material assists the offender. In some cases, murder charges against battered women or children have been reduced to manslaughter because of years of physical and mental abuse by the victim of the accused person. However, in many cases, this arose because no specific intent to kill can be proved and in other cases the killing was preceded almost immediately by violence at the hands of the deceased or at least a well grounded fear that it would occur.33 In the present case, the offender chose to go to a hotel and consume a very large quantity of alcohol, including rum and he consumed illegal drugs, including ecstasy. Before he went home, he formed a determination he would deal in some way with his mother as well as his stepfather. He blamed her for letting his stepfather abuse and threaten him and the other children and he was also resentful about her telling him he had to find other accommodation, when he had nothing and his parents were living on a million dollar income in a million dollar home. Fortunately, he did not harm his mother. 34 He struck the victim suddenly and savagely. This caused penetrating wounds to the right anterolateral side of the neck. These wounds travelled through the sternocleidomastoid muscle, lacerating his thyroid gland and blood vessels associated with it. The wounds were within two centimetres of the carotid artery and the jugular vein. 35 The recurrent laryngeal nerve on the right side was divided, leaving him with a right sided paralysed vocal chord. The consequence of this injury continues to this day and has resulted in a permanent hoarseness, making it difficult for him to speak and to sing. 36 There was also a wound to his left mid face and multiple stab wounds to his left forearm with the division of the thumb flexor, ulna wrist extensor, fingers extensors and his little finger extensors. There was a separate stab wound to the thenar eminence. The tendons were repaired and operative treatment undertaken to deal with all his other wounds. 37 It was the opinion of the hand surgeon who fixed his wounds on his left arm and hand the wounds were suggestive of the victim defending himself. This surgeon was of the opinion the depth of the wounds to the arm and hand would suggest a vicious attack by a strong person with a sharp instrument. 38 Mr McRae enjoyed singing and playing a guitar. He cannot pursue these hobbies any longer. 39 The charge to which the offender pleaded guilty is a crime specific intent, which is an intent to “cause grievous bodily harm”. The legislature has seen fit to provide for a standard non-parole period of seven years. 40 The crime was violent, vicious and intentional. It caused very serious harm to the victim, who was completely defenceless at the time the offender struck him. 41 Any person committing this crime must expect to get a severe sentence. The need for general deterrence and for retribution, that is, to say imposition of a sentence appropriate to the crime, calls for a sentence of some severity. 42 The offender, his natural father, his mother, his siblings, his grandparents and two ministers of religion, paint a picture of the victim being a controlling, violent and nasty individual. The Crown, for reasons I do not know, has chosen to accept this evidence being given by affidavit, and has not challenged any of it, either by objection to parts of the affidavit or by cross examination of the deponents. The Crown sought to cross examine only the offender. 43 Mr McRae has also provided an affidavit. He is supported in what he says by his brother and other friends and relatives. Mr Littlemore, did not seek by cross examining them, to challenge anything said by Mr McRae or those supporting him. 44 The affidavit material produced on behalf of the offender, untested as it is, is far from convincing and these affidavits did not establish, in my opinion, that Mr McRae was brutal, callous or cruel. I had the advantage of seeing Mr McRae being cross examined for nearly five days. The impression I formed was that he was an honest witness, that he had been very seriously injured and he was hurt by the reaction of his family, all of whom supported the perpetrator rather than him. 45 The affidavit of Mr McRae reveals him to be a very meticulous man who takes notes of everything that he does including all of his activities on holidays. The degree to which he takes notes is perhaps somewhat unusual, and it is consistent with the picture presented of him in his wife’s affidavits as a person who is a controller of others. 46 There seems little doubt that in various stages of the marriage, the offender’s natural father called the Department of Community Services and made allegations against Mr McRae and against his former wife. It is also clear that he and Mr McRae did not like one another. 47 During the trial, Mr Littlemore QC put the submission that Mr McRae was a monster. I cannot accept that submission. Mr McRae’s wife and children have all abandoned him and no doubt this has something to do with his treatment of them in the past, but I am unwilling to conclude that that treatment provided any basis whatsoever for the offender to attack him. 48 The maximum sentence for this offence is 25 years imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of seven years. Because he pleaded guilty to this offence on the fifth day of the trial I am entitled to impose a sentence which has a non-parole period less than that of the standard non-parole period if I were to conclude that it was a mid range offence. Nevertheless, the standard non-parole period and the maximum sentence are guideposts that have to be kept in mind when the sentence is imposed. Since he pleaded guilty at trial, he is entitled to a discounted sentence and I fix that discount at ten percent. 49 In this case there are outstanding prospects of rehabilitation. The first matter, though I take into account, in that regard is that he voluntarily surrendered to the police. He also wrote a letter of apology for what he had done, and he has expressed his remorse to the court and to a number of other people, including a probation and parole officer who have reported this. 50 After a period in custody of three months following his arrest, he was released on bail and since that time he has complied with every condition of bail, has worked hard and has ceased taking illegal drugs. He has sought counselling in relation to drug and alcohol matters and has said in evidence before me that he has avoided getting drunk. He is well regarded by a number of people who have provided written references for him and his future rehabilitation is supported by psychological and psychiatric evidence. 51 He has expressed an anxiety not to return to gaol. Apart from anything else he is concerned that pressure might be put upon him in gaol to consume illegal drugs. It is unfortunately a sad fact that despite the best efforts of the Department of Corrective Services, illegal drugs continue to be smuggled into prisons and continue to be trafficked. He found his time in prison very worrying and he is anxious not to return. This anxiety is a very natural one, and I can have some regard to it when I impose sentence. I must nevertheless impose a sentence which properly reflects the seriousness of the offence, which deters him from future offending, which serves as a general deterrent to others who might be minded to offend and which, at the same time, takes into account, his excellent prospects of rehabilitation.52 There is also evidence that he has suffered serious orthopaedic injuries, which cause him continuing pain, will be permanent and will be likely to cause him problems later in life. He has been working hard as a truck driver and has also started a small business making wooden objects, such as picture frames, shelves and signs. I have seen photographs of some of his handiwork. It seems to be of good quality. Clearly he has done a great deal to rehabilitate himself. 53 While taking into account all the positive things that can be said in his favour, I have to keep at the front of my mind that the attack he mounted on his victim was savage, sudden and on a totally defenceless man. He clearly intended to cause him grievous bodily harm and he achieved his aim. There was no preceding quarrel and he was not in any way responding to any threat made to him or to any other member of the family. He was not defending himself or anyone else and it could not be said that the victim had acted violently towards him or towards any other member of the family in his presence at any time close to the time of this attack. 54 In my opinion, the facts lead me to conclude that for many years the offender had harboured deep resentment towards the victim, that their personal relationship at most times was not good, and there had been episodes of physical chastisement of him by the victim at various stages over the years of his life. None of this could justify or explain the violent attack by the offender and his victim. 55 The attack was a cowardly act since the offender attacked his victim from behind and struck him when he was completely defenceless. The attack was also carried out in the family home in the presence of the offender’s mother and other members of the family. 56 The Crown has submitted that I should find this offence is more serious than a midrange offence, while Mr Littlemore has submitted I should not make this finding, but rather I should find the offence was caused by years of brutality at the hands of the victim and that this mitigated the offence to such an extent that I should not impose a sentence of full time custody. 57 I considered both of these submissions carefully. I also looked at the authorities to which I was referred and the articles to which I have also referred on the subject of battered woman and child syndrome. 58 Unfortunately, from time to time, people are stabbed and bashed by a perpetrator and subsequently call evidence that normally they are persons of good character and they would be unlikely to do this type of thing again. Frequently, the court accepts that such people are unlikely to offend again. Often the circumstances of these offences are very sad and cause any judge to feel sorry for all those involved. Often it is submitted that to send the offender to gaol would be very damaging to him and would be unlikely to be of any benefit to the community. Unfortunately, many of the perpetrators of violence are quite young, have previous good character and have committed the offence after a considerable period of drinking alcohol. 59 However, Courts must enforce the law and must give sentences which are aimed at deterring the individual, providing general deterrence, fixing a penalty appropriate to the crime and making due allowance for rehabilitation. 60 Having taken into account the submissions, I am of the opinion I can do nothing but impose a sentence of full time custody. This is a very serious crime and warrants the imposition of an appropriate penalty. I have concluded I should regard the offence as more than a midrange offence because it was sudden, unprovoked, extremely violent, involving repeated blows and caused permanent serious injuries to the victim. 61 I have earlier referred to the fact that the standard non-parole period for this offence, if I conclude it is a midrange offence, is seven years imprisonment and the maximum sentence is 25 years imprisonment. Because the offender pleaded guilty at the trial, I am not obliged to impose a standard non-parole period as the parole period in this case, but I am required to have regard to it and to the maximum sentence as guide posts. I am also required to look at any subjective features of the offender and in particular to such matters as his state of health, the way in which he has conducted himself whilst he has been on bail, his previous good character and the impressive steps he has taken to rehabilitate himself. Because of these factors, I have come to the conclusion that I could treat the offence as warranting less than the standard non-parole period. I am entitled to regard these factors as mitigating the seriousness of the offence so that I can sentence on the basis that it is less than the midrange offence. 62 I have considered the statistics, but do not find them to be of any assistance since there is no pattern of sentencing for offences of this type that would enable me to draw a conclusion as to an appropriate range of sentencing. 63 I have determined the offender is entitled to a ten percent discount for pleading guilty during the trial. 64 I consider that in the circumstances it would be appropriate to impose a sentence containing a non-parole period of four years with a total sentence of eight years. This would give him the opportunity for release at a relatively early time and allow for continuing supervision, which in my opinion should concentrate on anger management and abuse of drugs and alcohol. 65 I also intend to recommend that he be given access to programs concerning anger management and drugs and alcohol abuse while in gaol and consideration be given to classifying him to a young offender’s gaol or a minimum security institution as soon as possible. The sentence will also allow for the time he has already spent in custody pending trial, a period of three months and four days. Sentence66 I sentence the offender to a non-parole period of four years imprisonment. There will be a balance of four years. The non-parole period will commence from 5 December 2008 and will conclude on 4 December 2012. The balance of the term will commence on 5 December 2012 and will conclude on 4 December 2016. I recommend he be released on parole on 4 December 2012. He is to be released from all consequences of the sentence on 4 December 2016. 67 I recommend he be classified as soon as possible and considered for a young offenders programme or a minimum security institution. I also recommend that he be given the benefit of programmes concerning anger management and drugs and alcohol.

     JUDGMENT 
      
      
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Blanch J.2 BLANCH J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the Supreme Court on 7 June, 2007. The applicant had entered a plea of guilty to a charge of manslaughter contrary to s18(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, 1900 and he was sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 7 years and 9 months to date from 7 June, 2005 with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months. The maximum penalty for the offence is 25 years imprisonment.3 The applicant had been committed for trial on a charge of murder but the Crown subsequently presented an indictment for manslaughter accepting it could not discharge its onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt the applicant did not believe his conduct was necessary to defend himself.4 The offence occurred on 15 May, 2005. The applicant and Rabih Abdulrahman were engaged in illegal drug dealing. There was a dispute between them and the deceased, who was also their competitor in drug dealing. At the relevant time the applicant and Abdulrahman were staying in a unit rented by a witness who had earlier had a relationship with Abdulrahman and they were conducting their drug dealing operations from there.5 On 15 May the deceased went to that unit and informed Abdulrahman’s friend he wanted to stay there and use it for his drug activities. The applicant, with his brother and companions, came to the unit and there was a meeting in the bedroom. There was an argument between the applicant and his brother on one side and the deceased on the other side. The deceased drew a handgun and the applicant used a pistol in his possession to fire five shots at the deceased causing his death. The deceased had not fired any shots and there was no evidence his weapon was loaded.6 It was common ground the applicant was to be sentenced on the basis that his conduct was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them.Ground of Appeal One“The learned sentencing judge apparently failed to take specific account of an important part of the statement of facts relating to the threatening conduct of the deceased immediately before the confrontation in which he was killed by the applicant.”7 The part of the agreed statement of facts which was tendered and said to disclose an event not considered by the judge was a part of the statement which indicated when the deceased sent Abdulrahman’s former girlfriend out to get the applicant he said to her that if she did not get him someone was to get seriously hurt. She apparently went downstairs and according to the facts “… told the accused Ali Diab that the deceased wanted him.” Apparently immediately after he was told this, he was picked up in a motor vehicle and driven away. The submission is made that because the sentencing judge did not mention this incident, he did not fully understand the level of aggression on the part of the deceased at the time of the confrontation.8 I cannot see that this is so. The sentencing judge had the statement of facts and he summarised it including the relevant details. There can be no doubt the judge appreciated the two men were arch rivals, that the deceased had provocatively tried to take over premises used by the applicant, that there was an argument between them and that the deceased threatened the applicant with a handgun. It is quite clear the judge appreciated the full level of tension and threat which existed at the time of the shooting. Moreover, the facts do not disclose that when Abdulrahman’s friend spoke to the applicant, she told him of the threat which had been made. The facts simply say she “… went downstairs and told the accused Abdulrahman that the deceased wanted him. The accused Diab did not appear to be listening to her.” 9 I would dismiss this ground of appeal.Ground of Appeal Two“The learned sentencing judge made an important finding of fact adverse to the applicant, namely as to the circumstances in which the gun used by the applicant came to be in his possession on the night of the shooting, a finding which was not reasonably open on the whole of the material available in the sentence proceedings.”10 This ground argues that there was no evidence about where the gun used by the applicant came from. In the light of that, it is said the judge erred when he said “The offender brought with him to a meeting with the accused a pistol which was loaded and he fired five shots with it.” It is also said the judge erred when he said “The offender could have avoided the summons to enter the bedroom where the deceased was. He chose, however, to enter the bedroom and to argue with the deceased in circumstances where they were in dispute over their illegal drug activities. The offender had with him during the confrontation a loaded pistol.”11 The argument advanced by the applicant is that the gun could have been given to the applicant by someone else in the flat or that it could have been already in the flat. However, there is no doubt at all that the applicant had the gun in his hand and that he fired the five shots. It is accepted he did so after he was threatened with a gun held by the deceased. It does not appear to me to have any impact on an assessment of his culpability whether the gun was brought into the flat by him, given to him in the flat by someone else or picked up by him in the flat. It would be unrealistic to find that when he entered the flat he did not know a gun could be available to him from whatever source and these considerations can have no effect on an assessment of the appropriate penalty.12 It should be noted that the words used by the judge about the gun were in one case it was “brought with him to this meeting” and in another part of his remarks on sentence “had with him during the confrontation”. Neither of these statements asserts that the gun was brought into the flat by the applicant. Moreover in the statement of facts tendered to the Court it was said: 
     
      
      “The accused Ali DIAB showed SMIT (“Witness “B”) a silver hand gun and said he was carrying it because of the incident on 13 May 2005.” 
      
    13 I would dismiss this ground of appeal.14 No other ground of appeal is argued. In R v Forbes (2005) 160 A Crim R 1 Spigelman CJ said at page 27, paragraph 133: 
     
      
      “As has frequently been stated, manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character an an offence. (See in particular the observations of Gleeson CJ in  
      R v Blacklidge 
       (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, No. 60510 of 1995, 12 December 1995), esp at 2-3.) In its objective gravity it may vary, as has been pointed out, from a joke gone wrong to facts just short of murder ( 
      R v Weinman 
       (1987) 49 SASR 248 at 252;  
      R v Hoerler  
      (2004) 147 A Crim R 520 at [39]).” 
      
    15 In the same case Hall J surveyed a number of authorities dealing with sentences for manslaughter, all of which indicate that the sentence imposed in this case was well within the range of appropriate sentences for an offence with the characteristics of this offence and taking into account the subjective circumstances peculiar to the applicant. No argument has been advanced that the non-parole period should have been reduced because of special circumstances, no doubt because it was seen that such a submission was without merit. 16 This was a serious case of manslaughter against a background of feuding drug dealers and an offender being prepared to take the law into his own hands. It is clearly a case where the sentence should strongly reflect the principles of general deterrence and in my view, no lesser penalty than that imposed could be justified.17 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal be granted; 
       
      2. The appeal be dismissed.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Adrian Ford pleaded not guilty this morning to a charge that he, on 14 January 2007 at Narellan Vale, had sexual intercourse with TL without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting. 2 Before a jury was empanelled the Crown indicated that it wished me to rule on the admissibility of what it said was tendency evidence. It tendered to me statements made by TL, as well as two other women, ZM and AG. I was told that the latter two women had actually given evidence against the accused in separate proceedings but I was asked to proceed on the basis that their evidence did not significantly depart from their statements. 3 The allegation to be prosecuted by the Crown in the present trial is that he had sexual intercourse with the TL, that act of intercourse beginning while she was asleep, having attended a party at his home earlier and drunk a considerable amount of alcohol. 4 The statements of the other two women refer to incidents occurring some months after the date on the indictment, 17 January 2007. Each of those women alleges that after attending a party at the accused’s home and drinking alcohol to excess and having gone to sleep they woke up to find the accused indecently assaulting them. The Crown says that the evidence of ZM and AG is admissible in the present trial as it demonstrates a tendency on the part of the accused to sexually molest women sleeping at his home, after those women have consumed alcohol at parties held at the home.5 I note that the accused was found guilty of the allegations involving AG and ZM, but, of course, the Crown proposes to proceed, if allowed in this trial, by calling ZM and AG to give evidence, with no reference being made to the earlier convictions.6 Ms Mikhaiel objects to the evidence being admitted. She says that the evidence does not have the significant probative value required by s 97 of the Evidence Act and further that the probative value of the evidence does not substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect it may have on her client. 7 I confess to thinking that the law in relation to the applications of s 97 and s 101 of the Evidence Act was fairly settled, but Ms Mikhaiel pointed out to me something which I had not previously noticed and that is the absence of the word “unfair” in s 101(2). Whilst the exercise of any discretion by me under s 135 and s 137 of the Evidence Act requires that I look at the danger of unfair prejudice according to s 101(2) all I am looking at is any prejudicial effect. 8 The omission of the word “unfair"" is difficult to understand. All probative evidence adduced by the Crown has a prejudicial effect upon the accused. Unless the concept of unfairness is introduced into the test in s 101(2) then no evidence would ever be admitted as tendency evidence because as soon as it had the significant probative value required by s 97 it would automatically have an equal prejudicial effect. No tendency evidence could ever satisfy the test under s 101(2). 9 I suspect that the reason I had not noticed before, until Ms Mikhaiel pointed it out to me, that the word “unfair” does not appear in s 101, was because the authorities have proceeded on the basis that the concept of unfairness is to be introduced into s 101.10 In his most recent edition of Uniform Evidence Law, that being the Eighth Edition, Mr Odgers, at p 433, does address this issue. He, too, noticed the absence of the word ‘unfair’ and says this: 
     
      
      “Turning to the concept of ‘prejudicial effect’ the evidence ‘may have on the defendant’, it is curious that there is no reference to ‘unfair prejudice’, as in s 137. Despite this, it would be absurd if the concept of ‘prejudicial effect’ applied simply on the basis that the evidence tended to prove the guilt of the defendant, thereby ‘prejudicing’ the defendant’s prospects of acquittal. The concept should be understood in substantially the same way as ‘unfair prejudice’ in s 137, albeit with an emphasis on the evidence may, rather than necessarily will impact adversely upon the defendant.” 
      
    11 Mr Odgers does not cite any authority for the suggestion he makes, although he could have referred to a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Colby v The Queen [1999] NSWCCA 261 where at [97] Mason P says this: 
     
      
      “Section 101(2) further restricts tendency and coincidence evidence by precluding its use by the prosecution unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. Prejudice is not established by the mere fact of the weight of the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue. The focus is upon the danger that the tribunal of fact will use the evidence upon a basis logically unconnected with the issues in the case.” 
      
    12 Others who have noticed that the word “unfair” does not appear in s 101 include the Law Reform Commission in its recent review of the Evidence Act. (ALRC report 102). At p 380 of that report the Commission, at footnote 61, refers to this issue. Footnote 61 reads: 
     
      
      “The expression ‘prejudicial effect’ is not qualified by the word ‘unfair’. One commentator, Peter Bayne, considers the significance of this omission but concludes, correctly it is suggested, that properly construed the prejudice in question is unfair prejudice.” 
      
    13 The Commission then refers to Mr Bayne’s article and cites a number of cases including Colby, the decision of Court of Criminal Appeal to which I have just referred.14 I am satisfied therefore that properly understood s 101(2) is to be interpreted as requiring me to balance the probative value of the evidence against any unfair prejudicial effect it may have on the accused. In doing that I am interpreting s 101 in a way which avoids an absurdity, and perhaps more importantly, following the authority of Colby which binds me.15 Having sorted out the legal issue raised by Ms Mikhaiel let me turn to the particular matter before me. What the Crown has attempted to do is to establish a pattern of the accused’s behaviour or even as is sometimes described a modus operandi. In doing so it is important to go through the allegations made by the three separate complainants to identify points of similarity and of course points of dissimilarity.16 I am satisfied that what is established by the evidence is a tendency on the part of the accused to do something unusual, that is to indecently assault women who are asleep at his place after having attended a party there. Of course, I do not use the words ‘indecently assault’ in any technical legal sense here. I encompass within the term ‘indecent assault’ sexual assaults such as that alleged by the complainant in the present trial. So unusual is this behaviour that I am satisfied that the evidence to be adduced by the Crown has significant probative value. 17 I bear in mind also that it is not simply a case of one woman coming along to give evidence of what I regard as similar conduct to that alleged in the present trial but there are two. Of course those two events occurred on the same evening or morning and the allegation to be made by the Crown in the present trial is said to have taken place at a different time, but there is not such a significant temporal difference, being only about four months, to suggest that the time difference is of much significance at all. After all, we are talking about the tendency of a person to act in a particular way in particular circumstances and it would be easy to conclude that the period of months is unlikely to make much of a difference.18 Ms Mikhaiel refers also to the fact that the allegation made in the present trial is one of sexual intercourse and that the accused is alleged not to have stopped after the complainant awoke and realised what was happening, whereas in relation to the latter two allegations, they being the ones which have already been dealt with at trial, what is alleged a sexual assault involving no sexual intercourse, the accused apparently being prepared to stop once he was told to. They are, of course, differences which I have taken into account. But given that Ms TL, the complainant in the present matter, was asleep until she woke up to find the accused having sexual intercourse with her she, simply does not know whether what preceded that was activity such as described by the other two women.19 Ms Mikhaiel also referred in her written submissions to the circumstance that there was a delay of several months between when TL said she was sexually assaulted, and when she complained to police, whereas the other two women complained to police the day after they were assaulted. Given that the focus of this enquiry is on the tendency of the accused to act in a particular way that difference should be ignored as irrelevant. 20 I am satisfied that the evidence does have a significant probative value demonstrating a modus operandi on the part of the accused to do things virtually identical to what he is alleged to have done against TL on 14 January 2007. 21 As I attempted to make clear in coming to that conclusion, I have had regard to what I consider to be unusual behaviour. The more unusual behaviour is, the more it says about the tendency of a person to act in that way. That has been the approach of the law for many, many years. One only needs to look at the decision of the DPP v Boardman [1975] AC 421 to understand that. 22 Of course, it is not enough that there is significant probative value. One must perform the balancing test set out in s 101(2) as I have interpreted that section to be. In determining the prejudicial effect that the admission of the evidence would have on the accused, in particular in determining whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs that prejudicial effect, one must of course bear in mind that directions will go a long way to deal with this issue. In fact the directions may lead to the situation where there is no unfair prejudice at all. I consider that I am able to fashion directions to a jury which will focus the jurors’ attentions on the real issues to be decided in this trial. It is the experience of the law, backed up by empirical research, that jurors do their best to follow instructions given to them by trial judges. That is not to say that jurors are immune from prejudice and emotion, but it is to say in assessing the effect of any directions to be given in this matter I should proceed on the basis that jurors will do their best to apply them.23 Ms Mikhaiel referred to the sheer weight of numbers and said that if the evidence was admitted it would be “game, set and match” for her client. All that does is point to the high probative value of the evidence. It does not suggest that the jurors will look at matters unfairly or in a manner logically unconnected with the issues in the case. 24 It is suggested by Ms Mikhaiel, adopting what Mr Odgers says at p 343 of his book, that the jury might be influenced to convict the accused as punishment for conduct other than that charged. Of course one way round that would be to tell the jury that he is already to be punished for the conduct described by AG and ZM but that would lead to other problems for the accused, so it is probably unlikely that that evidence would be led. I consider, however, that a firm direction from me will deal with that possible prejudicial effect.25 Ms Mikhaiel says that the jury may overestimate the probative value of the evidence, but in a case where counsel will no doubt point out the differences between the conduct alleged by AG and ZM on the one hand and the complainant in the present trial on the other I do not consider that that is a real possibility. Nor do I consider that the jury will be distracted from the central issues in the trial or may too readily accept other prosecution evidence. The issues in this trial will resolve themselves, as I understand it, to quite a simply matter, did the accused have sexual intercourse with the complainant as she alleges? 26 I understand that there is no forensic evidence to back up what the complainant says and the issue will ultimately resolve as to whether the complainant is honest and reliable when she describes what she remembers occurring. In such circumstances to take into account the tendency of the accused to do something similar to two other women would not be to be distracted from the central issue and the real issue to be resolved.27 It cannot be the case that the sheer weight of numbers is enough to demonstrate unfair prejudice. The prosecution is not disentitled from bringing a powerful Crown case because s 101(2) of the Evidence Act. The fact that the introduction of this evidence does make this a strong Crown case is not the issue.28 I am satisfied that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused and the evidence therefore will be admitted.

    1 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Blanch J.2 BLANCH J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed on the applicant in the District Court on 9 February, 2007. After a trial which commenced on 11 September and concluded on 26 October, 2006 the applicant was convicted as follows:1. of an offence contrary to s24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, 1985 that on or about 7 September, 2004 at Coopernook in the State of New South Wales did attempt to manufacture a prohibited drug, namely ephedrine;2. not guilty of an offence contrary to s24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, 1985 that between 7 September, 2004 and 30 September, 2004 at Whiporie in the State of New South Wales to manufacture a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, but guilty of an attempt to do so;3. of an offence contrary to s24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, 1985 that between 1 September, 2003 and 5 August, 2005 at Kanwal and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales did conspire with John Henry Griffiths and others to manufacture a prohibited drug, namely ephedrine.3 Each of the offences carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and on 9 February, 2007 the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 2 years on each of the offences to be served concurrently. The sentences are to date from 17 August, 2006.4 In summarising the facts of the case the sentencing judge said that during the relevant years the co-offender Griffiths lived in Dulwich Hill. Bangs and Campbell lived in northern New South Wales and the applicant lived near Wyong. Griffiths knew how to manufacture illegal drugs and the role of the other offenders was to assist him. The applicant provided his house as a place for the chemicals to be sent, he allowed the name of a company to be placed on his letterbox to give the appearance that a chemical company had its headquarters there, he received chemicals sent there in a false name and he allowed Griffiths to use his fax machine and computer to communicate with chemical companies and chemical suppliers. Griffiths had a recipe for the manufacture of ephedrine and how to manufacture methylamphetamine from the ephedrine. That recipe was found in the applicant’s premises.5 During the course of the trial Campbell and Bangs both gave evidence for the prosecution. Griffiths, on the other hand, gave evidence for the defence supporting the claim of the applicant that they were really interested in making Viagra or diet suppressants for sale in China. Griffiths maintained his innocence in spite of the fact he had earlier entered a plea of guilty to two charges of conspiracy to manufacture ephedrine and he had admitted his guilt in respect of a third matter which was taken into account on a Form 1. This matter was the conspiracy to manufacture amphetamine with Campbell, Bangs, McCosker and the applicant, the subject of the third count.6 On 7 and 8 September the four men involved were at Coopernook where Griffiths attempted to manufacture ephedrine. Campbell and Bangs gave some unskilled assistance. The applicant’s part was to drive Griffiths to the property, being prepared to help him in the manufacture of the ephedrine. The attempt to make ephedrine failed. This relates to the first count.7 The second count relates to the applicant going to Campbell’s home at Whiporie. Campbell obtained some glassware and he and the applicant attempted to manufacture methylamphetamine using the recipe provided by Griffiths. The attempt again was unsuccessful. 8 Thereafter until the arrest of Griffiths on 5 August, 2005 the applicant, Griffiths, Campbell and Bangs all participated in attempts to acquire chemicals for the further manufacture of ephedrine.9 The grounds of appeal argued are a lack of parity with the sentences of Griffiths and Campbell and that the sentence was unduly harsh and severe.10 Griffiths appeared for sentence before Judge Tupman. He and another co-offender Dodd had earlier been committed for trial and a voir dire was conducted and a second voir dire was arranged to commence on 19 September, 2005. On 21 September, 2005 Griffiths and Dodd entered pleas of guilty to a charge of conspiracy to produce ephedrine between 13 May, 2002 and 9 May, 2003. Griffiths also entered a plea of guilty to a charge that between 10 May, 2004 and 5 August, 2005 at Coopernook and other places he conspired with Thomas Hudson and others to manufacture ephedrine. He also acknowledged his guilt of a charge of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of ephedrine at Coopernook on 31 December, 2004. He had been committed for sentence on the second charge and he adhered to his plea. He was sentenced by Judge Tupman to: 
     
      
      1.a non-parole period of 18 months with a balance of term of 12 months from 5 August, 2005; 
      
     
     
      
      2. a non-parole period of 2 years from 5 August, 2006 with a balance of term of 12 months. His total effective sentence was a non-parole period of 3 years with an overall sentence of 4 years. 
      
    11 In passing that sentence, her Honour noted she had reduced the first sentence by 15% from an intended 3 years because of the plea and in respect of the second offence, she had intended to impose a sentence of 4 years but reduced it to 3 years giving a discount of 25% for the plea of guilty. Her intention was therefore to impose a head sentence of 5 years in the absence of the pleas of guilty.12 Campbell appeared for sentence before Judge Black QC at Lismore District Court on 17 August, 2005. He was committed for sentence and entered a plea of guilty to a charge that he knowingly took part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. He asked that two matters be taken into account on a Form 1. The judge did that but noted that the possession of the rifle charge on the Form 1 had nothing to do with the drug offence. On 17 August, 2005 Campbell was sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months with a balance of term of 15 months leading to an overall sentence of 2 years and 3 months. The judge noted he would have imposed an overall sentence of 3 years without the plea of guilty.13 It is in relation to those sentences passed on Griffiths and Campbell that the question of parity is agitated on behalf of the applicant.The Law14 In Postiglione v The Queen (1996-1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301 in the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ it was said: 
     
      
      “However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in  
      Lowe v The Queen 
      , recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to ‘a justifiable sense of grievance’.” 
      
    15 At page 309 McHugh J said: 
     
      
      “If a judge wrongly fails to give effect to the parity principle, an appellate court will intervene to correct what is an error in sentencing principle. In  
      Lowe v The Queen 
      , Gibbs CJ, with whom Wilson J agreed, said that an appellate court should intervene where ‘the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done’. Mason J stated that an appellate court is entitled to intervene when there is a manifest discrepancy such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance. Dawson J, with whom Wilson J also agreed, was of the view that ‘[t]he difference between the sentences must be manifestly excessive and call for the intervention of an appellate court in the interests of justice’.” 
      
    16 At page 323 Gummow J said: 
     
      
      “The principle for which  
      Lowe 
       is authority appears to be that the Court of Criminal Appeal intervenes where the difference between the two sentences is manifestly excessive and such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance by giving the appearance, in the mind of an objective observer, that justice has not been done. 
      
     
     
      
      In  
      R v Taudevin,  
      Callaway JA said, in a passage with which I agree: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        ‘The important words are ‘manifestly’, ‘justifiable’ and ‘objective’. There is much to be said for the view that all three requirements are variations on the same theme, ie that only a manifest discrepancy in the sense of a difference that is clearly excessive will satisfy the other two requirements.” 
        
       
      
    17 And at page 335 Kirby J said: 
     
      
      “The removal of serious and unjustifiable disparities in the treatment of like cases is a legitimate goal of the administration of criminal justice.” 
      
    The Applicant’s Contention18 The applicant points out that the sentencing judge in this case said: 
     
      
      “Griffiths is a man who was a trained pharmacist. The offender is a man of little education and little intellectual training. Griffiths however is a very clever, intelligent and highly educated man.” 
      
    19 He also said: 
     
      
      “There is no doubt in my mind that Griffiths was the person who thought up this scheme.” 
      
    20 On that basis it is asserted that the sentence given to the applicant should be less than the sentence imposed on Griffiths to reflect their respective roles. It can be seen from the remarks of Judge Tupman noted above that she would, in fact, have given Griffiths an overall sentence of 5 years had it not been for the pleas of guilty, so that the sentences for the two offenders were essentially the same. The sentencing judge was alert to the need to achieve a sentence which did not give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance because of disparity and said that in fixing the sentence he did, he took that into account and whereas he would have fixed a non-parole period of 5 years, he reduced that to 3 years because of the sentence imposed on Griffiths.21 It is necessary then to look at the other comparative factors pertaining to Griffiths and the applicant. The applicant was 60 at the time of sentencing. Griffiths was 72. Griffiths had a criminal history which involved a conviction for stealing in 1957 for which he received a bond, a fraud conviction in Brisbane in 1994 for which he received a 7 year sentence and recommended for parole after 2 years. He was also convicted of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug in New South Wales but on 7 June, 2002 that conviction was quashed in the Court of Criminal Appeal although he apparently spent 2 years in custody bail refused prior to the conviction being quashed. It should be noted in his case that he was on bail awaiting his trial for the first offence at the time the second offence and the Form 1 offence were committed.22 The applicant has 24 convictions on his criminal history including 9 appearances before the Quarter Sessions Court and District Court. His convictions include a conviction for supply prohibited drug in 1987 for which he was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and he has had 4 subsequent drug related convictions, the last being in 1993 for supplying a prohibited drug for which he was sentenced to 12 months with an additional term of 4 months. It can be said that the applicant’s criminal history was more significant and relevant than that of Griffiths.23 In sentencing Griffiths the judge took into account his medical conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure and deteriorating arthritis, together with his depression which might amount to post-traumatic stress disorder. His age was taken into account together with his medical conditions which indicated his period in custody would be much more difficult than normal. It was also taken into account that the pleas of guilty indicated contrition and remorse.24 By contrast when dealing with the applicant, the judge noted his patently false claims during the course of the trial and there was no evidence of contrition. A psychologist report said that he had a low to moderate risk of recidivism but the trial judge rejected that and said “I think there is every chance that Mr Hudson will commit an offence of this nature again. He has committed them before.” That view was open to the sentencing judge who had presided over a long trial during which the applicant’s account of what he was doing and his attempt to raise an alibi were rejected by the jury.25 Presumably if this applicant had entered pleas of guilty in the same way Griffiths did, he would also have received a discount on his sentence. On that basis he would have received a shorter head sentence and a non-parole period less than the 3 years Griffiths received.26 It appears to me that taking into account those different factors which exist in the considerations for sentence as between the applicant and Griffiths, there is no marked disparity which gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. It should be borne in mind that the relevant disparity should have the characteristic of being “marked” or “manifestly excessive” or “serious and unjustifiable” in accordance with the various judgments in Postiglione v The Queen quoted above.The Sentencing of Campbell27 Campbell was sentenced in respect of only one offence and accordingly, it might be expected there would be a significant difference in sentencing between him and the applicant. Campbell also had no prior criminal history. The judge accepted he was remorseful and had good prospects for rehabilitation. The police statement of facts said that he was co-operative. He was not dealt with on the basis that he had offered any assistance but he did, in fact, give evidence on behalf of the prosecution in the applicant’s trial which reinforces the assessment by the police that he was co-operative. In my view, there are very significant differences between the sentencing considerations in the case of Campbell and those relevant in the case of the applicant and I do not believe there is any marked disparity in the sentencing of Campbell which gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.Was the Sentence Unduly Harsh or Severe?28 It should be noted that the applicant was given the considerable benefit of all three of the sentences being made concurrent. The sentences imposed had to take account of the need for general deterrence to be reflected in sentencing where drugs are being manufactured or attempts are being made to manufacture drugs which are to be sold for profit in the community. There are many statements in this Court to that effect and in my view, it cannot be said that the sentence in this case is in any way excessive. Indeed as the sentencing judge noted it was reduced from what might otherwise have been an appropriate sentence so as to avoid a disparity with the sentence imposed on Griffiths.29 It is submitted the failure to distinguish the sentence for the attempt counts is an error of law. The judge’s comment that “in terms of sentence it does not matter…” should be understood as referring to the fact that the same maximum penalty applied. An argument has been advanced that the sentencing judge should have imposed a lesser sentence because two of the convictions were for an attempt. In this case I do not believe that is so. The conduct of the applicant throughout the period involving the conspiracy and the attempts were persistent over a significant period of time and although the facts relating to the attempts concerned events in 2004 that was during a period when the conspiracy was in place from September, 2003 to August, 2005. Moreover, the decision of the judge to make the sentences for the attempt counts entirely concurrent makes any debate as to whether there should be a different sentence for the attempt academic. I do not believe any lesser sentence would be justified.30 I propose the following orders:  
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal be granted; 
       
      2. The appeal be dismissed. 
      
    31 HOWIE J: I agree with Blanch J.

     DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS v PAUL GREGORY EMANUEL 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Director of Public Prosecutions invokes this Court’s supervisory jurisdiction and seeks orders pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 with respect to a judgment of Hosking DCJ. His Honour heard and disposed of an appeal to the District Court from a conviction in the Local Court of the first respondent on certain charges. 2 The facts are not in dispute and can be briefly stated: 
     
      
    · On 4 February 2007 the first respondent was charged with three offences of assaulting a police officer, resisting a police officer and non-compliance with a direction given by a police officer. 
     
      
    · The first respondent applied for legal aid which was refused. 
     
      
    · On 19 June 2007 he appealed from that refusal. 
     
      
    · On 25 June 2007 the matter was before the Wollongong Local Court. The first respondent applied for an adjournment on the basis of the provisions of s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act 1979 which relevantly provides that where it appears to a court that a party to proceedings has appealed from a decision to deny legal aid, and the appeal is bona fide, the court “shall adjourn the proceedings”. 
     
      
    · On 25 June 2007 the magistrate hearing the charge refused to adjourn the proceedings and convicted the respondent of each of the offences, imposing an effective sentence of 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of nine months. 
     
      
    · On 25 June 2007 the first respondent lodged a notice of appeal to the District Court on the stated ground: “I am appealing the above conviction/order because I am not guilty”. 
     
      
    · The first respondent remained in custody between 25 June 2007 and the hearing of his appeal on 31 August 2007.  
     
      
    · The appeal came before Judge Hosking, who determined that the Local Court had no jurisdiction to proceed to conviction, by reason of the mandatory obligation to adjourn the proceedings under s 57 Legal Aid Commission Act. His Honour quashed the conviction and remitted the matter to the Local Court. He granted bail to the first respondent until the matter was listed in the Local Court upon remitter. 
     
      
    · On 11 September 2007 the remitted proceedings came before Wollongong Local Court and were adjourned until 25 September 2007, bail continued. 
     
      
    · On 25 September 2007, the matter was fixed for hearing on 30 November 2007. 
     
      
    · On 30 November 2007 the matter was stood out of the list due to the uncertainty about the status of proceedings in the Local Court.  
     
      
    3 It appears from this chronology that, at least by 30 November 2007, doubts had arisen as to whether the order remitting the matter to the Local Court was valid. The summons in this Court invoking its supervisory jurisdiction was filed on 16 May 2008. 
     
      
    4 A number of orders were originally sought in the summons. Only one is now sought: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. An order that the record of the District Court of New South Wales, sitting in its criminal jurisdiction at Wollongong on 31 August 2007, be called up and the orders made on that day … be quashed.” 
        
       
      
    5 In his written submissions Mr Emanuel accepted that there was jurisdictional error and agreed that the order sought by the Director of Public Prosecutions should be made.  
     
      
    6 During the course of the oral hearing, this Court raised with the parties certain unsatisfactory aspects that would attend an order remitting the matter to the District Court without any step being taken to challenge the conviction in the Local Court of 25 June 2007. In particular, Mr Emanuel would lose the opportunity to have an appeal “as of right” to the District Court after a fully contested first instance hearing and would require leave of the District Court to adduce fresh evidence pursuant to s 18(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the “Appeal and Review Act”). 
     
      
    7 During the course of the oral hearing two alternative means of resolving these matters were raised by the Court with the parties. Mr Emanuel could, by way of cross summons, invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court and seek orders in accordance with s 69 of the Supreme Court Act to quash his convictions and sentences in the Local Court. Alternatively Mr Emanuel could invoke s 53(1) of the Appeal and Review Act which, relevantly, provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “53(1) Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by a Local Court … may appeal to the Supreme Court against the conviction or sentence on a ground that involves… 
        
       
       
        
        (b) a question of mixed law and fact, 
        
       
       
        
        but only by leave of the Supreme Court.” 
        
       
      
    8 Pursuant to s 55(1)(b) of the Appeal and Review Act this Court, unlike the District Court, has an express power, when it sets aside a conviction, to remit “the matter to the original Local Court for redetermination in accordance with the Supreme Court’s directions”.  
     
      
    9 Furthermore, although one member of this Bench could exercise the jurisdiction under the Appeal and Review Act, by s 44 of the Supreme Court Act this Court is empowered to: “exercise every power, jurisdiction or authority of the Court … under any Act”. Relevantly this extends to the jurisdiction and powers contained in ss 53 and 55 of the Appeal and Review Act. 
     
      
    10 By means of a cross summons filed on 3 March 2009 Mr Emanuel instituted proceedings seeking the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Pursuant to Part 51B rule 6 of the Supreme Court rules the time for institution of this appeal be extended to 4 March 2009. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Leave be granted to the first respondent to appeal under s 53 of the  
        Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        3. The convictions recorded against the first respondent by the third respondent on 25 June 2007 be set aside pursuant to s. 55 of the  
        Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
        
       
       
        
        4. The sentences imposed against the first respondent by the third respondent on 25 June 2007 be set aside pursuant to s. 55 of the  
        Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        5. The proceedings be remitted to the third respondent to be heard according to law by a magistrate other than the magistrate who imposed the convictions and sentences imposed on 25 June 2007”. 
        
       
      
    11 The Director does not oppose these orders. 
     
      
       
      The Review of the District Court 
       
      
    12 The relevant passage of the judgment of Hosking DCJ is: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 57 of the  
        Legal Aid Act 
         requires a court where Legal Aid has been refused and an appeal has been lodged against that refusal to adjourn a matter. It appears to me therefore, as the learned magistrate did not apply that provision which is mandatory, the subsequent hearing was made without jurisdiction and accordingly the convictions recorded against Mr Emanuel which led to his imprisonment were correspondingly made without jurisdiction. In those circumstances I quash the purported convictions of the appellant. It follows that he must be released from custody because he is not lawfully in custody. 
        
       
       
        
        That does not put an end to the matter of course because that means that the charges are still on foot. I remit them to Wollongong Local Court and I will have them listed for mention here to fix a fresh hearing date on – which day ladies?” 
        
       
      
    13 Hosking DCJ was exercising jurisdiction pursuant to s 11(1) of the Appeal and Review Act which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “11(1) Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by a Local Court may appeal to the District Court against the conviction or sentence…” 
        
       
      
    14 The nature of the appeal to the District Court is identified in s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act, which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “18(1) An appeal against conviction is to be by way of rehearing on the basis of certified transcripts of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings …  
         
         
        (2) Fresh evidence may be given, but only by leave of the District Court which may be granted only if the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the fresh evidence be given …” 
        
       
      
    15 The orders that may be made by the District Court upon an appeal are specified in s 20, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(20)(1) The District Court may determine an appeal against conviction:  
         
         
          
          (a) by setting aside the conviction, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) by dismissing the appeal …”  
        
       
      
    16 As I have indicated above, no express power is conferred upon the District Court to remit the matter upon the setting aside of a conviction. This contrasts with s 16A of the Appeal and Review Act which provides expressly for a remittal to the Local Court in certain circumstances, not being circumstances pertinent to this case.  
     
      
    17 It was common ground in the submissions before this Court that the District Court had no power to order a remitter to the Local Court. 
     
      
    18 The Director of Public Prosecutions submitted that s 176 of the District Court Act 1973 did not prevent this Court from rectifying jurisdictional error. (See most recently Spanos v Lazaris [2008] NSWCA 74 at [15].) The submissions on both sides proceeded on the basis that Hosking DCJ had committed a jurisdictional error. 
     
      
    19 The nature of an appeal under s 11 of the Appeal and Review Act has been considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal. In Gianoutsos v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137; (2006) 65 NSWLR 539, McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Sully and Hislop JJ agreed) said:  
     
      
       
        
        “[39] The District Court has power to rehear issues at trial but does not have power to remit the matter back to the Local Court.” 
        
       
      
    20 Subsequently in Charara v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 244; (2006) 164 A Crim R 39, Mason P, with whom Kirby and Hoeben JJ agreed, referred to the analysis in Gianoutsos and the conclusion that under the legislative scheme the appeal from the Local Court was by way of rehearing, rather than a hearing de novo. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[19] The nature of an appeal ‘by way of rehearing’ has been discussed in many cases. The procedure to be adopted, powers to be exercised and function to be performed must first be sought in language of the particular statute …” 
        
       
      
    21 Although the issue of whether or not there is a power to remit is not expressly considered, his Honour’s observations are directly on point in the context of a legislative scheme which identifies the powers capable of being exercised on appeal and which does not confer any power to remit.  
     
      
    22 I have set out at [12] above the relevant passage from the judgment of Hosking DCJ. His Honour had before him an appeal against conviction. His Honour did not deal in any way with the appeal against conviction. His Honour proceeded to exercise what can only be characterised as a supervisory jurisdiction. He found that, by reason of the failure to obey the mandatory requirements of s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act, the magistrate acted “without jurisdiction and accordingly the convictions recorded against Mr Emmanuel … were … made without jurisdiction”. His Honour went on to say that “In those circumstances”, he would “quash the purported convictions”.  
     
      
    23 The jurisdiction his Honour was exercising was a jurisdiction to hear an appeal. His Honour purported to exercise a supervisory jurisdiction. This is implicit in his Honour’s judgment which made no reference to the evidence. It appears quite clearly from his Honour’s language: “without jurisdiction” and “purported convictions”, together with “quash” in lieu of the statutory formulation to ‘set aside’.  
     
      
    24 Furthermore, his Honour made an order which he had no power to make.  
     
      
    25 In my opinion his Honour fundamentally misconceived the nature of the jurisdiction he was exercising. This was a jurisdictional error entitling this Court to intervene. 
     
      
    26 In accordance with the authoritative formulations in Craig v South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 177-178: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) With respect to the jurisdiction he purported to exercise, his Honour: 
        
       
      
    · ‘misapprehended the nature of his function or power’; 
     
      
    ·  ‘acted wholly outside the general area of his jurisdiction’ by exercising a supervisory not an appellate jurisdiction; and 
     
      
    · ‘misconceived the nature of the function he was performing and the extent of his power’. 
     
      
       
        
        (ii) With respect to the order disposing of the proceedings, his Honour: 
        
       
      
    · ‘made an order based upon a misconception of the nature of his jurisdiction’; and 
     
      
    · ‘acted partly outside the general area of the court’s jurisdiction by making an order of a kind which he lacked power to make’. 
     
      
    27 Order one in the applicants summons should be made, but only with respect to his Honour’s orders quashing the convictions and remitting the matters to the Local Court. His Honour’s order continuing bail until the matter is listed before the Local Court should stand.  
     
      
    28 With respect to the Local Court orders of 11 September and 25 September 2007, it is sufficient to declare that the orders are invalid and of no effect. 
     
      
       
      The Appeal from the Local Court 
       
      
    29 As indicated above, by his cross summons Mr Emanuel invoked the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under s 53 of the Appeal and Review Act. This Court should exercise that jurisdiction. The basis of this appeal, as considered during the course of oral submissions, was that a denial of procedural fairness had occurred. 
     
      
    30 The materials before this Court indicate that Mr Emanuel had lodged an appeal against the refusal of legal aid to him by 19 June 2007.  
     
      
    31 When the matter was called for hearing in the Local Court on 25 June 2007, the prosecutor told the Magistrate that he was ready to proceed. The transcript of that day continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: You’re ready then. Mr Emanuel, matters listed for hearing, any reason why it shouldn’t proceed? 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: I need to ask for an adjournment. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Why is that? 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: The, there was a mix up with my Legal Aid appointment and I was legal aid refused and I’ve put in a -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What was the mix up Mr Emanuel? 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: I wasn’t able to attend the appointment. I made contact with head office in Sydney and they sent an email through and the email didn’t arrive until late afternoon and by that time the solicitor had made me legal aid refused and I put in a -- 
        
       
      
     HIS HONOUR: And why couldn’t you attend your appointment? 
     
      
       
       ACCUSED: I was in Sydney at the time, in the morning. 
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Why? What were you doing in Sydney rather than attending your appointment with your solicitors for an important court hearing? 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: (No verbal reply) 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Mr Emanuel, there are seven police officers sitting here ready to have this matter dealt with. 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: I’m fully aware -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: If you don’t keep – if you choose to go somewhere else rather than keep your appointments, I’m not going to adjourn the matter because you’re unrepresented for that reason. THE MATTER IS LISTED FOR HEARING, IT WILL PROCEED TO HEARING.”  
        
       
      
    32 It appears that the Magistrate dealt with the matter as an adjournment application to be addressed as a matter of general discretionary power with respect to the conduct of criminal proceedings. Although he indicated in remarks made some five months later (on 30 November 2007) that he had considered and addressed the matter under s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act, there was no reference to that in his reasons for refusing the adjournment, nor in the mode of his questioning of the unrepresented respondent.  
     
      
    33 Section 57 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        57 Adjournment of certain proceedings 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Where it appears to a court or tribunal, on any information before it:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that a party to any proceedings before the court or tribunal:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) has appealed, in accordance with section 56, to a Legal Aid Review Committee and that the appeal has not been determined, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) intends to appeal, in accordance with section 56, to a Legal Aid Review Committee and that such an appeal is competent, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that the appeal or intention to appeal is bona fide and not frivolous or vexatious or otherwise intended to improperly hinder or improperly delay the conduct of the proceedings, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) that there are no special circumstances that prevent it from doing so, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          the court or tribunal shall adjourn the proceedings to such date on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    34 As the transcript makes clear, the matters which called for attention under s 57 were not addressed by the Magistrate. Specifically there was no identification of the fact that an appeal had been lodged, which engaged s 57(a). Furthermore, none of the matters which fall for consideration pursuant to s 57(b) and (c) were mentioned. There were no relevant findings. 
     
      
    35 The language of s 57 is mandatory. (See The Friends of Glenreagh Dorigo Line Inc v Jones, Court of Appeal, 30 March 1994, unreported.) 
     
      
    36 Mr Emanuel was convicted at a trial at which he was unrepresented during a period when he was seeking legal aid to acquire representation. He was entitled, as a matter of law, for the Local Court to address the provisions of s 57 once he had lodged an appeal against the refusal of legal aid. If each of the other conditions in (b) and (c) were made out, s 57 requires the Court to adjourn the proceedings. Mr Emanuel was deprived, it appears to me by way of inadvertence, of his statutory entitlement to have the Court determine whether he was entitled to an adjournment in accordance with law. This, in my opinion, meant that his trial involved a miscarriage of justice, which this Court should not allow to stand.  
     
      
    37 A refusal of an adjournment may amount to procedural unfairness, relevantly, when it denies a party a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case. (See Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11; (2002) 209 CLR 597 at [40]; R v Thames Magistrates Court ex parte Polemis [1974] 1 WLR 1371 at 1375; McColl v Lehmann [1987] VR 503 at 506-510; Touma v Saparas [2000] NSWCA 11 at [27]; R v Osborne [2002] VSCA 156; (2002) 133 A Crim R 519 at [23]–[26]; R v White; R v Piggin [2003] VSCA 174; (2003) 7 VR 442 at [76]–[78].) 
     
      
    38 Where, as here, an accused may have a statutory entitlement to an adjournment for the purpose of obtaining legal aid, there has been a denial of a reasonable opportunity to present his case. (See McInnis v The Queen (1979) 143 CLR 575 at 579 and 583.) Accordingly, he did not receive a fair trial. 
     
      
    39 Leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal allowed and the matter should be remitted to the Local Court. 
     
      
    40 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
        
        1. An order that the record of the District Court of New South Wales, sitting in its criminal jurisdiction at Wollongong on 31 August 2007, be called up and the order that the conviction be set aside and the matter remitted is quashed.  
        
       
       
        
        2. Declare that the orders made by the Wollongong Local Court on 11 September 2007 and 25 September 2007 are invalid and of no effect. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The time for institution of the appeal by the cross applicant be extended to 4 March 2009. 
        
       
       
        
        4. Leave to appeal granted. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The convictions recorded against the cross appellant on 25 June 2007 are set aside. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The sentences imposed upon the cross appellant on 25 June 2007 are set aside. 
        
       
       
        
        7. The proceedings are remitted to the Local Court to be heard by a magistrate other than the magistrate who imposed the convictions and sentences on 25 June 2007. 
        
       
      
    41 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
    42 BASTEN JA: I agree that the orders proposed by the Chief Justice should be made and, subject to what follows, for the reasons his Honour gives. Unfortunately, this matter has been attended by a litany of errors. They did not cease when the matter left the District Court. The orders to be made will return the matter to the Local Court, which was the outcome intended by Hosking DCJ. 
     
      
    43 The proceedings were commenced in this Court by the Director, seeking judicial review in respect of the orders of the District Court, pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). As explained by the Chief Justice, the proceedings in the Local Court miscarried. That is no longer in dispute and, indeed, was conceded by the Director in the District Court. The only question was whether the District Court had power to grant the appropriate relief. No point was taken in the District Court that it did not. 
     
      
    44 Had the basis of the orders sought by the Director in this Court been challenged, it would have been necessary for the Court to be persuaded that the District Court judge misconceived his jurisdiction or exercised a power he did not have. The doubts which have arisen in those respects reveal an unsatisfactory aspect of the legislative regime for appeals from the Local Court to the District Court.  
     
      
    45 For the Director’s application to succeed, he was required to establish jurisdictional error, as a result of the privative effect of s 176 of the District Court Act 1976 (NSW), which operates to constrain the jurisdiction conferred on this Court under the Supreme Court Act: see s 69(5) and, in relation to the operation of s 176 of the District Court Act, Spanos v Lazaris [2008] NSWCA 74 at [15]. 
     
      
    46 The first question is whether the language adopted by Hosking DCJ revealed a misapprehension as to the nature and scope of the jurisdiction being exercised. His Honour commenced his judgment by stating that he was hearing “the all grounds appeal” of the respondent. That language indicates that he was aware of the nature of the proceedings before him. It was language reminiscent of that used with respect to appeals to the District Court under s 122 of the (now repealed) Justices Act 1902 (NSW). The powers of the District Court under that Act included orders which would “confirm, quash, set aside, vary, increase, or reduce, the conviction, order, sentence, or adjudication appealed against …”: s 125(1). Subject to the question of relief, it might be inferred that his Honour, in consequence of long-established habit, was continuing to use language sanctioned by the predecessor to the present section. It need not be inferred that his Honour misunderstood the nature of the jurisdiction being exercised. 
     
      
    47 The second question is whether the ground of challenge to the conviction, namely the failure of the Magistrate to adjourn the proceedings in circumstances where such a course was required by s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act 1979 (NSW), was unavailable in the District Court. As explained by the Chief Justice, and as accepted by counsel appearing for the Director in the District Court, the conclusion that the trial had miscarried in the Local Court was correct: see The Friends of the Glenreagh Dorrigo Line Inc v Jones [1994] NSWCA 101 (Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Mahoney JA); Edelsten v Medical Tribunal of NSW (No 2) [1993] NSWCA 87 (Kirby P, Priestley and Meagher JJA agreeing); Lewis v Spencer [2007] NSWSC 1383; 179 A Crim R 48 (Rothman J).  
     
      
    48 In substance, the refusal to grant the adjournment in the Local Court, although the right arose under statute, involved a breach of general law procedural fairness. Such an error, like the rejection of admissible evidence, may form a ground of appeal: see HG v The Queen [1999] HCA 2; 197 CLR 414 at [97] (McHugh J); Hamod v Suncorp Metway Insurance Ltd [2006] NSWCA 243; as may a complaint of apprehended bias: see Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design & Developments Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 55; 229 CLR 577; Dekkan v Picciau [2008] NSWCA 18 at [7]; Chaina v Alvaro Homes Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 353 at [23] ff; Seltsam Pty Ltd v Ghaleb [2005] NSWCA 208; 3 DDCR 1 at [159]. The effect of such a breach must be to invalidate the result of the proceedings. In the case of a judgment and orders of a court, an order to that effect is required: see Berowra Holdings Pty Ltd v Gordon [2006] HCA 32; 225 CLR 364 at [11]-[16]; cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11; 209 CLR 597. 
     
      
    49 The authorities in this Court noted in [47] above were by way of appeal under s 75A of the Supreme Court Act: accordingly, if there can be any basis for concluding that Hosking DCJ was not entitled to set aside the conviction in the Local Court because there had been a failure to comply with s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act, it must arise by implication drawn from the terms of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (the “Appeal and Review Act”). 
     
      
    50 The third question, therefore, is whether there was power in the District Court, in determining an appeal against conviction or sentence in the Local Court, under s 11 of the Appeal and Review Act, to set aside the conviction on the ground relied upon and remit the matter to the Local Court.  
     
      
    51 Where an application to annul a conviction or sentence is refused in the Local Court, an appeal may be brought to the District Court: s 11A. Where the appeal is upheld, the District Court is required to remit the matter to the Local Court: s 16A(3). However, an application to annul can only be made where the person has been convicted in his or her absence: s 4(1). It does not apply where, as here, the defendant was present, though unrepresented, and the trial, which should not have proceeded, did proceed. 
     
      
    52 The power to remit, under s 16A, is in contrast to the powers conferred on the District Court to determine an appeal against conviction, which, in express terms, are limited to setting aside the conviction or dismissing the appeal: s 20(1). The inference is, accordingly, that in determining an appeal from a conviction, the District Court has no power of remitter. 
     
      
    53 There is authority to support that conclusion. In Gianoutsos v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137; 65 NSWLR 539, McClellan CJ at CL (Sully and Hislop JJ agreeing) noted that there was no express power to remit (at [38]) and concluded that the District Court “has power to rehear issues at trial but does not have power to remit the matter back to the Local Court”: at [39]. 
     
      
    54 The focus of Gianoutsos was on the question whether the proceedings before the District Court involved a hearing de novo, or an appeal by way of rehearing: the Court concluded that there was to be an appeal by way of rehearing and that the conduct in the District Court of a de novo hearing had been in error. No question of remittal arose directly. 
     
      
    55 None of the cases following and applying Gianoutsos has been concerned with the power of remittal. In Spanos, this Court noted that there was “no express power providing for remittal to the Local Court” and that there was no power to enter a conviction: at [36]. The latter omission is surprising because it would prevent correction of error on the part of the Local Court in circumstances where alternative convictions were available. With respect to the absence of remittal, the nature of the jurisdiction of the District Court is important.  
     
      
    56 An appeal against conviction is described as being “by way of rehearing” but is to be conducted “on the basis of certified transcripts of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings, except as provided by section 19”: s 18(1). There is power for “fresh evidence” to be given, but only by leave of the District Court and only if the Court is satisfied that it is in “the interests of justice”: s 18(2). Further, there are constraints upon requiring the attendance of persons to give evidence. Section 19 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        19 Circumstances in which evidence to be given in person 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) The District Court may direct a person to attend and give evidence in proceedings on an appeal against conviction if it is satisfied: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) in the case of an appeal that relates to an offence involving violence against that person, that there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence, or  
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) in any other case, that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) An application for such a direction may be made by a party to the proceedings in relation to a particular person only if notice of the party’s intention to make such an application has been served on each other party to the proceedings within such period as the District Court may direct.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    57 Where there has been no proper hearing in the Local Court, the premise on which s 18 is based is absent, so that there can be no “rehearing” in the District Court. Further, the transcripts of the hearing are expected to provide a proper basis for reconsideration in the District Court. Where, as in the present case, those assumptions are not met, a “rehearing” in the District Court will give rise to anomalous results. It is at least unusual for a person accused of a criminal offence to have an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and call evidence only with leave of the court. It is also surprising that a person should be liable to imprisonment for up to two years if convicted, at what is his or her first hearing in accordance with law, without any general right of appeal. Those considerations lead to the question whether the District Court judge did in fact err in remitting the matter to the Local Court, despite the fact that there is no express power to that effect identified in s 20 of the Appeal and Review Act. 
     
      
    58 There are two possible ways to resolve these difficulties. The first is to require that a defendant who asserts that proceedings have miscarried on procedural grounds, leading to their invalidity, must seek relief in the Supreme Court, either by adopting the procedure under ss 52 and 53 of the Appeal and Review Act, or by seeking judicial review under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act. Such a requirement has the potential to increase expense and delay and will provide for bifurcated rights of appeal, in circumstances where a defendant may seek to rely upon different grounds in the alternative. Nor, generally speaking, is it appropriate to read down by implication provisions conferring jurisdiction or powers on a court: Owners of “Shin Kobe Maru v Empire Shipping Co Inc [1994] HCA 5; 181 CLR 404 at 421. 
     
      
    59 The second resolution is that a power of remittal exists on an appeal to the District Court. In Grassby v The Queen [1989] HCA 45; 168 CLR 1 Dawson J explained that a magistrates’ court, although an inferior court with limited jurisdiction, “undoubtedly possesses jurisdiction arising by implication upon the principle that a grant of power carries with it everything necessary for its exercise”: at 16. These principles were adopted and applied in Pelechowski v Registrar, Court of Appeal (NSW) [1999] HCA 19; 198 CLR 435 at [50]-[51] (Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ), their Honours noting that reference to “necessary implication” was to be understood as identifying a power to make orders “which are reasonably required or legally ancillary to the accomplishment of the specific remedies” provided in the statute. 
     
      
    60 The District Court had undoubted power to set aside the conviction and sentence: Appeal and Review Act, s 20. If the charges were to be pursued, that could only properly take place in the Local Court. There may be doubt as to whether an order of remittal were necessary. Assuming it was, it was arguably an order necessary to give effect to the judgment setting aside the conviction and was therefore within the implied powers of that Court, in the particular circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    61 It is not appropriate to resolve the scope of the jurisdiction of the District Court and the nature of the powers available to it in proceedings where the Director’s right to relief is conceded. However, I would not accept, without full argument, that an appeal cannot be taken to the District Court challenging the validity of the proceedings in the Local Court, nor that, where such a ground is upheld, there is no power of remittal. 
     
      
    62 Finally, were relief not conceded, there would have been strong factors militating against the grant of relief sought by the Director. The Director was represented by counsel before the District Court and raised no objection to the power or jurisdiction of the Court with respect to the proposed remittal. Nor did he take steps to review the decision until the local prosecutors drew to his attention remarks by the Magistrate in the Local Court on 30 November 2007, casting doubt upon the validity of the District Court order made three months earlier. Further, despite the fact that he was represented in the brief hearing before the District Court on 31 August 2007, he allowed a further four and a half months to elapse before commencing proceedings in this Court, supposedly because of a need to obtain transcripts. 
     
      
    63 In circumstances where the defendant is on bail, having been convicted and sentenced to a significant period of imprisonment, pending the outcome of his appeal, such delays would usually militate against the grant of discretionary relief.

    2 BUDDIN J:  I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    3 PRICE J: The appellant upon arraignment in the District Court on 4 February 2008 pleaded not guilty to counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 on an indictment but guilty to count 4. After a five-day trial, the jury found the appellant guilty of all the counts the subject of the trial. On 4 April 2008 the sentencing Judge imposed the following sentences:  
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 (an offence of robbery in company contrary to s 97(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900) to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years dating from 11 February 2008 to 10 February 2010. The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment.  
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 (an offence of robbery in company contrary to s 97(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ) to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years dating from 11 March 2008 to 10 March 2010.  
        
       
       
        
        Count 3 (an offence of aggravated car-jacking contrary to s 154C(2) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ) to a term of imprisonment of 8 years consisting of a non-parole period of 5 years dating from 11 May 2008 to 10 May 2013 with a balance of term of 3 years dating from 11 May 2013 to 10 May 2016. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years. The circumstances of aggravation was that the offence was in company. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4 (an offence of dishonestly interfering with a unique identifier contrary to s 154H(1)(a) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ) to a fixed term of imprisonment of 11 months dating from 11 April 2008 to 10 March 2009. The maximum penalty for this offence is 7 years imprisonment. A 10 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty was taken into account on sentence for this offence.  
        
       
       
        
        Count 5 (an offence of disposing of stolen property contrary to s 188(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ) to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years dating from 11 April 2008 to 10 April 2010. The maximum penalty for this offence is 12 years imprisonment.  
        
       
      
    4 The sentencing Judge also took into account on sentence a matter on a Form 1 being a charge of knowingly possess without reasonable excuse, a vehicle identification plate not attached to the motor vehicle to which it relates contrary to s 154J of the Crimes Act. Such an offence carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    5 The total effective sentence was a term of 8 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 5 years 3 months.  
     
      
    6 The appellant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on three grounds: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The sentencing Judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the robbery and car-jacking counts. 
       
       
      Ground 2: The sentencing Judge failed to adequately reflect his finding of “special circumstances” in the sentences imposed.  
       
      
     Ground 3: The sentence was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
     Facts  
     
      
    7 The sentencing Judge found the following facts (ROS 2-5): 
     
      
       
        
        “…The victim, Bruno Daniele, in 2006 advertised his vehicle bearing New South Wales registration plates AIV16F for sale on the Internet site  
        www.carsales.com.au 
        . The vehicle AIV16F was a black Honda Prelude and bearing VIN number JHBB6150YC200255 (sic). 
        
       
       
        
        On 3 October 2006 a black Honda Prelude, bearing New South Wales registration plate AZPO8W was sold at auction to the offender, Hassan Trad, by Pickles Auction Group in Canberra. This vehicle was sold with heavy panel damage and light structural damage to the front. The VIN number for that vehicle, AZPO8W is JHBB6140XC200069 (sic). This vehicle was not driveable and was transported to Sydney by Hassan Trad.  
        
       
       
        
        On 4 October 2006 the offender, Hassan Trad, contacted Bruno Daniele on his mobile phone and informed him that he was interested in purchasing vehicle AIV16F. Over the next twenty-four hours the offender again contacted Bruno Daniele numerous times in efforts to arrange a viewing time and a location.  
        
       
       
        
        Finally, the offender and victim, Bruno Daniele, arranged to meet at the Readings Cinema carpark Auburn at 8.30pm on 4 October 2006.  
        
       
       
        
        Around about 8pm the victim, Bruno Daniele, along with his brother in-law, Adrian Miano (victim number two) attended Readings Cinema carpark Auburn in vehicle AIV16F. Whilst waiting Bruno Daniele received several other phone calls from Mr Trad on his mobile phone informing him the offender was running late.  
        
       
       
        
        At about 8.25pm the offender, together with four other unknown male co-offenders, approached Daniele and Miano who were both standing directly next to their vehicle AIV16F. The offender and Daniele and [Miano] engaged in conversation about vehicle AIV16F and its condition.  
        
       
       
        
        While the offender inspected the vehicle the tallest co-offender, male, has produced what appeared to be a firearm and pointed it at point blank range into Daniele’s ribcage. This is offence number one, robbery in company. The offender reached into Daniele’s left pants pocket and took the vehicle’s, AIV16F, main keys and spare keys and a V3I Motorola mobile telephone.  
        
       
       
        
        The second offence of robbery in company, the second matter on the indictment, is at the same time when three other co-offenders have demanded the mobile phone and wallet of Miano, who is victim number two. Mr Miano handed the co-offenders his Nokia N70 mobile phone and a wallet containing $100 and personal cards.  
        
       
       
        
        Offence number three is the car-jacking. The offender has entered the vehicle AIV16F and occupied the driver’s seat. Both victims were directed by the co-offender, pointing what appeared to be a firearm, to walk away from the vehicle and not look back. The offender, together with several co-offenders, has driven the vehicle AIV16F away from the cinema carpark.  
        
       
       
        
        Offence number 4 is re-birthing. Between 5 October 2006 and 5 November 2006 the offender had interfered with the unique identifiers of vehicle AZPO8W by cutting the VIN numbers JHMBB6140XC200069 off the chassis and removed the compliance plates, manufacture plates, registration and registration plates.  
        
       
       
        
        The offender has added these unique identifiers belonging to the vehicle AZPO8W onto vehicle AIV16F and indeed it came out that the engine from AZPO8W was also inserted into the vehicle AIV16F. Examination revealed that the metal plate with VIN Number JHBB6140XC200069 (sic) was welded on top of the original chassis VIN number JHBB6150YC200255 (sic). These were shown again in photographs in the exhibits. The offender, as I said, also replaced the engine of AIV16F with the engine from AZPO8W.  
        
       
       
        
        The fifth offence on the indictment, receiving, took place on 5 November 2006. The offender sold the vehicle AIV16F (fraudulently imitating vehicle AZPO8W) to Mr Charbal Boustani for the amount of $15,000. This vehicle was stolen from Boustani’s home address and located burnt out several hours later. Mr Boustani gave evidence, and indeed it was referred to again this morning by the Crown that Mr Boustani did not have an opportunity in that short time to insure the car and therefore 
          
        has suffered a loss and makes a claim for that loss.”  
        
       
      
    Subjective Circumstances  
     
      
    8 During the proceedings on sentence the appellant gave evidence and the written material which was tendered included a report dated 24 March 2008 from John Jacmon, a psychologist, and a character testimonial. 
     
      
    9 The appellant was born on 19 February 1986 and was 20 years old at the time of the offending. His criminal record commenced in 2006 when he was convicted of common assault in the Local Court and placed on s 9 bond to be of good behaviour for 12 months commencing on 2 March 2006. Other convictions include goods in personal custody and carrying a cutting weapon for which fines were imposed.  
     
      
    10 The psychologist’s report recorded the appellant’s background. He was born in Sydney to parents who had migrated from Lebanon. He had two brothers and two sisters and grew up in a warm, supportive family environment. He completed year 12 at Homebush Boys High and obtained a UAI which enabled him to attend university. He did so for about a month and then left to study for a TAFE finance and banking diploma. He had completed about half of the course by the time of his being taken into custody for the present offences. Whilst studying he worked at a call centre for the National Australia Bank. The psychologist detailed the appellant’s relationship with his girlfriend which had become “rocky” because of her possessiveness of him. The psychologist opined that at the time of the offences “depression and anxiety at clinically significant levels appeared to have been markedly impairing [the appellant’s] daily functioning at the time of the incident. The impairment is likely to have existed since his relationship began to sour well before the incident.” Symptoms included difficulties in concentration, memory, problem solving and decision making. The psychologist noted the appellant’s sadness at the distress the offending had caused his parents and the loss of his career in banking. He had resolved to turn his life around and prepare himself for integration into the community as a productive and law abiding citizen. 
     
      
    11 During his testimony before the sentencing Judge the appellant said that what he had told the psychologist was truthful. He denied that he had freely participated in the crimes for which he was being sentenced. Following cross-examination of the appellant by the Crown advocate, the sentencing Judge concluded that the appellant’s “rocky relationship with his fiancée” was not a causative factor in his offending.  
     
      
    12 It had been the appellant’s evidence before the jury that he had no involvement in the robberies and car-jacking being counts 1 to 3. He had met a person called Harry or Hamad who sold him the first vehicle as part of an “insurance job”. He had subsequently sold the vehicle to Mr Boustani. In that context, he admitted interfering with the unique identifiers belonging to the second vehicle but denied involvement in any of the other offences.  
     
      
    13 The sentencing Judge in his remarks on sentence said (ROS at 10): 
     
      
       
        
        “I agree that the offences on his record are relatively minor, however, it is not so minor that I could extend leniency because of that fact.”  
        
       
      
    14 His Honour found (ROS at 10):  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        … there are special circumstances to do with his youth and also this will be the first time he will spend some time in custody.”  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Dealing with the appeal  
       
      
    15 The principal complaint in the first ground of appeal is that the sentencing Judge erred in characterising the car-jacking offence as being in the mid-range, particularly having regard to the fact that neither actual violence was used nor was there evidence of an actual firearm being involved.  
     
      
    16 In written submissions to the sentencing Judge the Crown had contended that whilst there was no evidence that the weapon used was in fact a firearm, the weapon nevertheless fell within the definition of an offensive weapon and was relied upon by the Crown as an additional circumstance of aggravation. 
     
      
    17 The attention of this Court was drawn by the parties to what was said by Howie J (with whom Basten JA and Hall J agreed) in R v Barker, R v Gibson [2006] NSWCCA 20 when the offence of aggravated car-jacking was considered. Howie J said at [63]-[64]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that for an aggravated offence involving the offender being in company the following factors may be relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence: whether the offence was planned; the number of persons involved in committing the offence and their conduct; the type of threats made; the degree of violence displayed; the number of persons in the vehicle at the time of the offence; the degree of fear instilled in the victim; the period over which the vehicle is used; damage to the vehicle (if not giving rise to a separate charge); the place and time the offence is committed (for example whether at night or in an isolated area); the special vulnerability of the victim; and the motive for the commission of the offence. The list is not intended to be exhaustive. Although counsel referred to the value of the vehicle, I doubt that is a relevant consideration where there is no intention to permanently deprive the owner of the vehicle.  
         
         
         
        Of course the objective seriousness of the offence will be increased if either of the other two aggravating elements of the offence are also present: that is that the offenders, or any of them, are armed with an offensive weapon or actual bodily harm is inflicted upon the victim. If they are present then the nature of the weapon and its capacity to inflict serious injury, and the nature of the injury inflicted, will be relevant factors.” 
        
       
      
    18 Whilst I otherwise enthusiastically endorse what Howie J said in the passage I have quoted, it seems to me that the value of the motor vehicle, the subject of the car-jacking, is a relevant consideration as that motor vehicle is the victim’s property which is taken. The car-jacking of a brand new Lamborghini by way of illustration would normally be considered more serious than the car-jacking of a vehicle of a common make and model. Car-jackings are in many cases motivated by the make and model of the vehicle to be taken. I merely make this general observation in passing as this issue was not argued before this Court nor was it a matter taken into account by the sentencing Judge in respect of charge 3. It is not a consideration in the present appeal.  
     
      
    19 The sentencing Judge was obliged to consider where the offence of aggravated car-jacking lay on the scale on objective seriousness as a standard non-parole period applied: R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. His Honour characterised the offence as being “at least that of the mid range of objective seriousness.” 
     
      
    20 A determination of where the subject offence lies on the scale of seriousness of an offence of its type is essentially one of fact and as such is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The Queen (1936) 55 CLR 499; R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 140; Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282. 
     
      
    21 This was an offence which was carefully planned by the appellant and committed in the company of four co-offenders. The telephone calls by the appellant to Mr Daniele were made under the false pretence of wanting to inspect the Honda Prelude and were used to lure Mr Daniele with his vehicle to the carpark at night so that the car-jacking could occur. As his Honour observed (ROS at 13): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The offence involved a planned and organised criminal activity. The constant ringing of the victim’s mobile phone, setting up the meeting place and the crime, as the Crown colourfully put it, was in fact an ambush and indeed it was.”  
        
       
      
    22 Although no actual bodily harm was involved (which his Honour charitably took into account as a mitigating factor), the level of violence that was threatened was high. What had appeared to be a firearm was pointed at point blank range into Mr Daniele’s rib cage during the robbery which preceded the car-jacking and was again pointed at both victims when they were directed to walk away from the vehicle and not look back by the co-offender. The sentencing Judge understandably found that: 
     
      
       
        
        “…it was a terrifying experience for the two victims…” (ROS at 13).  
        
       
      
    23 In these circumstances it seems to me to make little difference that the Crown was unable to establish that the weapon used was in actual fact a firearm. The inability to establish that the weapon used was in reality a firearm could certainly not be considered to be a mitigating factor: Versluys v R [2008] NSWCCA 76 per McClellan CJ at CL at [37]. 
     
      
    24 I am not persuaded that his Honour overlooked a relevant consideration or that wrong principle was applied or that the finding was not open on the evidence. His Honour’s characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of the offence was, in my opinion, open to him. 
     
      
    25 A further complaint is that the sentencing Judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the two counts of robbery in company (counts 1 and 2). For these offences fixed terms of 2 years imprisonment were imposed.  
     
      
    26 It is evident from his Honour’s sentencing remarks that he was mindful of the sentencing guideline for a contravention of s 97 of the Crimes Act promulgated in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at 380 of a head sentence of between 4 and 5 years for an offender having the following characteristics: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) Young offender with no or little criminal history; 
         
        (ii) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; 
        
       
      
     (iii) Limited degree of planning; (iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; 
     
      
       
        
        (v) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; 
        
       
      
     (vi) Small amount taken;  
     
      
       
        
        (vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.” 
        
       
      
    27 This sentencing range takes into account a 10 per cent discount for a guilty plea. 
     
      
    28 The sentencing Judge said (ROS at 14): 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept Mr Brewer’s submission also that the robbery in a sense was ancillary to the main purpose which was the carjacking. So rather than apply the  
        Henry 
          
        guidelines which suggest there is a narrower sentencing range of four to five years, I think that does not truly reflect the objective criminality of that part of the sentencing. In other respects, it does fall into the seven characteristics that are regarded in  
        Henry 
        . However, I have decided that on sentencing, for this purpose, on the first matter in the indictment a fixed period of two years. 
        
       
       
        
        On the second matter in the indictment also a fixed period of two years.” 
        
       
      
    29 The characteristics identified in (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) in Henry apply to the present case. The victims were in a vulnerable position being in the car park at night. Violence was threatened by the use of a weapon and by the presence of the appellant and his co-offenders. Keys and a mobile phone were taken from Mr Daniele (count 1) and a mobile phone and wallet containing $100 cash and personal cards were taken from Mr Miano (count 2). Whilst the appellant is a young offender with a limited criminal history, an aggravating factor was the commission of the offences whilst on conditional liberty as was the planning that had been involved. Furthermore, the appellant had pleaded not guilty. If these offences had been viewed without regard to the car-jacking, sentences at the top of the range of 4 to 5 years imprisonment might have been called for. The car-jacking, however, immediately followed the robberies and it was open to the sentencing Judge to accept the appellant’s submission that the robberies were ancillary to the car-jacking. His Honour for this reason departed from the guideline in Henry by imposing sentences which were below the bottom of the suggested range. If his Honour had not done so, there was the risk that the aggravating factors which were common to the robberies and the car-jacking would have been “double counted” and inappropriate sentences imposed. His Honour did not err, in my opinion, in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the two counts of robbery in company.  
     
      
    30 The first ground of appeal has not been established.  
     
      
    31 In the second ground of appeal the appellant complains that the sentencing Judge failed to adequately reflect his finding of “special circumstances” in the sentences imposed. It was submitted that a non-parole period of 5 years for count 3 in the context of a full term of 8 years was inadequate and did not give adequate effect to his Honour’s findings. 
     
      
    32 The special circumstances found by the sentencing Judge were the appellant’s youth and first time in custody.  
     
      
    33 Section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 requires that the balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one third of the non-parole period, unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances. The size of an adjustment to the statutory ratio, special circumstances having been found, is essentially a matter within a Judge’s discretion. As was observed by Spigelman CJ in Regina v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31] the size of an adjustment for special circumstances “raises so many matters of a discretionary character that this Court should be very slow to intervene” and will not usually be interfered with unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    34 The sentencing Judge varied the statutory ratio so that the non-parole period of 5 years was 62.5% of the 8-year head sentence for count 3. This was the standard non-parole period for the offence. The overall non-parole period of 5 years 3 months was 63.6% of the overall head sentence of 8 years 3 months. The effect of his Honour’s finding of special circumstances was to increase the balance of the term of the overall sentence from the statutory ratio of 2 years 1 month (round figures) to 3 years with a corresponding reduction in the non-parole period from 6 years 2 months (round figures) to 5 years 3 months. It seems to me that the proportion of the overall non-parole period to the overall sentence gave effect to the finding of special circumstances. The second ground of appeal, in my opinion, has not been established.  
     
      
    35 The third ground of appeal is that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The appellant complains that given his age, his relatively minor criminal record and other subjective features, the sentences were outside the legitimate range of sentence. The Court’s attention was directed to what was said by his Honour in the passage quoted at [13] above. The appellant argued that greater emphasis should have been made of his lack of criminal history.  
     
      
    36 The difficulty with this submission is that whilst the appellant had what was recognised by the sentencing Judge as a relatively minor record, the present offences were committed whilst he was subject to a s 9 bond. The commission of an offence whilst subject to conditional liberty is a matter that aggravates the offence and weighs upon an assessment of the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation: R v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28. Another obstacle to a positive finding about the appellant’s prospects of rehabilitation was his lack of remorse for the offences to which he had pleaded not guilty, as he had maintained his innocence after the jury’s verdicts. His Honour closely considered the subjective case advanced for the appellant during his sentencing remarks. In my opinion the sentencing Judge gave appropriate weight to the appellant’s subjective circumstances in the balancing process and had proper regard to the serious objective circumstances of his criminal behaviour. Due allowance was made for the relative youth and background of the appellant.  
     
      
    37 It was next submitted that the sentencing Judge failed to adequately take into account the principle of totality. The appellant particularly argued that the sentences for the robberies and the car-jacking effectively referred to one incident and should have been imposed concurrently.  
     
      
    38 The sentence for count 2 (robbery in company - Mr Miano) was partially accumulated on the sentence for count 1 (robbery in company - Mr Daniele) commencing as it did one month after the sentence for count 1. The effective sentence for count 1 was one month. The extent of partial accumulation of the sentence for count 3 (aggravated car-jacking) on the sentence for count 2 was 2 months. The effective sentence for count 2 was accordingly 2 months.  
     
      
    39 Questions of concurrence or accumulation are a discretionary matter for the sentencing Judge but that “discretion is generally circumscribed by a proper application of the principle of totality”: R v MMK (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 at [13]. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    40 It is evident from the sentencing Judge’s remarks that he considered the principle of totality. His Honour said (ROS at 15): 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard then to the totality of the sentencing, of course, I do not intend to make them all accumulative or concurrent. I accept both Mr Brewer and the Crown have said that there ought to be some degree of accumulation and I accept that there should be according to  
        Pearce 
        .” 
        
       
      
    41 His Honour was there referring to Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 in which the High Court considered the totality principle.  
     
      
    42 The offences of robbery in company involved criminal acts which were separate to the car-jacking. Mr Miano was not the owner of the car and was a separate victim of the criminal offending. Cash, personal cards and a mobile phone were stolen from Mr Miano. A mobile phone, as well as the car keys, was stolen from the person of Mr Daniele. In my opinion, it was open to the sentencing Judge to consider that a small measure of partial accumulation was required for counts 1 and 2. Wholly concurrent sentences were imposed for counts 4 and 5. These sentences were fixed to commence one month after the sentence for count 2 and were subsumed by the sentence for count 3. I do not detect error in the structure of the sentences imposed.  
     
      
    43 I am not persuaded that the overall sentence was outside the legitimate range of sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    44 Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Leave to appeal against sentence be granted. 
        
       
      
     2. Appeal dismissed.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender is to be sentenced for the murder of his parents in their home on 28 August 1993 after a jury convicted him of these offences on 28 November 2008. The facts surrounding these killings, the death of the offender’s brother on the same evening and the history of the prosecution of these offences are truly extraordinary. In April 1995 Mr Justice Abadee described the events surrounding the killings as “a remarkable human drama”. That drama has continued to the present day. 
     
      
    2 At the outset it is important to bear in mind that the offender is being sentenced for the murder of his parents. It is obvious now that both the investigating police and the prosecutor were duped at the time that the offender was dealt with for the manslaughter of his brother. But that event has passed into history and has only limited relevance, as I shall explain later. Of course it is impossible to consider the penalty for the killing of his parents without considerable reference to the death of his brother, but I am not punishing the offender for that killing. Nor am I in any way vindicating his brother who for 15 years was falsely accused of murdering his parents. I do not accept the prosecutor’s submission that the objective seriousness of the killing of his parents was aggravated by the fact that the offender falsely blamed the killings on his brother. 
     
      
    3 At the time of the killings the offender lived with his parents, who were in their 50’s, and his elder brother in the family home in Woronora. The brother, Christopher, was aged 25 years and the offender 23. The family was highly respected in the community. Both sons, and in particular the offender, were seen as role models to those who knew the family as friends or neighbours because of their scholastic achievements, their general exemplary behaviour and character, and their loving relationship with their parents. 
     
      
    4 The offender in particular was admired. He was a good looking, strongly built young man who had marked success as a yachtsman. He was gregarious and popular not only within his own large circle of friends but with acquaintances of his parents and neighbours. He was apparently the favoured son, at least of his father. Christopher, however, was more withdrawn and sensitive, yet was not without his own friends arising mainly from his interest in fencing. He did not have the striking appearance of his brother and was troubled with difficulties in his eyesight. He spent much of his time in the family home using the computer. 
     
      
    5 In the early hours of the morning of 28 August, the offender’s parents and brother were savagely stabbed to death and the house set on fire. At about 4.30am the offender came to a neighbour’s home raising the alarm. He was dressed only in a pair of shorts and appeared to be in a highly distressed and emotional state. He said that his brother had killed his parents and set them on fire. He admitted to having stabbed his brother to death. The neighbour called emergency services. The offender in a halting and distracted manner told the operator what had happened. So apparently deranged was the offender’s state of mind and so frantic was he to assist his parents at the time, that at one stage he took hold of a small kitchen fire extinguisher and had to be restrained from running outside to fight the fire. He then lay on the floor in a foetal position hugging a jumper that had been brought to him. 
     
      
    6 Eventually he went out to where the fire brigade were in attendance but had to be taken away from the house in order to stop him trying to enter the building. He even tried to prevent a fireman going toward the house because he claimed there was a murderer inside. He appeared to be in a highly distressed and confused state and was comforted by neighbours until the police arrived. 
     
      
    7 When firemen were able to enter the premises they found the charred remains of the offender’s father facedown in the bedroom. An axe was near the bed. The body of the mother, also heavily burnt, was in the lounge room lying on her back. Downstairs near his bedroom was the body of Christopher unaffected by fire. He was lying on his back clothed in a short shave coat with a filleting knife propped against his body near his left hand. He had multiple stab wounds to his torso in the chest area. 
     
      
    8 The offender was taken to the police station and interviewed by investigators. There dressed only in shorts with a blanket around his shoulders the offender gave the following account almost in a whisper. He slept in a boathouse separate from the main residence. He was asleep when he heard screams from his mother over the intercom next to his bed that was connected to the lounge room of the main house. He got up put on a pair of shorts and ran up the path to the house entering through the open glass sliding door into the dining area. There he saw his brother standing over the body of his mother and about to set her on fire. His brother said that he had killed his parents and then he lit his mother’s body. 
     
      
    9 The offender walked to where his mother lay and stood there for some seconds watching the fire spread. He did not try to assist either of his parents nor did he attempt to put out the fire. Rather he walked over to where his brother had dropped the knife and picked it up. His brother, ignoring escape from the house through the open glass door some feet away from him, ran down the narrow spiral staircase that led to the lower storey of the house where he was effectively trapped. The offender caught him and stabbed him to death. He then came up the spiral stairs, notwithstanding that the fire was now raging above him and despite the fact that he could have left by a closed but unlocked door in the downstairs room. He left the house, closing the sliding door behind him, and went to the neighbour’s house. 
     
      
    10 The offender was charged with the murder of his brother, and later voluntarily went with police to the premises for the purpose of showing them what had occurred. This was video-recorded. The offender appears to be in complete control of his faculties and shows no signs of distress or agitation as he explained his version of what had taken place. During the course of the walk around the site, police pointed out to the offender that a piece had been cut from the middle of a garden hose that was connected at one end to the outside faucet with the other end under a boat on a trailer in the carport. They also indicated the cut portion of the hose near an open jerry can in which was a small amount of petrol. The offender explained that he and his father had used the hose the night before to get petrol for a boat but it was the wrong type of petrol. 
     
      
    11 The original police investigating the incident never charged the offender with the murder of his parents. He spent one month in custody in respect of the murder of his brother before being released to bail. It was a condition of his bail that he live with a neighbour who had supported him since his arrest and still supports him some 15 years later. 
     
      
    12 On 5 April 1995 the offender appeared before Mr Justice Abadee for the murder of his brother. The Crown accepted a plea of guilty to manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment. There was a statement of facts tendered that described the offender’s account of the killing as “feasible” and conceded that it could not be refuted by the investigation that had taken place. A large number of persons either gave evidence on the offender’s behalf or provided testimonials in his support. A number of those witnesses, including some of his maternal aunts, gave character evidence before the jury in his recent trials. At the time of his sentencing it was said that the whole family was behind him. The offender was placed on a good behaviour bond for a period of 5 years. 
     
      
    13 A coronial hearing later that year concluded that Christopher had killed his parents. 
     
      
    14 There the matter remained until members of the family on the father’s side had cause to withdraw their support for the offender. The reasons for that falling out are not before me in evidence and are in any event irrelevant. However, the offender’s paternal uncles came to the belief that he, and not Christopher, had killed his parents. As a result a further investigation took place and the Coroner once more reviewed the matter. In April 2000 the Coroner referred the papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions so that he could consider proceeding against the offender. The Director decided to take no further action. 
     
      
    15 In May 2001 one of the offender’s uncles commenced a private prosecution against him for two charges of murder. However, the Director took the over the prosecutions and terminated them. Despite agitation by the uncle, the Attorney General indicated he would not intervene in the matter. 
     
      
    16 In 2004 there was an inquiry into the earlier investigations and in October that year a re-investigation of the death of the parents commenced. As a result a brief of evidence was sent to the Director and on 21 February 2006 an ex-officio indictment was filed in this Court charging the offender with the murder of his parents.  
     
      
    17 The offender sought a stay of the indictment on the grounds that the trial would be oppressive, unfair or in breach of the rule against double jeopardy. On 21 March 2007 that application was refused. An appeal against that decision was dismissed on 26 November 2007 and special leave to appeal was refused by the High Court on 8 February 2008. 
     
      
    18 On 11 February 2008 a jury was empanelled to hear the trial but they were discharged on 10 April when unable to agree upon a verdict. The second trial of the offender commenced on 13 October 2008. The jury found the offender guilty of both counts of murder after deliberating for 8 days. The offender was thereafter remanded in custody where he has remained. He is on protection as a result of an assault upon him by another prisoner. 
     
      
    19 Mr Boulten SC, who has tirelessly appeared for the offender throughout the proceedings in this Court, conceded at the outset of the sentencing hearing that the real question to be determined was whether the offender should be sentenced to life imprisonment. That is the sentence that the Crown submits is the appropriate one in accordance with what is now s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That section is relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        61 Mandatory life sentences for certain offences  
         
        (1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence. 
         
        
       
      
    20 It was accepted by the parties that this section applies notwithstanding that the murders for which the offender is being sentenced occurred before the enactment of that provision. In any event that section generally reproduces the approach at common law. As the hearing proceeded, it became apparent that the real issue is whether the offender’s conduct in killing his parents was so heinous that the section should apply notwithstanding that the Court could not conclude that the offender was presently, or in the future, a danger to society such that community protection was a relevant consideration. 
     
      
    21 Although the Crown submitted that the Court should find that the offender was a potential danger, that argument was based upon an inference to be drawn from what the Crown said was the planned and horrific nature of the killings. In effect the argument was that, if the offender could decide to kill his parents in the way that he did and for whatever reason that he did, there must be a concern that he would act in the same way again if he saw the need to do so. 
     
      
    22 Yet the effect of the psychiatric evidence is that the offender does not manifest the traits of a person who has a psychopathic personality or any other personality disorder. In brief it is the opinion of the psychiatrists that a person with a severe personality disorder could not have formed and maintained the social relationships that the offender achieved both before and after the killing of his family. The offender has lived for the years since the killings as a happily married father of three children, until recently a well-respected, trusted and valued employee of the Roads and Traffic Authority and a socially engaging man with a large number of friends many of whom have remained loyal to him since his parents were killed. Dr Roberts commented upon the large number of persons who attended bail and other proceedings in respect of the killing of his brother in order to support the offender. 
     
      
    23 Dr Roberts had seen the offender in 1995 as a result of a condition imposed under the bond that the offender entered into under the sentence imposed upon him for the manslaughter of his brother. There was at that time no psychiatric or psychological condition apparent that needed to be addressed by any treatment that could be offered by Dr Roberts. The attendance by the offender on him under the terms of the bond became an empty formality. Neither Dr Roberts nor Dr Westmore could find that the offender presently suffered any mental disorder or psychiatric condition that needed treatment. Both psychiatrists are of the view that the risk of further offending of a violent nature is minimal. They both point to the fact that this was one occasion of violence, although of an extreme nature, that occurred in the offender’s life and, whatever be its cause, was specific to the circumstances that existed in 1993. 
     
      
    24 On no standard of proof could I find that the offender presents as a danger to the community or will do so in the foreseeable future. In any event, even if he were not sentenced to life imprisonment, the sentence must be of such a length that he will be well into the later part of his middle age before he is eligible for release to parole. I am unable to see how a set of circumstances might arise after his release that could result in such terrible and calculated violence as he showed on the night when he killed his parents. 
     
      
    25 But a finding that the offender is not a future danger to the community does not deny the operation of s 61 nor prohibit the imposition of a life imprisonment: Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292. The facts of the matter might still present an offence of such extreme culpability that the community’s need for retribution and punishment can only be met by a life sentence. Therefore, it is necessary for the Court to make findings as to the circumstances surrounding the murder particularly as the offender’s account to police and his evidence at the trial was contrary to the jury’s verdicts. 
     
      
    26 A matter that loomed large during the course of the hearing and is crucial to a determination of the culpability of the killings is the question of whether they were planned to any significant extent. It was the Crown’s case during the trial that the offender had been intending for some weeks prior to the killings to murder his parents. On the other hand the defence argued that the killings were frenzied attacks by a person deranged as a result of some spur of the moment emotional or psychiatric disturbance. It was put to the jury that this was more likely to be the work of Christopher than the offender. 
     
      
    27 I accept that, before I could use as an aggravating factor that these killings were planned to any significant degree, I must be satisfied of that fact beyond reasonable doubt. But I could only come to that finding on the basis of the surrounding circumstances and it is not necessary that I find each of those circumstances proved beyond reasonable doubt. For the following reasons I am satisfied to the criminal standard that the offender planned to kill his parents well before the evening of 28 August 1993 and that a significant part of that plan was that he would also kill his brother and blame him for the death of the parents. 
     
      
    28 I accept that on its face it is an outrageous proposition that a young man could, for whatever reason, embark upon a plan to kill his family and as part of that scheme admit to killing his brother under the effects of provocation. Such a plan must have envisaged an almost immediate admission to stabbing his brother to death and preparedness to accept the consequences of that admission whatever they might be. It is difficult to believe that the offender could have thought that he would escape any significant punishment for that killing even though this is in fact what occurred. This was a very powerful argument advanced by the defence at the trial to raise a doubt about the offender’s guilt. But once it is accepted that the offender did murder his parents, there is no other possible alternative arising from the facts, most of which were undisputed, than that this was indeed his plan however improbable and audacious it might seem. 
     
      
    29 Fundamental to the defence case at trial was the drawing of a comparison between the offender and his brother to the detriment of the brother and, as a result of that comparison, to ask the jury to consider who was more likely to kill the parents. Therefore, the defence painted Christopher as a troubled young man, unlucky in love and employment, socially inept and the cause of storm clouds in the otherwise sunny existence of the members of this family. His enjoyment and hopes in life were said to be diminishing as much as those of his brother were blossoming. Much of that argument was in my opinion an exaggeration of the true position. 
     
      
    30 There is no doubt that for a time some weeks before the killings Christopher had been reluctant about continuing his training as a teacher and this had caused some tension in the family because his father believed that he should persist. His mother did not hide the fact that this was worrying her and sought to have people talk to Christopher and try to encourage him. But it was not I believe the crisis that it was depicted to be in the trial. In any event any friction that there was between Christopher and his father had evaporated well before the night of their deaths. According to what the mother told her brother about a month before her death, the situation had resolved itself and Christopher had determined to continue with his teaching. Certainly when his former girlfriend saw Christopher shortly before his death she understood he was looking forward to becoming a teacher and perhaps moving to the country. 
     
      
    31 More significantly I reject any suggestion that Christopher had been aggressive to his father and had been assaulting him in the weeks leading up to the killings. Such behaviour was in my opinion completely foreign to his character as described by those who knew him best and are still alive, particularly his former girlfriend who still spoke of him with a genuine affection. He was described as a gentle person without the slightest suggestion of hostility in his character to anyone or about anything. The only suggestion that Christopher was ever aggressive to anyone, let alone his father, came from the offender. I do not believe that either of his parents would have put up with such behaviour. Yet the offender, on his account stood by while this aggressive conduct towards his father took place without once intervening or even attempting to find out what the conflict was about. The offender told police he thought the arguments were about money. He also told Mr Nolan that he thought the trouble was about money and that Christopher wanted a motor vehicle. But this was nonsense as his brother had more money than the offender. He rarely drove the family vehicle even when he could have done so. Everyone knew that Christopher would not drive at night because both he and his mother believed that it was dangerous for him to do so as a result of impairment to his vision.  
     
      
    32 Further the offender on the very afternoon before the killings told his friend Mr Nolan that he had to get home because he was concerned about what might happen when his father returned from playing golf and was confronted by his brother. Later that evening, when seeing his girlfriend off the property, the offender said to her: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “What am I going to do about my brother? It’s pretty serious, Hayley. I’ve never seen him so psycho. He’s pushing my father around. I don’t know what to do.” 
        
       
       
      In my opinion this was not a case of the offender having some sort of premonition of the dreadful events of the next morning, but rather he was confirming the groundwork for the story that he had invented to explain the killing of his parents and his brother. 
       
      
    33 This invention had in fact commenced some weeks earlier when the offender first started expressing his concerns about Christopher’s behaviour to Mr Nolan and his girlfriend, the persons chosen by him to support the truly wicked deception that his brother was to become a homicidal maniac. I believe that the telephone conversation that his girlfriend related in which the offender is describing Christopher’s behaviour about three weeks before the killing was a complete fabrication by him. Anyone who hears the account of that conversation knowing that the offender was in fact the person who killed his parents and falsely blamed his brother could not have any doubt that it was part of a plan to give authenticity to his later account of the killings. 
     
      
    34 There is no reasonable possibility that the killings were a spur of the moment reaction to some unknown emotional or psychiatric disturbance that came upon the offender in the early hours of the morning of 28 August. I have no doubt that the Crown’s scenario placed before the jury contains the true account of what occurred. Having decided to kill his parents that evening, the offender met with Mr Nolan and expressed his concerns about his brother’s behaviour. He used the surprise visit of his girlfriend to carry the story forward. I think it highly likely that that at some stage he removed Christopher’s glasses to put him at a disadvantage. Shortly before the killings the offender undressed to avoid getting blood on his clothes. He left his clothing and shoes where he took them off in the lounge room. He obtained an axe and the knife. He first killed his father, then his mother and then Christopher. He lit the fire and waited for it to take hold. He closed the sliding door as he left the house in the belief that it would either help the fire’s spread or hide it from the neighbours. He more than likely washed himself before he went to the neighbours to raise the alarm and perform his extraordinary charade. 
     
      
    35 At some time that morning he attempted to siphon petrol from one of the motor vehicles in order to accelerate the fire. Being unable to do so successfully, he looked for some other means and found the mineral turpentine. It does not matter whether this took place before or after the killings, as it is inconsistent with the offender having killed his parents in some maniacal episode.  
     
      
    36 He also at some time that evening placed the items found in the clothesbasket in the downstairs bathroom. These were a syringe filled with Panadol paste and the objects used to prepare that paste. I told the jury that they should ignore that evidence as it was inexplicable and could not indicate who might have been the killer of the parents. But once it is accepted that the offender was that person, there is no reasonable possibility that his brother prepared those objects. I believe that this was part of the scenario manufactured by the offender to paint Christopher as deranged. I also believe that this explains the frenzied nature of the killings of the parents. 
     
      
    37 The offender is a consummate liar and a brilliant actor. He even managed a few tears for his parents when giving evidence in the first trial. Yet one of his lies eventually helped to bring him undone. His explanation about the cut hose and siphoning petrol was patently untrue even without the evidence given by a fireman of the offender smelling of petrol at the time of the fire. The suggestion that his father would have been a party to siphoning petrol in the late hours of the evening before his death was absurd. 
     
      
    38 But the offender so believed in his powers of deception that there was a cocky arrogance in his manner especially during the second trial. This was particularly apparent when he was giving evidence and tried to joust with the prosecutor. It is borne out by the fact that, as he told Dr Westmore, he never contemplated being convicted. He apparently believes the jury acted on suspicion rather than the evidence. This is self-deception because on any view there was ample evidence to support the jury’s verdicts. 
     
      
    39 Therefore the offender is to be sentenced on the basis that he conceived a plan to kill his parents some weeks before the event and set about constructing evidence to hide his guilt. The plan involved the death of his brother in circumstances in which Christopher would be blamed for the killings and the offender would be pitied as a loving son who reacted in an extraordinary fashion to the scene of horror that confronted him on entering the house. And it was an awful killing that he planned. He inflicted 29 knife wounds upon his father in taking his life. It may well be that the sounds Ms Shaw heard were the guttural death throes of his father. That is what she was trying to explain by likening it to the sound made by the person she had witnessed struck by lightening. The axe was at hand in case the knife failed. 
     
      
    40 Then the offender turned to his mother. She no doubt witnessed the killing of her husband. She was heard trying to reason with her killer but to no avail. She was stabbed 17 times and had the most horrible defence wounds so that she must have suffered in excruciating agony as she hopelessly tried to defend herself from her son. And then Chris was knifed to death with 17 stab wounds but I should say no more about his horrific death. 
     
      
    41 The Crown submitted that I should find that the offender murdered his parents in order to obtain their estate. There is no evidence before me to support that inference. The Crown sought to prove a motive of that kind at the first trial but ultimately it failed to do so to any degree of proof. It did not attempt to lead any evidence at the retrial to support that allegation and there was nothing placed before me at the sentencing hearing. I do not know what caused the offender to decide to kill his family. But there is no mitigation simply because there is no evidence of a motive that might be considered as a matter of aggravation. However, as I have already indicated, whatever the motive, this was not a decision made on the spur of the moment. 
     
      
    42 There is nothing in the offender’s personal circumstances that would mitigate the offences except for one matter relied upon by Mr Boulten. It was submitted that the delay of 15 years from the killings to the convictions is a matter that should be taken into account. Reliance is placed upon the course adopted by Mr Justice Barr in sentencing Gordon Wood. In that case there was a delay of about 10 years. His Honour took into account a period of 9 years in which the investigation languished and during which Mr Wood had set up a new life in England. Barr J concluded that the delay was due to the police investigation and not the fact that Mr Wood had initially told police that the deceased had committed suicide.  
     
      
    43 In the present case the initial police investigation of the killing of his parents was less than satisfactory. Notwithstanding that the investigating police expressed their incredulity with the version of the facts given by the offender in their interview with him, they appear to have quickly accepted that they could not prove its falsity. It is noteworthy that they never charged the offender with the murder of his parents. 
     
      
    44 The decision of the prosecutor to accept the plea to manslaughter in 1995 seems difficult to understand in light of the evidence placed before the jury in 2007 even though almost all of it was available in 1993. But that decision has to be seen in context. The whole of the offender’s extended family were supportive of him and convinced of his innocence at that time. There was in effect nobody to contradict the offender’s version that his brother was the killer of his parents. Delay, thereafter, was completely understandable as the Director stood by the decision made in 1995. 
     
      
    45 Therefore, unlike the position before Barr J, the delay in the prosecution was not due to police or prosecutor incompetence. The offender was so convincing in his behaviour and so unlikely to have killed his doting parents that initially he fooled everybody by his conduct and his extraordinary account of the events of the night. It can be easily understood that the police and prosecutor found it impossible to believe that he could have come up with such a plan to kill his family as has now been uncovered, so audacious, cunning and evil was it. In effect the offender succeeded in what he had set out to do, that is admit to the killing of his brother to mask the fact that he himself had killed his parents.  
     
      
    46 True it is that the delay has resulted in the offender rehabilitating himself. It will be the case that, because he leaves behind his wife and children, prison will be harder for him than it might have been had he been convicted of these offences in 1995 and been imprisoned as a young single man. But by his lies he was able to buy himself 15 years living as a happily married family man whereas had he been sentenced in 1995 for killing his parents that opportunity would never have arisen. Notwithstanding the attempts to bring him to justice made by his uncle, the offender never believed that he would be prosecuted let alone convicted of these offences and, therefore, he never lived with that threat hanging over him. In these circumstances I do not believe that delay or its consequences is a mitigating factor. 
     
      
    47 Although there have been cases of the murder of family members where life sentences have or have not been imposed depending upon particular facts, these cases each represent an exercise of discretion of a particular judge. They may disclose a range of sentences but they are not precedents to what a particular judge is to do in a particular case. They do not provide a guide as to when a life sentence should or should not be given. As was pointed out in Gonzales v R [2007] NSWCCA 321, there is no category of family or domestic murders. The decisions in the Court of Criminal Appeal are generally significant for the principles they lay down rather than the decision in a particular case. 
     
      
    48 In R v Twala (NSWCCA unreported 3 November 1994) the following was stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        … in order to characterise any case as being in the worst case category, it must be possible to point to particular features which are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed) 
        
       
       
      Some question has arisen as to whether this is an overstatement but it demonstrates the severity of an offence before it can justify the maximum penalty. It is clear that for the purposes of s 61 the offence must be “greatly reprehensible and extremely wicked”. 
       
      
    49 Clearly the number of murders is a relevant fact in determining whether any one murder falls within the worst category, especially where the murders occur in close proximity and arise as part of a single planned enterprise. That, of course, is the case here. These were vicious murders. I am satisfied that the manner of carrying them out was designed to simulate the actions of a demented person such as the offender was portraying his brother to be, regardless of the terror and agony such a killing would impose on the victim. The crimes were in fact coldly calculated and planned over some weeks. There was no provocation and on all accounts the parents were loving of, and committed to, the offender. The reason he killed them will never be known but it was not because of some mental aberration or extraordinary passion arising that morning. Part of his plan was setting fire to the house in order to destroy evidence of his involvement in the killings. 
     
      
    50 In my judgment the offences were in the worst category. It is not simply because he killed his parents that these offences fall into the class of heinousness that brings them within s 61. This is notwithstanding that the community is repulsed by the thought that a child could kill loving and caring parents for some reason whether explained or not. It is also the callous and brutal nature of the killings and the audacity of his plan to murder them and escape discovery. The offender cannot rely upon any mental state that might diminish the seriousness of the conduct. Nor are there any subjective matters that mitigate the offence. The fact that he is in protective custody is not of particular significance given the nature of the custody. These offences are truly heinous and justify the most serious penalty that can be imposed notwithstanding that the offender does not present as a danger to the community and is probably unlikely to reoffend in the future. 
     
      
    51 I am fully aware that were the offender not sentenced to life imprisonment, any determinate sentence would be less than might have been imposed had the offences been committed close to the present time. Sentences for murder have increased significantly since 1995. But I do not believe that there was a pattern in 1995 of not giving life sentences for domestic murders. 
     
      
    52 The offender is sentenced to life imprisonment on each of the charges of murder.

                11 March 2009 
                
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
     R v Hibberd 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Price J and, subject to what I say below, generally with his reasons.  
     
      
    2 At [56] of his judgment his Honour has noted the 1995 decision of this Court in Regina v Santos Da Silva (Court of Criminal Appeal, 30 November 1995, unreported) which purported to draw a factual distinction between non-consensual digital penetration on the one hand and, for example, penile penetration on the other, Grove J (with the agreement of Gleeson CJ and Ireland J) observing that the former was likely to be less serious than the latter. I agree with Price J that there is no canon of law that mandates a finding that digital penetration must be considered less serious than other non-consensual acts of sexual intercourse. However, the contrary has never been suggested. 
     
      
    3 At the conclusion of the hearing the Crown was asked to provide a list of authorities that touched or concerned what Grove J had said in Da Silva. That list was duly provided.  
     
      
    4 The starting point of any discussion of this issue is the fact that s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 provides for a general offence of “sexual intercourse” without consent, an expression defined in s 61H to mean, relevantly, 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) sexual connection occasioned by the penetration to any extent of the genitalia (including a surgically constructed vagina) of a female person or the anus of any person by: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) any part of the body of another person, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) any object manipulated by another person, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          except where the penetration is carried out for proper medical purposes, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) sexual connection occasioned by the introduction of any part of the penis of a person into the mouth of another person, …” 
        
       
      
    5 Identical provisions in the Criminal Code of Western Australia were considered by the High Court in Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; (1987) 163 CLR 447. At 451 [4] Mason CJ, Wilson, Brennan, Toohey and Gaudron JJ referred to the judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal in that case in which Burt CJ, with whom Smith J agreed, had observed  
     
      
       
        
        “The offence carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and as I observed in  
        Reg v Ginder  
        (1987) 23 A Crim R 1 at 3-4, ‘it is apparent that the (Code as amended) … creates one offence which embraces without distinction inter se all the identified kinds of penetration by one of another if achieved without consent’ and that it should not be supposed that for the purposes of punishment ‘one means of penetration is more heinous than another’.” 
        
       
      
    6 Their Honours in Ibbs then referred to the following further statement of Burt CJ in Ginder (at 4) where the Chief Justice said that in fixing the sentence in a particular case  
     
      
       
        
        ”…it should not be supposed that one means of sexual penetration, divorced from the circumstances, is more heinous than another. To make that distinction would, I think, be to hark back to notions which have, by the reforming Act, been abandoned.” 
        
       
      
    7 Their Honours then remarked as follows (at 451 [4]): 
     
      
       
        
        “It appears that the majority regarded the Chief Justice’s judgment in  
        Ginder  
        as stating a principle which should govern the fixing of sentences for offences of sexual assault. Although neither that judgment nor the judgments in this case suggest that the particular facts of each case are to be disregarded, the judgments appear to adopt as a sentencing principle the proposition that, ‘divorced from the circumstances’, each kind of sexual penetration as defined in s 324F [equivalent to s 61H] is neither more nor less heinous than another. That proposition cannot be accepted. The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence of sexual assault is reserved for the worst type of case falling within s 324D [equivalent to s 61I] … The maximum penalty is not prescribed as an appropriate penalty for the worst type of case falling in each of the respective categories of sexual penetration described in s 342F.”  
        
       
      
    8 Their Honours then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The inclusion of several categories of sexual penetration within the offence described as sexual assault carries no implication that each category of sexual penetration is as heinous as another if done without consent.  
        When an offence is defined to include any of several categories of conduct, the heinousness of the conduct in a particular case depends not on the statute defining the offence but on the facts of the case. In a case of sexual assault, a sentencing judge has to consider whether the facts of the particular case lie in a spectrum at one end of which lies the worst case of sexual assault perpetrated by any act which constitutes sexual penetration as defined 
        .” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    9 In R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575, Simpson J with whom, relevantly, Adams and Howie JJ agreed, referred (at 582 [22]) to the passage from Ibbs to which I have referred at [8] above and, at 582 [23], cited the following observations of Woods CJ at CL in R v Davis [1999] NSWCCA 15 at [66]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        Ibbs v The Queen  
        … the High Court rejected the proposition that each kind of sexual penetration as defined in the section, there under consideration, was to be regarded as neither more nor less heinous than another. The Court said that such a proposition cannot be accepted. It appears to me that any other view would beggar common sense, and that penile/vaginal penetration of a child is significantly more serious than many of the other forms of conduct encompassed within s 66A [which provides that any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is under the age of 10 years should be liable to imprisonment for 25 years].” 
        
       
      
    10 Simpson J then continued in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “24 It might be true, as senior counsel suggested, that penile/vaginal intercourse would, in the circumstances, have amounted to a more serious offence. But does that avail the respondent? Let it be supposed that his Honour had not excluded as irrelevant the nature of the sexual activity in question. It is difficult to think that that of itself would have led him to the conclusion that the offence was of something less than mid range gravity.  
        It is not possible to create some kind of hierarchy of the seriousness of the various kinds of sexual intercourse contemplated by s66A (and defined in s61H). It is the facts and circumstances of each case, including the nature of the intercourse, that enables the proper evaluation of objective seriousness 
        . While penile/vaginal penetration might be taken to be more serious than enforced fellatio, that does not mean that enforced fellatio necessarily falls somewhere below the mid point of objective seriousness. There are many instances of conduct that come within the definition of sexual intercourse that would be significantly less serious than enforced fellatio. ... 
        
       
       
        
        25 Other appropriate areas of inquiry in the consideration of the objective seriousness of a s66A offence are, for example, how the offences took place, over what period of time, with what degree of force or coercion, the use of threats or pressure before or after the offence to ensure the victim’s compliance with the demands made, and subsequent silence, and any immediately apparent effect on the victim. ...” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    11 It is to be noted that Grove J in Da Silva did not refer to Ibbs as support for his statement that he generally agreed that it was likely that digital penetration is less serious than, for example, penile penetration. Nor was that decision called in aid by Studdert J, with whom Smart AJ agreed, in R v O’Brien [2002] NSWCCA 102 where his Honour observed (at [16]) that digital penetration, although not to be treated lightly, “is not treated as seriously as penile penetration”. 
     
      
    12 Nor was Ibbs referred to by Sully J, with whom, relevantly, Hidden and Hall JJ agreed, in Regina v O [2005] NSWCCA 327 where his Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “32. I would accept that, as a general proposition, an act of digital penetration, as such, is less serious than an act of penile penetration as such. I do not agree, however, that such a general proposition is, more or less as of course, a proposition of universal applicability in cases of digital penetration. One only has to read the victim impact statement of KW and JS to see at once how damaging to a particular victim an act of digital penetration, let alone more than a single such act, can be to a very young child. 
        
       
       
        
        33. I would at once agree that the acts of digital penetration are not properly to be regarded as the worst types of sexual intercourse on a scale of statutory penalties that peaks at a sentence of imprisonment for 20 years. That said, however, I do not agree that the offences here relevant are to be treated as though they were more or less trifling offences. They were in my opinion, nothing of the kind. They were, for the reasons earlier herein explained, in my opinion offences of significant objective criminality.” 
        
       
      
    13 I would refer to two further authorities. The first is R v Gebrail (Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 November 1994, unreported), where Mahoney JA, with whom Newman and James JJ agreed, in a case involving digital penetration of a female adult, observed:  
     
      
       
        
        “As I have indicated, every offence of this kind is a serious offence. But those whose duty it is to deal with crimes of this kind and to sentence those who commit them know that though each case is inherently serious, some are more serious than others. In some cases, the degree of violence, the physical hurt inflicted, the form of forced intercourse and the circumstances of humiliation and otherwise, are much greater than are involved in this case. It is to be understood that in sentencing it is appropriate – indeed in most cases it is necessary – that the sentencing judge form and record his assessment, of where, on the relevant scale of seriousness, the particular offence lies.” 
        
       
      
    14 The second is R v O’Donnell (Court of Criminal Appeal, 1 July 1994, unreported), a case of anal penetration of a child under 10. In that case the sentencing judge was asked to take into account five additional offences, one or more of which involved fellatio with a young child. In that context Hunt CJ at CL with whom, relevantly, Simpson J agreed, remarked: 
     
      
       
        
        “When I read the evidence and then turned to the sentences which were imposed, I was struck by their severity notwithstanding the quite horrible circumstances of the offences themselves. My next step was to read the judge’s remarks on sentence to see where the explanation lay for that severity which, on its face, was of a crushing nature. My concern as to whether error occurred arose from the absence of any express recognition in the remarks of the judge of the principle – applicable where different crimes of sexual assault with varying degrees of serious are somewhat inappropriately encapsulated by the Legislature within the single definition of sexual intercourse – that the seriousness of the conduct in a particular case depends not upon the description of sexual intercourse as defined but upon the facts of that case, and that the maximum penalty prescribed for all such offences is not appropriate in relation to those offences of a less serious nature. That is the principle stated by the High Court in  
        Ibbs  
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Fellatio, in my opinion, is clearly less criminal than, say, anal or vaginal penetration. That is a distinction of vital importance in this case …” 
        
       
      
    15 The critical part of the judgment in Ibbs to which I have referred at [8] above is that part which I have emphasised. True, their Honours rejected the proposition that each kind of sexual penetration as defined in s 61H of the Crimes Act is to be regarded as neither more nor less heinous than another. But this was because, as the High Court pointed out, such a proposition cannot be “divorced from the circumstances”. As Simpson J observed in AJP (at [24]), it might be the case that penile/vaginal intercourse would have amounted to a more serious offence “in the circumstances”.  
     
      
    16 Further, as Mahoney JA observed in Gebrail, although each form of sexual intercourse as defined in s 61H is inherently serious, some are more serious than others depending on the circumstances to which his Honour referred. In taking into account the objective seriousness of a particular offence, a number of factors are relevant including, of course, the form of forced intercourse. 
     
      
    17 Nor do I understand Wood CJ at CL in the passage from Davis cited by Simpson J in AJP at [23] to be saying anything different. His Honour was there dealing with penile/vaginal penetration of a child under 10 which, as a matter of common sense as his Honour observed, was significantly more serious in the case of a young child than many of the other forms of conduct encompassed within s 61H such as fellatio. That was because of the physical and emotional impact that the particular offence in the circumstances would have upon a child victim. I do not regard the learned Chief Judge as otherwise stating a general proposition of universal application.  
     
      
    18 Furthermore, although Sully J in Regina v O accepted that as a general proposition an act of digital penetration “as such” was less serious than an act of penile penetration “as such”, his Honour did not agree that such a proposition was one of universal application.  
     
      
    19 However, with respect to his Honour’s long experience in the criminal law, I consider there to be a danger in adopting, at least in the case of sexual assault upon an adult, a general proposition that an act of digital penetration, without more, is less serious than an act of penile penetration, without more. The problem is that it is never “without more”. True it is that penile penetration, contrasted with digital penetration, may carry risks to a female adult victim such as pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease. On the other hand, digital penetration has the potential to cause more physical damage than penile penetration. These are some of the many factors which are required to be taken into account when determining the objective seriousness of the offending act and the point on the scale of seriousness where that act should be placed. 
     
      
    20 My point is that any notion that one particular form of penetration may generally be regarded as more or less serious than another form should be rejected. In my view such a generalised proposition was rejected in Ibbs where their Honours emphasised that the heinousness of the conduct in a particular case depended not on the statute defining the offence but on the facts of the case. Any form of hierarchy of seriousness between the various kinds of sexual intercourse identified in s 61H was also specifically rejected by Simpson J in AJP in that part of [24] of her judgment which I have emphasised at [10] above. 
     
      
    21 In my respectful view the time has come for this Court to depart from any prima facie assumption, let alone general proposition, that digital sexual intercourse is to be regarded as generally less serious than penile sexual intercourse. If one was to accept such a proposition, then it may well be appropriate to also assert that the forced vaginal penetration in some of its more gross forms is likely to be more serious than penile penetration. As the objective seriousness of the offence is wholly dependent on the facts and circumstances of the particular case as the High Court and Simpson J emphasised in Ibbs and AJP respectively, any resort to prima facie assertions that one form of penetration is likely to be or generally will be more serious than another, is to be avoided. It can, in my view, only lead a sentencing judge to erroneously attribute more weight to the general proposition or assumption than the particular facts of the case. 
     
      
    22 It was the undue emphasis that the sentencing judge in the present case placed upon the proposition that digital penetration was to be regarded as less serious than penile penetration which, in my view, led him into error particularly with respect to Count 4. Price J at [54] of his judgment has correctly noted that the focus of his Honour’s consideration was plainly upon that form of forced intercourse. By adopting the remarks of Grove J in Da Silva the sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to the other matters referred to by Price J resulting in an erroneous finding as to the objective seriousness of the offending act. 
     
      
    23 Subject to the foregoing observations, I agree with the orders proposed by Price J. 
     
      
    24 JAMES J: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    25 I have read in draft judgment of Tobias JA. 
     
      
    26 I agree that digital sexual intercourse without consent is a serious offence and that there is no rule that it is necessarily less serious than penile sexual intercourse without consent. 
     
      
    27 I would like to reserve my position on whether this Court should now depart from statements made in previous cases to the effect that generally an act of digital penetration is likely to be less serious than an offence of penile penetration.  
     
      
    28 The point was not fully or even adequately argued before this Court. No submission was made by the Crown in its written submissions that it is an error to regard digital sexual intercourse as being generally less serious than penile sexual intercourse. The point was raised, for the first time, by the presiding judge in the course of the oral hearing. It was apparent that neither counsel had come to court prepared to argue the point and the court did not receive much assistance from counsel. 29 PRICE J: This is a Crown appeal against the manifest inadequacy of sentences imposed upon the respondent in the District Court. 
     
      
    30 The respondent had pleaded not guilty to seven counts on an indictment but was found guilty by a jury on each count. On 20 March 2008 the sentencing Judge imposed the following sentences: 
     
      
    · Count 1 (an offence of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900) to a term of imprisonment of 5 years consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months commencing on 23 July 2006 and expiring on 22 January 2010 with a balance of term of 1 year 6 months commencing on 23 January 2010 and expiring on 22 July 2011. 
     
      
    · Count 2 (an offence of common assault contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act) to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months commencing on 23 July 2006 and expiring on 22 January 2007. 
     
      
    · Count 3 (an offence of common assault contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act) to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months commencing on 23 July 2006 and expiring on 22 January 2007. 
     
      
    · Count 4 (an offence of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act) to imprisonment for a term of 6 years consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months commencing on 23 July 2009 and expiring on 22 April 2013 with a balance of term of 2 years 3 months commencing on 23 April 2013 and expiring on 22 July 2015. 
     
      
    · Count 5 (an offence on common assault contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act) to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months commencing on 23 July 2009 and expiring 22 January 2010. 
     
      
    · Count 6 (an offence of common assault contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act) to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months commencing on 23 July 2009 and expiring on 22 January 2010. 
     
      
    · Count 7 (an offence of indecent assault contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act) to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 23 July 2009 and expiring on 22 July 2010. 
     
      
    31 During the proceedings on sentence a related offence involving a breach of an apprehended domestic violence order was listed for sentence before the sentencing Judge pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1985. This was an offence contrary to s 562I(1) of the Crimes Act. The respondent was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months commencing on 23 July 2006 and expiring on 22 January 2007 for this offence. 
     
      
    32 The overall sentence which was imposed as a result of partial accumulation and concurrence was a term of 9 years consisting of a non-parole period of 6 years 9 months commencing on 23 July 2006 and expiring on 22 April 2013 with a balance of term of 2 years 3 months commencing on 23 April 2013 and expiring 22 July 2015. 
     
      
    33 The earliest date the respondent is eligible for release to parole is 22 April 2013. 
     
      
    34 An offence contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act is punishable by 14 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 7 years applies. An offence contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act is punishable by 5 years imprisonment whereas an offence contrary to s 61 is punishable by 2 years imprisonment. The standard non-parole period provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 do not apply to these offences nor do they apply to an offence contrary to s 562I(1) of the Crimes Act which attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 2 years and/or a fine of $5500. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    35 The sentencing Judge found that the jury accepted the complainant’s evidence and the facts may be stated in accordance with his Honour’s findings. 
     
      
    36 The complainant first met the respondent in 2005 when she was 16 years old. The respondent was then about forty-one. A de facto relationship between them commenced when the complainant was seventeen. 
     
      
       
      Count 1: On 9 May 2006 the respondent woke the complainant and repeatedly asked for sex, which she declined. She told him that she could not have sex in case it brought on labour. The complainant was in the eighth month of pregnancy. Despite her refusal the respondent forced the complainant’s legs apart and inserted at least one finger into her vagina. She described a scratching sensation and stinging pain in her vagina. The respondent called her a slut and accused her of “fucking around” saying that he knew that she had “shagged someone”. He told her to get into the shower. 
       
       
      Count 2: Whilst the complainant was in the shower the respondent jumped into the shower and again accused her of “shagging someone”. When she denied any infidelity, the respondent hit her around the head, pushed her down and then pulled her back up by the hair, bashing the side of her face with either his fist or elbow. 
       
       
      Count 3: After getting out of the shower the complainant made the respondent a cup of coffee. He then hit her on the head with his fist. 
       
       
      Count 4: On 10 May 2006 the respondent woke the complainant and accused her of “fucking someone”. The respondent said to her, “let me shove it in you.” He was told by the complainant, “I can’t in case I go into labour.” The respondent said, “You’re lying.” She said the respondent shoved his fingers up her vagina and said, “Someone else’s cum is up there.” The complainant said that she kept on telling him to stop and felt pain in her vagina. She said that “his hand was up there”, she tried to remove his hand but he would not remove it. When she tried to scream, the respondent shoved her head into the pillow, telling her to shut up. She felt strong pain in her vagina and following the incident saw blood on the bed. The sentencing Judge referred to the evidence given by Dr Holland, the obstetric and gynaecological registrar at Gosford Hospital, that on examination she observed that the complainant’s labia appeared slightly swollen and bloodstained mucous was observed at the introitus. There was also complaint of vaginal pain. Dr Holland testified that the complaints of vaginal pain and bleeding were not normal during pregnancy. Dr Holland said that the swelling of the labia and bleeding was consistent with having a fist inserted into the vagina. 
       
       
      Following a review of the whole of the evidence the sentencing Judge found that he could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent had inserted his whole hand or fist into the complainant’s vagina. His Honour was satisfied that the respondent had inserted “at least three fingers into the complainant’s vagina making it a more serious sexual assault than the offence in count 1, bearing in mind also that some injury was occasioned to the complainant’s vagina, causing bleeding to occur”. 
       
       
      Count 5: After having a shower the complainant returned to bed. The respondent again accused her of having sex with someone. He tried to force her legs apart and slapped her, hitting her on the head. 
       
       
      Count 6: On 11 May 2006 the complainant was woken up by the respondent who accused her of “shagging someone”, slapped her, pulled the pillow from under her head, put it on her face so she could not scream and at the same time had his forearm on her neck so that she was choking and had difficulty breathing. 
       
       
      Count 7: The respondent called the complainant a “dirty slut” and urinated on her saying at the same time “take that”. This was in effect, the sentencing Judge said, a continuation of the assault in count 6. 
       
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    37 Evidence of the respondent’s subjective circumstances was put before the sentencing Judge by way of a Probation and Parole report dated 13 August 2007 and two character testimonials. The respondent did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. 
     
      
    38 The respondent was born on 30 July 1964 and at the time of sentence was aged 43 years. He was the middle of five children whose parents separated when he was about 12 years old. He left school in year 10 and after working in a number of labouring positions, secured stable employment with the electricity commission as a fitter, rigger and welder where he worked for 13 years. Since 2003 he had been working as a strapper in the horse racing industry. The respondent told Ms Ellen, the author of the Probation and Parole report, that he started smoking cannabis when about 14 years of age and claimed that he had stopped completely in about 2004. He had also used amphetamines (speed) but claimed to have ceased altogether in 2004. Ms Ellen noted from the custody records that the respondent tested positive to cannabis on 7 November 2006. The respondent denied smoking cannabis stating that he may have tested positive as a result of breathing in his cell mate’s cannabis smoke as his cell mate was a chronic cannabis smoker or the cannabis could still be in his system. The sentencing Judge remarked that the respondent had not given evidence during the sentence hearing and rejected these explanations. 
     
      
    39 Ms Ellen noted that the respondent maintained his innocence and claimed that the complainant had consented to his sexual advances. He denied any wrongdoing or violence within his relationship with her. Ms Ellen opined that he appeared to be in denial and his presenting issues were anger management and illicit drug use. 
     
      
    40 During the trial the respondent had given evidence in which he denied the allegations of assault and indecent assault. He had testified that no sexual intercourse took place on 9 May 2006 at all, that the sexual intercourse in respect of count 4 was consensual and involved the use of three fingers and that consensual penile vaginal sexual intercourse took place on 10 May 2006. 
     
      
    41 The respondent has eight children, including a one-year old child, (at the time of the report) to the complainant. Ms Ellen stated that the respondent remained in a relationship with the complainant who had visited him regularly whilst he was in custody. The sentencing Judge noted that the complainant had been a reluctant witness who despite her evidence remained supportive of the respondent. His Honour described the complainant as being “a fairly unsophisticated young woman from an unfortunate background which included periods of homelessness during which she resided in refuges”. (ROS at 2) 
     
      
    42 At the time of the commission of the offences the respondent was on bail in relation to charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and stalking which were ultimately withdrawn by the complainant. The sentencing Judge found that the respondent’s breach of conditional liberty was a factor of aggravation regardless of whether or not the charges were ultimately dismissed. 
     
      
    43 As to the respondent’s prior criminal history the sentencing Judge noted that he had multiple offences involving violence which included three offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and three offences of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order which were committed between November 2001 and March 2002. For these offences he had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment. He had also been sentenced on 3 June 2003 to imprisonment for 3 months for his failure to comply with the terms of a good behaviour bond and to 12 months imprisonment for common assault, a non-parole period of 5 months 6 days being set. His Honour remarked that the respondent’s record demonstrated “a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law with a disturbing number of offences involving violence and breaches of apprehended domestic violence orders”. The current offences, his Honour said, represented a continuation of the respondent’s disposition towards violent behaviour and in particular behaviour towards those with whom he had a domestic relationship. Considerations of deterrence and protection of the community were, his Honour said, of importance and would be taken into account when determining sentence. 
     
      
    44 The sentencing Judge accepted that the offences were spontaneous and to that extent a mitigating factor. His Honour did not regard the relationship between the respondent and the complainant as a mitigating or an aggravating factor so far as the objective seriousness of the offences was concerned. 
     
      
       
      Dealing with the appeal 
       
      
    45 Counsel for the respondent reminded this Court that it is not sufficient that an appellate court would have imposed a more severe sentence: R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67 at 78. It was submitted that, even if it could be established that the sentence was to some degree lenient, this was not a case where the Court would interfere with the sentencing Judge’s wide discretion. 
     
      
    46 The principles that apply to the determination of Crown appeals against sentence were summarised by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]:  
     
      
       
        
        “…it is important to note the principles which apply in relation to the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence:  
         
         
        (a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
        House v The King 
         (1936) 55 CLR 499, applies to Crown appeals against sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion, as to the appropriate sentence, for that of the sentencing judge:  
        Lowndes v The Queen 
         (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown;  
        R v Tait 
         (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 58 and 109. 
         
         
        (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
        Malvaso v The Queen 
         (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere:  
        R v Baker 
         [2000] NSWCCA 85 
         
         
        (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle “ 
        for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons 
        ”: per Barwick CJ in  
        Griffiths v The Queen  
        (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
        Everett v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299;  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        (2000) 202 CLR 32, at paras 61 and 62, and  
        Wong & Leung v The Queen 
         at para 109. 
         
         
        (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
        R v Allpass 
         (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
        R v Papazis 
         (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         at para 110. 
         
         
        (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
        R v Holder and Johnston 
         (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         at para 62.” 
        
       
      
    47 Although the Crown relies on the sole ground of manifest inadequacy, the Crown submitted that there were a number of individual errors made by the sentencing Judge. 
     
      
    48 It was first contended that the sentence imposed for count 1 was manifestly inadequate. The Crown complained that his Honour had substantially failed to expose the reasoning behind the determination of the relative objective seriousness of the offence and the extent of departure from the middle of the range was not articulated. The Crown submitted that the circumstances of the offence required a finding that the offence was only marginally below the middle range of objective seriousness and the non-parole period of 3 years 6 months was so much less than the standard non-parole period of 7 years so as to be manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    49 In written submissions to the sentencing Judge the Crown had contended that count 1 fell below the middle range of objective seriousness having regard to the following matters: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) the offence involved an act of digital penetration; 
        
       
       
       (ii) the complainant was eight months pregnant; 
       
       
       (iii) the act caused pain; and 
       
       
       (iv) the nature and extent of force used. 
       
      
    50 The sentencing Judge in his remarks on sentence expressly referred to these submissions and to various decisions of this Court which the Crown had brought to his attention concerning offences of violent attacks in domestic settings. His Honour then said (ROS at 14): 
     
      
       
        
        “Having considered all the circumstances, I am of the view that the offence in count 1 falls below the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of this nature, particularly having regard to the fact that the offence involved digital penetration rather than penile vaginal penetration.” 
        
       
      
    51 His Honour’s determination was in accordance with the submissions that had been made to him by the Crown. The Crown argued in this Court that the circumstances of the offence in count 1 required a finding that the offence was only marginally below the middle range of objective seriousness having regard to the circumstances that the offence involved: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) digital/vaginal penetration accompanied by abusive language and forceful overpowering the attempts by the complainant to resist the penetration; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) occurred in the course of personally degrading and abusive remarks that accompanied overbearing demands for sexual intercourse from a domestic partner; 
        
       
       
       (iii) the complainant was eight months pregnant at the time. 
       
      
    52 The respondent submitted that his Honour had comprehensively taken into account every relevant consideration in determining whether in his discretion it would be appropriate in the circumstances of count 1 to depart from the standard non-parole period and had recorded his reasons for doing so. His Honour in particular made it clear that he placed particular weight on the fact that the offence involved digital penetration rather than penile penetration in his determination that the offence fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    53 The sentencing Judge was obliged to consider where the offence lay on the scale of objective seriousness: R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. 
     
      
    54 A determination of where the subject offence lies on the scale of seriousness of an offence of its type is essentially one of fact and as such is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The Queen (1936) 55 CLR 499. As was said by Simpson J in R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 140 at [36]: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the Crown to succeed on this aspect of the appeal, it is necessary that it establish that the finding, which is essentially one of fact, was not open to his Honour. The finding, being an evaluation, is akin to an exercise of discretion and may only be held to be wrong if it can be shown that some wrong principle was applied, or irrelevant consideration taken into account (or a relevant consideration overlooked) or that the finding itself simply was not open on the evidence: House v The King…” 
        
       
      
    55 The definition of “sexual intercourse” is found within s 61H(1) of the Crimes Act and includes conduct which extends beyond what is ordinarily understood by that expression. The “heinousness” of the offending conduct depends on the facts of the case and not on the statute defining the offence: Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447; R v Allpass (1994) 72 A Crim R 561.56 Relevant considerations in determining where on the scale of seriousness an offence contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act lies include “the degree of violence, the physical hurt inflicted, the form of forced intercourse and the circumstances of humiliation…” See Regina v Gebrail (Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 November 1994, unreported) per Mahoney JA at 10-11. To those matters I would add the duration of the offence. Non-consensual sexual intercourse by digital penetration has generally been considered to be less serious than an offence of penile penetration: see, for example, Regina v Santos Da Silva (Court of Criminal Appeal, 30 November 1995, unreported) per Grove J at 3, but each case will depend on its own facts. There is no canon of law which mandates a finding that digital penetration must be considered less serious than other non-consensual acts of sexual intercourse. Whilst the form of the forced intercourse is an important factor it is not to be regarded as the sole consideration. 57 It is evident from his Honour’s sentencing remarks that the principal basis of his determination that the offence fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness was that it involved digital penetration rather than penile vaginal penetration. His Honour had earlier in his sentencing remarks referred to the circumstances of aggravation and of mitigation that were present. Although the complainant was eight months pregnant, the forced intercourse was of short duration and involved the use of a single finger. Whilst accompanied by abusive and personally degrading language, the violence employed was of a low level and the physical hurt inflicted was slight. I am not persuaded having regard to all the circumstances of the offence that the sentencing Judge’s characterisation of the offence as falling below the middle range of seriousness was not open to his Honour nor am I persuaded that the reasons provided were inadequate. His Honour further found special circumstances justifying an adjustment to the statutory ratio. There has been a proper evaluation, to my mind, of the respondent’s criminality by the sentencing Judge for count 1 and the sentence of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months was appropriate to the gravity of that crime.58 The Crown further contended that the sentence imposed on count 4 was manifestly inadequate. Counts 1 and 4 were, as I have earlier detailed, offences contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act attracting a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The sentence for count 4 imposed by the sentencing Judge was a term of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months.59 The Crown was critical of the sentencing Judge’s determination that the offence was “slightly below the mid-range” and argued that the circumstances of the offence required a finding that the offence was in the middle range of objective seriousness. The Crown said that the penetration was with three fingers and occasioned bleeding to the complainant who was eight months pregnant and was accompanied by abusive and personally degrading remarks and forceful overpowering of the attempts by the complainant to resist. The Crown further submitted that his Honour had failed to provide adequate reasons for the determination of objective seriousness and for the extent of departure from the middle of the range. It was argued that the non-parole period imposed was so much less than the standard non-parole period as to be manifestly inadequate even for an offence having the relative objective seriousness of “slightly below the mid-range” as found by the sentencing Judge and more so for an offence in the middle of the range. The factual finding by his Honour that the whole hand or fist had not been used was not challenged.60 The respondent submitted that whilst his Honour acknowledged that this offence was more serious than count 1 as it involved three fingers rather than one, the fact that it was still a case of digital rather than penile sexual assault was a reasonable basis for determining that it fell below the mid-range of offence. His Honour, it was said, was a very experienced sentencing Judge who was in an ideal position to assess the degree of force used in the commission of the offence, and to make a comparative assessment of objective criminality against the full range of such offences coming before the courts. The head sentence of 6 years which was a full year longer than count 1 and the non-parole period of 3 years 9 months, the respondent argued, was not demonstrably inadequate.61 Both the Crown and the respondent referred in this Court to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics. More than the usual cautions should be borne in mind in having regard to the statistics for offences contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act because of the wide range of conduct embraced in the definition of “sexual intercourse”. In this area careful attention is to be paid to the different facts of each offence. 
     
      
    62 In written submissions to the sentencing Judge the Crown had contended that count 4 fell within the middle of the range of objective seriousness having regard to the following matters:  
     
      
       
        
        (i) the offence involved an act of digital penetration and penetration by the hand; 
         
        (ii) the complainant was eight months pregnant; 
        
       
      
    (iii) the act caused pain and bleeding; and (iv) the nature and extent of force used. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    63 The sentencing Judge recited these submissions in his remarks on sentence, but as I have previously recounted, was not satisfied that the whole hand or fist had been used in the commission of the offence. His Honour was satisfied that at least three fingers had been inserted making it a more serious offence than count 1, bearing in mind that some injury was occasioned to the complainant’s vagina. His Honour said (ROS at 16): 
     
      
       
        
        “As mentioned, I am not satisfied that the act of digital penetration was achieved by the offender inserting his whole hand. The question then to resolved is whether the circumstances of this offence is elevated to mid-range or above by the offender using three fingers to commit the offence. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I am of the view that the offence can still be categorised as one involving digital penetration, placing it in the less serious category. That is not to say that such acts cannot fall in the mid-range or above if the court was satisfied that a fist or a whole hand was used in the commission of the offence, or other aggravating circumstances. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Taking all those circumstances into account I am of the view that the offence, although more serious than the offence in count1 is  
        slightly 
          
        below  
        the mid-range for offences of that nature. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Accordingly, I do not regard the matter as appropriate for the imposition of the standard non-parole period, but again take into consideration as a benchmark or guidepost to determine the appropriate sentence.” 
        
       
      
    64 Unlike this Court the sentencing Judge had the particular advantage of seeing and hearing the complainant giving evidence during the trial and was in a strong position to assess the objective seriousness of the offence. This Court would ordinarily respect that advantage unless it appears in the circumstances of this appeal that wrong principle may have been applied or a relevant consideration overlooked. During argument in this appeal attention was directed to the following passage within his Honour’s remarks quoted at [51] above: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am of the view that the offence can still be categorised as one involving digital penetration, placing it in the less serious category.”  
        (italics added) 
         
        
       
      
    65 Should his Honour’s understanding have been that a finding of digital penetration required as a matter of law the characterisation of the offence as being in the less serious category then, as I have explained at [56], wrong principle was applied. I am, however, not persuaded that this was the case as his Honour went on to state: 
     
      
       
        
        “That is not to say that such acts cannot fall in the mid-range or above if the court was satisfied that a fist or whole hand was used in the commission of the offence,  
        or other aggravating circumstances…” 
          
        (italics added) 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      and specific reference had been made earlier on in the sentencing remarks to that which Grove J said in  
      Santos Da Silva 
       that [he]  
      “generally agreed with a submission that digital penetration may be considered less serious that penile penetration”.  
      (ROS at 13) 
      
    66 The focus of his Honour’s consideration was plainly upon the form of forced intercourse. The violence, however, which had accompanied the commission of this offence on a heavily pregnant woman was not to be overlooked. The respondent had ignored her entreaties to stop and resisted her attempts to remove his fingers from her vagina. The offending conduct was not of short duration. When she tried to scream her head was shoved into the pillow and she was told to shut up. Whilst his Honour had recited the Crown submissions, in his determination of where in the scale of objective seriousness the offence lay no mention was made of the violence that had been used. In my respectful opinion his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the extent of the violence used in the commission of the offence. This offence involved the forcible insertion of at least three fingers into the vagina of a woman who was eight months pregnant and was accompanied by the violence to which I have referred. I consider the offence to be within the middle range of objective seriousness and that his Honour erred in finding otherwise.67 In any event the Crown’s criticism that the assessment by his Honour of the objective seriousness of the offence as being slightly below the mid-range did not justify the substantial departure from the standard non-parole period of 7 years to 3 years 9 months is, in my view, justified. There was little which could be said to mitigate the offence. The sole mitigating factor identified by his Honour was that the offence was spontaneous. On the other hand, the offence was committed whilst the respondent was on bail. The commission of an offence whilst on conditional liberty has long been recognised as a factor of aggravation requiring the passing of deterrent sentences for those who abuse their freedom on bail: see, for example, Regina v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at [40-42] and R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 at [48]. Furthermore, as his Honour said, the respondent’s prior criminal history of offences involving violence and breaches of apprehended domestic violence orders demonstrated “a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law”. His Honour was entitled to have regard to the respondent’s record by giving more weight to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community than would be the case if such a record did not exist: see R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; R v M.A.K. R v M.S.K. [2006] NSWCCA 381 at [51].68 This offence had been committed the day after the forced intercourse which was the subject of count 1 and called for a greater punishment than the earlier offence, if solely for reasons of personal deterrence. The non-parole period set by his Honour for count 4 was only 3 months longer than the non-parole period set for count 1. Although a finding of special circumstances was made resulting, as his Honour said (ROS at 19), in “a modest adjustment to the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term as the sentences are being partially accumulated”, the non-parole period “must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence”: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [63]. In my opinion the non-parole period of 3 years 9 months failed to do so. The sentence for count 4 was, in my view, not merely lenient but manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    69 The Crown further submitted that the sentence imposed on count 7 was manifestly inadequate. The Crown pointed to the maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment and to his Honour’s finding that the offence was in the middle of the range. This was an offence of indecent assault contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act which did not attract the standard non-parole provisions. 
     
      
    70 The offence involved the respondent urinating upon his partner, the complainant, who was then eight months pregnant. It was accompanied by personally degrading and abusive remarks. It was undoubtedly a vile act which humiliated the complainant. This Court has emphasised, as the Crown pointed out, the seriousness of the offences committed in the course of domestic relationships: see, for example, R v Jeffries [2008] NSWCCA 144; R v Hiron [2007] NSWCCA 336 at [32]. Notwithstanding all of these matters, I am not persuaded that a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment was not properly within his Honour’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    71 The respondent contended that the total effective sentence could not be considered manifestly inadequate. It was, the respondent argued, within his Honour’s discretion to commence the sentences for counts 1, 2 and 3 on 23 July 2006 as all these offences occurred on 9 May 2006. Furthermore, it was within his Honour’s discretion to commence all the sentences imposed in respect of the remaining counts on 23 July 2009 as counts 4 and 5 occurred on 10 May 2006 and counts 6 and 7 on the following day and were in effect one ongoing course of conduct. The respondent pointed out that the significant aspect of the structuring of the sentences in reflecting the totality of the criminality of all seven counts is that the second set of offences (counts 4-7 inclusive) do not commence until three years after the commencement of the first set of offences (counts 1-3 inclusive) and the second set of offences apart from 6 months accumulates upon the first set of offences. It was submitted that the degree of accumulation of the second set of offences was a particularly harsh aspect of the sentences and was an eloquent expression of the court’s denunciation of the respondent’s conduct. 
     
      
    72 The sentencing Judge was obliged (as his Honour recognised) to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation, concurrence and totality: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. 
     
      
    73 As I have indicated, the sentence imposed for count 4 was manifestly inadequate. Whilst it is true that the sentences for what have been described as the second group of offences did not commence until 23 July 2009 considerable leniency was extended by his Honour to the respondent by the concurrency of the sentences for counts 6 and 7 with the sentences for counts 4 and 5. These offences did not occur on the same day and involved separate harm and humiliation to the complainant. The overall sentence did not adequately reflect, in my respectful opinion, the totality of the respondent’s criminality and fell outside the appropriate range. 
     
      
    74 I am of the opinion that the Court should not exercise its discretion to refuse to intervene. 
     
      
       
      Re-sentencing 
       
      
    75 I have regard to the double jeopardy that the respondent has faced as a result of the Crown appeal and that the sentence to be imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the court at first instance and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range. I am of the opinion that the sentence for count 4 should be increased to a term of 7 years consisting of a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months. The overall effective sentence will be a term of 10 years consisting of a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months commencing on 23 July 2006 and expiring on 22 January 2014 and a balance of term of 2 years 6 months expiring on 22 July 2016. 
     
      
    76 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The Crown appeal against sentence be upheld. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The sentence imposed in the District Court on 20 March 2008 in respect of count 4 being an offence of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the  
        Crimes Act 
         be quashed. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) In lieu thereof the respondent in respect of count 4 is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 7 years consisting of a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months commencing on 23 July 2009 and expiring on 22 January 2014 with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months commencing on 23 January 2014 and expiring on 22 July 2016. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The sentences imposed for counts 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 are confirmed. 
        
       
       
        
        The earliest date on which the respondent will be eligible for release to parole is 22 January 2014.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for extension of time for seeking leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by James J in the Supreme Court on 23 June 2006. The application to extend time was supported by an affidavit by the applicant’s solicitor Ms Vivian Evans sworn 4 September 2008. The content of the affidavit was not challenged. Ms Abraham QC who appeared with Mr Neild for the Crown in their written submissions conceded that some explanation for the delay had been made and that the Crown had not suffered prejudice as a consequence of it, however, it was contended that leave should be refused because the merits of the challenge to sentence lacked prospects of success. Whether that is so can only be determined by consideration of the arguments for and against the grounds which have been raised. I would grant any necessary extension of time. 
     
      
    2 The applicant stood trial upon an indictment containing 13 counts, upon all of which he was found guilty by the jury. Counts 1 – 6 have, for convenience, been referred to as “the bribery offences”. Count 1 charged that on 3 December 2000 the applicant corruptly offered to give William Herbert Howard (Howard), an agent for HIH Casualty and General Insurance Limited (HIH C&G) a benefit, namely cash and employment by a company associated with the applicant, the expectation of which would tend to influence Howard to show favour to companies associated with the applicant in processing claims by them made to HIH C&G. The latter was part of a group of corporations which, for present purposes can be sufficiently referred to as HIH.  
     
      
    3 Counts 2 – 6 were in broadly similar terms relating to different dates and to varying amounts of cash given to Howard from time to time.  
     
      
    4 Counts 1 – 6 were charged as breaches of s 249B (2) of the Crimes Act 1900 which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) If any person corruptly gives or offers to give to any agent, or to any other person with the consent or at the request of any agent, any benefit: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) as an inducement or reward for or otherwise on account of the agent’s: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) doing or not doing something, or having done or not having done something; or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) showing or not showing, or having shown or not having shown, favour or disfavour to any person, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            in relation to the affairs or business of the agent’s principal; or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the receipt or any expectation of which would in any way tend to influence the agent to show, or not to show, favour or disfavour to any person in relation to the affairs or business of the agent’s principal, 
          
         
        
       
       
      the firstmentioned person is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.”  
       
      
    5 Counts 7 – 13 charged the applicant with publishing a statement to HIH C&G which he knew to be false in a material particular with intent to obtain financial advantage to companies associated with him. These were referred to as “the false statement offences”. These counts allege breaches of s 178BB (1) of the Crimes Act which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Whosoever, with intent to obtain for himself or herself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever, makes or publishes, or concurs in making or publishing, any statement (whether or not in writing) which he or she knows to be false or misleading in a material particular or which is false or misleading in a material particular and is made with reckless disregard as to whether it is true or is false or misleading in a material particular shall be liable to imprisonment for five years.” 
        
       
      
    6 The applicant was on bail until committed into custody after return of the guilty verdicts by the jury on 31 October 2005.  
     
      
    7 His Honour sentenced the applicant on 23 June 2006 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) On each of counts 7 – 10 to imprisonment for a fixed term of two years six months commencing on 31 October 2005 and expiring on 30 April 2008, the sentences to be served concurrently with each other; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) On each of counts 11 and 12 to imprisonment for a fixed term of two years commencing on 31 October 2006 and expiring on 30 October 2008 to be served concurrently with each other; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) On count 13 to imprisonment for one year six months commencing on 31 October 2007 and expiring on 30 April 2009, and 
        
       
       
        
        (d) On each of counts 1 to 6 to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years commencing on 31 October 2008 and expiring on 30 October 2010 with a balance term of three years commencing on 31 October 2010 and expiring on 30 October 2013. 
        
       
      
    8 The effective overall sentence amounted to a non-parole period of five years with a balance term of three years. Obviously the sentences on counts 7 –1 2 have now expired and the sentence on count 13 will expire shortly.  
     
      
    9 The sequence of relevant events commenced on 3 December 2000 when, pursuant to an arrangement made by the applicant, Howard met him at a hotel in Balmain. At the time Howard was Chief Investment Officer of the HIH Group of companies and the bank accounts of that group were conducted through HIH C&G. Both of them knew that the HIH Group was in a parlous financial position. The applicant offered Howard cash and a position in one of his companies if he would help to resolve claims which were being made by some of those companies which, if allowed, would be paid out through HIH C&G. Howard agreed to the proposition. Those facts were the foundation of count 1. 
     
      
    10 The other bribery offences, counts 2 – 6, arose out of a series of cash payments following that agreement. The specifications in counts 1 – 6 of the indictment did not link the promises or the payments to particular claims by the applicant’s companies. The evidence and his Honour’s charge to the jury noted an apparent relationship between some payments and some claims and as I shall mention later, a table was prepared seeking to show how payments or claims “fitted into the case”.  
     
      
    11 However, it is important to note that in relation to an element in count 1 (numbered as element 3 in a written direction provided to the jury) concerning the expectation of benefit by showing favour “in the processing of claims and demands of those companies” his Honour directed: 
     
      
       
        
        “In element 3 it would be sufficient for the Crown to prove that the expectation of the benefit offered would tend to influence Mr Howard to show favour to any company associated with the accused in the processing of any claim by that company.” 
        
       
      
    12 A similar direction was given in relation to other counts charging the bribery offences. Again in his Honour’s remarks on sentence he observed that the Crown case was that individual payments were not necessarily specifically linked to the settlement of any particular claim which Howard facilitated. 
     
      
    13 His Honour found that on 22 December 2000 at the applicant’s office in North Sydney Howard was handed an envelope containing about $20,000 which was stated to be a “Christmas present”. This fact was a constituent of count 2. 
     
      
    14 Howard was uncertain about the order of events, however, about $30,000 was transferred from a bag brought by the applicant to one belonging to Howard at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Sydney. On another occasion the applicant picked up Howard in his Ferrari motor vehicle and they drove to the Sheraton on the Park Hotel where an envelope containing about $40,000 was passed to Howard. Whatever the order, these events occurred in January and February 2001 and were constituents of counts 3 and 5.  
     
      
    15 During January 2001 Howard was holidaying at Noosa, Queensland and an innocent intermediary delivered to him an envelope from the applicant. It contained about $9,000 and related to count 4. 
     
      
    16 In March 2001 Howard called at the applicant’s residence at Balmoral where the applicant withdrew either $20,000 or $25,000 from a drawer and gave it to him. This payment was reflected by count 6. 
     
      
    17 Subject to the uncertainty about the amounts referrable to count 6, Howard received cash from the applicant totalling either about $119,000 or about $124,000. 
     
      
    18 It is necessary to sketch some background out of which the allegations comprehended in the false statement offences arose.  
     
      
    19 The applicant had had dealings with HIH through companies which he owned and controlled. One of these was Vision Publishing Pty Limited (Vision) a wholly owned subsidiary of Goodwill Group Pty Limited (Goodwill). There was also relevant contact involving the applicant emerging from the takeover of FAI Insurances by HIH in 1999. One result of the takeover was that HIH came to own a large shareholding in the applicant’s US based corporation Home Security International (HSI) which was the parent company of an Australian entity FAI Home Security Pty Limited and all of the shares in another company FAI Finance Corporation (FAI Finance) which had previously been part owned by the applicant. By December 2000 HIH had made a decision to separate itself (described as a “divorce”) from the applicant and his corporations. This involved consideration of various claims for payment by HIH and acceptance or rejection of these claims was to be considered under the guidance of Howard who was the recipient of the bribes paid by the applicant. Howard was in a position to authorize payment through HIH C&G. 
     
      
    20 One of the claims was based upon a memorandum by a consultant who was working at the time for HIH, which recorded an agreement by HIH to sponsor seminars produced by Vision in the amount of $1.2 million. No such seminars ever took place. However, in December 2000 the applicant raised with Howard a claim for payment of the $1.2 million. Howard arranged for the claim to be accepted and it was agreed that it would be satisfied by HIH discharging a debt of about $850,000 owed by Goodwill to FAI Finance and by the payment of $347,500 to Vision. These things occurred. 
     
      
    21 Thereafter, the applicant learned that the Chief Executive Officer of HIH (Williams) was unaware of the satisfaction of the claim and the applicant set about seeking to obtain a repeat payment of the claim which he knew had already been settled. 
     
      
    22 On 15 December 2000 the applicant dispatched documents bearing date 6 December 2000, one of which was a letter to Williams asserting that Vision had not been paid the $1.2 million sponsorship amount. That false statement was the foundation of count 7. 
     
      
    23 Following the dispatch of these documents there were a series of activities relative to this duplicated claim. On 20 December 2000 the applicant sent a facsimile transmission to Howard about several matters but included therein a statement “I plan to settle the $1.2 million sponsorship agreement”. As stated, that claim had already been settled and this false statement was reflected in count 8. 
     
      
    24 Sham negotiations took place between the applicant and Howard and it was purported to resolve the matter by an agreement that the applicant would receive $750,000. 
     
      
    25 On 8 January 2001 the applicant sent another facsimile transmission from Goodwill to Howard enclosing an invoice (dated 27 December 2000) in the amount of $825,000 which was said to be made up of $750,000 plus GST. It was represented that $450,000 was payable immediately and $375,000 payable within four months. It was stated that the account was “extremely overdue”. The statements in this transmission were the subject of count 9. 
     
      
    26 Howard arranged for $412,500 (one half of $825,000) to be paid forthwith. In reference to Vision’s claim, on 15 January 2001 the applicant sent Howard a memorandum which referred to “the amount of $375,000 owing by HIH to me”. This false statement was the basis of count 10. Howard responded to this demand by an immediate payment which was “discounted” to $325,000. 
     
      
    27 As a matter of history, a mutual association called Credit Reference Australia (CRA) demutualized in September 1998 allocating shares in a corporation entitled Data Advantage Limited to previous members of the association. Some of the shares were allocated in accordance with invoices by CRA over a defined period. As a result of this process, a large parcel of shares was allocated to FAI Finance and the applicant claimed that some of these should have been received by his company, FAI Home Security. 
     
      
    28 In mid January 2001 Howard flew to Hayman Island where he spoke to the applicant who was staying on the island and the subject of the Data Advantage shares was raised. Howard said that he would need documentation. On 31 January the applicant sent to Howard a facsimile of a letter bearing date 2 August 1999 which had been signed by Rodney Adler who had formerly been Chief Executive Officer of FAI Insurances. The letter stated that a large percentage of the Data Advantage shares should have been allocated in accordance with the applicant’s contention. In the covering letter to Howard the applicant described this letter as “retrieved from archives”. In fact, the applicant instigated the creation of the letter in January 2001 and Adler signed it then. The false statement that the letter had been retrieved from archives was a foundation of count 11. 
     
      
    29 That letter with other documents were forwarded to a solicitor for advice. The solicitor was unaware that the date of 2 August 1999 which it bore was not genuine and, on the assumption of regularity, he advised that as at that date FAI Home Security should have received 80 percent of the value of the allocated shares. The applicant forwarded the advice to Howard at HIH C&G thereby publishing to it the solicitor’s advice and asserting an agreement to the effect of it. There was no such agreement and that was the material false particular. However, on 14 February 2001 the claim was “settled” by Howard authorizing payment of $1 million. The publication of the false particular founded count 12.  
     
      
    30 As at February 2001 HIH held some shares (126,000) in an American company, Publicard Inc. On 23 February the applicant sent a facsimile transmission to Howard offering to buy these shares for an immediate cash payment of $163,800. No currency was specified in this offer. Enquiries suggested that these shares were valued at US$2. Arithmetically, the offer represented $1.30 (currency unstated) per share for 126,000 shares. At the time the exchange rate for an Australian dollar was about US$0.50. 
     
      
    31 Howard accepted the offer and an employee of HIH converted what was assumed to be US$163,800 and the applicant paid the converted amount of A$312,000. 
     
      
    32 The applicant realized afterwards that the value of the shares was not as high as he had thought. After this realization, on 12 March 2001 he telephoned Howard and asserted, for the first time, that his offer was A$163,800. On the following day he repeated this assertion in a facsimile transmission. He offered options of reversing the transaction and receiving a refund of A$312,000 or, alternatively, refunding the difference between that sum and A$163,800 namely A$148,200. Howard arranged payment to the applicant of the lastmentioned sum and this took place on 14 March 2001. On 15 March 2001 HIH went into provisional liquidation.  
     
      
    33 The false statement that the applicant had offered A$163,800 as distinct from US$163.800 for the Publicard Inc shares which he confirmed in the facsimile transmission after he had spoken to Howard founded count 13.  
     
      
    34 In broad summary the applicant’s criminal conduct was constituted by paying a series of bribes to an executive functionary who would, in return, authorize payments which would ultimately benefit the applicant (counts 1 – 6); four false statements in pursuit of the duplicated payment of a claim for $1.2 million for sponsorship of the seminars organized by Vision which did not take place (counts 7 – 10); two false statements relating to the value of the allocated shares in Data Advantage Limited (counts 11 and 12); and one false statement relating to the purpose of Publicard Inc shares purporting to identify the purchase price in Australian rather than US dollars (count 13).  
     
      
    35 His Honour conducted an analysis of the payments to determine whether some, or some parts, of claims would have been (legitimately) paid in any event. The details of these findings can be accepted but it is unnecessary to recapitulate them for present purposes. 
     
      
    36 As the sentences above detailed reveal, his Honour recognized the association in the conduct represented in the counts charged and it was acknowledged by counsel then appearing that the sentences should be “grouped”. His Honour as stated, made the sentences on counts 1 to 6 concurrent with each other and similarly the sentences on counts 7 to 10 and counts 11 and 12 concurrent with each other. 
     
      
    37 The notice of appeal specifies grounds as follows:

        GROUND 5 
        
       
       
        
        5. The sentences imposed on each count are manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
    38 GROUND 1 
     
      
       
      The sentencing judge erred in taking into account in assessing the objective criminality of the offences that they were committed with the intention of procuring a senior officer of HIH to commit breaches of trust. 
       
      
    39 The initial argument advanced by the applicant asserted that his Honour treated the complicity of the applicant in Howard’s breaches of trust towards his employer HIH C&G as additionally aggravating the objective criminality of his offences. Reliance was placed upon this extract from his Honour’s remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “As to paragraph (k) of s 21A(2), the prisoner did not commit any direct breach of trust in that he was not a director, an officer or an employee of HIH or of any company which was a member of the HIH group of companies. However, the prisoner was complicit in breaches of trust by Mr Howard. Mr Howard was a senior officer of HIHC &G and the prisoner offered a bribe and gave bribes to Mr Howard with the intention of procuring Mr Howard to commit breaches of trust and the prisoner’s conduct had that consequence. The knowingly false statements made by the prisoner were made with the intent of procuring or assisting Mr Howard to commit breaches of trust.” 
        
       
      
    40 Section 21A (2) (k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 specifies a possible aggravating factor that “the offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim”. The whole of s 21A (2) is governed by a general proviso that a court is not to have additional regard to one of the specified aggravating factors if it is an element of the offence. 
     
      
    41 The submission was that his Honour made an assessment in breach of that proviso. It should be noted that, prior to the remarks above quoted and relied upon by the applicant, his Honour had said explicitly in relation to s 21A (2) that the aggravating factors referred to in paragraphs (g) (substantial harm was caused) and (n) (planned or organized criminal activity) were present. He did not find that a factor as referred to in (k) was present. 
     
      
    42 The counts for the bribery offences are properly construed to charge as an element the intention to influence Howard to act in breach of the trust placed in him by his employer. It was not an element of those offences that the applicant committed a breach of trust and his Honour’s reference to s 21A (2) (k) was exclusory of that as an aggravating factor. This was consistent with his omission to mention it when specifying the factors which he did find were present which were limited to those set out in (g) and (n).  
     
      
    43 Read in context, it is apparent that his Honour was not finding that there was additional aggravation by reason of a breach of trust by the applicant but he was observing that an intention that motivated the applicant was to induce Howard to breach a trust which he owed to his employer for the purpose ultimately of advantage to the applicant. That was a circumstance relevant to the assessment of the applicant’s objective criminality. 
     
      
    44 I accept the applicant’s contention that, so far as the bribery offences are concerned the procuring of breach of trust between the agent (Howard) and his principal (HIH C&G) is an element of the offence but his Honour’s remarks do not demonstrate that he treated this as an additional factor of aggravation.  
     
      
    45 It was submitted in relation to the false statement offences that the applicant could not be penalized for complicity with Howard in his breaches of trust because such a finding constituted a circumstance of aggravation not alleged in the counts of the indictment. This elevated to the level of a more serious offence conduct for which sentences were being imposed: The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. 
     
      
    46 De Simoni was a case concerning the West Australian Criminal Code but the principles discussed therein have frequently been cited in common law jurisdictions. Gibbs CJ said (at p 389): 
     
      
       
        
        “At first sight it may seem unlikely that the framers of the Code intended that an offender should be sentenced on the fictitious basis that no circumstance of aggravation existed when it is found by the trial judge that such a circumstance did exist, particularly when such a finding is based upon an unchallenged statement of facts made by the prosecutor after the offender has pleaded guilty. However, the general principle that the sentence imposed on an offender should take account of all the circumstances of the offence is subject to a more fundamental and important principle, that no one should be punished for an offence of which he has not been convicted. Section 582 reflects this principle. The combined effect of the two principles, so far as it is relevant for present purposes, is that a judge, in imposing sentence, is entitled to consider all the conduct of the accused, including that which would aggravate the offence, but cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence.” 
        
       
      
    47 The breach of principle which the Chief Justice was articulating concerned giving cumulative or additional effect to a matter of aggravation. He was not placing a restriction upon the taking of matters into account in assessing the objective criminality of an offence: see R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at 191-192. 
     
      
    48 The contention of the applicant was that complicity by him in the breaches of trust by Howard towards HIH C&G could conceivably have given rise to charges under s 176 or 176A of the Crimes Act. These provisions carry greater prescribed penalties (ten years imprisonment) than those of the charges against the applicant and are thereby to be categorized as more serious offences. 
     
      
    49 In an argument presented in a negative sense, it was observed that breach of trust was not an essential element of the false statement charges and attention was drawn to comments in the judgment in R v Martin [2005] NSWCCA 190 where some examples of abuse of trust were said to amount to aggravating factors available to be taken into account on sentence. It was submitted that the present case could be distinguished on the facts (the applicant was not an officer of HIH whereas Martin was an officer of a particular corporation) and it was submitted that comments were “in any event” obiter and wrong. The submission tended to deflect attention from pertinent issues. It is not necessary to engage in an examination of the correctness or otherwise of the comments in Martin. 
     
      
    50 Each of the false statement counts involved an element of intention to obtain a financial advantage for the applicant through his various corporations. Recognizing his Honour’s statement in reference to s 21A (2) (k) that the applicant intended assisting Howard to commit his breaches of trust is not an indication that he was treating that circumstance as a matter of aggravation but that it was a circumstance which he was taking into account in the assessment of the objective gravity of those offences. Those breaches of trust led to the improper payment of funds consequent upon the presentation of the false statements. It would have been artificial and sterile, to assess the objective seriousness of the false statement offences by excluding consideration of how consequences were achieved and what they were. 
     
      
    51 I would reject ground l. 
     
      
    52 GROUND 2 
     
      
       
      The learned sentencing judge erred in his application of  
      Pearce v The Queen 
       (1989) 194 CLR 610 and the principles of proportionality and totality such that the sentences imposed were excessive. 
       
      
    53 His Honour expressly noted his obligation to comply with what had been specified in Pearce v The Queen (1989) 194 CLR 610. The applicant argues that his Honour did not fulfil his expressed intention. It was submitted that two errors were apparent, first, that his Honour failed to determine appropriate sentences for each offence and, second, that he failed to have regard to elements of commonality in certain of the bribery offences and certain of the false statement offences.  
     
      
    54 This ground and the arguments in support of it were to an extent based upon a misconception concerning the relationship between counts and payments. As earlier mentioned there was produced at the hearing a schedule purporting to cross reference payments (or set-off) to specific counts.  
     
      
    55 In his remarks on sentence his Honour summarized the position thus: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the Crown case at the trial the individual payments made by the prisoner to Mr Howard were not necessarily specifically linked to the settlement by Mr Howard of any particular claim made on behalf of a company associated with the prisoner and in some cases were linked to the settlement of a number of claims.” 
        
       
      
    56 It was not contended that the similar direction to the jury in this regard was erroneous and neither was it erroneous for his Honour to approach the issues of sentence accordingly. 
     
      
    57 It was submitted that, although a finding by his Honour of “substantial loss” in relation to each offence was not disputed, he failed to examine which claims by the applicant’s companies were linked to which charges. So to do would have been inconsistent with dealing with the issue in accordance with the trial and his Honour’s above cited finding.  
     
      
    58 In relation to the false statement charges it can be said that the link was self evident and, to the extent that that might have been relevant, his Honour “grouped” by concurrent sentence the related misconduct as above set out.  
     
      
    59 All of the bribery offences were met by equal sentences to be served concurrently. The attempt to draw distinctions by reason of linking various amounts of improper payments must fail in the light of the finding, congruent with the conduct of the case, that the bribes were not referrable to any particular payment. In that circumstance, given the identity of other factors including subjective matters favourable to the applicant, no error has been demonstrated by his Honour’s imposition of equivalent sentences within the groups, in particular the six bribery offences. His Honour did not fail to set appropriate terms for each offence. 
     
      
    60 The second argument in support of this ground referred to the joint judgment (McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ) in Pearce at p 623 where their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common. No doubt that general principle must yield to any contrary legislative intention, but the punishment to be exacted should reflect what an offender has done; it should not be affected by the way in which the boundaries of particular offences are drawn. Often those boundaries will be drawn in a way that means that offences overlap. To punish an offender twice if conducts falls in that area of overlap would be to punish offenders according to the accidents of legislative history, rather than according to their just deserts.” 
        
       
      
    61 It might be observed that what was discussed in that extract was commonality of elements and not the repetition of similar criminal conduct. The commonality asserted by the applicant in this case was that in each offence the intention of the applicant was to gain a benefit in the processing of the claims of his various corporations. Those payments represented outcomes of the offences. As the extract from the joint judgment states it is “the commission of elements that are common” which requires avoidance of double punishment not a similarity of outcome. In any event, as already observed, where the outcome was the same in respect of particular offences, his Honour “grouped” the sentences and ordered that they be served concurrently. 
     
      
    62 There was no commonality between the acts of criminality leading to impermissible “double punishment” referrable to each of the groups of offences. His Honour, having assessed sentences for individual offences, made the orders effecting the partial accumulations as above indicated. 
     
      
    63 It is well established that questions of cumulation are matters for the exercise of discretion in respect of which this Court can only intervene in accordance with the principles laid down in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. No miscarriage of discretion has been shown. 
     
      
    64 I would reject ground 2. 
     
      
    65 GROUND 3 
     
      
       
      His Honour erred in failing to impose a sentence on the applicant that was proportionate with that of his co-offender (taking their different circumstances into account) and failed to apply the principle of “consistency” in sentencing. 
       
      
    66 The co-offender referred to in the statement of the ground is, of course, Howard. Howard was not charged with the same offences as the applicant and was sentenced for two counts contrary to s 184 (2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Commonwealth) for dishonestly using his position as an officer of HIH C&G with the intention of gaining an advantage for the applicant’s companies. The maximum prescribed penalty for such offences is five years imprisonment. Howard pleaded guilty.  
     
      
    67 In support of this ground the applicant referred to the joint judgment (Dawson and Gaudron JJ) in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301 where their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality.” 
        
       
       
      
    68 Although the crimes of Postiglione and his co-offender Savvas were entirely different from those of the applicant and Howard there is some comparison to be drawn from their Honours’ following observation to that just quoted: 
     
      
       
        
        “The different circumstances involved this case, namely, the fact that Savvas was the principal organiser in both conspiracies and that Postiglione rendered significant assistance to police and prosecuting authorities, clearly require that Postiglione receive a markedly lesser sentence than that imposed on Savvas.” 
        
       
      
    69 The major beneficiaries of the crimes were the applicant’s companies and he would, for that reason, meet the description of principal organizer. It was he who instigated the very first meeting at the Balmain Hotel. The quantum of bribes received by Howard was a comparatively small proportion of the total benefits which were improperly paid out by HIH C&G. Howard rendered significant assistance to the prosecuting authorities as did Postiglione. Not the least of Howard’s assistance was the giving of evidence at the trial of the applicant. 
     
      
    70 The applicant’s submissions recognized that he and Howard were not dealt with for the same offences but attention was sought to be directed to his Honour’s findings that there was a degree of correspondence between the criminal conduct constituting some of the offences by each of them. Such findings were open to his Honour but they do not translate a finding that the offenders were of like total culpability for their respective crimes. 
     
      
    71 In what has been treated as one classic statement on the topic, Gibbs CJ in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 said at 609: 
     
      
       
        
        “The true position in my opinion may be briefly stated as follows. It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender, and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence, have to be taken into account 
        .” 
        
       
       
      
    72 In any event, Howard was entitled, on being convicted for Commonwealth offences, to a reduction of sentence on his pleas of guilty for having shown a willingness to facilitate the course of justice: Cameron v The Queen (2002) 209 CLR 339; his pleas of guilty were also indicators of remorse and he rendered the assistance above described. His Honour detailed a number of reasons for his conclusion that the applicant’s sentences should be greater than those received by Howard. He found that the applicant was the instigator of the offending and that the crimes of the applicant were more serious and that this was plainly reflected by the higher prescribed maximum penalties.  
     
      
    73 The applicant’s submissions do not articulate a complaint in terms of parity but in terms of asserting a lack of “consistency”. Citation was made of the remarks of Mason J in Lowe at p 610: 
     
      
       
        
        “Just as consistency in punishment – a reflection of the notion of equal justice – is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice, so inconsistency in punishment, because it is regarded as a badge of unfairness and unequal treatment under the law, is calculated to lead to an erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice 
        .” 
        
       
      
    74 There can be no criticism of the ideal which that expression postulates but it has not been understood to require a sentencing judge to engage in a comparative exploration of sentences for any offence by any offender whether or not connected with the sentencing task being performed. Consistency is achieved by the imposition of sentences conforming to established sentencing patterns, every sentence taking into account the particular circumstances of the offence and of the offender.  
     
      
    75 The applicant appeared for sentence for many more offences than Howard and his Honour was constrained to give effect to principles of totality. In addition, as previously mentioned, some of the applicant’s offences were required to be set against a guide of maximum penalty greater than that faced by the co-offender. His Honour’s assessment displayed no lack of consistency. 
     
      
    76 It was irrelevant for the applicant to seek to draw contrast between the sentences received by him and those received by the offenders Raymond Williams and Rodney Adler. Notoriously, and as the remarks of sentencing judges in those cases revealed, they were involved in criminal behaviour associated with the collapse of the HIH Group. Those offences had nothing to do with the crimes of the applicant. It may be true that some part of the attrition upon the funds of HIH by the improper payments to the applicant’s companies could have contributed to the ultimate insolvency but that does not make the punishment of those offenders a yardstick for the punishment of the applicant for what he has done.  
     
      
    77 I would reject ground 3. 
     
      
    78 GROUND 4 
     
      
       
      His Honour erred in not taking into account in mitigation on penalty that the applicant had complied with his obligations under Part 3, Division 3  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
       (pre-trial disclosure). 
       
      
    79 The complaint in this ground is that his Honour should have reduced the sentences by taking into account “the voluminous disclosure made in the course of this complex criminal trial”. 
     
      
    80 The Crown challenges the description “voluminous” and observes that his Honour made no such finding. Section 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “22A(1) A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender who was tried on indictment, having regard to the degree to which the defence has made pre-trial disclosures for the purposes of the trial. 
        
       
       
        
         (2) A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    81 His Honour’s remarks were transcribed under various headings, one of which was “Mitigating Factors”. Under that heading he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The prisoner did provide some assistance within s 23 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         in the proceedings relating to the offences. However, the assistance provided by the prisoner was limited. The prisoner agreed that at the trial the statements of a number of witnesses could be read, without the makers of the statements being required to give oral evidence, and for the purposes of the trial a limited number of facts were agreed to by the prisoner. 
        
       
       
        
        On 6 May 2005 I gave certain directions ordering pre-trial disclosure pursuant to Div 3 of Pt 3 of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
        . On 24 June 2005 the prisoner’s solicitors wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions supplying the names of a number of witnesses to be called as character witnesses at the trial (none of whom were in fact called) and giving notice of the prisoner’s intention to dispute the admissibility of large parts of the evidence in the Crown brief, including all of the evidence of Mr Howard, the principal Crown witness.” 
        
       
      
    82 It is contended that his Honour, having noted the application of Div 3 of Pt 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act, gave no discount for the applicant’s compliance and gave no reasons why he was not inclined so to do. His Honour did not state that he was not taking the applicant’s compliance into account in his favour and his inclusion of these observations when referring to mitigation indicates the contrary. He was not obliged to formulate some arithmetical or individually quantified discount and his purpose in mentioning this matter was obviously to include it as a matter of mitigation. The error asserted by this ground has not been demonstrated.  
     
      
    83 GROUND 5 
     
      
       
      The sentences imposed on each count are manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    84 It is not submitted that his Honour omitted to take into account some factor favourable to the applicant that he should have. The applicant’s written submissions referred to those which he took into account in some detail and contend nevertheless that the sentences were manifestly excessive “having regard to all of the circumstances outlined.” It cannot be, and it is not, said that the applicant was lured into criminal activity in order possibly to keep a corporate ship afloat. He (as was Howard) was fully aware of the probable fate which awaited the HIH Group and, to continue the metaphor, his actions were more akin to those of piracy than of salvage. 
     
      
    85 The bribery of Howard and the production of false documents were crimes motivated by greed. No challenge was advanced against his Honour’s finding that the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        “….did not curtail his extravagant lifestyle, including driving expensive cars, living in a residential apartment at Balmoral, staying at Hayman Island and gambling large sums at a casino.” 
        
       
      
    86 It is true that at the first instance hearing the Crown Prosecutor referred his Honour to a number of cases including those of Howard and Adler which were described in a written submission as “sentencing comparatives”. His Honour was not bound by the approach advanced by the Crown nor for that matter any approach advanced on behalf of the applicant. As was said by this Court in a joint judgment (Mason P, Wood CJ at CL and Sully J) in R v Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7 (the relevant passage is not included for publication in the authorized report at (2004) 59 NSWLR 284): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not, however, the case that much benefit is ever gained by an attempt to draw a comparison with other cases, having regard to the differences in the objective and subjective circumstances involved …. 
        
       
       
        
        …… 
        
       
       
        
        (it is) the responsibility of this Court to determine whether or not the sentence imposed fell within a proper exercise of sentencing discretion by reference to its own facts.” 
        
       
      
    87 The applicant’s offences manifested a high degree of objective criminality. Not only are such offences difficult to detect but as the applicant’s submissions recognize, their prosecution is a matter of considerable complexity. A significant reflection of general deterrence was required. His Honour gave full weight to such matters as the applicant could seek to draw upon in mitigation and the sentences were neither individually nor cumulatively excessive. 
     
      
    88 I would grant the necessary extension of time and I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with James J. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: On 4 February 2009 the Court announced its decision to dismiss an appeal by the Crown against an order made on 20 November 2008 by her Honour Judge Tupman in the District Court adjourning to 13 March 2009 proceedings for the sentencing of the respondent Bradley Brown. The order was made by her Honour pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (“the Act”). Such an order is sometimes referred to as a “Griffiths remand” (Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293).  
     
      
    3 On 4 February 2009 the Court did not give reasons for its decision, informing the parties that it would give its reasons later. The following are my reasons for joining in the decision by the Court to dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
    4 On 20 November 2008 Judge Tupman was conducting proceedings for the sentencing of the respondent for an offence of armed robbery to which he had pleaded guilty. Her Honour was to take into account in sentencing the respondent an additional offence of robbery.  
     
      
    5 A statement of agreed facts of the offences was admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence. The facts of the principal offence can be briefly summarised as follows. In the late afternoon of 6 October 2007 the respondent approached the victim in a city street. The respondent produced a knife which was about 5 centimetres long. The respondent said “give me your phone or I’m going to stab you”. The victim was carrying a mobile telephone attached to the belt around his waist. A struggle ensued between the respondent and the victim in which the respondent did not use the knife but threw several punches, at least one of which connected with the victim’s face. The respondent seized the victim’s mobile telephone and ran off.  
     
      
    6 The facts of the additional offence, very broadly stated, were that about an hour later on 6 October 2007 the victim was using her mobile telephone in a street in an inner city suburb. The respondent grabbed the victim’s mobile telephone, pulled it from her grip and ran off.  
     
      
    7 The offences were promptly reported to the police and a description of the offender was broadcast over police radio. The respondent was arrested later on the evening of 6 October 2007, while walking in a city street. 
     
      
    8 In the proceedings on sentence on 20 November 2008 the respondent gave oral evidence before her Honour. The respondent’s legal representative then addressed her Honour. In the course of this address the respondent’s legal representative submitted that a course which her Honour might adopt would be to make an order under s 11 of the Act. Her Honour decided that she would adopt this course.  
     
      
    9 Before making the order appealed from, her Honour delivered some brief remarks.  
     
      
    10 In these remarks her Honour noted that, on the face of it, having regard to the facts of the principal offence and the guideline judgment for sentencing for offences of armed robbery R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, the respondent would be likely to receive a sentence of full time custody. However, her Honour then referred to evidence the respondent had given before her in the proceedings on sentence. Her Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “From the evidence he has given under oath I accept that there were a number of serious circumstances and incidents surrounding him at the time he committed the offences, all of which occurred within the five or six days preceding the offence, which involved his wife, his young children, violence, becoming unemployed, becoming homeless, losing his children in circumstances where he was fearful for their wellbeing, on the face of it with some justification, having no money and at least from a lay perspective getting to a stage at the time he committed this offence where all those surrounding events had overwhelmed him and clouded his judgment.” 
        
       
      
    11 Her Honour observed that the offences appeared to be very much out of character and that there was no logical explanation for the respondent’s conduct.  
     
      
    12 Her Honour continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It would be desirable, however, for the court to have access to more evidence about his ongoing and past psychological situation, perhaps with reference to the state of mind that he must have been in at the time he committed the offence, but in any event, his ongoing circumstances and have further evidence in relation to his general social circumstances so that his real prospects of rehabilitation can be assessed.” 
        
       
      
    13 Her Honour noted that the Crown opposed the making of an order under s 11 on the grounds that the objective facts of the principal offence was such that no sentence other than a sentence of full time custody would be appropriate. 
     
      
    14 In her remarks her Honour continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is submitted and suggested that there is a possibility that something other than full-time custody may be available. That is yet to be determined. Even if that is not so, the prisoner’s real prospects of rehabilitation must be known on the basis of proper evidence before the court, so that the appropriate length of sentence and the finding of any special circumstances and the like can be properly ascertained.” 
        
       
      
    15 Her Honour decided that an adjournment of about three months would be required and then made the following formal order:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I adjourn the matter part-heard before me for sentence to Friday 13 March 2009 at 10am.” 
        
       
      
    16 It was common ground on the appeal that the appeal was competent. An order made under s 11 of the Act is a “sentence” for the purposes of s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act.  
     
      
    17 It was submitted by the Crown on the appeal that Judge Tupman had erred in making an order under s 11 of the Act, because, even allowing for any subjective factors, anything less then a sentence of full-time imprisonment could not be justified. The Crown referred to Henry and submitted that the present case was worse than the common category of cases of armed robbery described in par 162 of the Chief Justice’s judgment in Henry, for which the Chief Justice said that a head sentence of imprisonment between four and five years should generally be imposed. At par 113 of his judgment in Henry the Chief Justice said that a non-custodial sentence for armed robbery could be imposed only in exceptional circumstances and it was submitted by the Crown that the present case, whatever evidence might be obtained about the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation, could not be regarded as an exceptional case. 
     
      
    18 It was submitted by the Crown that, as in R v Alameddine [2005] NSWCCA 68, there was no justification for the making of an order under s 11 because “there was no reasonable prospect that her Honour was likely to learn by virtue of the further adjournment of the matter, any significant matter likely to bear upon the exercise of the sentencing discretion” (Alameddine at (15) per Barr J). 
     
      
    19 It was further submitted by the Crown that, while it was accepted that the circumstances in which an order under s 11 of the Act could properly be made were not limited to those where, if rehabilitation was effected during the period of the adjournment, a sentence not involving full-time custody might properly be imposed, nevertheless in any such other cases “it ought to be explained to the offender that the use of s 11 will not avoid punishment made necessary by the objective gravity of the crime(s) under consideration” (R v MRN [2006] NSWCCA 155 at (114) per Simpson J). it was submitted that no such explanation had been given to the respondent in the present case.  
     
      
    20 It was further submitted by the Crown that the sentencing judge had failed to make findings about the facts of the offences before making an order under s 11. The Crown referred to R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381.  
     
      
    21 It is clear that a number of the submissions made by the Crown which I have summarised should be rejected.  
     
      
    22 As was in fact conceded by the Crown in one of its submissions, the power to make an order under s 11 of the Act, while it is to be exercised sparingly, is not, as the power to grant a “Griffiths remand” strictly so called was held to be, limited to cases where “in the event that rehabilitation and reform are achieved, it would be appropriate to impose a non-custodial sentence” (R v Tindall, R v Gunton (1994) 74 A Crim R 275 at 276 per Hunt CJ at CL). The circumstances in which an order can be made under s 11 were discussed by Smart AJ, with whose judgment Spigelman CJ and Grove J agreed, at pars 41-64 of his Honour’s judgment in R v Trindall (2002) 133 A Crim R 119. At 131 (64) his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The granting of a Griffiths remand (that is an order under s 11) is likely to arise for consideration in a relatively small number of cases. Generally, such a remand should not be granted unless there are good reasons for concluding that it is likely to assist the court in determining whether an offender should be sent to gaol or in fixing the length of the sentence or the non-parole period. If the latter be the case, the judge should, as here, make it clear to the offender that he will be going to gaol and that the purpose of the remand is to assist the court in fixing the non-parole period. This Court should not seek to circumscribe the wide statutory discretion given to the sentencing judge.” 
        
       
      
    23 In the present case, although Judge Tupman did not say so in her short remarks, her Honour had during the proceedings on sentence given clear warnings to the respondent and his legal representative that in due course a sentence of full-time custody might have to be imposed “(even) if everything goes well” during the period of the adjournment. 
     
      
    24 There is no substance in the submission by the Crown that her Honour erred in failing to make findings about the facts of the offences. An agreed statement of the facts of the offences had been admitted in the proceedings on sentence.  
     
      
    25 There may be more force in the Crown submission that there was no reasonable prospect of more evidence of any significance about the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation being obtained during the period of the adjournment. I am, however, not satisfied that I should find that her Honour erred in deciding, as she implicitly did, that there was a reasonable prospect of some evidence being obtained which would assist her in sentencing the respondent.  
     
      
    26 Even if it were held that her Honour did err in making the order under s 11, the question would arise whether there would be any utility in allowing the Crown appeal.  
     
      
    27 It was not suggested by the Crown that, if the appeal was allowed, this Court should itself proceed to sentence the respondent. The orders sought by the Crown, in the event of the appeal succeeding, were that her Honour’s order should be quashed and the matter be returned to the District Court to be re-listed before her Honour.  
     
      
    28 Under her Honour’s own order the matter is to be re-listed before her on 13 March 2009, that is in just over five weeks time. This Court has no information about her Honour’s availability and commitments and would be reluctant to interfere with listing procedures in the District Court by requiring a listing of the matter before her Honour prior to 13 March. 
     
      
    29 Accordingly, even if error had been established, I would not have been in favour of allowing the appeal. 
     
      
    30 The above are my reasons for joining in the Court’s decision to dismiss the Crown appeal. 
     
      
    31 I would add the following comments. A sentencing judge will sometimes be justified in adjourning sentencing proceedings to enable further evidence to be obtained, without any need to invoke s 11 of the Act or any other statutory provision. My further comment is that nothing in this judgment is to be taken as constraining in any way the ultimate exercise by her Honour of her sentencing discretion.

   1. HIS HONOUR: The offender, Carlos Ferreira, appears before this court on a serious charge of robbery.2. The robbery occurred on 30 June 2008. On that day at about 8.40am, a woman working at a business called, Cashstop Financial Services in Parramatta Road, Petersham was about to enter the premises. The premises were the subject of some considerable security precautions. She was required, apparently, to look around and make sure the shop had not been broken into, and then to ring on her mobile phone and provide a password. That then permitted her to open the premises by putting a key in a lock in the front door. 3. She then had to walk through a man trap door and then through a second man trap door. However, as she went to the first man trap door there was the offender behind her. He had a beanie on, a black cloth covering his face with an opening for his eyes, a black glove on his right hand and he pushed her with his left. She started screaming, he covered her mouth with his left hand and he told her to keep quiet he needed money, if he got the money he would let her go; otherwise he would kill her. Understandably she was extremely scared.4. They then went through the second man trap door. She deactivated the alarm but entered a duress code on a keypad. 5. The victim pleaded to him not to hurt her, he said, “I don’t want to hurt you just give me the money. Don’t press any panic alarm, if police come in here I’ll take you along with me.” She presumably took this as some indication that she would die with him. She attempted to open a safe, she took some money from a float, which was at the bottom of the safe, he took this cash and put it in a recyclable bag that he had with him. This consisted of $3,450 Australian dollars, US$1,829, one UK pound and $10 in Hong Kong currency and seven hundred euros. 6. Because the duress code had been keyed in, obviously the alarm alerted someone and police arrived. She was ordered to go out the front and indicate she was fine. He then ordered her to go out the back; she unlocked the door and ran out. He tried to escape through a rear window but it was barred. He ran to the front and after speaking to the police he opened the door. I have no doubt that he surrendered after some relatively short discussion because he was not armed and the police were. He was wearing an expensive silver watch which he claimed to have bought from someone in a street. This is the subject of a related charge under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).7. He is a thirty year old man. He has an extensive criminal history. That criminal history commenced in the Children’s Court with stealing. He has been a thief from his childhood; he has been convicted of many breaking and entering offences and other offences of dishonesty. In 2003, the Drug Court suspended some sentences and put him on program. He ignored their program, he was ejected from their program. The Drug Court program, which is a very fine program, attempts to bring people face to face with the reality of being drug dependant. Very many people go through this program successfully and go on to achieve great things. All he did was ignore it and go back to taking drugs, committing driving offences and offences of dishonesty until he decided to become a criminal of a more significant type by engaging in robbery.8. He has written me a note. The note indicates to me that he can read and write quite well. He expresses sorrow; he said that in the witness box. A prison chaplain has sent along details of his attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He has given, in the witness box, no indication of the significance of any of those meetings and the mere fact he goes to a meeting and signs a register in my opinion means absolutely nothing. The real question is has he gone to these meetings for any particular purpose other than getting a certificate from someone that he has attended. 9. He came from a family where his father was Brazilian, his mother was Maori. He has a sister and a brother. Both of them lead ordinary respectable lives. There have been tragedies in his life, his mother died when she was thirty-five and he was only seventeen. His father was not at home at the time, and he somehow arranged to take his mother’s body with his younger siblings back to New Zealand for a family funeral. When they got back to Australia some weeks later they discovered his father had been murdered probably just before his mother died. These are traumatic events and there is no doubt anybody would be very seriously affected by them. However, he is now thirty. These were events of thirteen years ago.10. Since that time he was given the opportunity of going to the Drug Court program and no doubt these matters would have been looked at had he bothered staying. He cannot use as an excuse for his actions the grief that he felt when his parents both died. He has to get on with life. His parents left him some money, he wasted all the money on drugs and other things of no value. He has had some training as a painter of houses but he has not really done very much of it. He told a psychologist that he drank a lot which may be true. It is hard to say. There is nothing wrong with him mentally. The psychologist thinks there is a fairly good chance of his getting back into drug crime again. I think so too.11. I do not think there is anything much going for him. He managed to create terror in a young woman. His explanation was he did not have any plan in mind, he was just across the road and he was stoned. Well that must indicate that he carries around disguises with him just on the off chance that something might turn up that he could steal or somebody could be there and he could rob them. That might be true. Who knows? 12. The consequences of what he did on this day are very serious. He frightened the life out of a woman; he stole a significant sum of money. He did not have it for very long because the police arrived and intercepted him. The robbery itself, one would have to say, was pretty stupid, walking into a place that is subject to a whole lot of security precautions which obviously were in place. However he frightened her, he created enormous upset, caused the police to be called out, damaged the window, made yet another person whose employment was working in a place with cash worried as to whether she could continue working in that place, I would imagine. I have no statement from her saying that, but that would be a natural thing. 13. This court has had before it in its civil jurisdiction a number of claims over the years by people working in TAB offices and similar places with large sums of money who have been robbed and those people have sued their employers because of the trauma suffered by them as a result of the robberies. Anybody who is the victim of a robbery suffers trauma. I think it is a significant crime, I do not see any great circumstances of a subjective type that operate in his favour. He was on a s 12 bond at the time and there is no doubt in my mind that when he was put on that bond he was told, breach the bond and you will go to gaol, just as he has been told this thing on many other occasions.14. He has appeared before judges of this court on a number of occasions. On each occasion the judges have bent over backwards to try and assist him by giving him short sentences and I have no doubt that on each occasion the judges have been told about this tragic set of circumstances that occurred when he was seventeen years old. It really is about time he just got on with life and stopped involving himself in crime. I have no confidence at all that he will do anything much to remove himself from drugs. I do not see any great reason to make a finding of special circumstances because I do not think there is anything terribly special. I will give him the benefit of some finding of special circumstances which will not be extremely significant.15. In relation to the offence of robbery I sentence him to a non-parole period of two years and six months. That sentence will go from 30 June 2008 to 29 December 2010. The balance of the term will go from 30 December 2010 to 29 December 2012. He is to be released on parole on 29 December 2010. I recommend that he be given the benefit of drug and alcohol and grief counselling and that that be pursued by the parole authorities.16. In relation to the related matter which is one of dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime, I sentence him to three months imprisonment, that sentence commences on 30 June 2008 and concludes on 29 September 2008.17. I could refer him, of course, although I have not been asked to, because hardly ever anybody ever bothers to do so, I could refer him again to the special program run by the Drug Court for convicted prisoners but I will leave that to the Drug Court. I am not going to do anything, I have not been asked to do anything and previously he just ignored what they offered him anyway.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: In recent years the Court of Criminal Appeal has had occasion to comment in adverse terms on the practice of reports being tendered on pleas of guilty, reports from psychologists which express opinions and conclusions where there is no evidence put before the court to establish the material on which the conclusion is based. In those cases the Court of Criminal Appeal suggests that judges should look with scepticism at those opinions. At the very least the Court of Criminal Appeal has suggested that the weight to be given to such opinions should be reduced. This is one such case. 2 The central theme of the plea in mitigation put on behalf of the offender in this case concerned his experiences in Colombia, the reason he left Colombia and what has happened to his family who are left behind. A large part of the reports prepared on the offender on his behalf record various things that he has told the psychologists. The psychologists have accepted those at face value. Sometimes they have spoken to others as well in an effort to clarify or corroborate what the offender has said, but the remarkable thing about the case before me is that there was no sworn evidence from the offender himself to establish much of that which was relied on by the experts in forming their opinion. Quite why that was is, frankly, beyond me. It has affected the weight that I can give to the material put before me and the opinions formed by the psychologists. What could otherwise have been quite powerful evidence in favour of the offender has been left behind.3 The offender has pleaded guilty to one offence of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. That is a most serious offence, carrying a maximum penalty of twenty-five years with a standard non-parole period of seven years. The plea was entered at a reasonably late stage in the proceedings but because the intention to plead guilty was advised to the Crown shortly before the trial started, there was a utilitarian benefit to the Crown and the court. In particular witnesses who otherwise would have had to come from Colombia did not need to do so. I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by fifteen per cent to reflect the plea of guilty and when it was entered. 4 The offence arose in the following circumstances. The offender lived with two other men in a two bedroom apartment. The offender and a Mr Gallo, one of the flatmates of the offender, went out for a few drinks. Whilst they were out an argument started between Mr Gallo and the offender. Mr Gallo left the hotel and got a taxi back to the apartment.5 He went into the kitchen and started making himself something to eat. The offender arrived a few minutes later. The argument appears to have restarted. At one stage the offender was sitting on the lounge while Mr Gallo was in the kitchen. It was then that Mr Gallo walked towards the offender and started to push him. A scuffle therefore broke out between the accused and Mr Gallo, with them each pushing each other. The third man who lived in the apartment tried to separate them saying “please guys, please respect the house.” The two men continued to abuse each other and Mr Omar, the man who was trying to make peace, sat down at his computer. He then heard the offender yell out in Spanish, “I’m going to kill this motherfucker.” Because of the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced, I must not treat that as a genuine statement of intent. Nevertheless when Mr Omar turned around he saw that the offender was walking towards the victim whilst holding a knife in his right hand. It was a pocket knife with a blade approximately eight centimetres long. The offender swung the knife at Mr Gallo’s body about five times very quickly before he fell backwards onto the floor. Mr Omar bravely intervened and pushed the offender away. Mr Gallo felt pain in his arm just under his left elbow then noticed blood coming from his neck and realised that he had been stabbed.6 He then went to his bedroom. The offender moved towards the bedroom. Mr Omar heard noises, which he said sounded like someone kicking the door. Mr Omar ran from the apartment to get help. He spoke to a security guard in the building and asked him to call police. When he returned to the level on which the apartment was, he heard the offender yelling out “motherfucker” several times. He went back downstairs and then upstairs again. This time he saw the offender outside the apartment door. He walked past Mr Omar saying “fuck” several times. He then got into the lift and left. Mr Omar went into the apartment and saw Mr Gallo, who appeared to have lost a lot of blood. Mr Gallo asked for an ambulance and also asked Mr Gallo to contact his wife in Colombia. Mr Omar therefore left the building to try and find a public phone to arrange contact with Mr Gallo’s wife.7 When he got back to the building the security guard asked him to write down his personal details. Whilst Mr Omar was doing that the offender approached and asked him what he was doing. The offender then left the building and met up with two others, Mr Walker and Mr Figuero. 8 An ambulance arrived and Mr Gallo was taken to the hospital. He was treated by a doctor for two serious wounds, one of which, even to an untrained eye, is clearly a very serious stab wound to the very front of Mr Gallo’s neck. It was necessary for doctors to explore that wound in order to exclude life threatening injuries such as an injury to a major blood vessel. Fortunately the injuries themselves were not serious but their potential was of course enormous. As well as the wound to Mr Gallo’s neck, he had a five centimetre laceration, a significant one at that, to his elbow. He was in hospital for about three days before being released.9 The offender is forty-one years of age and has no prior convictions. He came from Colombia in circumstances I will discuss shortly and sought refugee status, although this has been denied him I understand. He has worked at times, although was not working at the time of this offence. There is nothing to suggest that he was other than a man of prior good character before the events of this morning. 10 One of the issues that was raised concerned the issue of intoxication. Ms David, who appeared for the offender, suggested that it was a mitigating feature, and that the alcohol has caused her client to act out of character. The Crown suggested that it was neither a mitigating nor an aggravating circumstance. In this case there was evidence from a friend of the offender’s, Mr Christian Victoria. He said that he considered that the offender had an alcohol problem. That is not terribly important here but what is important is that Mr Victoria has seen the offender intoxicated in the past and the offender has not previously been violent. In other words, there is nothing to suggest that alcohol causes the offender to act out of character. It may be readily accepted that those who are drunk are not able to reason with the same composure that sober people are. But in this case there is no evidence to suggest that the offender’s level of intoxication was at that level, he does not appear to have been grossly intoxicated. Certainly there is no evidence to suggest it. I am satisfied that given that there is an onus on the offender to establish intoxication as a mitigating feature, that I should regard the matter of intoxication as neutral, as the Crown suggests I should. 11 Linked to what was said to be the offender’s intoxication, is the circumstance I have said that I would come back to, that is what it is that led to the offender coming to Australia. The offender told others, in particular the psychologists, that whilst living in a village in Colombia, he became involved in local politics. He supported one side but those in power came from the opposite point of view. This apparently is not just a matter of a difference of opinion in Colombia but led to kidnappings of government officials and most importantly threats to the offender. It is that the offender told others which prompted him to leave Colombia, leaving behind his wife and then young child. I gather that the offender would much prefer to be living at peace in Colombia but regarded it as important to his safety that he live elsewhere. To others the offender describes specific incidents which would justify the offender’s fears. 12 Some evidence was called in relation to this issue. Mr Victoria spoke about the situation in La Virginia generally. He said that in Colombia there are some areas, and La Virginia is one, which are affected “big time” by guerrilla activity. Mr Flores, who also gave evidence on the offender’s behalf, knew the offender’s family in Colombia but did not know him. Mr Flores supported some of the assertions made in the psychological reports prepared on behalf of the offender. 13 The psychologists, who of course accept what the offender tells them, base their opinions on reports of the offender’s history and also the results of tests which they administer. These tests of course rely on the offender telling the truth. There is no suggestion here that the offender has been other than truthful but it is to be noted that when Dr Pullman spoke about symptoms of hyper-vigilance and overreaction, she was basing these conclusions on responses that the offender gave in a questionnaire. She did not, for example, observe anything of that kind in her examination of the offender. 14 I accept that the political situation in Colombia is as described by Mr Victoria and Mr Flores. I accept that there are threats that have been made to the offender because of his involvement in local government politics in his homeland. I accept that these would have an effect on him and that they may tend to lead to symptoms which are consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder.15 The difficulty I have is seeing precisely or even generally how the findings of the psychologists relate to this offence, in the absence of evidence from the offender himself as to what was going through his mind when he stabbed Mr Gallo. It is one thing for the psychologists to speak at a somewhat academic level about how experiences such as those reported by the offender might effect him when he is scuffling and arguing with Mr Gallo. It is another thing for the offender himself to give sworn evidence as to what was going through his mind at the time. I do not wish to suggest at all that I have rejected the conclusions drawn by the psychologists, but I do wish to make it clear that the absence of sworn evidence from the offender has effected the weight that I can give to what they say.16 Objectively this was a very serious offence. It is fortunate that Mr Gallo has, I expect from the material put before me, been left with physically nothing more than a few scars. There is no victim impact statement and so I do not know whether there have been any non-physical consequences for him. It would be consistent with my understanding of human behaviour if Mr Gallo was left with some psychological consequences as a result of the attach upon him: Their nature and level I cannot be sure of.17 The seriousness of this offence however is not determined only by the actual consequences to the victim. As I mentioned, Mr Gallo was stabbed directly to the front of his throat. I am satisfied that the nature of the injury inflicted is relevant and that the potential consequences which would flow from an attack of that nature, realised as they must have been by the offender, are to be taken into account. They demonstrate the seriousness of the nature of the attack and the level of harm intended by the offender. Of course as I mentioned earlier, I am not to be thought to have suggested that the offender intended to kill Mr Gallo. In assessing the level of harm he did intend, I take into account the potential consequences to Mr Gallo of being stabbed in the neck.18 Ms David referred to a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal called Heron v R [2006] NSWCCA 215. Heron says the potential consequences are not to be taken into account when looking at the mitigating feature set out in 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Heron does not say the potential consequences are completely irrelevant in the sentencing process.19 This offence was not planned or organised and to a very limited extent, it was provoked by the victim, Mr Gallo. It was he who apparently first used violence when he pushed the offender. However given that what followed was described in the agreed facts as a “scuffle”, the offender’s decision to stab Mr Gallo with a knife was a gross over-reaction and seriously criminal indeed.20 This offence is aggravated by the circumstance that a weapon was used, although I do have to say that most offences of this type are committed by an offender using a weapon. When I look at this case and compare it with other offences of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm, I will take into account that most of the sentences imposed on those other matters would have also reflected an aggravating circumstances; that a weapon was used.21 The offender has apparently told others that he is sorry: Sorry to his family, sorry to the victim’s family and sorry to the victim himself. Once more he did not say so to me. I accept that the offender has demonstrated remorse, as that term is currently used in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, but the extent to which the offender is remorseful is effected by the circumstance that whilst he was prepared to say it to others, he was not prepared to give evidence in this court and expose himself to cross-examination on this aspect of the matter.22 The offender, given that he is forty-one years of age and has only now committed his first offence of violence, might be thought to have reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. Although therapy has been suggested and it is not certain how he would respond to that therapy, I am satisfied that it is unlikely that an offence of this type will be repeated; if only because of the deterrent nature of the sentence that I will impose upon the offender.23 The offender or at least one of the witnesses did refer to the circumstance that the offender had been sending money home to his family in Columbia and that they will suffer because the offender is currently in custody and will be for some time. I mention this only to say that such consequences are not exceptional. They are a distressingly common feature of sentencing when breadwinners are sent to goal.24 The standard non-parole period is one of seven years. It is of course not of direct application in this case because of the plea of guilty, but it remains as a guidepost. Offences of grievous bodily harm can vary enormously in their consequences. Some offences are also planned, organised and done coldly rather than in the heat of the moment. For that reason I will regard this offence as below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this type. There are clearly special circumstances in this case. This is the offender’s first time in custody and the matters referred to in the psychologist’s report suggest that the offender will benefit from an extended period of supervision on parole.25 The offender is sentenced as follows. I sentence him to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years and six months to have commenced on 18 November 2007, the day on which the offender went into custody. I set an overall term of four years and eight months. Those who wish to do the maths will realise that absent a fifteen per cent discount, the total term would have been five years and six months. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 17 May 2010.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: There are before the Court applications for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by McGuire A/DCJ on Nicola Romano and Luigi Romano. The applicants are brothers. They were jointly indicted upon a charge that between 1 September 2003 and 5 April 2004 they knowingly took part in the cultivation at Glen Davis of a large commercial quantity of the prohibited plant cannabis. It was specified to amount to in excess of 8,000 plants. It will avoid much repetition if the applicants are referred to, without meaning any disrespect, by their forenames. 
     
      
    2 Nicola pleaded guilty on 26 February 2007, the day upon which the trial was listed to begin. This was mistakenly stated in his Honour’s remarks on sentence to have been 11 May 2007. To follow the intended joint trial was a further trial in which Nicola was charged with a similar offence committed between 1 January 2004 and 4 February 2004 at Torrington. Nicola originally declined a suggestion that, if he acknowledged his guilt, this offence might be taken into account when he was sentenced on the charge to which he had pleaded guilty in accordance with the Form 1 procedure, however, on 11 June 2007 he signed a Form 1 admitting the offence at Torrington. On 27 July 2007 he was sentenced (taking into account the Form 1 offence) to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 3 February 2006 and expiring on 2 February 2012 with a balance term of 4 years.  
     
      
    3 Luigi maintained a plea of not guilty and his trial proceeded before McGuire A/DCJ and a jury from 28 February 2007 until the jury returned a verdict of guilty on 21 March 2007. On 1 May 2007 his Honour sentenced him to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 27 April 2007 and expiring on 26 April 2012 with a balance term of 3 years 11 months. His Honour stated that he was taking into account 4 weeks of pre-sentence custody.  
     
      
    4 As will appear, the application by Luigi is principally focussed upon complaints of parity with other involved offenders (including Nicola) and it will be practical to deal with the grounds advanced by Nicola first. 
     
      
    5 Following his plea of guilty and signature of the Form 1, an agreed statement of facts concerning Nicola’s offences was tendered. This abbreviated description is extracted therefrom. 
     
      
    6 The investigation which concerned the crop at Torrington commenced in January 2004. A property of approximately 12,000 acres, Grevillea Downs, was owned by one McWhinney. Pursuant to warrant, police intercepted telephone conversations participated by McWhinney, a co-offender Maiurano and Nicola. It was established that Nicola gave instructions to Maiurano who would pass them to McWhinney. There were a number of such calls in which Nicola gave orders relating to the cannabis plantation. After late January several calls were intercepted in which Nicola instructed Maiurano to have McWhinney destroy the crop. McWhinney did not. On 4 February 2004 police executed a search warrant at Grevillea Downs and located three plantation sites on the property with a total of 5,141 cannabis plants. 
     
      
    7 In February 2004 a strike force was established to investigate a reported cultivation of cannabis believed to have been established in the Central West of the State. Warrants were obtained to intercept telephone communications used by Nicola and by Luigi as well as Nazzareno Foti, Luigi Bonfiglio, Tibor Mitin and Domenico Cento. 
     
      
    8 A property at Glen Davis was identified. This had belonged to Antonio Caporale, who lived on a nearby farm called The Crown. It was learned that workers were being employed for planting, nurturing and harvesting cannabis. The principals obtained seedlings and provided food and equipment for the workers. Police were authorized to covertly enter the property and between 31 March 2004 and 4 April 2004 they detected three plantation sites. There was a large L-shaped shed on the property. On 4 April 2004 Nicola, in particular, was seen standing near the shed at one of the crop sites. The cannabis was being harvested and some fifteen people were seen coming and going to and from the shed. 
     
      
    9 On 5 April 2004 police entered to execute a search warrant. Seven men were arrested on the site and others were seen fleeing into nearby bush land. More than 500 kilograms of harvested cannabis were found in the shed. 
     
      
    10 Nicola was a principal organizer. In September 2003 he and Bonfiglio had met Caporale and arranged for the transfer of the property into the name of Adrian Bulai. Nicola engaged in a series of organizational activities, including arranging for Mitin to use his credit card for hire of vehicles and equipment, for which Nicola reimbursed him. Food, equipment and bedding were delivered to workers at the site. Nicola gave instructions to the hired help as to how to prepare the ground for planting. With others he travelled to Griffith to collect cannabis “clones” and he delivered them to the crop site. 
     
      
    11 Interceptions included Nicola receiving enquiries about providing a sample, which obviously concerned attempts to find a buyer or buyers for the cannabis. Nicola was present on the property during the harvest. He had left when police entered. Subsequent intercepted calls revealed Nicola being informed of the correct number of persons who had been arrested. He was also heard to say that he had not located his brother Luigi and on the day after the police entry he went to the Glen Davis area looking for him. Luigi had fled when police arrived but Nicola did not find him.  
     
      
    12 On 25 May 2004 Nicola attended at Fairfield Police Station in response to a request communicated to him through his wife. Upon his attendance, he was charged. 
     
      
    13 A notice of grounds of appeal contained eleven grounds.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
      : The starting date for sentence did not take into account all of the pre sentence custody that the applicant had served. 
       
      
    14 At the hearing senior counsel stated that the discrepancy amounted to two days. The commencing date of 3 February 2006 upon which his Honour acted had been conveyed to him as the appropriate date by counsel. A matter of calculation is involved, and as the Crown Prosecutor pointed out, the applicant’s calculation appears to have been based upon an assumption stated in the written submissions that his date of arrest was 22 May 2004. This is incorrect. He was arrested when he attended the police station on 25 May 2004. This ground is not made out. 
     
      
    15 Ground 2: The Sentencing Judge erred by giving insufficient weight to the utilitarian value of the applicant’s plea of guilty. 
     
      
    16 His Honour stated that he would assess a total sentence of 11 years imprisonment but, for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, he would reduce the term to 10 years. Arithmetically this amounted to a “discount” of 9.9 percent. It was contended that this would be “less than the lowest discount envisaged by this Court in the guideline judgment for a late plea”.  
     
      
    17 The reference made is to R v Thomson and Houlten (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. As the submission recognized, the Court has proclaimed a guideline and that does not create an effect of the same character as a legislated minimum. What was said by the Chief Justice (at 419) was that there “should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 percent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge.” (Emphasis added) 
     
      
    18 As was earlier mentioned, the plea of guilty was entered on the trial date. It is accepted that the intention so to plead was indicated to the Crown about a week beforehand. There was further delay while the second matter was being considered by Nicola and his advisers culminating in the signing of the Form 1 in June. This ground challenges an exercise of discretion of the sentencing judge. It has not been shown that that discretion miscarried. It is a misconception to assert that 10 percent is the lowest discount for a plea of guilty. I would reject ground 2. 
     
      
    19 Ground 3: The Sentencing Judge erred by failing to take into account in mitigation the applicant’s remorse and contrition. 
     
      
    20 Reference was made to s 21A (3) (i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as it stood at the time this sentence was imposed. A substituted formulation has since been inserted taking effect from 1 January 2008. 
     
      
    21 It was submitted that his Honour did not deal with the claim of remorse or contrition at all and that he was required to take into account the offender’s “genuine remorse”. It was for the offender to prove these matters to the requisite standard: The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270. In submissions to this Court he pointed to references which had been tendered and descriptions of charitable and community work which he undertook when released on bail. 
     
      
    22 In assessing whether the plea of guilty conveyed remorse by the offender as distinct from any utilitarian value, the strength of the Crown case is relevant: R v Sutton 2004 41 MVR 40. Police observation was available to evidence Nicola’s physical involvement in the Glen Davis plantation and telephone intercepts confirmed his participation in the cropping at Torrington. In both instances there was clearly a strong Crown case. 
     
      
    23 The evidence about charitable work performed by Nicola was expressly taken into account by McGuire A/DCJ when he found that this constituted a positive sign towards rehabilitation. The evidence did not suggest that the reason for engagement in charitable work was regret for having committed crime, but it was rather a continuation of activity in which Nicola had previously engaged, no doubt to the approbation of the community. A clue to what may have inspired him can be found in a reference from the president of a soccer club who stated, “He is sorry for the embarrassment and hardship that his actions have brought to his family”. Whilst it may be accepted that that is the case, it represents distress at the inevitable consequences rather than contrition for criminal acts.  
     
      
    24 No error as asserted in this ground was committed by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    25 Ground 4: The sentence gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant when one compares his sentence to that of Luigi Romano. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 
      : If parity does not apply, the sentencing Judge erred in not applying the principles of consistency to ensure there is no justifiable sense of injustice when one compares the applicant’s sentence to that of Luigi Romano. 
       
      
    26 Those grounds are obviously associated and can be dealt with together. The sentence received by Luigi followed trial. It has been set out above. The principles relating to parity and consistency are not in doubt and it is not necessary to recite the oft quoted passages of authority which appear in cases such as Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 and Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295. 
     
      
    27 In terms of minimum custody Nicola must serve 6 years and Luigi must serve 5 years. There is one month difference in their respective balance terms but this difference is not of significance. 
     
      
    28 A principal matter of discrimination between the two offenders was undoubtedly the circumstance that Nicola was to be sentenced for involvement in the cultivation of two large commercial quantities of prohibited crop whereas Luigi was involved in only the one. Of course, for involvement in the Torrington cultivation the offence by Nicola was taken into account in the Form 1 procedure and he was not to be separately sentenced in respect of it. Nevertheless, it was an offence for which there is a maximum prescribed penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and that offers a measure of its seriousness. It was his Honour’s function when dealing with Nicola to impose a sentence for the totality of his criminality: R v Bavadra [2000] 115 A Crim R 152. It was observed in AG’s Application under s 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) 2002 56 NSWLR 146 that taking a matter into account on a Form 1 required greater weight to be given to personal deterrence and retribution with the consequence that a longer sentence will be imposed for the indicted offence and the additional penalty will not necessarily be small. 
     
      
    29 There was no justifiable basis for Nicola to be aggrieved by comparing the sentence received by him with that received by Luigi and these grounds should be dismissed. 
     
      
    30 Ground 6: The Sentencing Judge erred by taking into account matters which were not in evidence before him on the applicant’s sentence. 
     
      
      Ground 10 
      : The Sentencing Judge erred in taking into account material which was not in evidence before him in determining the applicant’s role or level of involvement in the cultivation. 
       
      
    31 These grounds effectively articulate the same complaint. 
     
      
    32 At the sentencing proceedings there was tendered to his Honour without objection a folder containing the statements of facts and the remarks on sentence of relevant judges in respect of all the other co-offenders except Luigi (Exhibit E). In that circumstance there can have been no error by McGuire A/DCJ having reference to the content of the exhibit. 
     
      
    33 The argument was focussed on a remark by his Honour concerning findings by Hulme DCJ who sentenced a number of other offenders including Bonfiglio. McGuire A/DCJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Judge Hulme formed opinions as to where the various figures stood, in the hierarchy of the organisation. He did so on the basis of agreed statement of facts. 
        
       
       
        
        As I remarked when sentencing Luigi Romano on 1 May 2004 his Honour made findings relying upon evidence as to the involvements of various participants, different to that available to me. For example a determination was made by his Honour Judge Hulme as to the status of Luigi Bonfiglio as being relatively senior figure in the enterprise albeit that he found Foti and Caparilli (sic) to be of greater importance and placed Bonfiglio in the middle of the hierarchy. With the greatest of respect to his Honour that was a finding that I would not of made having regard to additional information available to me, that was not in the possession of his Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        I had the advantage of the evidence given in the trial of Luigi Romano from various co-offenders and the many tape recordings of conversations among various participants, including the offender standing for sentence. I do not consider valid the parity argument advanced in the case of Luigi Romano nor do I find Judge Hulme’s assessment to be of real assistance in dealing with the case of the offender before me.” 
        
       
      
    34 However, it should be noted that he went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Nicola Romano’s conduct in both the offence that is the matter on the indictment and on the Form 1 reflect far greater criminality than was displayed by Bonfiglio. 
        
       
       
        
        I have not drawn upon the material before Judge Hulme nor upon his opinions to assign to the offender, Nicola Romano, his role in the venture. Luigi Bonfiglio gave a letter of assistance for which he received a discount and he entered a plea of guilty at a much earlier point in time than the present offender.” 
        
       
      
    35 His Honour’s finding as to the role of Nicola was explicitly based upon the agreed statement of facts that had been placed in evidence before him. He made this plain: 
     
      
       
        
        “The agreed statement of facts clearly establish that the offender was a member of the top echelon in the organisation. Whether he was a few percentage points more or less responsible than X or Y I consider to be of little relevance. Nicola Romano was involved in activities over a substantial period. His conduct was not spontaneous. It was obviously considered and deliberate.”  
        
       
      
    36 It is true that the transcript shows exchanges between his Honour and counsel then appearing for Nicola (who did not appear in the appeal) in which the obvious fact that his Honour had presided in the trial of Luigi was mentioned and his Honour referred to the great deal of material that he had necessarily then heard. That such exchanges had taken place offers no basis for concluding that his Honour did not do as he said, namely, determine issues including Nicola’s place in the top echelon of the organization by reference to the evidence which had been put before him in the instant proceedings. He was not obliged uncritically to apply findings by other judges made upon facts put before those other judges, and he expressly declined so to do. No error was manifest and I would dismiss these grounds. 
     
      
    37 Ground 8: The Sentencing Judge erred in finding that the “agreed statement of facts clearly establish that the offender was a member of the top echelon in the organisation”.  
     
      
    38 The written submissions in argument in support of this ground invited this Court to find that his Honour did not make this determination as he had stated that he did, but made his findings on material which had become available to him in his capacity as the presiding judge in the trial of Luigi. This submission was entirely unjustified. A brief reference to some of the salient matters in the agreed statement of facts shows that it was scarcely necessary for his Honour to elaborate this matter. Nicola’s position in the “top echelon” was indisputable.  
     
      
    39 As to the Glen Davis crop, it was an agreed fact that Nicola “had a detailed knowledge of the everyday operation of the plantation”. He was physically present overseeing the harvest and assisting in setting up the arrangements for drying the harvested material. He made a journey to Griffith to obtain some of the clones to grow the crop. He gave instructions to workers as to how to overcome difficulties with water supply and irrigation. Intercepted conversation about supply of a sample showed plain involvement in trying to market the illicit product. He was involved in obtaining provisions including food and bedding for the field hands. He arranged for the hire of plant and vehicles by Mitin, using the latter’s credit card but subsidizing him with cash. As regards the Torrington operation, it was Nicola who gave the instructions, obviously seized of authority up to the level of even giving a direction that the crop be destroyed. It was not suggested that he gave this direction by reason of some change of heart, and the rational alternative would be that a fear had been engendered that the security of the clandestine activity may have been breached. As events turned out it had, but McWhinney had not complied with the direction. 
     
      
    40 This ground should also be rejected.  
     
      
    41 Ground 9: The Sentencing Judge erred in finding that the starting point in Skoran’s case did not apply because Skoran was found to occupy an intermediate level in the cultivation. 
     
      
    42 The intended reference is to R v Skorin [2005] NSWCCA 276. Skorin was not involved in either of the matters concerning Nicola. It was referred to in his Honour’s remarks on sentence because counsel had submitted that that case provided a close “factual scenario”. His Honour was not bound by counsel’s submissions. 
     
      
    43 The contention advanced in support of this ground sought to demonstrate error by his Honour in not choosing a similar starting point for sentence assessment as had been chosen in that case. That approach invited the sort of error identified by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Morgan [1993] 70 A Crim R 368-371 where he observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is quite wrong to compare the sentence under challenge directly with that imposed upon another offender (who is not a co-offender) simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. What must be looked at is whether the challenged sentence is within the range appropriate to the objective gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender, and not whether it is more severe or more lenient than some other sentence (other than that of a co-offender) which merely forms part of that range.” 
        
       
      
    44 His Honour gave reasons for choosing a higher starting point than had been chosen in Skorin and he listed the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The plea of guilty was at the last moment. 
        
       
       
        
        2. There was no assistance offered to the authorities. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Nicola Romano was in the top echelon of the criminal organisation rather than an intermediate one. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The existence of a serious offence on the Form 1.” 
        
       
      
    45 Whilst the inclusion of all of these items was the subject of some criticism, the simple fact is that Skorin does not stand as some sort of arithmetical authority setting a starting point for sentences for offences like to the present. 
     
      
    46 Skorin had pleaded guilty in the lower court and had been committed for sentence. It came before this Court on Crown appeal and the ultimate sentence, to which the present applicant sought to refer, was imposed with the restraint applicable to resentence after a successful Crown appeal. 
     
      
    47 There was no error by his Honour in not adopting the “mathematics” which could be derived from Skorin and this ground has not been sustained.  
     
      
    48 Ground 11: The sentence imposed on the applicant was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    49 This ground was sought to be supported by reference to a range of cases. Reiterating the extract from Morgan cited above, it suffices to observe that for the offence by Nicola, with a necessary reflection of the significant criminality of the offence on the Form 1, the imposition was well within the range of sound sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    50 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    51 I turn to the application by Luigi Romano. 
     
      
    52 Senior counsel who appeared in the appeal indicated that certain grounds previously filed were abandoned and he essentially relied upon grounds numbered 2 and 3. I will also set out ground numbered 1, which was not pressed as such but, as counsel said, it was included in order to “tease out the point made” and “go behind the label and see what the findings actually are”. 
     
      
    53 The grounds as stated were: 
     
      
       
      “1. The Sentencing Judge erred by not assessing the applicant’s role with reference to the relevant standard of proof (beyond reasonable doubt) and failed to give reasons as to why the applicant occupied the role of principal such that one could infer that he found such fact proven beyond reasonable doubt. 
       
      2. The sentence gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant when one compares his sentence to that of Luigi Bonfiglio (and Nicola Romano). 
       
       
      3. If parity does not apply, the sentencing Judge erred in not applying the principles of consistency to ensure there is no justifiable sense of injustice when one compares the applicant’s sentence to that of Luigi Bonfiglio.” 
       
      
    54 It is convenient to deal with these grounds together as the argument was presented in that manner. Bonfiglio was sentenced by Hulme DCJ to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months and a balance term of 1 year 8 months, a total of 4 years 2 months. This was stated to have been reached after an allowance of 35 percent discount for his plea of guilty and assistance to authority. Extrapolation results in the calculation of a notional starting point of a total sentence of a little under 6½ years. The total assessment of sentence for Luigi was 9 years. The essence of the submission was that by reference to the sentence received by Bonfiglio and that received by Nicola (who was involved in two plantations) then comparison with the head sentences would result in an assessment for Luigi “in between” - something in the order of a little over 8 years. 
     
      
    55 It was found by Hulme DCJ that Bonfiglio had decamped from the Glen Davis property when the police raid commenced but he was found later in the day hiding beneath the floor boards of the adjoining property, The Crown which was owned by Caporale. Hulme DCJ determined that Bonfiglio was “a willing lieutenant to the principal offenders in the provision of services and equipment to those at the crop site…and he had people acting under him …”.  
     
      
    56 He then concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am satisfied that whilst his criminal responsibility was at a lesser level than principals such as Nicola and Luigi Romano, it was substantial criminality nonetheless. He is somewhere in the middle echelon of offenders in this syndicate along with the offenders Foti and Caporale.”  
        
       
      
    57 In dealing with Luigi, McGuire A/DCJ referred to Bonfiglio in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “As to Bonfilio (sic), acting on the agreed statement of facts and other material relevant to him, Judge Hulme concluded that Bonfilio (sic) occupied a relatively senior position in the enterprise, albeit that Foti and Caporali (sic) were involved at a much higher level. His Honour was satisfied that he fell somewhere in the middle of the hierarchy, that he was a willing lieutenant to the principal offenders. He also received a reduction in his sentence because of his guilty plea and the considerations attracted by the assistance he rendered to the authorities.” 
        
       
      
    58 That extract shows that his Honour was mistaken in his understanding of the relativity in the criminal hierarchy between Bonfiglio on the one hand and Foti and Caporale on the other, which had been found by Hulme DCJ.  
     
      
    59 It is important to note, however, McGuire A/DCJ expressly referred to the findings as to hierarchy made in relation to various co-offenders and did not draw on Hulme DCJ’s reasons for sentence. In particular he stated that he sentenced Luigi on the evidentiary material admissible against him. Further in his remarks he stated that he “did not believe the principles as to parity were applicable” by which I would take him to have meant, as he explained, that there were differences from the co-offenders in the case of Luigi which made assessing similar sentence for him to them inappropriate. He mentioned the contrast in plea and his own finding that Luigi was a principal in the venture and not a mere lieutenant. 
     
      
    60 It was recognized that comparison with the sentence on Nicola would be affected if his appeal were to be successful on any ground other than those which complained of parity with Luigi. I have proposed that Nicola’s appeal not succeed. 
     
      
    61 The ultimate submission was that the sentence on Luigi should be adjusted downwards to reflect “properly” where his sentence should stand, namely, between those imposed upon Bonfiglio and Nicola. In my opinion the difference between the notional initial assessment for Bonfiglio and that received by Luigi was not so great as to give rise to a justifiable grievance on the part of the latter, having regard to the differences between them. Whether Bonfiglio was equivalent to Foti and Caporale in the hierarchy or lower than them does not alter the situation that his Honour found that Luigi was a principal. Luigi was to be sentenced for what he had done and not by reference only to his place in the hierarchy as such. His Honour described Luigi’s activity and this included discussing the provision of money for the sham transaction transferring the property at Glen Davis into the name of Bulai, the hiring of vehicles, the provision of irrigation equipment, the giving of instructions about horticulture (scissors for leaf harvest) and the guarding of the illicit crop. Luigi travelled twice to Griffith to obtain seedlings and was active in and about the plantation. This conduct is well beyond the totality of activity of Bonfiglio found by Hulme DCJ and for which he was punished. 
     
      
    62 Neither am I persuaded that Luigi can have a justifiable grievance if his sentence is compared to that received by Nicola. Whilst I have rejected the implication in submissions on behalf of Nicola that taking into account of his separate offence would act as a counterbalance to the absence of discount in the case of Luigi who maintained his plea of guilty, I would not regard the respective additions and subtractions such as to result in equivalent impositions. 
     
      
    63 The sentence received by Luigi lay well within the range of the sound exercise of sentencing discretion and I would not regard any lesser sentence as warranted. 
     
      
    64 In the application of Nicola Romano I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    65 In the application of Luigi Romano I would also grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss that appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an appeal against conviction on an indictment charging the supply of a commercial quantity of the prohibited drug heroin. The appellant was tried at Sydney District Court by Ainslie-Wallace DCJ sitting without a jury. Upon conviction her Honour sentenced the appellant to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 10 years with a balance term of 3 years. In the alternative to the appeal against conviction, the appellant seeks leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    2 The Crown case was based upon a supply which took place in Melbourne, Victoria. No issue is raised challenging the necessary geographical nexus and procedural requirements which enabled prosecution in this State pursuant to Pt 1A of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    3 As her Honour found, there was no direct evidence that the appellant supplied drugs and the Crown relied upon proof by circumstance. In brief, in early to mid May 2005 police, pursuant to warrant, intercepted calls on designated telephone services. A number of calls were made between one Sang Pham (also known as Van Diep Pham) who, for present purposes I will refer to as Sang and the appellant. The evidence included formal admission by the appellant pursuant to s 184 of the Evidence Act of the identities of herself and Sang as the speakers on seventeen scheduled intercepted calls.  
     
      
    4 The schedule records the first of these calls on 11 May 2005 when Sang rang the appellant at about 10.50 pm. On the following day (12 May) there were three calls between them, two of which were initiated by the appellant. On the next day (13 May) seven calls were made between them, in five of which the appellant was the caller and on 14 May another seven calls were made, in six of which Sang initiated the calls. As will appear, in the early hours of 15 May, Sang was arrested in Sydney. 
     
      
    5 I shall refer to some of the content of these calls in due course. Also admitted into evidence, but for a limited purpose, were intercepted conversations between Sang and others including Anh-Ba Tran (also known as Thai-Phong and John Xanvi Tran), Truc (also known as Minh or Dao Tan Dung), Ca-Lam (also known as Trieu or “the stutterer”) and Ho or Hoa (a female). Detective Sergeant Cadden testified that, in relation to this investigation, he had been given a compact disc containing approximately one thousand transcribed telephone conversations. 
     
      
    6 On 14 May 2005 (the last day of telephone communication between the appellant and Sang) at 6.14 pm Sang booked a seat on an overnight bus service departing Melbourne at 7 pm for Sydney. Shortly after 4.30 am on 15 May Detective Senior Constables Wilson and Hong were patrolling in the area of Liverpool Bus Terminal. They observed Sang who had alighted from a bus and was making his way towards the railway station and they spoke to him. Ultimately he was detained and searched. He was found to be in possession of two brown packages, each weighing a little over 350 grams, the contents of which were later identified as heroin. Also in his possession was a large amount of cash, which he told the arresting officers was “about $15,000”. Subsequently a count established the amount as $17,200. 
     
      
    7 Sang was charged with supplying a commercial quantity of prohibited drug (heroin) and jointly tried with Anh-Ba on this and other counts of criminal drug supply before Sweeney DCJ and a jury. They were indicted as Pham Van Diep and Tran John Xanvi. They were convicted and sentenced for multiple offences which included a count relating to the drug which Sang had brought with him on the bus from Melbourne, and was the basis of the charge against the appellant. 
     
      
    8 On 31 August 2006 an extra-territorial warrant was executed on the appellant’s premises in Victoria and following a search, arrangements were made for her appearance at Melbourne Magistrates Court. She was there bailed to appear at Sydney Central Local Court on 21 September 2006. She attended and thereafter was taken to Surry Hills Police Station where she was charged with the current offence and again released on bail.  
     
      
    9 The trial was heard between 5 and 14 November 2007 and the appellant was committed into custody on 29 November 2007 when her Honour delivered judgment finding the appellant guilty on the indictment.  
     
      
    10 The appellant lodged a notice relying upon five grounds of appeal against conviction.  
     
      
    11 Ground 1: The case against the appellant is a circumstantial case. Her Honour failed to recognize that the evidence is also reasonably consistent with an alternative scenario consistent with innocence. 
     
      
    12 Her Honour was explicitly alert to the requirements imposed upon her as a fact finder when the Crown relied upon circumstantial evidence. At the outset of her judgment she stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no direct evidence that the accused supplied the drugs to Sang. The Crown relies on a circumstantial case to prove the charged against the accused. In any case where the Crown asks that the guilt of the accused be determined inferentially, I must be satisfied that the conclusion of the accused’s guilt is not only a reasonable conclusion arising from the facts and circumstances established by the evidence but that it is the only reasonable conclusion arising from those facts and circumstances. If at the end of my consideration of the evidence, I find that there is a reasonable conclusion arising from the facts and circumstances established by the evidence which is inconsistent with the guilt of the accused then I must find the accused not guilty of the charge.” 
        
       
      
    13 It was submitted that her Honour formed an unfavourable opinion as to the credibility of the appellant. Undoubtedly she did. Assessing credibility of all witnesses, including the appellant, was part of her role. She gave reasons for her determination that “the evidence of accused is unreliable and she is not to be accepted”. She later stated “the whole of her evidence lacked credibility”.  
     
      
    14 Having made those findings, her Honour was nevertheless alert to avoid the error of using the rejection of the appellant’s testimony to discharge the burden of proof which lay on the Crown. She observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Such are the inconsistencies, the inherent improbabilities and the lack of cogency in her evidence, I am satisfied that the accused is not a credible witness. However, even putting her evidence to one side, I am still required to determine whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and as part of that determination, whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is discussing the supply of two blocks of heroin to Sang and did give him two blocks of heroin.” 
        
       
      
    15 Reference was made to the testimony of the appellant, that her conversations with Sang related, inter alia, to an intended loan, to food and to milk. Further, it was submitted that the possession of $17,200 by Sang when arrested was consistent with the appellant’s description of lending him $20,000 when she last saw him. She also testified to observing him immediately hand two small bundles of cash (a bundle apparently being $1000) to the man Trieu. Obviously those arguments could be advanced and were advanced to her Honour but she rejected the testimony of the appellant and she was not obliged to determine alternative facts and circumstances concerning the cash in Sang’s possession. One of her functions was to determine whether there was any credibility attached to the version advanced by the appellant and she held that there was not. 
     
      
    16 At the hearing of the appeal, some stress was laid upon the finding of the cash in Sang’s possession as supportive of the appellant’s contentions. Leaving aside the somewhat obscure evidence of the appellant concerning the sources of money which she loaned to a man to whom she had been recently introduced by a friend (Doan), a woman whose occupation was piecework clothing manufacture, and the appellant’s involvement in Hui, (which she described as a type of community lending arrangement at high interest), it was scarcely surprising that her Honour was not persuaded to attach credibility to the appellant’s version.  
     
      
    17 It was said that the appellant had loaned $20,000 to this stranger because her friend Doan guaranteed it. Her evidence concerning her reaction to the substantial loss which she claimed was unconvincing. In submissions at the hearing of the appeal it was asserted that the appellant had unsuccessfully sought to recover the money which she claimed to have loaned to Sang from Doan as guarantor. There was little to support this proposition. The appellant gave evidence at her trial and was cross examined on this topic, she gave this evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Has he (Sang) returned any money to you? 
         
        A. No, not even a cent for interest. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Not even 1 cent? 
         
        A. That’s right, not even a cent. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’ve lost the capital and you didn’t earn any interest. Is that right? 
         
        A. That is correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you tell Doan? 
         
        A. I have the lost the telephone number.” 
        
       
      
    18 It is to be recalled that Sang was arrested in May 2005 and the appellant was not approached by police until August 2006. She testified that she had not spoken to Doan during 2006 but had spoken to her “very often” in 2005. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. After you had given the money to Sang, did you ring Doan and tell her that you had given him $20,000, as she had asked you to help? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When did you speak to her? 
         
        A. I talked to her several times but now you’re asking me what date, then I cannot remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When did you first find out that the man Sang was arrested? 
         
        A. About two weeks after. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. After what? 
         
        A. After I gave him the money. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That’s on 14 May, is it? 
         
        A. Only approximate time because I cannot be accurate about the date. That was quite normal things. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Towards the end of May 2005? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did someone tell you? 
         
        A. I rang – I made a phone call asking for the money. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who did you ring? 
         
        A. I rang Doan. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In May? 
         
        A. Just about two or three weeks after that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But you gave Sang three months to pay. 
         
        A. Yes, three months term but he had to pay me interest every month and the interest was $1,000. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In that conversation with Doan, did she indicate to you that she would give you back $20,000 plus interest? 
         
        A. She said to me that she was not going to pay me interest but she would with the principle. (sic).” 
         
        
       
      
    19 The money which the appellant claimed she had given to Sang was said to come from Hui, friends and family (that is to say, her father). She said she had repaid her father because she “always had three Hui and for each of the Hui in a year I would have between twenty and fifty percent interest”. This explanation does not sit comfortably with obtaining any funds from Hui to lend to Sang (and presumably becoming liable to pay interest). Obviously to earn interest one would need to be a lender rather than a borrower. There was no suggestion that the appellant had directed Doan to the Hui so that Doan could fulfil her guarantee to the appellant of the loan allegedly made to Sang. 
     
      
    20 The appellant’s manoeuvring on the subject was further illustrated by this exchange in cross examination: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Didn’t you tell the court last week that, in order to ensure that there was some trust in you, you repaid the money so that your father could give you the money again? 
         
        A. When I was talking to my father over the phone, my father just wanted to check to see if the money was still available,  
         
          
          if the money was still in the Hui or if I had spent money for other things. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Q. When did you speak to your father on the phone? 
         
        A. I did not have to talk to my father over the phone because I went to visit him very often in person. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you say you spoke to your father on the phone? 
         
        A. I’ve just said to him like that, but I didn’t have to prove to him about getting the money and I didn’t have to bring Sang to my father to prove that I’m going to get the money and then lend to this person. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you tell him that a man wanted to borrow money? 
         
        A. No. If I said that, my father wouldn’t have lent me the money. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you told your father a lie? 
         
        A. It doesn’t mean that I lied to my father, but if I needed money for certain things, then that was what I said to him.” 
         
        
       
      
    21 Whilst, as her Honour expressly recognized, the prosecution case could not be proved by the incredibility of the appellant’s testimony, the rejection of it is significant in demonstrating why this ground of appeal should fail. The evidence pointed to as “reasonably consistent” with “innocence” is the appellant’s version of events and as her Honour, the fact finding tribunal, held “the whole of her evidence lacked credibility”. An argument based on facts which have been rejected does not constitute a reasonable alternative to a conclusion of guilt. 
     
      
    22 Her Honour’s conclusion as to the guilt of the appellant was based upon her acceptance of the true import of the conversations between the appellant and Sang. It was submitted that “her Honour allowed her assessment of the credibility of the appellant to be infected” by opinion of Detective Sergeant Cadden that the appellant and Sang were using a code. This opinion is essentially the focus of the challenge on grounds 2 and 3 to which I will turn. I would reject the contention that her Honour’s view was so infected. As she stated, she did not place great weight upon the appellant’s demeanour. Her conclusion of the appellant’s lack of credibility was illustrated by the inherent absence of sense in the exchanges unless, as contended by the Crown, it was intended to communicate something other than what was being said. The explanations offered by the appellant did nothing to alter the situation. If anything, they strengthened the conclusion that the conversationalists were engaged in deliberately obscuring the real topic of the exchanges. It is to be remembered that the appellant claimed Sang was an applicant to her for a loan and there would be no reason to mask their expressions if that were the case. The appellant’s assertion that she refrained from direct reference in case someone overheard her was unsurprisingly rejected by the judge as the tribunal of fact. In a sense, the appellant’s explanation offers a confirmation that the real topic of the conversations was being disguised, however, as her Honour found, even at face value the conversations did not bear the meaning of the appellant lending money to Sang.  
     
      
    23 On their faces, Sang and the appellant discussed haircuts, payment of bills, food, warehousing, going to see grandpa (or maternal grandpa) and, in what might be regarded as the extreme of absurdity given the appellant’s version of the moneylending reason for the association between herself and Sang, the bulk supply of milk by the crate or half crate. 
     
      
    24 There was a vigorous debate at trial between the parties as to whether a Vietnamese word used in connection with milk was to be translated as “crate” or “box”. The debate did not focus on a real issue. The use of “code” is not a word in this context inhering fixed rules. What is involved are two people with a common understanding of what is being communicated between them and the use of words to disguise the topic. This can be identified by a person having relevant experience of words being frequently used to convey some particular meaning.  
     
      
    25 Her Honour made no error such as is complained of in ground 1.  
     
      
    26 Ground 2: The evidence of Sergeant Cadden was based upon reading transcripts of translated telephone calls made in the Vietnamese language. He did not listen to the telephone calls. His evidence as to the existence of a code in the conversations should not have been admitted. 
     
      
    27 So far as the first complaint in this ground is concerned, it is to be noted that, while Detective Sergeant Cadden had some basic knowledge of the Vietnamese language, he did not claim fluency. It would have been futile for him to listen to the intercepts. Had he done so and proffered his opinion as to translation there would no doubt have been a sustainable objection that he was not appropriately qualified.  
     
      
    28 Both the Crown and the appellant called qualified interpreters. Her Honour found preference for the evidence of Mr Nguyen, who was called by the Crown. She gave reasons for this preference which included her appreciation of his attempt to translate the sense of the phrases used, rather than a literal word for word translation. She found the latter, which had been advanced by the interpreter called by the appellant as an approach which (when translated) “rather strained the language”. The finding was clearly within the scope of her Honour’s jurisdiction as a fact finder and no fault in her reasoning process has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    29 The thrust of the appellant’s argument against the admission of Detective Sergeant Cadden’s evidence was contained in ground 3. 
     
      
    30 Ground 3: Sergeant Cadden used conversations between Sang and other people, to which the appellant was not a party, to assist him in coming to the conclusion that some of the words spoken by the appellant were consistent with being a code used in illicit drug undertakings. This breaches the principle in Regina v Nguyen (2007) 173 A Crim R 557. This evidence should not have been admitted. 
     
      
    31 Nguyen was a case where there had been trial by jury and schedules of words used by Vietnamese drug dealers to refer to heroin and particular quantities of it had been put into evidence. The court, approving an earlier decision in R v David, unreported CCA 10 October 1995, held that an expert (with similar experience to that of Detective Sergeant Cadden) would be entitled to give evidence that words could be referring to the supply of heroin etc. but could not give evidence that the words in fact had that meaning. It was noted that one objection to evidence in the latter form would be that it was liable to influence a jury making their own minds. 
     
      
    32 The evidence of Detective Sergeant Cadden was given in terms of his experience as to the use of words commonly to describe various aspects of drug trafficking. He did not purport to assert absolutes. He also acknowledged that some of the expressions were new to him. Her Honour dealt with these issues and in her judgment and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Detective Cadden had considered all of the telephone calls which were tendered and said that he believed the parties were using coded terms for drugs and amounts of drugs. In particular, he said that the words ‘old man’ were commonly used as a reference to one block, 350 g of heroin and the words ‘kids’ and ‘little kids’ were often used to refer to ounces of heroin. He said that a common term for methylamphetamine, or ice, was the word ‘glasses’ or ‘eyebrow’. There was no challenge to this evidence.  
        
       
       
        
        There were three areas in which his opinion was challenged. In relation to the conversations in which the accused spoke of ‘grandpa’, Detective Cadden’s opinion was that she was using a coded reference to heroin. While there was no challenge to Detective Cadden’s evidence that the term ‘old man’ is commonly used as a coded reference to heroin, he expressed the opinion that when the accused and others and Sang in the intercepted calls used the word ‘grandpa’, or ‘maternal grandpa’, they too were codes for heroin. Detective Cadden said that he had not heard the word ‘grandpa’ used in reference to heroin before considering the conversations in this matter. He extrapolated this from his experience of the use of the words, ‘old man’. However, he said that in coming to that conclusion, he took into account that in conversation between Sang and others, Sang used the words ‘old man’ and ‘grandpa’, as if they were interchangeable, which persuaded him that the word ‘grandpa’ was code for heroin. In call 7 Sang said, ‘Anyway, we get it done and then take Grandpa and Grandma, the old men, you know’. Detective Cadden said that this cemented the association between the word ‘Grandpa’ and ‘Old man’ and firmed his opinion that it was code for heroin. 
        
       
       
        
        The second area in which his opinion was challenged was the use by Sang in call 19 to the accused of the word ‘foodstuff’. In that conversation between Sang and the accused, the accused first said to Sang, ‘What time do you want to go and eat hotpot in Springvale?’ There was then some conversation about Sang contacting a person or persons who had spoken to the accused. The accused suggested they go at about 7pm. Sang then said, ‘No, can you come over here. Not home. Can you come and take me up there…to get the….foodstuff to make it even?’ The accused said, ‘Yeah.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Detective Cadden said that he had heard the words ‘food’ and ‘eating’ often used as code for the purchase of drugs. He had not heard the word ‘foodstuff’ as code for drugs used before. His opinion that Sang was talking about drugs was based on that experience and that he believed ‘foodstuff’ to be a logical extrapolation from ‘food’. He also took into account that the conversation appeared to be guarded and because the accused had already spoken about hotpot, he saw no reason for Sang to be guarded. 
        
       
       
        
        As to the guarded nature of the conversation, Detective Cadden based that on the form in which the transcript appeared. He does not speak Vietnamese and had not listened to the conversations as recorded. He said that where three dots appeared between words, he took that as reflecting a guarded or hesitant manner of speaking. Mr Nguyen, the translator who made these transcripts, said that when typing the transcripts, he inserted three dots to signify several things – when one party was speaking and the other party interjected he puts dots to show that the first party continued to speak after the interjection; when one party paused slightly between words, he inserted dots to signify that; if one person spoke at the same time as another, Mr Nguyen puts dots in the transcript to indicate that. It was not suggested to Detective Cadden that the three dots could have a meaning other than to reflect pauses. However, accepting Mr Nguyen’s evidence that the insertion of three dots could mean a number of things, I do not propose to give weight to Detective Cadden’s view that the pauses between the words in this conversation, and presumably others, reflected that the parties were speaking in a guarded way. 
        
       
       
        
        In call 20, the accused rang Sang and asked, ‘Was it a crate of milk that they want or half a crate?’ Sang replied, ‘One crate, I guess’. The accused said, ‘Can you get onto them and then ring me?’ Mr Nguyen translated the word ‘crate’ rather than some other container to give sense to that conversation. Ms Nguyen preferred the word ‘box’ which Mr Nguyen accepted. Detective Cadden said that he had not heard the word ‘crate of milk’ used as code for drugs although he believed he had heard the word ‘crate’ alone used as code. As to the word ‘box’, he said that it immediately registered as code to him because the weight of the drug ice is often referred to as ‘a box’. He could not say whether this conversation was code for ice or not, because in another conversation, call 22, Sang said, ‘It’s going to be one box. One old man will taken away’. This caused Detective Cadden to consider whether the word ‘box’ was being used to refer to heroin rather than ice. He nonetheless maintained that it was code for drugs. 
        
       
       
        
        It was suggested that the opinion of Detective Cadden should not be accepted where it is, in effect, an extrapolation from known code to other words. One imagines that the use of code by those engaged in the drug trade is not static and codes change from time to time. That an association was new to Detective Cadden does not cause me to discount it. In considering the evidence of Detective Cadden, it is important to bear in mind that sometimes ordinary words bear their ordinary meaning. 
        
       
       
        
        On the basis of Detective Cadden’s expertise, and on consideration of the content of the calls, I accept him that the words ‘Grandpa’, ‘maternal Grandpa’, ‘foodstuff’ and ‘crate’ or ‘box of milk’ are codes for heroin and supply of heroin. I accept this evidence even though he had not heard those particular variations of code before. The similarity and the context of their use in the conversations between Sang and others led him to the view that they were coded references to drugs. Based on my acceptance of his evidence concerning the use of codes, I am satisfied that Sang and the other people to whom he was speaking in the intercepted conversations were discussing him obtaining ‘two old men’, or two blocks of heroin.” 
         
        
       
      
    33 No error of approach or of determination by her Honour has been shown.  
     
      
    34 The complaint first articulated in ground 3 is allied to the complaints in grounds 4 and 5. 
     
      
    35 Ground 4: Her Honour was in error in admitting the evidence of the contents of telephone calls intercepted between the man Sang and others to which the appellant was not a party. The evidence of these telephone conversations is hearsay evidence. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 
      : Her Honour used the hearsay evidence referred to in 4 above in establishing the guilt of the appellant. 
       
      
    36 As above observed, her Honour admitted the evidence only for a limited purpose and she made this plain: 
     
      
       
        
        “In this case, the accused was not charged that she committed the crime in concert with the others to whom Sang was speaking. That being the case, the calls to which the accused is not a party are admitted for a limited purpose. The Crown has relied on those conversations to give a context to the calls made between the accused and Sang. The Crown also relies on those calls to establish a geographical nexus between the crime allegedly committed by the accused in Melbourne and Sydney which would enable the matter to be tried in this jurisdiction. 
        
       
       
        
        It was suggested that the court might come to the view that Sang and the other people were talking about drugs. If I came to that conclusion, that would not of itself permit me to conclude that Sang and the accused must therefore be speaking about drugs. Equally, if I came to the view that in some of the calls the accused and Sang were speaking about the drug ice, that of itself could not lead to a conclusion that she and Sang also spoke about the supply of heroin. So too in the conversations between Sang and the others where Sang, after speaking to the accused goes on to speak to others, it is not to be assumed that the accused knew what passed between Sang and the others. In considering these calls, I have kept that limited purpose clearly in mind.” 
         
        
       
      
    37 As appears within the extract from her Honour’s judgment earlier set out Detective Sergeant Cadden used the conversations between Sang and others as one of his resources for an understanding of the meanings of words and expressions which were used in the conversations between Sang and the appellant. That recourse was an ordinary aspect of qualification for an expertise which is gained by experience. For example, if it can be deduced that when Sang and Anh-Ba are conversing and referring to an old man, they are referring to heroin, it would be open to someone like Detective Sergeant Cadden to draw upon that as a resource for the possible meaning of that expression when used by others. It was for her Honour to determine whether in the context of the conversation between Sang and the appellant, that was the meaning they were intending to communicate between themselves. 
     
      
    38 None of grounds 3, 4 or 5 has been sustained. 
     
      
    39 I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    40 The appellant seeks leave to appeal against sentence. The imposition by her Honour was guided by a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and the prescription of a standard non-parole period of 10 years.  
     
      
    41 Three grounds have been expressed. The first ground contended that the sentence was manifestly excessive. It was submitted “that her Honour allowed herself to have too much regard to the standard non-parole period when assessing the appropriate term for imprisonment. It is submitted that her Honour considered it more a starting point than merely a reference or guide.” The submission misapprehended the statutory obligation which, in the case of an offence in the mid range of objective seriousness requires the imposition of a standard non-parole period unless the Court determines that there are reasons not to: s 54B (2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The submission appears to confuse what was said by the Court in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 when observing that although the standard non-parole period may be directly applicable after conviction following trial, it remains a guidepost even if by reason of a plea of guilty or otherwise there is reason to depart from the standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    42 For reasons which she gave, her Honour determined that this offence fell within the mid range of seriousness for offences of this type. That finding has not been challenged. Within the tenor of the terms of the provision it was clearly the intention of Parliament to limit the discretions of sentencing judges and reference, as was made, to patterns of sentence developed in the absence of standard non-parole period prescriptions have to be gauged in that light.  
     
      
    43 A number of submissions were made that her Honour failed to give sufficient weight to matters upon which the appellant sought to call in mitigation. No specific error was identified. It is true that there was no evidence of discernible benefit received by the appellant and her Honour expressly found that there was no evidence of financial benefit but there was some counterbalance to this in her further finding that the offence was not committed by the appellant to support any personal drug use or need. 
     
      
    44 It is complained that by reason of the appellant’s non English speaking background the conditions of custody would be more onerous. There was no evidence to this effect. In fact, there was evidence that the appellant had worked on a casual basis for a lawyer assisting in his communication with Vietnamese speaking clientele.  
     
      
    45 Complaint is made about putting weight on “inadmissible material” in the intercepted telephone calls. The question of admissibility has been dealt with in relation to the conviction appeal. There was nothing in her Honour’s remarks on sentence to indicate that she placed any particular weight upon the evidence of the calls between Sang and others when she approached the issue of sentence in accordance with the finding of guilt which she had made upon the whole of the evidence. 
     
      
    46 No error has been shown in her Honour’s conclusion that she did not find reason to depart from fixing the standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    47 The second ground asserted that her Honour failed to have sufficient regard to the principle of parity. Her Honour was aware of the sentences imposed upon Sang and Anh-Ba by Sweeney DCJ, which included other offences as well as the offence in which the appellant was involved. The effective overall sentence received by Sang was a non-parole period of 10 years 6 months with a balance term of 3 years 6 months. There was an unsuccessful Crown appeal asserting the inadequacy of the sentences received by him: [2008] NSWCCA 194. Anh-Ba received an effective sentence of 12 years non-parole period with a balance term of 4 years for his multiple offending. 
     
      
    48 In isolation, the imposition upon each of Sang and Anh-Ba for the offence involving the appellant was a non-parole period of 9 years with a balance term of 3 years. In that regard her Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was submitted on behalf of the offender that her sentence should be less than that imposed on Sang and Ahn Bah. (sic) I am not persuaded that this should be the case. In any event it is important to note that Sang’s sentence for this offence was moderated by her Honour Judge Sweeney after taking the totality of the sentence into account. I am of the view that the offender’s criminality is at least equal to that of Sang. 
        
       
       
        
        I can find no reason to depart from the stated (sic: standard) non parole period in this case and I propose to sentence the offender to a non-parole period of ten years.” 
         
        
       
      
    49 I am unpersuaded that the appellant can harbour a justifiable sense of grievance by comparing the sentences received by co-offenders. The difference was observed and in the light of her Honour’s unchallenged finding as to the range of seriousness in which the appellant’s offending stands, there was no error in her giving effect to the statutory provision as to standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    50 The third contention was that her Honour breached the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. It was submitted that her Honour erred by elevating the criminality of the appellant on the basis that this was not an isolated offence. De Simoni was a case concerning the West Australian Criminal Code where it was held that when an indictment does not refer to particular circumstances of aggravation, a judge in imposing sentence may have regard to those circumstances only if they would not render the offender liable to a greater punishment pursuant to the Code. The principle, however, has been applied in common law jurisdictions.  
     
      
    51 The remarks by her Honour which are now sought to be impugned were: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was able to source and pay for considerable quantities of heroin. Examination of the calls shows that she very quickly arranged the first block of heroin but there was a delay while she made arrangements for a second. Apparently when the offender went to collect one block she found that she had to pay more than she had originally thought and $20,000 more had to be paid before she could get the heroin. The offender had the capacity to pay for the heroin and to arrange for the funds. She was confident that she could supply the heroin to Sang because when he was concerned about the delay she assured him that she would be able to provide it. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this offence was not isolated. It is clear from the conversations that were recorded between her and Sang that she knew what to do to source the heroin. In making that finding I do not intend to punish the offender for crimes committed perhaps and not charged, that finding aids a determination of objective seriousness and is also relevant to a determination of whether the offence was committed as an isolated lapse of judgment. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was not.” 
        
       
      
    52 There is nothing in those remarks which demonstrates a breach of the principle in De Simoni. It was a legitimate element of sentence assessment for her Honour to consider and make a finding whether this had been an isolated occurrence. She found that it was not. She did not punish the appellant for any other offence nor did she impermissibly elevate the seriousness of the index offence. She assessed its seriousness in the terms stated. No error has been shown. 
     
      
    53 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
      (2) Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted, but that appeal also dismissed.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Lynne Maree Thurlow appears for sentence today on two serious offences. They are related to each other. The first and most serious is an offence of aggravated break enter and steal. The second offence is one of possessing house breaking implements. The house breaking implements were used as part of the aggravated break enter and steal offence, so in view of that overlap she will receive no extra punishment because of the housebreaking implements matter.2 On 18 June Ms Thurlow and her de facto husband, Mr Boyd, went out fishing. They had an argument and Mr Boyd walked off. Ms Thurlow was then taken, some time later, by a friend of Mr Boyd’s called Chris, to where Mr Boyd was. He was in fact near or at a public school in Balmain East. When they got there Ms Thurlow said she needed to use the toilet, therefore she says Mr Boyd helped her climb over the fence into the school. She used the toilet and when she came out she found that Mr Boyd had come up with the idea of breaking into one of the classrooms and stealing some electrical equipment inside. I say at once that this is a rather different version to that given by Mr Boyd when I sentenced him last year. His evidence was that the idea to break into the school did not come up after he had helped Ms Thurlow across the fence in order to use the toilet. His evidence was that there was much more forethought and planning. However that evidence has not been admitted on the sentence proceedings. Ms Thurlow’s evidence as to the circumstances in which the offence was committed is uncontested and I will therefore sentence her on the basis of the evidence that she gave rather than the evidence that Mr Boyd gave earlier.3 In any case, returning to the narrative of what occurred, she and Mr Boyd did break into a classroom. They took a large flat screen television and a VCR. In breaking in they had obviously set off an alarm because as they were carrying the TV and VCR away they noticed police who had attended at the school. They tried to run away. Mr Boyd was more successful than Ms Thurlow. Ms Thurlow climbed over a fence, it was 1.8 metres high but on the far side of it the ground dropped away. She landed on a footpath that was about two and a half metres below. She broke both her knees and bears the consequences of those injuries to this day. Some might think it is poetic justice that in the course of committing an offence such as this the offender was injured. In any case it is, I am satisfied, a form of extra curial punishment that the offender has suffered. I will return to the consequences for her in a little while.4 Quite clearly Ms Thurlow was unable to run further after she had broken her knees. She was arrested, and said to police who arrested her that they broke in because they were desperate and took a TV and a DVD player. She also admitted that she had a bag with tools in it which she had dropped. She was taken to hospital where she spent seven weeks before being released. She has had a number of operations and will require two more operations in the future. There is some contradictory evidence as to the extent of her recovery from her injuries but even on the most favourable view, that is even on the view suggesting that Ms Thurlow has recovered to the stage where she is able to walk pain free, that being the report of Dr Tan, there is still the question of further operations that are required. Even if she has made a full recovery she has endured much already as a result of the injuries to her knees caused when she was running away from police.5 As I said when sentencing Mr Boyd this is an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I referred when sentencing Mr Boyd to the reasons that that is so. I placed particular emphasis on the fact that an educational institution was the target of the offender’s crime. Fortunately the TV and VCR were recovered, they were re-installed a few days later. The finding that this is an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness is of course related to the fact that the aggravated break enter and steal offence carries with it a standard non-parole period of five years. That standard non-parole period is not of direct application because of the plea of guilty but it does remain as a guidepost or a benchmark which I must have regard to in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon this offender. It is undeniable that by choosing this offence as one which carries with it a standard non-parole period the legislature is requiring and expecting that offences such as these are treated more seriously than they have been in the past. 6 The offender is now thirty-seven years of age. Her criminal history is relevant. She is certainly not a first offender by any means but she has not committed any offence approaching this seriousness. She has never spent any time in custody and her most serious offence was dealt with by way of community service. There is a large gap in her criminal history between her last offence and the present. In the meantime she was working until she suffered an injury at work when she fell down some stairs, it was an injury to her back. She has, I am satisfied, good prospects of rehabilitation. The gap in her record that Mr Kozonechi pointed out is perhaps the most important matter which has led to me making that finding. I am satisfied also that she is remorseful. She said that whilst in hospital she wrote a letter to the principal of the school expressing her remorse. There was no challenge to that evidence from the Crown. 7 Ms Thurlow clearly has a problem with alcohol. She says that the reason that the offence was intended was simply so that they, she and Mr Boyd, could buy more alcohol. She said that in the past she has used drugs and alcohol to block out painful thoughts from her childhood. That childhood is referred to in a psychological report which was tendered by Mr Kozonechi. For obvious reasons Ms Thurlow did not want Mr Kozonechi to ask questions about aspects of that history in open court, however the offender did say that the factual material contained within the report was true. One can then understand why an offender such as Ms Thurlow might use drugs and alcohol to block out painful thoughts from her childhood. She might be forgiven for thinking about resorting to drugs and alcohol in order to do so.8 Of course principles of parity arise here. The offender should not feel that when she compares the sentence imposed upon her with that I imposed upon Mr Boyd she has a justifiable sense of grievance. There are a number of differences. Ms Thurlow, unlike Mr Boyd was not on conditional liberty at the time of this offence. Her record is much less serious. Mr Boyd had prior offences of break enter and steal and property offences and had served time in gaol for supplying drugs. On the basis of the evidence presented to me the offence was not her idea and again on the evidence presented to me there was much less forethought and planning put into this enterprise. Those differences in my mind justify the difference between the sentence I imposed upon Mr Boyd and the sentence I will impose upon the offender. I think I might have mentioned the offender pleaded guilty at an early opportunity, indeed she made admissions whilst lying on the ground awaiting the ambulance. Accordingly I will discount the sentence I would otherwise impose by about twenty-five per cent to reflect that circumstance.9 Mr Kozonechi asked that I deal with this matter by way of a suspended sentence, I am not going to do that for two reasons. First is that the length of the sentence I have chosen precludes the imposition of a sentence of that type. Even if there was not that statutory bar I consider that the offence is so serious that there needs to be a component of genuine punishment to be visited upon this offender. After determining the appropriate length of sentence I am satisfied that a period of custody is required. I am satisfied there are special circumstances in this case, it will be the offender’s first time in custody. I also determine that it is appropriate this sentence be served by way of periodic detention. I am satisfied that although the offender could receive the medical treatment she will need in the future whilst in custody the problems that she will face in the future with her need for operations, the prospects of the offender being rehabilitated which will be enhanced if she is able to work Monday to Friday mean that periodic detention is the most appropriate outcome.10 The order I make is this, the offence of aggravated break enter and steal the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months with a head sentence of two and a half years. For the offence of possessing house breaking implements the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of six months, that is a fixed term because of the other sentence. I order that both sentences are to be served by way of periodic detention and the offender is to attend the Wollongong or Unanderra, however it is described, Probation and Parole Centre at 8.30 am on 21 March 2009 in order to commence serving her sentence and thereafter to attend that Periodic Detention Centre every Friday evening thereafter as directed. 11 Now Ms Thurlow the gentlemen here will take you downstairs into custody while some paperwork is filled out but you will then be released within a short time. When you commence serving your periodic detention it is important that you attend because if you do not what will happen is that the sentence will become a full-time custodial sentence. It will not be a question of you going every weekend, you will be there seven days a week and seven nights as well.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 BLANCH J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: The applicant was sentenced in the District Court for an offence of specially aggravated break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence contrary to s 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. The serious indictable offence alleged was assault occasioning actual bodily harm and the special aggravation was that the applicant was in company with a person who was armed with a shotgun. The maximum penalty prescribed for such an offence is 25 years imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of sentence of 3 years dating from 22 June 2007. The applicant is eligible for release to parole on 21 June 2013. 
     
      
    4 There is only one ground of appeal that asserts that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    5 The facts can be stated briefly. The applicant went with three other men to a unit at North Richmond in order to obtain money. The applicant was armed with a baseball bat and a co-offender was armed with a shotgun. That weapon had been loaded and test-fired in the applicant’s presence on the journey. At about 4.20am the applicant and two co-offenders entered the premises by kicking in the door. They were wearing items of clothing to disguise their appearance. There were four persons residing in the premises at the time. 
     
      
    6 The applicant armed with the baseball bat entered a bedroom where one of the residents was in bed. The applicant struck him four times with the bat to the head and arms causing bruising and lacerations that later required stitching. The applicant forced this man into the kitchen where he became involved in a struggle with him and another resident. They managed to disarm the applicant and he was struck with the baseball bat and a machete causing him lacerations to the head.  
     
      
    7 During this altercation the co-offender armed with the shotgun entered the kitchen and discharged the weapon into the wall. This did not cause the residents to stop their struggle with the applicant so the co-offender discharged the weapon again but this time in the direction of the residents although no one was struck. The co-offender then left the premises. A second co-offender who was armed with a knife threatened one of the residents before also leaving the premises. The residents tried to detain the applicant and the gun was again discharged this time into the front door. The applicant was then able to escape. 
     
      
    8 The applicant was arrested as a result of DNA material and his fingerprints obtained from the flat. The co-offender with the gun was recognised by one of the residents and calls on his mobile phone were intercepted. The woman who drove the vehicle to the unit was interviewed and nominated the applicant as one of the offenders. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was born on 19 May 1988 and was aged 18 years at the time of the offence. He was subject to good behaviour bonds as a result of offences of malicious damage to property dealt with in February 2007 in the Local Court. There was a psychological report in evidence but there was little in the applicant’s background of relevance although as a child he had been diagnosed with an attention deficit disorder for which he was given medication. The applicant was at the time of the offending using amphetamines on a regular basis. The psychologist reported that the applicant was remorseful and had been attempting to address his drug usage while in custody. 
     
      
    10 The Judge described the offence as “of very considerable criminality” and noted aggravating features in that the offence was planned, was committed in company, the shotgun was loaded, there were a number of victims, multiple criminal acts, and that people were residing in the premises. He concluded that the offence was “well above the mid range”. He noted that the offence was committed while the applicant was subject to conditional liberty. However he took into account in mitigation that the applicant had no significant criminal record, that he had shown remorse and he had good prospects of rehabilitation. He also took into account that the applicant had pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    11 The Judge indicated that he was departing from the standard non-parole period because of the plea of guilty, the applicant’s remorse and, because of his young age, the greater need for rehabilitation. Having considered the statistical information from the Judicial Commission, his Honour then stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “It seems to me that in dealing with this matter a proper course would be to take something in the order of fourteen years as a total head sentence, having regard to the nature of the offence. If one then discounts that to take into account the plea of guilty, the remorse and your age and your previous good record, it seems to me that one derives a sentence of something in order of a total term of nine years and non-parole period needs to be fixed in that context.” 
        
       
       
      With respect this passage appears to contain a two-stage approach to sentencing contrary to what was said by the majority of the High Court in  
      Makarian v The Queen 
       [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [39]. 
       
      
    12 However the applicant makes no complaint about that passage except that it is contended that the starting point of 14 years was too high. It was conceded that “the offence was very serious and that a significant sentence was required to be imposed” but the submission is that the sentence gives insufficient weight to the subjective matters particularly the applicant’s age, remorse and the guilty plea. 
     
      
    13 The applicant relies upon statistical information, presumably the same, or similar to, that which was placed before the sentencing Judge. As I have previously noted in this Court, and as the Judge commented, reference to that material in standard non-parole period cases usually indicates that the sentences that have been imposed are remarkably lenient. They reveal that in most cases insufficient regard is apparently being given to the standard non-parole period as any sort of guide. However, it is the application of the principles that have arisen in relation to the application of the standard non-parole period provisions that will inform the court as to the appropriate range for the sentence and not necessarily reliance upon statistics. If this is an apparent conflict between the statistics and the standard non-parole, the latter is the most reliable guide. 
     
      
    14 The applicant also calls in aid decisions of this Court in other cases in an attempt to show that the sentence is outside the available range and that the sentencing discretion must have miscarried even though no error is attributed to the Judge. But the matter that sets this offence apart from those to which the applicant referred was the firing of the shotgun on three occasions in close proximity to the residents. 
     
      
    15 If the Judge was correct in deciding that the facts in this case placed the offence “well-above mid range”, and it is not suggested by the applicant that it was not open to the Judge to come to that assessment, then the standard non-parole period has less importance as a guide to the appropriate sentence than the maximum penalty for the offence. 
     
      
    16 R v Mitchell and Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; 177 A Crim R 94 was concerned with a different offence but one where, like the present, there was a maximum penalty of 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years. There it was held: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [37] Where a particular case falls well above the mid-range of offending, the standard non-parole period will have less significance as a guidepost and more attention should be directed to the maximum penalty in determining the appropriate sentence. This must be so otherwise an offence falling within the worst category of case, and so notionally attracting the maximum penalty, would be drawn away from that point by the standard non-parole period and a court could never impose the maximum penalty. This does not mean that the standard non-parole period loses all relevance and it may still have work to do as a guide to determining the non-parole period. So, for example, with an offence of objective seriousness well above mid-range it may be unlikely that, even after a discount for the plea of guilty, or a consideration of the subjective circumstances of the offender or a finding of special circumstances the result would be a non-parole of, or below, the standard non-parole period prescribed. 
         
         
        [38] Of course when the maximum penalty is the principal factor used as a guide in determining the appropriate sentence rather than the standard non-parole period, the court is then considering primarily what the total term of the sentence should be. The court determines as against the maximum penalty, and taking into account that this is the prima facie sentence for an offence falling within the worst category of offending encompassed by the section, how serious is the criminality in the particular case and how much of the maximum penalty is warranted having regard to all relevant sentencing considerations including of course those matters specified in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the purposes of sentencing as set out in s 3A of that Act. 
        
       
      
    17 In the present case the Judge should have considered what sentence would have been appropriate to be imposed by a consideration of both the objective seriousness of the offence and the subjective case and before taking into account the discount for the plea of guilty. In determining that starting point he should have had regard chiefly to the maximum penalty. He then would have turned his mind to setting the non-parole period bearing in mind the applicable standard non-parole period as a guide. In my view, notwithstanding the young age of the applicant, the Judge would not have been in error in deciding that the appropriate sentence was 14 years before applying the discount for the guilty plea. If that had been his Honour’s approach, the applicant would have been faced with a heavier sentence than that which was imposed upon him. 
     
      
    18 The only matter that kept this offence from being towards the top of the range on an assessment of the objective criminality of cases coming within the section was the fact that the “serious indictable offence” alleged was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. That is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years and is at the lowest range of offences that could fall within the scope of “serious indictable offence” for the purposes of s 112(3). The relevance of the nature of the offence which was to be committed after breaking and entering the premises was considered by Simpson J in R v Huynh [2005] NSWCCA 220. That was an offence contrary to s 112(2) and the serious indictable offence was larceny, which also carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. Her Honour held that the fact that the offence was one that just fell within the scope of a “serious indictable offence” did not prevent a particular instance of the offence from falling within the mid-range of seriousness even though there could be more serious examples of offences falling within the scope of that section. As her Honour noted, the sentencing court looks at all the surrounding circumstances when assessing the degree of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    19 Because the offence was so serious less regard could be had to the applicant’s age, his lack of relevant criminal record and his prospects of rehabilitation. The sentence imposed by his Honour was a heavy one but it cannot be said that it fell outside of his discretion. 
     
      
    20 I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

      Friday 13 March 2009 
       
       
       
      2006/5489 R v PJS 
       
       
       
      REASONS FOR SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 20 October 2008 PJS was arraigned on a charge that on 29 October 2005 he murdered CB. He pleaded not guilty and a jury trial ensued. On 4 November 2008 the jury found him guilty of murder. 
     
      
    2 The factual background is as follows. In 2004 the offender entered into a relationship with JK. She had two daughters, D and CB. In August of that year the four of them moved into a rented house in Gorokan, on the central coast. In June 2005 the offender and JK were married. They were still living in the Gorokan house at the time of the offence. D was nine years old and the victim, CB, was three. 
     
      
    3 29 October 2005 was a Sunday. After breakfast JK prepared lunch for her two daughters. She and the offender then went out, leaving the two girls alone at home. The offender was hoping to start a concreting business at that time. He and JK had been planning to do some work towards the new business, but instead went to a hotel in the Toukley area. According to JK, the offender drank a considerable amount of beer. She was not drinking as she was pregnant. An argument developed between them and the offender left in the car, taking with him JK’s mobile phone. She was not prepared to return home, so she arranged to stay at a local refuge for the night. 
     
      
    4 It appears that the offender went straight home from the hotel, and that he remained there for the rest of the afternoon and evening, except for one trip back to the hotel a little before 5.00 pm, when he bought three bottles of VB long-necks. A neighbour gave evidence that on two occasions that evening, at about 6.00 to 6.30, and again at about 8.00 to 8.30, D came to her home and asked for beer and cigarettes for her father. On each occasion the neighbour gave her cigarettes and a bottle of home-brewed beer. 
     
      
    5 At 9.40 that evening a triple-0 call was made by the offender’s next door neighbour, complaining that the man next door had been making a lot of noise for a long time. She said: “He’s got a little girl in there about three, and she has been screaming for over half an hour”. Later in the call she said: “I can’t understand what he’s doing to the little child, and he keeps screaming “Get up, get up”. In her evidence, which was read to the jury, the neighbour said: “I heard a lot of banging going on, like the walls were being broken and a lot of crockery being thrown around”. 
     
      
    6 A little after 11.00 pm the offender knocked on the door of another neighbour’s home, and asked the occupants to call the police and the ambulance as his daughter was not breathing. 
     
      
    7 At 11.13 pm the first police arrived at the scene. CB was lying on her back on the kitchen floor. D was kneeling over her crying. The ambulance arrived shortly afterwards. All attempts to resuscitate CB were unsuccessful. 
     
      
    8 After the police arrived, and during the resuscitation attempts, the offender and D were kept outside the house. The offender was reported on a number of occasions to have said to D words to the effect of: “What did you do to her, what did you do to your sister?” to which she replied: “Nothing”. During this period the offender’s demeanour was described by police officers as generally being aggressive and abusive, interspersed with periods when he was crying and introverted. He became particularly upset and aggressive after being told that CB was dead, at which point he punched the side of the house and said to D: “Go on, tell them what you did”. The offender was variously assessed as being “mildly” intoxicated to “moderately to well” intoxicated. 
     
      
    9 Numerous photographs of the house were tendered before the jury. These showed, amongst other things, considerable damage to the gyprock walls in the dining room, as well as to the bedroom and the bathroom doors. The evidence indicated that this damage must have been caused on the evening of CB’s death. Considerable force must have been used to cause at least some of this damage. 
     
      
    10 There were bloodstains in various parts of the house, including the bathroom, the dining room and the kitchen. It appeared that an attempt had been made to clean some of the blood using a kitchen sponge. A knife was found in the kitchen bin with CB’s blood on the blade. 
     
      
    11 Post-mortem examination revealed that CB had sustained a very large number of blunt force injuries. Indeed, they were too numerous to quantify. These had been inflicted at much the same time (or at least within the space of a few hours), and required the application of considerable force. Although many injuries were seen on the trunk and limbs, the focus of the assault was on the child’s head. A number of sharp force injuries had also been sustained. These appeared to have been produced by a short-bladed and sharp-pointed instrument, such as the knife found in the kitchen bin. There were literally hundreds of bruises on CB’s body and severe haemorrhaging into her brain. 
     
      
    12 On 11 November 2005 the offender was arrested and charged with CB’s murder. He has been in custody ever since. 
     
      
    13 There was no suggestion at the offender’s trial that any outsider had come into the home and inflicted the fatal injuries on CB. Indeed, this hypothesis was effectively excluded. This left only the offender as the killer or D, who was then nearly ten years old. D always denied involvement in her sister’s killing.  
     
      
    14 D had three interviews with the police. The first was in the early hours of the morning of 30 October 2005. She said that she had gone to bed, when she heard the offender call out for her “D, come quickly”. She went out to the kitchen where her sister was lying on the floor with blood on her face. Her father gave her the phone and asked her to ring the ambulance, which she did. She said that, earlier in the evening before she had gone to bed, the offender was in the kitchen reading the paper and watching the TV. CB was on the toilet. The offender normally put CB on the toilet before she went to bed, D said. She said that she loved her sister and that they had never been violent to each other. 
     
      
    15 The second interview took place a little over a year later, on 3 November 2006. This was a brief interview which took the matter no further. Finally, on 21 August 2007, nearly twenty-two months after the event, D said that before she went to bed that night the offender had hit her and she had fallen onto the floor, injuring her hand. Later, when she was in her bedroom, she heard the offender and her sister screaming and shouting. Some time later, the offender asked her to come out and she saw CB lying on the floor. The offender was pushing her chest, trying to resuscitate her. He told D to ring the ambulance, which she did. She saw a baseball bat underneath the kitchen table. Before the police arrived the offender hid the bat behind the door. She said that she had not given these details earlier as she was frightened of the offender. 
     
      
    16 I should interpolate here that the medical evidence at trial indicated that it was unlikely that a baseball bat had been used to inflict any of the injuries on CB. 
     
      
    17 During the offender’s trial, the thrust of the defence case was that it must have been D who inflicted the fatal injuries upon CB. The offender did not give evidence, but the defence called three witnesses who were experts in the fields of clinical psychology and forensic pathology. Their evidence was designed to add weight to the possibility that CB’s injuries were inflicted by a person of D’s age and size. The jury’s verdict indicates that it rejected this proposition. 
     
      
    18 The offender was represented by counsel at his trial. After his conviction he terminated the services of that counsel and sought alternative representation through Legal Aid. This was not forthcoming and the offender was given a choice of being represented during the sentencing proceedings by his previous counsel or being unrepresented. He chose the latter. As a result, few of the matters relevant to sentence which would normally be addressed on behalf of an offender were put before the Court. The offender tendered a number of testimonials and affidavits. These testified to some of his past difficulties and to the strength he has shown in surmounting them. I shall be referring to these later. However, the overall thrust of almost all these testimonials was to assert the offender’s innocence of this offence. Similarly, the offender himself addressed the court asserting his innocence and referring to the “huge miscarriage” which had occurred during the course of the trial. I told him at the time that I was required to sentence him according to the jury’s verdict. Material which effectively cavilled at that verdict could not be taken into account on sentence. 
     
      
    19 Also tendered on sentence was a pre-sentence report from the Probation and Parole Service and a report prepared on behalf of the offender by Dr John McMahon, clinical psychologist. Between these reports and the various references tendered by the defence, a reasonably detailed picture emerges of the offender’s background. 
     
      
    20 The offender is now aged 33, having been born on 22 June 1975. His father was a Magistrate, who was very distant with the offender and his younger sister. There was a great deal of violence in the home, primarily directed by the offender’s father at his mother, but sometimes at the offender himself. His parents separated when he was seven years old, following which he lost contact with his father. 
     
      
    21 The offender and his younger sister were raised by their mother until, when he was in his mid-teens, his mother formed a relationship with her current husband. The offender had difficulty accepting this relationship for some time, and a period of turbulence ensued. However, in due course the offender accepted his step-father and a close bond developed between them. The offender’s immediate family: his mother, step-father and sister, have remained extremely supportive of him and have assisted him during the Court processes. 
     
      
    22 The offender left school during year 11. There followed a period when he was employed in various short-term, unskilled positions. In 1996, at the age of 21, he suffered a work-related back injury which incapacitated him from work for a number of years. He then undertook various forms of employment, but was unemployed between 2004 and his arrest in November 2005. In the months leading up to the offence the offender and his step-father were seeking to commence a concreting business together. However, this never eventuated. At the time of the offence the offender and his family were in serious financial difficulties. This was exacerbated by the offender’s gambling habit: he would regularly gamble on poker machines or horse races, sometimes to the tune of several hundred dollars a week. This was a source of conflict between himself and JK. 
     
      
    23 The offender had two significant relationships with women before he married JK. Each of them resulted in the birth of two sons. The older ones are now aged 12 and 11 and the younger ones are eight and five. After the offender and JK moved to Gorokan in August 2004, his sons used to visit regularly on weekends and school holidays. On all accounts the family presented a picture of domestic harmony. 
     
      
    24 However, it is apparent that all was not harmonious in the offender’s life, nor in his relationships. Probably as a result of his own background, his relationships have been marked by domestic violence, which has been exacerbated by his use of alcohol and cannabis. It was no doubt for this reason that, on the day of the offence, JK elected to go to a refuge rather than return home to her intoxicated husband. 
     
      
    25 This brings me to say something about the offender’s alcohol and drug use. It appears that the offender suffered a serious assault when he was about 16 years old. This precipitated his alcohol and drug abuse. He told Dr McMahon that he drank up to 24 beers per day from 17 to 20 years of age. Between the ages of 21 and 25 years of age he drank even more heavily. At the same time he was a heavy cannabis user. The pre-sentence report noted that the offender’s alcohol use would sometimes cause him to lose his temper and react violently. He has sometimes “blacked out” when intoxicated. During his late twenties and up to the time of the offence it appears that the offender’s alcohol consumption varied from total abstinence to highly excessive consumption. At the same time he was continuing to take cannabis. He told Dr McMahon that he was smoking eight to ten cones two to three times each week. 
     
      
    26 The offender has a criminal history going back to 1991 when he was 16 years of age. These included offences of dishonesty, such as stealing and obtaining a financial benefit by deception. He had a number of alcohol related driving matters and several convictions for driving whilst disqualified. More significantly, there are a number of convictions for assault and other offences suggesting violence. In 1994 he was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and sentenced to three months’ periodic detention. In October 2004 he was placed on an 18-month bond in relation to two charges: one of resisting a police officer in the execution of duty and the other of intimidating a police officer. He was subject to those bonds at the time of this offence. 
     
      
    27 The offender has been kept in protection since his incarceration. This is a relevant matter on sentence and I will return to discuss it later. 
     
      
    28 The maximum sentence for murder is life imprisonment. The standard non-parole period, where the victim was a child under 18 years of age, is 25 years. The standard non-parole period applies to cases in the mid-range of objective criminality, subject to adjustment on account of the offender’s personal circumstances. 
     
      
    29 The first step in the sentencing process is therefore to assess the objective criminality involved in the particular offence. And the starting point in relation to this offence is that it involved the unnecessary taking of a human life, moreover the life of an innocent, defenceless child. 
     
      
    30 An aggravating factor in relation to this offence, as opposed to the offender, is the fact that the offender was in a position of trust in relation to the victim, she being his step-daughter and under his care and control at the time of the killing. A further potentially relevant aggravating factor was the victim’s vulnerability, given that she was only three years old. However this factor has already been taken into account in increasing the standard non-parole period from 20 years to 25 years. It would therefore, in my view, be inappropriate to have further regard to it. 
     
      
    31 The one mitigating factor relating to the offence is that it was not part of a planned activity. 
     
      
    32 Given that the offender was not represented on sentence, the Crown made no oral submissions and handed up only very brief written submissions. These submitted that the offence falls in the mid to above-mid-range of criminality and that a non-parole period of 25 years is an appropriate penalty. 
     
      
    33 The offender, as already indicated, has continued to assert his innocence of this offence. He declined to discuss the circumstances of the offence with the Probation and Parole officer who prepared the pre-sentence report. He told Dr McMahon that on the day of the killing he and his wife went to the hotel at midday and started drinking. He said that there were no arguments or disagreements between them. He told the doctor that his wife proceeded to get him drunk so that he could not go to a Christening the following day. As a result he was significantly intoxicated and his memory was patchy. At about 5.00 pm his wife left the hotel, so he went home to the two girls. He said that the children did not want dinner. He recalled putting CB to bed. His next recollection was of hearing a loud bang and seeing CB lying on the floor. He tried to resuscitate her. He also tried to call emergency services, but his telephone cut out and he went to a neighbour’s house and asked them to telephone emergency services. 
     
      
    34 I should interpolate here that much of this account does not accord with the evidence of JK, nor that of the offender’s neighbours. The one matter I do accept is that the offender was heavily intoxicated on the night of this offence. He has a history of violent behaviour in a domestic setting when influenced by alcohol. Certainly all previous acts of violence had been directed towards his partner at the time. I accept that he had not previously exhibited violence towards any of his children or step-children. However, on this occasion it was CB who was the recipient of his violence. An adult might have been able to escape or to try to reason with the offender. CB was unable to do either of these things. I think it is highly possible that the offender was in such an advanced state of intoxication that he has no precise memory of these events. In this situation his intoxication does not excuse his behaviour, but might go some way towards explaining what would otherwise appear to be inexplicable and uncharacteristic behaviour. 
     
      
    35 In my finding the killing of CB, brutal as it was, was above the mid-range of objective criminality, although not substantially so. It is apparent from the medical evidence that this series of assaults, which led to extensive internal bleeding, must have continued for a considerable period, probably well in excess of twenty minutes. The next door neighbour described hearing the little girl’s screams, and one can barely contemplate the horror she must have experienced when the person who was charged with keeping her from harm and protecting her from violence turned on her and inflicted extreme violence over a sustained period. 
     
      
    36 The offender has frequently expressed grief at CB’s death. However, consistent with his denial of responsibility for her death, he has expressed no remorse whatsoever. Indeed, the defence raised at trial was that D, who was then not yet ten years old, must have brutally murdered her little sister. It is not surprising in the circumstances that the jury rejected this hypothesis. It does mean, however, that the offender cannot call upon remorse in mitigation of sentence. 
     
      
    37 Nor are there any other subjective features which can avail the offender in mitigation of sentence. Given his record of previous convictions, he cannot call upon a prior good character. Indeed, he was subject to a good behaviour bond at the time of this offence. Dr McMahon assessed his likelihood of re-offending as within the average range. 
     
      
    38 One significant matter has been raised on the evidence, namely the conditions of the offender’s custody. Because of the nature of his offence, and also because his father is a retired Magistrate, the offender has spent his entire time on remand in protective custody under conditions of “limited association”. After the sentencing proceedings, the offender’s mother furnished myself and the Crown with a statement from the offender describing the circumstances of his incarceration. Although this statement was not provided during the sentencing proceedings, I nevertheless propose to take it into account. In the statement the offender said that for the first twelve months of his incarceration he was allowed out of his cell for only one hour per day. After that he received employment as a sweeper which has alleviated his situation. He has been assaulted twice, he said, and has been told about two death threats levelled against him. He also said that access to drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs and education are severely limited compared to mainstream prisoners. 
     
      
    39 It is well established that the hardship that a prisoner will suffer in gaol through being in protective custody is a matter to be taken into account on sentence. However, as Howie J said in R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97: 
     
      
       
        
        “It can no longer be assumed that a prisoner, by reason of the fact that he will serve his sentence on protection, will find prison life more difficult or onerous than other prisoners in the general prison population.” 
        
       
      
    40 Given the nature of his offence, I think it likely that the offender will remain on protection for the duration of his sentence. I propose to take this into account as I shall describe shortly. 
     
      
    41 Extremely moving victim impact statements were read in court by or on behalf of JK, D, who is now aged 13, and CB’s aunt, who is the sister of CB’s deceased father. I would like to extend my, and the Court’s, sincere condolences to all of them, whilst recognising that no amount of condolences can start to address the grief and loss they have suffered as a result of the senseless killing of this little girl. I have taken their statements into account in the manner provided by the legislation. 
     
      
    42 Although I have not specifically adverted to these matters, I should emphasise that in sentencing this offender I have had regard to the normal purposes of sentencing, namely the punishment of the offender, general and personal deterrence, the protection of the community, rehabilitation and denunciation. 
     
      
    43 Were it not for the fact that the offender will probably have to serve the whole of his sentence on protection, I would have imposed a non-parole of 26 years with an additional term appropriate to that period. Taking into account the likely conditions of his incarceration, I have reduced both the non-parole period and the additional term which I would otherwise have imposed. 
     
      
    44 PJS, for the murder of CB I sentence you to imprisonment to be served by way of a non-parole period of 20 years, commencing on 11 November 2005 and expiring on 10 November 2025, together with an additional term of six years, commencing on 11 November 2025 and expiring on 10 November 2031. The first date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 10 November 2025.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCOLL JA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an application to extend time for seeking leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Hulme DCJ at Taree District Court on 10 November 2006. The applicant had pleaded guilty on the listed trial day to indicted offences but his Honour accepted that it had earlier been made clear that he was likely to so plead. He was convicted on two counts (counts 1 and 3) of indecent assault upon a child under the age of ten years contrary to s 61M (2) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which offence there is a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years; on two counts (counts 2 and 4) of procuring a child under fourteen years for pornographic purposes (each child was aged eight years) contrary to s 91G (1) (a) of that Act, which offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and on one count (count 5) of inciting a child under the age of ten years (a child aged eight) to commit an act of indecency contrary to s 61O (2) of the Act for which a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment applies. His Honour was also asked to take into account on a Form 1 a further offence contrary to s 61O (2) and an offence of possessing child pornography.  
     
      
    3 His Honour sentenced the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
      On count 1: to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 28 October 2006 and expiring on 27 October 2009 with a balance term of 1 year; 
       
       
      On count 2: to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 28 October 2006 and expiring on 27 October 2008 with a balance term of 8 months; 
       
       
      On count 3 (taking into account the offences on the Form 1): to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months commencing on 28 July 2007 and expiring on 27 January 2010 with a balance term of 2 years;  
       
       
      On count 4: to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 28 July 2007 and expiring on 27 July 2009 with a balance term of 8 months, and 
       
       
      On count 5: to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 28 January 2006 and expiring on 27 January 2007 with a balance term of 4 months. 
       
      
    4 The overall effective sentence amounted to a non-parole period of 4 years with a balance term of 2 years. As above appears, the sentence on count 5 is now wholly expired as is the non-parole period set in respect of count 2. 
     
      
    5 The Crown opposed the grant of extension of time. The application was supported by an affidavit by the applicant’s solicitor sworn 13 November 2008. That solicitor has acted for the applicant throughout the proceedings and the documents show that he was also acting for him in October 2004 when he was previously charged with possessing child pornography.  
     
      
    6 After sentence was imposed on 10 November 2006 a notice of intention to appeal was filed on 8 December 2006 and this notice was within time. It expired on 8 June 2007 and, upon request, the Registrar extended the time until 17 September 2007. The solicitor’s affidavit records some telephone contact by counsel with officers in the registry but nothing was done to secure a further extension. The application presently before the Court was filed on 13 November 2008. 
     
      
    7 The supporting affidavit recounted the detail of attempts to make appointments for conference including conference with particular senior counsel. Advice was eventually obtained in July 2008. The further delay from then until November was sought to be explained, at least in part, by the illness of junior counsel.  
     
      
    8 The Crown submitted that no sufficient reason had been presented to explain why junior counsel (who had appeared at Taree District Court) could not have prepared and filed a notice in grounds of appeal nor has any reason been shown why, given the difficulties in appointing a conference, other counsel could not have been briefed for advice. 
     
      
    9 In general, upon an explanation then forthcoming, the Court liberally grants extensions of time. The obvious foundation for implementing that approach is the avoidance of possible injustice in cases where merit might be shown to exist. Nevertheless the requirements as to time for notifying appeal have not been prescribed without purpose, one important purpose being the bringing of proceedings to finality.  
     
      
    10 The circumstances advanced by the applicant in this instance strain the limits of the liberality which I have mentioned. There is considerable force in the Crown opposition and it is with some reservation that I would grant the extension of time and turn to consider the merits of the grounds put forward. I have recorded some of the detail concerning how this application was progressed, as it is appropriate to give notice that similar lack of diligence in attending to time requirements may not be treated so leniently in the future.  
     
      
    11 The facts were before the Court as an agreed statement which his Honour drew upon in making his remarks on sentence. His summary was not suggested to be inaccurate in any respect and I quote therefrom: 
     
      
       
        
        “The complainants are TF, CM and TM. ……..As at the time of the offences they were each aged eight years and four months. 
        
       
       
        
        In January 2006, CM and TM were staying with their father in Tuncurry. TF lived in Tuncurry in a house about 300 (sic) from the home of CM and TM’s father. At about 3.30pm on Saturday 28 January 2006 and the three girls left the twins’ house to go to TF’s home for a swim. Later in the afternoon they decided to walk back to the twins’ house. 
        
       
       
        
        TF was wearing a pink bikini and had a towel over her shoulder. She also had a number of stick on tattoos of the Australian flag she had obtained at Australia Day celebrations a couple of days before. CF and TM were both wearing sun shirts and board shorts. CF was wearing underpants but TM was not. CF had both of her arms in plaster. 
        
       
       
        
        On the way to the twins’ home the three girls were walking past the front of the Tuncurry Public School when they were approached by the offender. He told them he was a professional photographer for Girlfriend Magazine and asked if he could take some photographs of them. He suggested they go into the school grounds for this purpose. 
        
       
       
        
        Once inside the school grounds he commenced to photograph the girls, both individually and as a group. He then asked CM and TM to take their pants off so he could take some photographs of them in bikinis. TF was present when this request was made but it was not directed to her. CM took her board shorts off but TM declined to do so because she was not wearing underwear. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender then pulled TF’s bikini bottoms lower but not exposing her vagina. He said this would look a bit ‘sexier’. He also lowered the underpants worn by CM, although they still covered her vagina. He then asked TF and CM to cuddle each other and photographed them in that position. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender placed his fingers inside TF’s bikini bottoms, pulling them forward and exposing her vagina. He took a photograph of this. He did the same to CM. He pulled TF’s bikini bottom to the area of her knees and touched her on the vagina. He also pulled CM’s underpants down to her ankles and touched her on the vagina. TM was present when this was happening but none of her clothing was removed and she was not touched by the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        Shortly thereafter the complainants fled and made their way to the twins’ home. They complained to the twins’ father and they gave a description of a distinctive t-shirt the offender was wearing, it being blue with a large letter E on the front. The twins’ father and the three girls then drove around the school and the adjacent park area looking for the offender but to no avail. The father then dropped the girls off at the home of the twins’ grandmother and he then reported the matter to Forster Police. 
        
       
       
        
        He then returned to the Tuncurry area and saw the offender in a car park behind the main street. He approached and told him that he matched the description given by the three girls and that he would ring the police. The offender remained in the area, standing next to his car. 
        
       
       
        
        Police attended promptly and spoke to the offender. He was cautioned and placed under arrest. A Nikon digital camera and computer floppy disc was found in his car. He was told that the police intended to seize his car and the camera equipment. He claimed to them that he only had photographs of the scenery on his camera. 
        
       
       
        
        About a week later the police took the camera and floppy disc to their State Electronic Evidence Branch for examination. A disc was removed from the camera and from it were retrieved forty-eight coastal scene images. Also identified were fifteen deleted images. These deleted images had been created on 28 January 2006 between 3.35pm and 3.38pm and had been deleted between 3.49pm and 3.50pm. Those images depicted the complainants, four of them being photos of TF and CM in sexually explicit poses.” 
        
       
      
    12 The relationship of the particular counts to the facts was also specified by his Honour and, again, I can draw from his remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offences to which the offender has pleaded guilty are as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        Count one, indecent assault upon TF a child under ten, namely eight – this offence relates to the offender having pulled TF’s bikini bottom to the area of her knees and touching her vagina. 
        
       
       
        
        Count two, using TF a child under fourteen, namely eight, for pornographic purposes – this offence relates to the offender taking photographs of TF. 
        
       
       
        
        Count three, indecent assault upon CM a child under ten, namely eight – this offence relates to the offender having pulled CM’s underpants down to her ankles and touching her vagina.  
        
       
       
        
        Count four, using CM a child under fourteen, namely eight, for pornographic purposes – this offence relates to the offender taking photographs of CM. 
        
       
       
        
        Count five, inciting TM a child under ten, namely eight, to commit an act of indecency with the offender – this offence relates to the offender asking TM to take her pants off so he could take photographs of her. 
        
       
       
        
        The offences the offender asks to have taken into account are: 
        
       
       
        
        Offence one, inciting CM a child under ten, namely eight, to commit an act of indecency – this offence relates to the offender asking CM to take her board shorts off so he could take photographs of her. 
        
       
       
        
        Offence two, possession of child pornography – this offence relates to the offender having in his possession photographs he had taken of the complainants, four of which showed TF and CM with their pants pulled down exposing their vaginas.” 
        
       
      
    13 The notice filed on 13 November 2008 specified five grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        1. His Honour the sentencing Judge erred in rejecting the fact that the Applicant had been himself sexually assaulted at a very young age, as a matter that went to mitigation of sentence. 
        
       
       
      
    14 A written submission in support of this ground stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “There appears to be a statistically established empirical connection between the sexual abuse of the offender at a young age and his perpetrating similar offences as an adult. The connection is not present in every case but the high preponderance of histories of sexual abuse suffered by offenders during their childhood suggests that there is a connection between the two. 
        
       
       
        
        It would be difficult to demonstrate with absolute or near certainty in any particular case that the offender’s abuse at the hands of an adult when a child was a causal factor in his offending as an adult in any particular instance. However, the significant preponderance of the occurrence of adults who sexually offend against children having such a history must make it more likely than not that the abuse of the offender as a child did have a causal psychological connection to the offender’s behaviour as an adult. 
        
       
       
        
        The need to demonstrate a causal connection between the history of sexual abuse as a child and the offender’s conduct when it is not immediately apparent does not justify an approach of rejecting the history of sexual abuse of a child in respect of adult offending against children without further evidence establishing the link between the two.” 
        
       
      
    15 The matter of mitigation is required to be demonstrated to exist by the offender on the balance of probability and not as an absolute or near certainty: The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270. There was no evidence supporting what was stated to have been “statistically established”. His Honour accepted that the applicant had been in fact sexually abused as a child but found that the evidence did not satisfy him that that past abuse contributed to the applicant’s criminal conduct and thereby reduced his moral culpability. His approach was in conformity with authority: R v AGR (unreported) NSWCCA 24 July 1998. Counsel had referred his Honour to R v Rich [2000] NSWCCA 448 but nothing therein detracts from the correctness of the views expressed in AGR and the several authorities referred to in the judgment of James J who concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “If it is established that a child sexual assault offender was himself sexually abused as a child and that that history of sexual abuse has contributed to the offender’s own criminality, that is a matter which can be taken into account by a sentencing judge as a factor in mitigation of penalty as reducing the offender’s moral culpability for his acts, although the weight which should be given to it will depend very much on the facts of the individual case and will be subject to a wide discretion in the sentencing judge.” 
        
       
      
    16 Rich recognized that prior sexual abuse of an offender may be taken into account in the subjective assessment of an offender. His Honour did so in this instance, although he rejected the past occurrences as reducing moral culpability and said that it would be brought into account “as a part of the matrix of subjective features”.  
     
      
    17 This ground has not been made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: His Honour the sentencing Judge erred in arriving at his assessment of the Applicant’s remorse. 
       
      
    18 The complaint raised pursuant to this ground was significantly based upon a comment by his Honour during the sentencing hearing when he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think you can proceed along the lines that I am prepared to accept that your client is genuinely remorseful Mr Kintominas. Again, subject to anything the Crown might wish me to persuade me to on the topic. I think that’s clear enough on the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    19 It was submitted that there was a discernible difference between his Honour’s assessment of the genuineness of the applicant’s remorse and what he said in his remarks on sentence, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the question of remorse, I have the evidence of the offender and the evidence of others to whom he has spoken. I gained the distinct impression that first and foremost he is concerned for his own disgrace and humiliation and that which he has brought upon his family. He said quite a deal in his evidence about his concern for his victims and their families but I have doubts about whether he was genuinely sincere. 
        
       
       
        
        His actions in deleting the photographs so soon after taking them may well indicate that he realised at that early stage the evil of what he had done. Against that however is his conceded failure to admit to having indecently assaulted two of the girls until the third of his consultations with Mr Glancy (sic). Having regard however to what he said in his evidence and what he is reported to have said by the others who gave evidence, on balance I think there is just enough for me to conclude that this mitigating feature is established.” 
        
       
      
    20 His Honour did not find, to the contrary of what he had said in the earlier exchange, that the applicant’s remorse was not genuine. That he had some doubts about the sincerity of some of the applicant’s protestations and that any remorse for the commission of criminal acts might be less prominent than his feelings of disgrace and humiliation brought upon his family, was not inconsistent with his remarks and the finding that the applicant had established to the necessary standard that he was remorseful. 
     
      
    21 As the Crown has pointed out, his Honour applied his finding that the applicant was remorseful as one of the specific factors justifying his departure, in the applicant’s favour, from the imposition of the standard non-parole period on counts 1 and 3.  
     
      
    22 Ground 2 should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      
    23 Ground 3: His Honour the sentencing Judge erred in assessing the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    24 His Honour expressly turned his attention to the question of rehabilitation which, obviously in all cases, involves assessing the future. Inter alia, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The next matter to consider is the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation and his likelihood, or otherwise, of re-offending. He said in his evidence that he did not understand why he committed the offences. He said he wanted to seek help so he could understand the problem and address it so as to ensure it would not happen again. He is fortunate to have the family support that I referred to earlier. 
        
       
       
        
        I am troubled however as to the fact that he did not realise that he needed to seek help after being charged with the child pornography offences. He claimed in his evidence that he thought he was strong enough to deal with it himself. He had the jolt of having spent two days in custody in relation to that matter. He had the benefit of the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service as a condition of the bond. The fact that an intelligent man, as he obviously is, did not pursue rehabilitation at that stage is not a positive sign. 
        
       
       
        
        I accept on the balance of probabilities that the offender does appreciate the need to seek rehabilitative assistance and I trust that he will. However, whether he has good prospects of rehabilitation is something that, on the evidence before me, I am unable to determine. Being motivated to seek it is one thing but success in that endeavour is another. It does not appear to me that enough about his psychological problems has been professionally determined to enable a finding in his favour that his rehabilitation prospects are good and that he is unlikely to re-offend.” 
        
       
      
    25 It is convenient to identify now his Honour’s reference to an earlier offence. On 15 March 2005 the applicant was convicted at Downing Centre Local Court upon two charges of possessing child pornography and on each charge was sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 6 months with a balance term of 6 months. He appealed against the severity of those sentences and in the District Court on 15 June 2005 the sentences were quashed, and, in lieu thereof the applicant was placed upon a recognizance to be of good behaviour for two years on each charge. Those recognizances were current when the offences presently under consideration were committed. 
     
      
    26 The facts sheet in respect of the earlier matters was before the District Court in Taree. It showed that in September 2004 a multi-national initiative was engaged in the detection of persons involved in the distribution and possession of child pornography. In October 2004, police executed a search warrant at premises where the applicant was residing and from his property there was seized a computer on the hard drive of which was a picture of two young females in a sexually explicit pose. Also seized was a compact disc from which were retrieved numerous similar images. 
     
      
    27 For this ground to succeed it will be necessary to demonstrate that his Honour’s conclusion was wrong. Reliance was placed upon observations by a psychologist, Mr Glancey, who expressed an opinion that experience showed that chronic psychological disturbance is more likely to be successful after crisis and discovery of motivation. Mr Glancey attended upon the applicant three times (27 June, 24 July and 29 August 2006). A very substantial bulk of his report records history and assertions which were supplied by the applicant. He does not refer to having applied any psychometric testing nor any results of such. The applicant told Mr Glancey that he entertained an interest in photographing girls who were naked. It was not until the third consultation that the applicant admitted to Mr Glancey that he had touched the children on the vagina. 
     
      
    28 It was argued that there are indications of steps towards rehabilitation in particular the action of the applicant in seeking to delete the images from his camera and not leaving the vicinity in which the offences were committed. His Honour accepted that the applicant had tried to delete the images and it might be noted that the stated purpose of the applicant’s presence in the township to assist his father in taking some photographs in connection with the recent purchase of a motel in the town would very likely result in an explanation being called for if he had left suddenly. 
     
      
    29 The failure of the evidence to satisfy his Honour that the prospects of rehabilitation were good was an available conclusion and error has not been shown. 
     
      
    30 Ground 4: The sentences imposed by the learned sentencing Judge were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: The total sentence imposed upon the Applicant was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    31 His Honour correctly observed that the various applicable maximum prescribed penalties and the standard non-parole period in respect of counts 1 and 3 were guides to which he should have reference. There were multiple victims, and, although the offences occurred on the one occasion, it was entirely appropriate for his Honour to consider cumulation. His approach and impositions which he made were in accordance with binding authority: Pearce v The Queen  (1998) 194 CLR 610. It was a serious element of aggravation that the applicant was subject to a current recognizance for offences which were not of an entirely different character. It was also significant to take into account the actual ages of the children where an offence is defined in terms of being anywhere below a specific age. 
     
      
    32 It was claimed that the individual sentences were excessive when compared to other cases involving indecent and/or sexual assault on children. At the hearing the Court was handed a folder containing judgments in some thirty seven cases which, in various ways, related to sexual offences against children. It was accepted, as is the case, that every offence and every offender are different and it suffices to record that that accumulation did not present a pattern outside the range of which this applicant’s sentences for these offences fell.  
     
      
    33 This Court has always stressed that those who prey upon the innocence of young children will be met with retribution and personal deterrence as well as signalling to others who may be minded to so offend that condign punishment will follow such depredations. 
     
      
    34 In my view the sentences and their structure were imposed well within the exercise of sound discretion by his Honour. 
     
      
    35 I would order the time for filing the notice of appeal extended, I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    36 HOWIE J: I agree with Grove J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant was sentenced in the District Court by Nield DCJ (the Judge) for a number of offences of dishonesty arising from investments made in a company of which the applicant was the principal and which he controlled. The applicant is unrepresented before this Court but has filed both written submissions in support of his appeal and written submissions in answer to the submissions filed by the Crown. He is a highly intelligent and articulate person, which is, no doubt, why he was able to lure a number of persons in the community into making investments into the company that ultimately failed, leaving most of the investors without the return of their money. 
     
      
    3 The indictment to which the applicant pleaded guilty contained 26 counts. Fifteen of the counts were for offences contrary to s 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900, being offences of making a false statement for which the maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 5 years. Eleven of the counts were for offences contrary to s 300(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, being offences of using a false instrument, for which the maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 10 years. As a result of his pleas of guilty the Judge sentenced the applicant to a total sentence of 7 years 4 months from 1 May 2006 with an overall non-parole period of 5 years 6 months. The applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 1 November 2011. 
     
      
       
        
        Facts 
        
       
      
    4 There was an agreed statement of facts placed before his Honour. The facts as recited by the Judge take up 15 pages of the remarks on sentence. It is unnecessary for the determination of the application to detail them to the same degree. I will summarise them as briefly as possible. Most of the offences involved the same criminal conduct but against different victims. In effect the applicant induced, sometimes by fraudulent documents, members of the public to invest in a company that he ran, Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited (“KSE”). This company was incorporated in 1999 to take over the applicant’s highly successful business in the collection of supermarket trolleys. 
     
      
    5 From April 2000 until July 2001 the applicant sought and accepted investments in this company. There was a Financial Investment Agreement setting out the terms of the investment that was to be for a number of years, variously between three and fifteen. The result of the agreement was that the investor would be guaranteed a return on the investment by fortnightly payments from the income of the trolley collection business. In relation to one investor, the applicant induced the investment by false documents he had manufactured indicating the existence of contracts between large supermarket stores and KSE for the collection of trolleys. These false documents gave rise to the charges under s 300(2). 
     
      
    6 Count 1 on the indictment related to false statements made to Soldoz Pty Limited (“Soldoz”) in April 2000 in relation to an investment made by the company with KSE. In effect the applicant falsely stated that the investment made by Soldoz would be repaid from the income received by KSE from two specific trolley collection agreements in which KSE was involved with two supermarkets in Queensland. However those agreements did not exist and, therefore, any return made to Soldoz would not come from income derived by KSE from those sources. Soldoz’s investment agreement was actually fulfilled by KSE but from funds obtained from other investments to which other charges related.  
     
      
    7 Count 2 related to an investment made in KSE by the Billington Family Trust (“the Trust”) in April 2000 as a result of false statements made by the applicant. As in Count 1 the false statements related to specific agreements purportedly existing between KSE and 14 specified trolley services agreements with various supermarkets. Those agreements did not exist and, therefore, any returns made to the Trust would not be derived from the income of those agreements as the Trust believed. In fact the agreement made with the Trust was fulfilled, money being paid from funds obtained from other investment agreements. Counts 16 to 26 related to false instruments prepared by the applicant to induce the Trust to enter into the investment agreement and purporting to be the agreements between KSE and the specified supermarkets. 
     
      
    8 Counts 3 to 15 related to investment agreements between KSE and various investors made between April 2000 and July 2001. The false statement in each case was that the particular investor would receive a return of a specified amount each fortnight. However, the applicant was using these investments to fulfil the agreements with Soldoz and the Trust. Some returns were made initially but ultimately KSE failed and the agreements were not fulfilled. As a result of these agreements KSE was to make returns totalling over $137,000 per fortnight but was receiving an average net profit per fortnight of less than $8,000. 
     
      
    9 As a result of the investment agreements comprised in all the counts on the indictment KSE received investments totalling $3,185,000. As a result of the agreements investors, excluding Soldoz and the Trust, lost a total of $828,915. 
     
      
       
        
        Subjective matters 
        
       
      
    10 The applicant was born on 16 April 1961. He was, therefore, 46 years of age at the date of sentence. He had no relevant criminal record except that on 15 April 2004 he was sentenced by Berman DCJ for dishonesty offences to a prison term of 21 months with a non-parole period of 12 months. The sentences dated from 5 March 2004 and the applicant was released to parole on 4 March 2005. Those offences arose in a period between December 2000 and October 2001. They involved false statements and associated forgeries made by the applicant for the purchase of luxury items including prestige motor vehicles and a yacht. It was shortly before his release to parole from that sentence that he was charged with the current matters. He was then on bail for 14 months before being returned to custody after he pleaded guilty to the matters the subject of this application. 
     
      
    11 There was nothing in the applicant’s background of relevance. He came to Australia with his family in 1976. He was educated to high school leaving standard. He married in 1988 and had two children. His marriage ended with the failure of his company. He thereafter had limited contact with his children. The applicant was treated by a psychiatrist for depression between July 2002 and May 2003. There were no relevant psychiatric or mental health issues to be addressed by the Judge. The psychiatrist assessed the applicant’s likelihood of further offending as low. 
     
      
       
        
        Grounds of appeal 
        
       
      
    12 The applicant raised the following grounds of appeal; 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. With regards Charges 1-26, I submit that His Honour erred or was overly harsh in allowing only a 15% discount for my pleas of guilty to all charges and my complete cooperation with various investigating bodies and the liquidator of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty. Limited. 
         
         
        2. With regards Charges 1-26, I submit that His Honour erred in accepting as an aggravating factor, my breaching of a trust with the ""Assyrian community"". 
         
         
        3. With respect to Charges 1-26, I submit that His Honour did not take full account of all the circumstances of each particular charge in determining the penalty for each charge. 
         
         
        4. With regards charges 2 and 16-26, I submit that His Honour did not take into consideration the fact that a number of the charges were related to one single transaction. Or that the ""victim"" recovered 100% of their ""investment"" and suffered no loss. 
         
         
        5. I submit that certain elements of my state of mind were not adequately covered during my sentencing hearing and/or His Honour did not sufficiently take these factors into account in determining the sentence. 
         
         
        6. I submit that threats made against my life and the extra hardship and mental anguish that this is causing me during my incarceration, should have been taken into consideration in my sentencing. 
         
         
        7. Notwithstanding the above, I submit that in total, my non-parole sentence was manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
        
        Discount for plea 
        
       
      
    13 The applicant was given a discount by reason of his plea of guilty of 15 per cent. The applicant submits that in light of the assistance he had given to various investigating authorities and the liquidators of KSE the discount should have been greater. 
     
      
    14 The discount by reason of the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty is based largely upon the timing of the plea and the saving of the costs of the prosecution of the offence before a jury. That discount does not include any consideration of remorse or any other factor such as assistance given to authorities by way of admissions or co-operation: see R v MAK and MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159. 
     
      
    15 The prosecution of these matters was commenced in the Local Court on 2 February 2005. The applicant was committed for trial after agreeing to dispense with committal proceedings. The matter was first before the District Court on 12 August 2005. A trial date was fixed for 1 May 2006 with an estimate of 4 weeks. The applicant indicated that he would plead guilty on 21 April 2006 and pleaded guilty on 1 May 2006. A discount of 15 per cent was to some degree generous in light of the fact that the pleas of guilty were very late, occurring about a week before the trial date and some 16 months after he was charged. 
     
      
    16 There was no evidence of any co-operation with investigating authorities raised at the sentencing hearing even though the liquidator gave evidence. Although the defence called Mr Griffiths, a business consultant employed by the applicant, and he repeated statements made to him by the applicant indicating some remorse, his Honour was not bound to give significant weight to those statements in light of the fact that the applicant did not give evidence. 
     
      
    17 This ground is not made out. 
     
      
       
        
      Breach of trust 
      
    18 In its written submissions before the sentencing judge the Crown stated the following under the heading “Aggravating Factors”: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) The Offender was known to the investors through word of mouth in the Assyrian community. A decision by many of the investors to place funds with KSE was influenced by the Offender’s position within the Assyrian community and his reputation as a prominent and successful businessman. As such, the Offender’s dealings with the investors involved an abuse of trust: s 21A(2)(k). 
        
       
       
      The reference to s 21A(2)(k) is a reference to the relevant provision of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       1999 set out below. 
       
      
    19 Counsel for the applicant at the sentencing proceedings conceded that the objective gravity of “this offence (sic) is heightened by his particular relationship in the Assyrian Community. And no doubt some elements of trust were placed in him…………”. 
     
      
    20 In the course of his sentencing remarks, the Judge made the following statement: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “[the offences] other than those related to the Billington Family Trust, were committed upon commercially naive people. They involved a breach of trust that the investors; particularly those within the Assyrian Community, had in the appellant. "" 
        
       
       
      This passage arises in a paragraph of the sentencing remarks clearly dealing with aggravating factors. His Honour later identifies the aggravating circumstances as including that the offences were committed in breach of trust. 
       
      
    21 Even accepting that members of the Assyrian community placed trust in the applicant because of his apparent status as a successful businessman within that community, it does not follow that there was a breach of trust between him and members of that community such that s 21A(2)(k) was engaged. Section 21A(2) sets out factors of aggravation to be taken into account when determining the sentence and the particular provision is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (k) the offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim. 
        
       
      
    22 This aggravating factor is not made out simply because the victim trusted the offender for some reason or other, such as because of the offender’s standing in the community or he appeared to be a successful businessman. Nor is it made out because the persons with whom the offender dealt were “commercially naïve people”. The relevant factor is that there was at the time of the offending a particular relationship between the offender and the victim that amounted to “a position of trust”. It is a special relationship existing between them and transcends the usual duty of care arising between persons in the community in their everyday contact or their business and social dealings. The position of trust may reside in only one of the persons, such as between parent and child. But there may be situations where each stands in a position of trust to the other. The relationship is one recognised by the common law as imposing upon one of the participants a particular responsibility not to act to the detriment of the other because of their peculiar relationship. 
     
      
    23 The position of trust recognised by the common law does not arise simply from a subjective state of mind of one of the members of the relationship. It is not enough that for some reason or another the victim trusted the offender not to act in a particular way: that state of mind might be irrational or without foundation. On the other hand a position of trust can arise irrespective of the state of mind of the victim, for example because the victim is a child or mentally disabled. But the offender would know, or should have known, that he or she is in a position of trust with respect to the victim. In R v MAK [2005] NSWCCA 369 it was held in a sexual assault case that there was no position of trust between the offender and the victim simply because they had a prior encounter where nothing untoward had occurred between the two. The victim may have erroneously trusted the offender because of his behaviour on a prior occasion but that did not create a position of trust for the purposes of sentencing. 
     
      
    24 There are recognised trust relationships that rely upon the person’s standing in the community but usually as a consequence of the person holding a particular occupation or calling; for example doctors, priests or teachers. In such a case members of the community generally understand that holding that position imposes upon the holder a particular duty of care not to act to the detriment of a person dealing with the holder while fulfilling that position. That understanding is recognised by the common law. 
     
      
    25 But the common law does not recognise, for the purposes of sentencing, that a position of trust arises simply because the two persons are involved in a commercial relationship. There must be some peculiar aspect of the relationship that imposed a position of trust on one or both of the participants. Such relationships were considered in R v Martin [2005] NSWCCA 190 at [40] and included a real estate agent fraudulently omitting to account to a client and dishonesty offences by a solicitor in carrying out his duties. 
     
      
    26 It has been made perfectly clear both by the wording of s 21A(2) and decided cases that the section was not intended to extend the categories of aggravating factors recognised by the common law at the time the section was created: R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193; R v Johnson [2005] NSWCCA 186. The common law would not have identified the fact that the applicant was considered to be a successful businessman within the Assyrian community as imposing a position of trust upon him in relation to any person in that community with whom he dealt. Neither does s 21A(2)(k). The fact that defence counsel at the sentencing hearing conceded otherwise is irrelevant. Both counsel appearing before the sentencing Judge led him into error in that regard. 
     
      
    27 The Crown before this Court made the submission that the formal investment agreements themselves imposed upon the applicant a position of trust in relation to the investors because by entering those agreements they trusted in his honesty. That submission should be rejected and would impose a position of trust on almost every person entering into a commercial agreement. Nor does a position of trust arise simply because one of the persons to the agreement is commercially naïve. 
     
      
    28 This ground has been made out. It should be noted that, generally speaking, a finding that an offence was committed in breach of trust is a seriously aggravating factor. It could not be said in the present case that it was a matter that would not have significantly affected the sentence imposed upon the appellant. 
     
      
       
        
        Application of Pearce 
        
       
      
    29 Grounds 3 and 4 can be dealt with together and they concern the nature of the charges and the particular manner in which the Judge sentenced for each count on the indictment. 
     
      
    30 As has been noted already, counts 1 to 15 inclusive were offences contrary to s 178BB of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty prescribed was 5 years imprisonment. On each of counts 1 to 14 the Judge imposed a sentence of a fixed term of 1 year 6 months. The sentences for the first two counts commenced from 1 May 2006 and, thereafter, each of the sentences for the next pair of offences commenced on various dates after the commencement of the preceding pair of offences usually a period of 3 months later but in some cases a period in excess of 3 months. I am unable to see why differing periods of accumulation were chosen between the various counts and they did not appear to me to have any relationship to the seriousness of the offences. By this method the overall sentence imposed for the first 14 counts was a fixed term of 5 years 3 months. 
     
      
    31 The Judge then imposed a sentence on count 15 being a non-parole period of 4 months and 14 days from 18 June 2011 and to expire on 31 October 2011 and a parole period of 1 year 10 months.  
     
      
    32 Counts 16-26 were for offences contrary to s 300(2) of the Crimes Act. In respect of each of those offences, that carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, the Judge imposed a fixed term of 9 months to date from 1 May 2006. 
     
      
    33 With respect there was a degree of artificiality and arbitrariness in the sentences imposed by the Judge and they bore little or no relationship to the offences for which sentence was being passed. For example, each of the s 178BB offences received exactly the same sentence even though the criminality differed considerably between them. The 6th count concerned an investment of $555,000 with a loss of $170,000 yet the 13th count concerned an investment of $100,000 and loss of $28,000. On its face it is difficult to understand how both offences could justify the same sentence. 
     
      
    34 The most serious criminality involved the offences relating to the Trust because of the associated forgery offences. Yet the sentence actually imposed for the Trust offences was no more than any of the other offences because the sentences for the forgery offences were made completely concurrent with the sentence of 1 year 6 months imposed for the s 178BB offence. The applicant complains that the sentence imposed for this offence and that for count 1 did not reflect the fact that the victims did not suffer any loss. Although the fact that no loss was occasioned to the victim is clearly a relevant factor, also significant is the amount of money put at risk by the fraudulent behaviour of the offender and the nature of the fraudulent conduct. 
     
      
    35 This lack of discrimination in the sentencing is the point raised by the applicant in his 3rd and 4th grounds of appeal. I appreciate the difficulty in sentencing for multiple offences in the way that Pearce has been interpreted but the manner in which the Judge sentenced the applicant does not appear to reflect the proper application of that principle. 
     
      
    36 The Judge set out his method for deriving the sentences that he imposed. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [51] I have determined, balancing the purposes of sentencing, the objective features of the offences, the subjective features of the offender and the aggravating and mitigating factors, all of which I have referred, that for the offences contrary to s 178BB of the Crimes Act, those referred to in counts 1 to 15 of the indictment, the starting point is imprisonment for three years six months, and for the offences contrary to s 300(2) of the Crimes Act, as referred to in counts of 16 to 26 of the indictment, the starting point, because those offences were used in conjunction with the offence referred to in count two of the indictment, is imprisonment for three years. I reduce the period of three years six months by 15 per cent, which, for ease of calculation, is seven months, to 2 years 11 months, and a period of three years by 15 per cent, which, again for ease of calculation, is six months, to two years six months. Absent a special circumstance, a sentence of imprisonment for two years eleven months would be divided into a non parole period of two years two months seven days and a parole period of eight months twenty one days, and a sentence of imprisonment for two years six months would be divided into a non parole period of one year ten months fourteen days and a parole period of seven months fourteen days. 
        
       
      
    37 After finding that there were no special circumstances based upon the applicant’s depression, the Judge went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [53] As to whether the sentences should be served concurrently or consecutively, I consider that, as the offences were separate and distinct offences, although the offences referred to in counts 16 to 26 are related to the offences referred to in count 2 of the indictment, the sentences for the offences contrary to s 178BB of the Crimes Act, those referred to in counts 1 to 15 inclusive of the indictment, should be served partly concurrently and partly consecutively, and that the sentence as to the offences contrary to s 300(2) of the Crimes Act, those referred to in counts 16 to 26 of the indictment, should be served concurrently with each other and partly consecutively with the other sentences. However, in view of what I will say as to totality, this result cannot be achieved. 
         
         
        [54] As to totality, I consider that to reflect the offender's criminality for the 26 offences, and to punish him properly for those offences, the offender should serve a total sentence of seven years four months with a total non-parole period of five years six months and a parole period of one year ten months. To achieve this result, I propose to impose upon the offender sentences of imprisonment for a fixed period in relation to counts 1 to 14 inclusive and counts 16 to 26 inclusive of the indictment, and for a period divided into a non parole period and a parole period in relation to count 15 of the indictment. For ease of division of the overall non parole period of five years six months among the offences, the actual sentences that I will impose on the offender in relation to counts 1 to 14 inclusive and 16 to 26 inclusive of the indictment will be less than the period calculated in para 51 above. 
        
       
      
    38 With respect it is clear that the Judge did not apply the principle that has been obtained from Pearce because he has not determined the appropriate sentence for each offence individually. He has treated all the s 178BB offences as being of the same criminality and each worth a sentence of 3 years 6 months regardless of the amount invested or the amount lost. Such a starting sentence is in my view too high for most of the offences under s 178BB in light of the maximum penalty of 5 years. In any event that starting sentence became irrelevant once the Judge decided simply to impose a sentence of 1 year 6 months for all the s 178BB offences except count 15. A sentence of 1 year and 6 months for the offences involving the Trust was probably manifestly inadequate. Arguably the most serious offences were those in breach of s 300(2) because they were forgeries that induced the Trust to risk its money. They carried a greater maximum penalty than the s 178BB offences. Yet they were punished by a total sentence of a fixed term of 9 months concurrent with the s 178BB offence relating to the Trust. Therefore, there was no actual penalty imposed for those offences and the total criminality involved in the offences against the Trust was not distinguished from the lesser criminality involved in the s 178BB offences against the other victims. 
     
      
    39 However derived, the starting total sentence for all the offences before discount was about 8 years 6 months. This represented a sentence for criminality involving 15 separate victims conducted over a period of about 15 months where each offence had a maximum penalty of at least 5 years and included, in one case, the use of forged documents to induce the victim to invest in the applicant’s company. All up over $3 million was fraudulently received by the applicant and resulted in a loss to investors of over $800,000. Whether the overall sentence is such that some lesser sentence ought to be imposed will be considered later. 
     
      
       
        
        The applicant’s mental state 
        
       
      
    40 The applicant complains that no regard was given by the Judge to the fact that he hoped to be able to make returns under the agreements by other business interests he had, particularly in an Internet provider. The applicant accepts in his submissions that material he now seeks to rely upon was not placed before the sentencing judge. There is no reason why this Court should act on that material and in any event it is merely statements set out in his submissions. 
     
      
    41 In relation to the applicant’s expectations of funding the investments through other business activities, the applicant gave no evidence about this matter before the sentencing judge. He puts that explanation forward now in order to show that his intention was simply not to strip the investors of their investments but that he hoped in the long term to be able to honour the agreements through finances obtained by other enterprises. But it is not unusual to find that a fraudster hopes to be able to make good the agreements he enters into with innocent members of the public from other investments, or other sources of finances that he hopes will become available in the future. The crux of the offence under s 178BB is that the victim is induced to risk money based upon false statements intentionally made by the offender where had the true situation been known the victim might not have entered into the agreement. None of the victims in the present matter were aware that their returns were subject to the applicant successfully floating a company in which he had an interest. 
     
      
    42 To the extent that it is a mitigating factor that the applicant honestly believed he would be able to finance the agreements, the burden to prove that fact was upon him. On the basis of the evidence before him it was well open to the Judge to make his finding that “[the applicant] used [KSE] as a cash cow to fund his lifestyle and the public profile of the Froggy Group of Companies. 
     
      
    43 This ground fails. 
     
      
       
        
        The hardship of the applicant’s custody 
        
       
      
    44 The applicant states in his written submissions: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Although not raised at my sentencing hearing, I have had a number of threats made upon my life. I have been threatened that if I didn't pay money to certain well known criminals, I would not be protected while in jail. I also had a $100,000 contract on my life, which I believe can be confirmed from intelligence at Silverwater jail. 
         
         
        This extra strain put upon the role in prison is a factor which also should have been given some consideration in setting my sentence. 
        
       
      
    45 As the applicant concedes, none of this material was raised before the sentencing judge and is only before this Court by way of submission. This is a Court of error and does not generally receive material that could, and should, have been put before the sentencing court; see R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359. There is no reason why this Court should now receive this material in whatever form it is placed before the Court. 
     
      
       
        
        Totality of criminality 
        
       
      
    46 One matter not referred to by the applicant as a ground of appeal but that became apparent during argument was the failure of the sentencing judge to take into account the sentences imposed upon the applicant by Judge Berman in the particular circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    47 As has already been noted, the offences for which Judge Berman sentenced the applicant took place between December 2000 and October 2001 and concerned dishonest misrepresentations. They were different in kind to those with which the Court is now concerned except that they were intended to present a façade of wealth by the applicant and to live a lifestyle beyond his immediate needs. The Judge in the present matters found that these offences were similarly motivated. The offences before Judge Berman resulted in little, if any, loss to the victims. 
     
      
    48 Two matters are of importance in considering what effect is to be given to the sentences imposed upon the applicant by Judge Berman: first, the present offences fell within the period of time over which the offences before Judge Berman took place and, secondly, the applicant was not charged with these matters until he was about to be released to parole upon those sentences. The Judge sentencing him for the present offences ought to have considered the fact that the applicant had already served 12 months in custody for offences arising over the same period of time as the present offences and committed from a motivation similar to that which resulted in the present offences being committed. All the offences the applicant committed throughout 2000 and 2001 were part of a course of fraudulent activity committed over that period. 
     
      
    49 In such a situation as this the second sentencing judge should have considered what would have been the position had all of the offences committed by the appellant been before the one sentencing judge otherwise the applicant might be unduly prejudiced by the fact that, through no fault of his own, he came to be sentenced on two separate occasions by two different courts for offences occurring as part of a continuous course of criminal activity.  
     
      
    50 This was not a matter raised with the Judge and therefore, unsurprisingly, he did he not take it into account. The offences before Judge Berman were arguably less serious than these offences even though the amount of money involved in the loans fraudulently obtained by the applicant was about $3 million. As I have already indicated, there was no loss occasioned by his conduct in committing those offences and Judge Berman found some highly mitigating facts including a positive finding that the applicant intended to repay the loans he fraudulently obtained. 
     
      
    51 For the present offences and those before Judge Berman the applicant in effect received an additional non-parole period of 12 months to that imposed by Judge Nield. The matter is somewhat complicated because the applicant was released to parole between the two sentencing proceedings and placed on bail in respect of the present offences. 
     
      
       
        
        Decision 
        
       
      
    52 In my opinion having regard to the error in taking into account that the offences were committed in breach of trust and the totality of the sentences for the whole of the applicant’s fraudulent criminality over the period of 2000 and 2001 there should be some modest reduction in the overall sentence imposed by his Honour. This can best be achieved by adopting the scheme used by his Honour notwithstanding the technical criticisms that might be made of it, otherwise this Court would be required to increase some sentences to achieve the appropriate result. The seriousness of a particular offence can be reflected in the period of accumulation between the sentence for that offence and the sentence for the next offence on the indictment. So, for example, to indicate the seriousness of the offence relating to the Trust in count 2 there is a period of accumulation of 12 months with counts 3 and 5. Yet the overall sentence imposed for counts 1 to 14 is the same as that imposed by the Judge. The reduction in the overall non-parole period is achieved by a change to the commencement date of the sentence for count 15. The reduction in the overall sentence is achieved by a reduction in the balance of term for that count. It is my intention that the overall non-parole period be reduced by 9 months and the overall balance of term by 3 months: that is a total term of imprisonment of 6 years 4 months with a total minimum period of custody of 4 years 9 months as against a total term imposed of 7 years 4 months and a total minimum period of custody of 5 years 6 months imposed by his Honour. 
     
      
    53 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. Leave to appeal be granted and the appeal allowed. 
         
         
        2. The sentences imposed in the District Court for counts 1 to 15 are quashed and the applicant sentenced as follows: 
         
         
          
          On count 1 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months to date from 1 May 2006 and that expired on 31 October 2007; 
           
           
          On count 2 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months to date from 1 January 2007 and that expired on 30 June 2008; 
           
           
          On counts 3 to 5 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months to date from 1 January 2008 and that expires on 30 June 2009; 
           
           
          On count 6 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months to date from 1 April 2008 and that expires on 30 September 2009; 
           
           
          On counts 7 to 9 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months to date from 1 July 2008 and that expires on 31 December 2009; 
           
           
          On count 10 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months to date from 1 October 2008 and that expires on 31 March 2010; 
           
           
          On count 11 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months to date from 1 January 2009 and to expire on 30 June 2010; 
           
           
          On counts 12 and 13 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months to date from 1 April 2009 and to expire on 30 September 2010; 
           
           
          On count 14 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months to date from 1 July 2009 and to expire on 31 December 2010; 
           
           
          On count 15 the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 4 months 14 days to commence on 17 September 2010 and to expire on 31 January 2011 the date upon which the applicant is to be released to parole with a balance of term of 1 year 7 months to date from 1 February 2011. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        3. The sentences for counts 16 to 26 are confirmed.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Sean Tibbey appears for sentence today. He was before me some time ago when the matter was dealt with at the East Maitland District Court. On that occasion, having read the evidence put before me, I determined that there were prospects for Mr Tibbey’s rehabilitation and put him on a s 11 remand. Unfortunately he has breached that remand in a number of ways; firstly by committing a further offence and secondly by failing to report to the Probation and Parole Service as required.2 As I told Mr Tibbey at the time of putting him on a s 11 remand, if he committed further offences or a further offence, I would send him to full-time gaol. I also told him that it was not a pleasant place. 3 Mr Tibbey committed two offences of break enter and steal just before his eighteenth birthday and two just after his eighteenth birthday. I am dealing with the latter two. They were both committed on the same night when he and his co-offender broke into the Target store in Scone by removing a roof panel and then by cutting through some padlocks on a shipping container at the rear of the store. They then took a number of items of electronic equipment. Shortly thereafter they went to another shop in Scone. There they broken into more shipping containers, but did not take much material at all. The following day Mr Tibbey’s premises were searched, and he was arrested shortly thereafter when he attended at the Muswellbrook Police Station.4 These offences were serious, a matter which Mr Tibbey I do not think realised at the time, but hopefully does realise now. So serious are the matters that they carry with them standard non-parole periods of five years imprisonment. That of course is not of direct application in the present case because of the plea of guilty, but the standard non-parole period indicates the seriousness with which the legislature says judges should treat offences such as these. The community is rightfully sick and tired of people like Mr Tibbey committing offences of this kind.5 Quite clearly, however, when Mr Tibbey appeared before me in 2007, I consider that there were prospects for his rehabilitation. A report from a Dr Hampshire was tendered and that, and other evidence, suggested that Mr Tibbey had commenced the process of rehabilitating himself, but had some distance to go. As events have turned out, I was perhaps a bit optimistic. Nevertheless the fact that the offender has recently spent some time in custody will assist in his further rehabilitation through deterring him personally from committing further offences in the future.6 The offender’s upbringing was much less than satisfactory, although I note that this is something of an understatement. He is fortunate that his grandmother was able to take over the care of him from such a young age. His mother is a drug user and she has had little contact with him and in fact none in recent years. His father has spent time in custody for drug offences. He has recently been released from custody and is living Sydney. He has not attended court today.7 His grandmother is to be commended for the efforts that she has put into raising her grandson. I am sure that matters would have been much worse had she not taken the care of him that she has taken. She has done everything she could as far as I can see, to avoid the situation where Mr Tibbey is in custody and facing further time there.8 Mr Tibbey suffers from ADHD. That condition is related to his criminal offending directly because people like Mr Tibbey are less able to reason about the rightfulness and wrongfulness of their conduct, but also indirectly because Mr Tibbey was in the habit of self-medicating. He found that by taking amphetamines he was able to concentrate more, and become what he considered to be more normal. Unfortunately those with whom he took amphetamines described better feelings, higher feelings than simply feeling normal and Mr Tibbey therefore began to increase the dose of the drugs that he took in an attempt to feel the same way his fellow drug takers did.9 He says that these offences to which I am sentencing him today were committed so that he could obtain money in order to buy drugs, although when the police searched the premises they found most of the property. It seems to have been simply because there had not been time to sell it before the police arrived.10 Because of the offender’s ADHD, I will not impose a sentence upon him which has a full component of general deterrence. However as has been repeatedly pointed out, the fact that an offender suffers from a condition which suggests that general deterrence is of less importance does not mean that a lesser sentence must necessarily be imposed, because other purposes of sentencing, in this case particularly personal deterrence, may have increased relevance.11 The offender describes his recent time in custody as the worst time of his life. He explains why that is so and refers to the fact that he has been assaulted whilst in prison. I fully recognise that the decision I am making today requires the offender to spend longer in custody and that that is a significant circumstance where the offender is as young as Mr Tibbey is and where his conditions of custody are as bad as he describes. Nevertheless I regard it as important to deter Mr Tibbey from future offending and that he fully understands the consequences of further offending.12 Mr Tibbey was dealt with for the offence he committed whilst on the s 11 remand in the Local Court in March this year. Because he had been arrested in early September 2008, the magistrate sentenced Mr Tibbey to a fixed term of imprisonment, receiving seven months and six days. At the same time he was dealt with for breaching bonds imposed in the Children’s Court for the two other break, enter and steal offences that I have referred to. He received wholly concurrent sentences of six months imprisonment. That is why Mr Tibbey has spent over six months in custody so far.13 Mr Massey suggested that I should deal with this matter by way of a s 12 remand or, as a fallback position, home detention. I am not proposing to do either of those things. A s 12 remand would in my view be insufficient to fully personally deter the offender from future misconduct.14 It should not be thought that the offender’s life ahead is going to be an easy one. There are indications that things might well improve. The offender’s grandmother says that for the first time whilst visiting him in custody, her grandson realises that in truth he is to blame for his present predicament, not others. The offender has been seeing Mr Brandtman and hopes to continue treatment with him or someone recommended by him upon his release from custody.15 These matters do speak well of prospects for the future, but I am going to do what I can too to emphasise to the offender the choices that he has in the future. If he commits further offences, he will go back to gaol and as I said before, I want him to be fully aware of what that will involve. Of course this is not to suggest that I am imposing a sentence of imprisonment which is greater than is warranted by the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct. As I mentioned, the offender’s conduct was serious. It was an aggravated form of break enter and steal and carries a standard non-parole period allocated by Parliament. In no way could it be said that the sentence I am shortly to announce exceeds that required to reflect the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct, even given the mitigating features operating in his favour, most importantly perhaps, the fact that he was just over the age of eighteen at the time he committed these offences.16 Before announcing sentence I should make a recommendation. It is my recommendation that upon his return to custody, he is to be immediately reviewed by Justice Health regarding the appropriateness of the medication Zyprexa, currently prescribed for him.17 The offender pleaded guilty to these offences. I will discount the overall sentence that I would have imposed by twenty-five per cent to reflect those pleas of guilty. That discount is, in the circumstances of this case, reflected in my decision to make the sentences wholly concurrent. In other words were it not for the pleas of guilty, the overall sentence would have been longer.18 On each offence therefore, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of six months to commence on 6 April 2009. The non-parole period will expire on 5 October 2009 and I set head sentences in each case of eighteen months. The total sentence is thus expiring on 5 October 2010.19 It is a condition of the offender’s release to parole that he continue regular treatment with either Dr Pickering or a medical practitioner recommended by him. Other conditions of parole are that on parole he take all medication prescribed for him in accordance with the way in which it is to be prescribed and that he obey all reasonable directions of the Probation and Parole Service by whom is to be supervised whilst on parole.20 Mr Tibbey, you have understood what I have done? You have got another slightly more than six months to do. You get out on 5 October this year. Once you are out, you are on parole. On parole you have got to do those things I mentioned; continue seeing Dr Pickering or someone recommended by him, continuing to see the Probation and Parole Service, take any medication that is prescribed for you. If you do that then you do not go back to gaol. If you do not do it, you do go back to gaol and as I have said repeatedly to you, if you commit further offences, you will be going back to gaol as well. Your grandmother says it is no longer a case of you blaming others and taking responsibility for your own actions. It is you who decides whether you go back to gaol or not, do you understand.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court following his plea of guilty to a charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 7 years. The applicant also requested that a charge of common assault be taken into account on sentencing. A total term of imprisonment of 2 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 12 months was imposed which the applicant was ordered to serve by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    2 As there is no dispute about the facts, they can be briefly stated. On the evening in question the victim was socialising with three friends at the Billinudgel Hotel. They had been there consuming alcohol for a couple of hours when the applicant approached their table and struck up a conversation with them. He was clearly intoxicated and as he continued drinking he dribbled beer over his face and began spitting on the ground. When one of the victim’s companions rebuked the applicant, the applicant punched the victim to the left side of his face. At the time the applicant was holding a schooner glass in the hand with which he punched the victim. The glass cut through the full thickness of the victim’s mouth to his cheek. The wound bled profusely. The applicant then grabbed hold of the victim with his other hand. He then proceeded to punch him numerous times to his face and upper body with a clenched fist. Another of the victim’s friends, a man named David Speakman, pulled the applicant off the victim. The applicant then threw a punch at Mr Speakman who managed to avoid it. It was that conduct which constituted the offence of common assault. Security staff then removed the applicant from the area. As the victim’s friends were accompanying him to a car in which they intended taking him to hospital, the applicant approached the group from behind. He ran at Mr Speakman attempting to kick him in a karate style kick. Mr Speakman again avoided the blow and the applicant fell to the ground. The applicant was thereafter arrested but declined to be interviewed by police. 
     
      
    3 A number of reports were in evidence from which the sentencing judge was able to glean a good deal of information about the applicant’s background. There were also a number of references which attested to the applicant’s personal qualities. At the time of the offence the applicant was 29. He had been in a de facto relationship for a number of years and his partner remained supportive of him. He had children, with whom he remained in close contact, from a former relationship. The sentencing judge regarded his “record as a family man [as being] significant”. His Honour also took into account the fact that the applicant had a responsible job and that he and his father, who were in partnership in an earth moving business, had a number of employees who were dependent on them for their positions. 
     
      
    4 Although the applicant had a prior record, which consisted of an offence in 2000 of possessing a prohibited drug for which he was fined and a further offence in 2001 of supplying a prohibited drug in respect of which he was ordered to perform 250 hours of community service, his Honour treated it as being irrelevant to the present offence. The sentencing judge allowed the applicant a discount of 25% for his plea of guilty and also found that he was remorseful. 
     
      
    5 It is apparent that at the time of the offence, the applicant had been in the habit of drinking alcohol to excess. Moreover, he conceded that he had been consuming alcohol for about 5 hours prior to the incident in question. As a consequence, he professed to have no memory of it. He also told a psychologist that he had been traumatised by an incident which had occurred a couple of months before the present offence. During that incident his brother had been savagely assaulted and the applicant maintained that since then he had suffered anxiety and panic attacks. The applicant was apparently arrested following that incident and was accordingly on conditional liberty at the time of the present offence. 
     
      
    6 The evidence before the sentencing judge revealed that for about 12 months prior to sentence the applicant had been receiving professional assistance to help him with issues surrounding anger management and impulse control. He was also receiving drug and alcohol counselling and was said to be motivated to change his ways. 
     
      
    7 The sentencing judge made the following observations about the incident: 
     
      
       
        
        The agreed facts…show an unpleasant incident arising as a result of the excessive consumption of alcohol by the offender. The situation looked at from one point of view will be what is commonly described as a glassing, but there is more to it than that, but nevertheless those are very unpleasant incidents about which the public is understandably alarmed and it is very important for people to understand that acts of violence in public houses involving the use of glasses whether intentional or unintentional are viewed very seriously by the courts and the consequences will be severe. 
        
       
      
    8 His Honour nonetheless concluded that the applicant had not consciously used the glass as a weapon with the consequence that that factor could not be regarded as an aggravating factor within the meaning of s 21A(2)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act). 
     
      
    9 The sentencing judge described the effects of the applicant’s assault upon the victim in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        The material indicates that what happened as a result of the contact of the glass with the face of the victim was a most unpleasant injury and the subsequent photographs are a tribute to the medical people involved and not to anybody else although no doubt the victim cooperated as much as he could but they do show that the medical people did what can only be described as an excellent job. There is no further medical material indicating any consequences of that injury of a medical nature. There is, however, a victim impact statement which I have read and it sets out, understandably, the fears and concerns of the victim immediately afterwards and his feelings and it shows that he has still, and this is perfectly understandable in my view, a wariness in social situations and in view of what happened to him on this particular evening that is hardly surprising. 
        
       
      
    10 As a consequence, His Honour made the following finding: 
     
      
       
        
        I think….that the injury was substantial at the time and as I said it was a tribute to the doctors that they have reduced the effect of it and the appearance. I have no doubt there is still some scarring left and the emotional upset, in my view it was significant. Now whether that amounts to substantial is neither here nor there perhaps but overall I am satisfied that subs (g) is a relevant consideration. 
        
       
      
    11 The sole ground of appeal is that the sentencing judge erred in arriving at that finding. Section 21A(2)(g) provides that it is an aggravating factor that “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”. Although there is some ambiguity as to whether his Honour’s conclusion related to the victim’s physical injury or the emotional harm which he suffered or indeed both, it is clear nonetheless that he was satisfied that this requirement of the particular sub-section had been met. It was submitted that in so concluding the sentencing judge contravened the statutory prohibition contained in s 21A(2) that the court is “not to have additional regard to any aggravating factor if it is an element of the offence”. That provision prohibits “double counting” of any aggravating feature of an offence and extends to any feature which is an inherent characteristic of an offence of that kind: see Elyard v R [2006] NSWCCA 43. 
     
      
    12 It was submitted that it is an inherent characteristic of an offence in which grievous bodily harm is inflicted that the injury, be it a physical injury or emotional harm, will be substantial. I am inclined to accept that submission particularly given the facts of the present case. There was certainly no evidence that the injury, however it is characterised, went beyond what would normally be expected of an offence of this kind R v Youkhana [2004] NSWCCA 412. That however leaves the important question as to whether the sentencing judge had “additional regard” to this feature of the case. That question is best answered by having regard to the sentence which was imposed upon the applicant. His Honour rejected a submission from counsel, then appearing for the applicant, that a suspended sentence should be imposed. As I have said, the applicant received a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. He also received the benefit of a finding of “special circumstances”. 
     
      
    13 In my view, the sentencing judge extended to the applicant the maximum leniency which the circumstances of the case could possibly permit. The seriousness of offences of this kind, commonly known as “glassing”, can hardly be doubted: see Sayin v R [2008] NSWCCA 307 [at par 47]. Moreover, there was also the Form 1 matter to be taken into consideration as well as the fact that the applicant was on bail at the time of the offence. I am far from persuaded that there has been any impermissible “double counting”. Putting the matter another way, even if the sentencing judge has fallen into error, I would unhesitatingly conclude that no other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal 1912. 
     
      
    14 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

    JUDGMENT1 A jury found the offenders guilty after a trial in the District Court at Parramatta between 15 and 27 October 2008. 2 The counts on which the offenders were convicted are as follows:Count 13 Mr Han – On or about 13 August 2006 at Campsie in the State of New South Wales, in the company of other persons, with menaces did demand from AL an amount of money, namely $17,700 with intent to steal that money from Mr AL.4 This count was brought pursuant to section 99(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for the offence is 14 years imprisonment.Count 25 Mr Hu and Mr Huang (jointly) – Between 28 April 2007 and 3 May 2007 at Carlingford in the State of New South Wales, Pei Nan Hu and Lifeng Huang being in the company of each other, with menaces did demand from AL an amount of money, namely $10,000, with intent to steal that money from AL.6 This count was brought pursuant to section 99(2) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for the offence is 14 years imprisonment.Count 37 Mr Han – Whereas between 28 April 2007 and 3 May 2007 at Carlingford in the State of New South Wales, Pei Nan Hu and Lifeng Huang being in the company of each other, with menaces did demand from AL an amount of money, namely $10,000, with intent to steal that money from AL, and that Zhi Qiang Han, before the said serious indictable offence was committed, between 28 April 2007 and 3 May 2007 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did incite move, procure, aid counsel, hire and command the said Pei Nan Hu and Lifeng Huang to commit the said serious indictable offence in the manner aforesaid.8 This count was brought pursuant to sections 99(2) and of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for the offence is 14 years imprisonment.Count 49 Mr Hu – On 3 May 2007, at Carlingford in the State of New South Wales, did deal with the proceeds of crime, namely $100 of Australian currency, knowing that it was the proceeds of crime.10 This count was brought pursuant to section 193B(2) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for the offence is 15 years imprisonment.Count 511 Mr Huang – On 3 May 2007, at Carlingford in the State of New South Wales, did deal with proceeds of crime, namely $30 of Australian currency, knowing that it was the proceeds of crime. 12 This count was brought pursuant to section 193B(2) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for the offence is 15 years imprisonment.Facts13 The jury’s verdict appears to be consistent with the following:14 In about May-June 2006 the victim, Mr AL, was employed as head chef in Mr Han’s restaurant at Campsie. AL was a Cantonese-speaking ex-resident of Hong Kong. He was an Australian citizen.15 Mr Han had invested about $40,000 in stock for the restaurant. After some months, Han and the manager of his restaurant, Hong Chen, found that the restaurant was not making money. Chen’s suspicions were that AL was stealing. The assistant manager, Mr Zhou, said that he had seen AL taking a large Styrofoam box to AL’s car. 16 He engaged Mr Zhou and one of the restaurant’s waiters, Charlie Wong, to investigate the disappearance of food. Wong then borrowed AL’s vehicle. He said that he had seen two boxes of seafood and other raw food in the boot of the car.17 Chen brought those suspicions to Mr Han’s attention with the suggestion that a CCTV/ surveillance camera be installed. Mr Han authorised that.18 On Sunday 13 August 2006, AL approached Chen for his fortnightly pay. Chen told him to come to an upstairs room above the restaurant where Chen showed AL a video of AL allegedly taking food from the restaurant. AL did not know there was a video/CCTV camera in the restaurant.19 That video was played in front of the jury. It showed AL taking a box from the rear entrance of the restaurant. It was unclear what was in the box. Whatever was there, it did not seem to constitute a substantial amount or volume of seafood or other food stuff. This becomes relevant when one considers the demand that was made for $17,700.20 Chen accused AL of stealing. AL denied he had stolen and said that if that was Chen’s view, then he, AL, might as well quit.21 Chen then was joined by Han and the two of them made allegations about the amounts of money outstanding. Han and Chen asked AL how much he was prepared to pay. As I understand the evidence there was no attempt to justify the amount demanded. AL said that amount was never fully explained to him.Mr AL's Fear22 AL said that he was fearful of both Chen and Han because “I knew about their background – I knew they had some kind of criminal background” so he put forward the sum of $2,000 to settle the matter. He was concerned for his own personal safety. He remembered words having been said like “my hand would be chopped off”.23 AL said that at the time Chen asked about compensation “I was very scared and I replied to him saying 'I don’t have that much money to pay'.""AL offered to pay $2,000. AL's proposal that he pay a smaller amount of the order of $2,000 was rejected by Chen. Chen got angry and said to him “I won’t take one cent of that – don’t even think about leaving this restaurant”. Han also said that he was well-off and he wouldn't take any part of the $2,000.Other allegations24 Mr Chen also alleged in the presence of Han and two other Chinese men that he, AL, had collaborated with a vegetable deliveryman to defraud the restaurant of money, in particular, by the provision of goods, which were under par in weight.25 These threats were made when AL was sitting on a chair, Chen was sitting next to him, and Han was to the right of Chen. Standing up there were two other Chinese men in the room.26 The figure of $17,700 was originally mentioned. AL was owed wages at that time of $2,700 (AL’s net salary for two weeks) and he was told that he still needed to pay $15,000. He said that he didn’t have that amount of money to pay.27 Mr Chen did not give evidence. In the sentencing proceedings, Mr Han said that he could not find Mr Chen.IOU document28 Chen came back into the room with a piece of paper and some writing on it asking AL to copy what was in the paper in his own handwriting. The document contained an admission by AL that he owed $17,700 with the deduction of his two weeks salary resulting in the debt owed of $15,000. That item was in Chinese Script and was an exhibit in the trial.29 Chen asked AL to write out and sign the IOU. AL wrote it out but didn’t sign it. Ms CL30 AL had a friend, Ms CL, who also owned a restaurant. CL gave evidence at the trial. AL and CL had been in a relationship on a previous occasion when AL owned a takeaway shop. CL occasionally visited AL at Han’s restaurant. 31 Han then said that AL needed a sponsor or guarantor of his, AL’s, debt. Chen asked AL to ring his girlfriend and ask her to become a sponsor/guarantor for what was said to be AL’s debt.32 AL said that Han had said “well you can find any other person as long as they are willing to become your sponsor (guarantor)”. Chen insisted that CL would be the guarantor.33 As a result of these comments AL rang CL. When he had difficulties in contacting her, Mr Chen said words to the effect of “if my girlfriend could not arrive before 2am he could not guarantee that anything might happen and that he would also send someone to burn down her restaurant and also my family members will be hurt” (T16L9-13). There is no evidence that Mr Han was present at that time. However, the Crown ran the case as a joint criminal enterprise. Mr Han was clearly on the restaurant premises in the immediate vicinity. On any view, there is an overwhelming inference that Han knew that threats were made and the general nature of them.34 About a half an hour later CL arrived at the restaurant and was showed up into the upper story of the restaurant. CL asked Mr Chen to show her the videotape and then asked Mr Chen how much he thought that AL had stolen from the restaurant.35 When CL said that AL was not stealing anything by the boxes and that was confirmed by AL saying that he didn’t steal anything, Mr Chen told AL to shut up. Chen said that they needed to teach AL a lesson. CL proposed to pay $5,000 to settle the matter. Chen rejected this proposal saying they must pay at least $15,000. Chen then left AL and CL in the room on their own where they had a discussion about how they could pay an amount to get out of the situation and the premises. 36 When Mr Chen and Mr Han returned, the demand was again made that a $5,000 payment would be unacceptable but what was wanted was the sum of $15,000 by the following Tuesday, in other words, in 48 hours time. CL said that she then asked “what if I can’t do it” (in other words pay the $15,000) to which the response was “you know who I am, and you also know that I got a lot of brothers around”.37 CL then signed the IOU document and Mr Chen said they could leave. AL and CL said that they were both very scared that evening as a result of what had happened. Over the next couple of days they tried to make alternative finance arrangements to meet the demand, which had been made including drawing down on a home loan and borrowing from friends. They were unsuccessful.38 She, CL, was also terrified because of her family members being located in Sydney. She was also told that, if she didn’t sign the IOU document as a guarantor, she would not be able to leave the premises. CL also confirmed that she and AL spoke about the matter over the next few days. They came to the conclusion that they were unable to raise the money and that they should then report the matter to the police.39 I accept CL’s evidence – and her fear – as being genuine.Mr AL: visit to police40 Mr Chen had imposed a deadline of two days. AL and CL then went to the police to report the matter, which they did on 15 August 2006.Events at King Crab restaurant: Carlingford41 AL was sacked from Han’s restaurant at Campsie on the evening/morning of 13/14 August 2006. After some months he obtained another job working at the King Crab Restaurant in Carlingford. He was there on 29 April 2007, a Sunday evening, at about 10pm when his (new) boss told him there were two males waiting for him outside. Those were admitted to be Mr Hu and Mr Huang. AL did not know them and had never seen them before. Hu introduced himself as ‘Tom’. There was an issue in the trial as to whether any other terms or words were used including the words ‘Fat Tom from Big Circle’. It appears those words were said the following night.42 Mr Hu said that he, AL, owed his former boss (obviously Han) some money and that he, Hu, was there to collect the debt. Mr Hu also mentioned the IOU which had been written out by AL at the Keung Kee Seafood Restaurant. Mr Hu said that he wanted to collect the debt of $10,000.AL’s reaction to Hu and Huang43 AL said that it had been some months since he had reported the matter to the police and suddenly Mr Hu and Mr Huang had appeared. He said he was very scared so he immediately rang the police again.44 By arrangement, Hu and Huang came around to AL’s place of employment on the following evening, 30 April 2007. Following his discussions with the police, AL had obtained $1,000 first in marked police notes. He said to Hu and Huang that he could pay that amount and sought a docket (receipt) from Hu and Huang. AL was wearing a listening device. 45 Again, by arrangement on 1 May 2007, AL rang Han. He was initially unable to make contact with him. He then rang Mr Hu and told him that he had had a windfall at the Casino and was able to pay off the $9,000 remaining to him. 46 Mr Han subsequently returned AL’s call. AL asked whether he, Han, had sent Hu over to see him to collect the debt. He further asked whether Han had received the $1,000 handed over to ‘Tom’.47 Han said he had received the $1,000 and asked AL whether he had reported the matter to police. Han said that AL needed to pay the remaining part of the money and said words to the effect of “if you are looking for trouble, I can surely give you a lot of trouble through my boys”. Counsel for Hu submits, correctly, that statement is not admissible against Mr Hu.48 On 3 May 2007 by arrangement, Hu and Huang came to the back dock area of the restaurant. Again, AL was wearing listening devices. He handed over the money ($9,000) to Hu and wrote out a receipt or docket. Claim of right49 The offender, Han, based part of his defence on the fact that there was a claim of right, in other words, that he had a genuine belief in the fact that AL owed him money as a result of his stealing or embezzlement of food stuffs and other stock belonging to Han’s restaurant. He told Dr Jacmon that he thought the thieving had occurred over some time and represented about six weeks’ net income.50 It was a part of the defence claim that what was involved was a legitimate commercial debt recovery process, that the IOU document evidenced that debt which had been acknowledged by AL; further, that that claim of right extended to the actions taken by Hu and Huang in that inferentially, they were operating according to the legitimate claims made by Mr Han. Moreover, that Mr Han specifically instructed his then barrister and solicitor to go to the police to take action to recover the debt owed by AL.51 Counsel for Han submits that the IOU document and the itemised list of items allegedly stolen by AL that was handed to police are consistent with lawful debt recovery.52 The jury were specifically instructed on that claim of right. It must be taken that the jury rejected that claim of right. Further, that the jury must have found that Han had the intention to steal at that time.53 AL was cross-examined as to whether he had put a box of seafood into his car. He strongly denied the allegation. In relation to the plastic bag of noodles that were taken outside the restaurant by AL, AL said that those noodles were for his personal consumption as part of the normal arrangement that operated in Chinese restaurants entitling staff to free meals.54 AL also denied the allegation made by the waiter, Charlie Wong, that he, Wong, had seen food items in AL’s car. Another staff member said he also saw food items in AL’s car. There was no attempt by Han, nor others at his instruction, to justify the amount claimed i.e. $17,700.Additional/alternative matters55 The Crown submits, and I accept, that the jury’s verdict must be interpreted as meaning:· That the jury rejected the claim of right defence;· That the jury accepted that Mr Hu was either a member of the Big Circle gang or at least that he said these or similar words to intimidate the victim;· That either of the phrases “there may be trouble” or “there would be trouble” could have been accepted by the jury as constituting menaces in these particular circumstances. In my view, having heard the evidence, there was no ambiguity in the threatening intention involved.56 I accept that Han thought he was suffering losses and that he had gone to some trouble to install a CCTV camera. AL was shown on the CCTV camera leaving the restaurant with a box. Mr Han thereafter made a number of arrangements to pursue his own actions and to recover a very substantial amount of money from an employee earning relatively minimal income.Use of words: ‘Big Circle Gang’57 AL said that Hu mentioned the words ‘Big Circle’, in particular, saying that he was from Big Circle. That was on the second evening when the words “Fat Tom from Big Circle” were used. AL understood that that was a kind of criminal gang whose members engaged in criminal activities. AL said that the impact on him of those words was that he became “very scared because then I knew that he belonged to that kind of people”.Background and continuing threats58 AL also gave evidence that during the course of the conversation when AL was required to watch the video in the room above the restaurant, Chen had said words to the effect of “you have been working for us for three months, you’ve stolen many things and in the past if these things had happened, my henchmen would’ve broken your hands already”. At that stage AL did not know where Han was, in particular, whether Han was present in the room or not, although he probably had re-entered the room by that time. He was certainly in the vicinity.59 AL also said that as soon as he heard the word “trouble” from Mr Hu he was afraid “because he mentioned the fact that he was from the Big Circle Gang, that he was a member of a criminal organisation."" That reminded him of what Mr Chen had threatened him with eight months previously.Mr Han’s case60 Mr Han’s evidence was that he had showed or arranged for Chen to show the video of what was said to be AL stealing items from the restaurant and that he, Han, had said to AL that if the amounts weren’t paid, Han would ensure that the video was shown to all future employers. Against that background, counsel for Mr Han submits that the case should be viewed in the context of a dispute between employer/employee.Involvement of Mr Huang61 At all times Mr Hu was accompanied by Mr Huang.62 It was clear from the evidence that at no stage did Huang ever say anything during the meetings with AL. He was not introduced to him. He made no threatening actions or comments towards AL in any way. He was simply present at all times when Mr Hu made the comments he did.63 Moreover, it was also clear that Mr Huang as a matter of strongest inference was a Mandarin speaker whereas many of the conversations took place in Cantonese.Jury’s verdict64 The jury clearly rejected the suggestion that the negotiations over the IOU and the amount contained in it was part of a process of attempting to settle a debt. AL had said that he thought that he was obliged to write out the IOU document before he was allowed to leave.65 The jury also clearly rejected the suggestion that AL only made a complaint to the police on or after 15 August 2006 as a method of “getting in first” to dispute that he owed the money to Han.Connection – Mr Han, Mr Hu, and Mr Huang66 Mr Han gave evidence that he had known Hu for over 20 years from their days together in China, that he became aware that Mr Hu had no job and was in financial difficulties. Han said to Hu “if you go to collect a debt for me I can pay you some money”. The language of the telephone intercepts between Han and Hu does suggest a more serious operation involving, at the very least, pressure.67 Mr Han had never known, or met, Mr Huang other than two or three times.Evidence: Detective Inspector Cook68 Detective Inspector Cook gave evidence that he had been the Officer in Charge of the investigation at Strike Force Willowvale set up to investigate the activities of the Big Circle Gang. In that capacity he was responsible for reviewing all the intelligence taken during the course of the investigation as well as the overview of statements taken and the direction of the investigation. He had also been in charge of an investigation and had Strike Force Brome established to investigate the upper members of the Big Circle Gang.69 As a result of his training, studying and experience, he gave evidence that the Big Circle Gang was a criminal organisation, the members of which engaged in criminal activities.Evidence on sentencing proceedings70 Han gave evidence on the sentencing proceedings but Hu and Huang did not.Pre-sentence reports71 Pre-sentence reports were ordered. The Probation and Parole Service sent letters to each offender at the address provided but for a variety of reasons none of the offenders initially responded. 72 Mr Han through his legal representatives followed the matter up and a report dated 12 February 2009 was tendered. That report notes that Mr Han claimed that he spoke about his complaint to the police who told him ‘…the complaint was trivial and to talk with the former chef himself’. He also did not accept his guilt for the offence. He was assessed as being suitable for a Community Service Order but ineligible for a periodic detention order. In his oral evidence in the course of sentencing proceedings he said he now understood that he could not take the law into his own hands.73 The following personal details were provided in relation to each offender:Han74 Mr Han is 47 years old. He resides with his 15-year-old son and 21-year-old daughter, both of whom he provides with financial assistance. The son and daughter have a good relationship. His 21-year-old daughter, who lives at home, does not work. His son is in Year 10 in high school. They attended court during these sentencing proceedings. His former wife normally lives in the same premises although currently she is in hospital in Shanghai recovering from a broken leg received in an accident. She will return to Australia in around six months time.75 Han is the owner and manager of the Keung Kee Seafood Restaurant in Campsie, which is his sole source of income. He currently works seven days per week between 5pm and 3am, and employs 12 staff at any given time. His evidence was that managing the restaurant has been a successful business for him.76 His absence from the restaurant will cause a drop-off in the business possibly to the point of closure in six months time. When Mr Han was in goal in 2002, his son was looked after by his sister with whom he had, and has, a close relationship.Huang77 Mr Huang is aged 19. Huang contacted the Probation and Parole Service on 3 November 2008 at which time he updated his address. A letter was sent to this address on 22 January 2009, which garnered no response from the offender. A home visit was conducted on 4 February 2009 and it was found the address did not exist. A pre-sentence report was not prepared.78 In the light of the foreshadowed penalty of a suspended sentence for Huang, no pre-sentence was requested.Psychological report: Hu79 Mr Hu is aged 40. Despite being directed to attend the Probation and Parole Service by this court, two letters on 14 January and 22 January 2009, and a home visit on 5 February 2009, Mr Hu had no contact with the service as a result of a problem with the Legal Aid Commission regarding the notification of his address and therefore a pre-sentence report could not be prepared. 80 However in relation to Mr Hu, a report by psychologist Michelle Player dated 5 December 2008 was tendered, which it was agreed covered relevant matters to a pre-sentence report. It provides that Mr Hu was raised in Shanghai, China, and enjoyed a close relationship with his mother, but his father, who held very high expectations of him, was physically abusive towards him leading to a situation where Mr Hu left home at 17 to attend university. He emigrated to Australia in 1990. He has not returned to China since arriving in Australia 18 years ago.81 Mr Hu graduated from university in China after studying drama but since arriving in Australia he has worked primarily in restaurants as well as having various jobs such as a cleaner, store hand, and packer. He has often been unemployed. He is assessed as having above average intelligence.82 Mr Hu has lives with his partner of three years. He has no children. He has no substance or alcohol abuse issues, but had problematic gambling behaviour between 1997 and 2003 during which time he lost most of his savings.83 Mr Hu has diabetes for which he is prescribed medication. He was in a coma in December 2008. He is otherwise in reasonable health. That seems to be in conflict with the medical reports tendered referring to his diabetic coma last year. The report notes that ‘Mr Hu did not endorse anti-social attitudes despite his prior offence or an entrenched pattern of criminal offending’. It is difficult to reconcile that with his prior offence and the relative recency of that offence and sentence prior to these matters.84 Ms Player’s report is particularly relevant as to the sentencing options that should be considered and the impact on Hu of any incarceration.References85 A number of references were tendered on behalf of each offender.86 Mr Hu’s fiancée provided a reference contradicting the evidence as to Mr Hu’s good health and stating that they intend to marry in the near future. His former employer stated that Mr Hu had been employed as a chef.87 Mr Huang’s family and friends indicated that there was little acceptance of Mr Huang’s guilt or his association with Mr Hu. Further, that he comes from a secure, respectable family background and that Mr Huang as a son and brother, is ‘a good kind boy’ who is ‘disciplined and ‘… very good and kind and one who does favours to others’. Precisely where the offender’s ongoing employment as a security guard/receptionist in the Fallen Angels brothel fits into this picture is unclear. During the trial he attended court wearing a large head bandage said to have resulted from an altercation at the brothel to which police were called. That necessitated an adjournment during the trial.88 I have some reservations about his prospects of rehabilitation if he remains in that field of employment. He intends to move back to study, hopefully, in more traditional academic pursuits.Section 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act factorsAggravating factors89 The fact that liability arises from a joint criminal enterprise does not mean that the court cannot take into account the commission of the offence in company or a degree of planning as aggravating factors: Imnetu v R [2006] NSWCCA 203 at [55].Planning/ premeditation90 The actions of Han were part of a planned or organised criminal activity – for example, the preparation of videotape and the playing of it to show the victim and the involvement of other staff. The demand was made with four other men in the room. Han was involved in recruiting at least Hu (and with knowledge of Huang) in order to continue making the demand. 91 The period of time involved was over two separate periods of August 2006 and April/May 2007. Therefore there was effectively ongoing criminal activity over a period of eight months.Threats of violence92 These threats are an essential part of the menace and therefore should not be taken into account as an aggravating factor – The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 38393 Counsel for Han submits that it was open to the jury to find that the offender did threaten the accused but that the threat was not a threat of violence. I find that the language of Han, and in his presence, Chen, included inherent threats that raised fear that was entirely reasonable and foreseeable.Prior convictions94 Han has convictions for obtaining money by deception, a number of offences for supplying a prohibited drug and possessing a prohibited drug. For the offence of supplying prohibited drugs in 2000, he received a term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. That includes a sentence for obtain money by deception.95 Counsel for Han submits that the most serious offence was committed eight years previously, he has already been punished by serving 2 ½ years in prison, and the present conviction bears no reference to drug-related activity.96 Hu has convictions for using false instrument and goods in custody as well as for malicious injury (section 35 of Crimes Act). 97 Huang has no prior convictions.98 Counsel for Han also submits that the present offences are not reflective of a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law, and that the offender has done well since his period of imprisonment, establishing a restaurant and caring for two children, therefore, the eight year period between major offences is punctuated only by a single conviction for possessing a prohibited drug and that this is not reflective of a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. I do not accept this.99 The Crown Prosecutor submits that Han and Hu have criminal histories that show a clear “attitude of disobedience to the law” (Veen v R (No. 2) (1998) 164 CLR 465.100 Counsel for Han further submits that taking into account in sentencing for an offence all aspects, both positive and negative, of an offender’s known character and antecedents is not to punish the offender again for those earlier matters; it is to take proper account of matters which are relevant to fixing the sentence under consideration (Weininger v The Queen (2003) 212 CLR 629).101 Furthermore, counsel for Han also submits that although the offender received a period in fulltime custody of 2 years and 6 months (NPP) in 2000 for drug offences, there is no suggestion of drugs being associated with the present offences. He has already been “seriously” punished.102 In my view, both Han and Hu have prior convictions in the relatively recent past, which in both cases resulted in sentences of imprisonment. Those indicate an ongoing contempt for the law, disentitling both of them from any leniency. That is particularly the case for Mr Hu when he was given a sentence for a similar offence.Mitigating factors103 Counsel for Han submits that the victim provoked the offender because the victim was detected stealing from him, and that the offences are at the lower end of the scale because the facts are punctuated with acts consistent with lawful debt collection. The offender gave evidence that stealing by an employee, in his view, warranted full investigation.Remorse104 Mr Han expresses remorse through his counsel and in his evidence. That is at odds with the contents of the pre-sentence report dated 12 February 2009 and his evidence in the face of the sentencing proceedings that Mr Han ‘cannot understand how he was found guilty of the offence, portraying himself as the victim’.105 Further, the report states that he understands that it was wrong to commence debt collection processes in this manner and that he should have reported the theft to police. He also expresses remorse for CL having to attend the restaurant in the early hours of the morning and concedes that she would have been scared.106 In my view what remorse has been expressed has been in the course of the sentencing proceedings. Neither Mr Hu nor Mr Huang gave evidence.Sentencing options107 The pre-sentence and psychologist’s reports indicate that the following sentencing options are available:Han108 Han has been deemed suitable for a Community Service Order but ineligible for a Periodic Detention Order.Hu109 Hu has no contact with the Probation and Parole Service and was therefore not assessed for sentencing options.Huang110 I indicated my preliminary view to counsel that a suspended sentence might be an appropriate sentence for Mr Huang. After being pressed to take instructions on this point, the Crown concedes that, provided an appropriate primary or head sentence is established, a suspended sentence would not be outside the appellable range of discretion.Suspended sentence111 In relation to the offender, Huang, I have had regards to the principles enunciated by the High Court in the decision of Dinsdale v R (2000) 202 CLR 321 as well as the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in this State in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17.112 In Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [23], Howie J set out the approach to be taken in considering this issue:  
     
      
      “It is clear when sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment a court is required to undertake a number of steps before finally determining the appropriate sentence. Each step requires the court to consider the objective gravity of the offence balanced against the subjective circumstances of the offender but it is the first of those considerations that will principally determine which of the available sentencing alternatives the court should adopt. This is because at the end of the day the sentence must be commensurate with the seriousness of the crime”  
      
    113 and at [32]:  
     
      
      “a sentencing court must approach the imposition of a sentence that is suspended on the basis that it can be a sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent to both the general public and the particular offender. Of course it must also be recognized that the face that the execution of the sentence is to be immediately suspended will deprive the punishment of much of its effectiveness in this regard because it is a significantly more lenient penalty than any other sentence of imprisonment. It is perhaps trite to observe that although the purpose of punishment is the protection of the community that purpose can be achieved in an appropriate case by a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence retribution and denunciation. In such a case a suspended sentence may be particularly effective and appropriate.” 
      
    114 Here it does seem to me that the sentence for this offence normally should be one of full time custodial imprisonment to mark the seriousness and type of the offence, the maximum penalty involved and the circumstances involved on a broader level and the joint criminal enterprise in which he was involved. Those matters are more fully set out below and include the nature of the closed community involved, the position of AL as a relatively isolated and vulnerable person within that community. The nature of the threats made and the fact that the offenders went back repeatedly at AL’s new work place. In my view the sentence which would normally be imposed would be one of 18 months imprisonment.115 However, the particular circumstances as they involved Mr Huang make it in my view, appropriate that the sentence of imprisonment imposed should be suspended. That is essentially that the role that Huang played was that of a ‘foot-soldier’ accompanying Hu and not actually participating in any criminal or menacing activities other than by his presence. His relatively minor involvement in what actually occurred, indeed, the evidence is he did not say anything to AL at any time. The fact that he was not a party to any threats or presentation of violence (other than by his presence) as well as his subjective factors such as his age, the absence of any prior convictions and the strong prospects for rehabilitation, given his relationship and employment, also warrant the sentence being suspended.AuthoritiesPrinciples of sentencing arising on related matters: matters to be taken into account116 I have considered the following authorities in the context of these matters:117 R v Antoun; R v Antoun [2004] NSWCCA 268 involved two males threatening a nightclub owner for protection money over several months. They argued a claim of right. Several men thrashed the complainant’s nightclub as a threat and $8,000 was extorted. Joseph Antoun was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. Antoine Antoun, whose role primarily as a message deliverer, was sentenced to 3 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. The Court of Criminal Appeal confirmed the sentence although ultimately the High Court quashed the conviction and ordered a retrial.118 R v Truong [1999] NSWCCA 272 involved six males demanding protection money from a brothel. The offender who made the demand was sentenced to 4 years and 8 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months after a plea of guilty. The Court considered at [33] that this was a “particularly serious offence … where a strong deterrent element was necessary.”119 Further in Truong [1999] NSWCCA 272 at 15, Carruthers AJ stated that: 
     
      
      “It is significant that the Chief Judge [in the District Court, who referred to standover tactics in the Asian community] found it necessary to refer to the prevalence with which matters similar to the present matter come before the courts. It is, of course, a matter of grave public concern that standover tactics with threats of violence be used in order to seek to obtain protection money from institutions and, accordingly, such offences should be the subject of deterrent sentences.” 
      
    120 Both Antoun and Truong related to extortion rackets with stand-over tactics in the context of organised gangs. This is not such a case although the use of the words ‘Big Circle’ was part of the menace. There is no evidence that any one here was part of Big Circle or, for that matter, any triad or illegal group.121 In regards to parity between co-offenders, Carruthers AJ stated in Truong at [27-30] that:  
     
      
      “By way of general comment, may I say that Lowe’s case (1984) 154 CLR 606 contemplates that a prisoner, when sentenced in relation to a joint criminal enterprise with one or more co-offenders, may have a sense of grievance if the sentences which are imposed on a co-offender or co-offenders are relatively less severe than that imposed upon him or her if the circumstances (both subjective and objective) are such that it is possible for the relevant court to determine that there was a lack of parity between the sentences. It is not generally possible to reach such a conclusion if there are distinct differences between both the objective and the subjective features associated with each offender.” 
      
    122 The following matters also seem to be relevant in the context of robbery offences.123 Wright v R [2006] NSWCCA 122 involved the victim and offender working together. The victim saw the offender stealing and reported it, resulting in the offender losing his job. The offender used threats of retribution, violence, and death to make the victim withdraw monies from an ATM. The total extortion amounted to $8,995. The offender was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years after a plea of guilty.124 R v Nguyen [2000] NSWCCA 44 involved the co-accused of Truong. Two men entered a brothel with concealed pistols. The offender and Truong entered and Truong spoke to the undercover police officer however it was Truong who made the demand. The offender was sentenced after a trial to imprisonment for 4 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months.125 Marcus v R [2007] NSWCCA 229 involved the offender making threats towards the victim on the pretence that the victim owed him $40,000 and unless the victim helped him procure a $30,000 vehicle then “something bad [was] going to happen [to] his house.” The vehicle belonged to the offender’s friend. The offender was known to the victim as a member of a local group involved in extortion. The demand was made and the vehicle’s registration was signed over to the offender. The trial Judge described the offence at [15] as “objectively very serious, notwithstanding that it did not involve violence against the victims.” He was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years.126 The authorities indicate that the matters that need to be considered in sentencing for these offences include:· The difficulties in detection and encouraging victims of such crimes to come forward. Here the offences took place within a relatively isolated and close-knit community, specifically that of the employee group with the Asian community.· The amount involved· The time period over which the offences were committedGeneral deterrence127 For Han it was submitted that the appropriate sentences would be a community service order of 500 hours for Mr Han and a suspended sentence for Mr Hu. In my view, neither sentence would meet the requirements of general and specific deterrence.JIRS statistics128 The JIRS statistics for these offences indicate for these offences that :Section 99(2) – demand property with intent to steal in company:32 total cases, 59% prison.Term of sentence: 12 months (5%); 18 months (16%); 24 months (26%); 30 months (21%); 36 months (26%); 42 months (5%).Non-parole period: 6 months (7%); 12months (53%); 18 months (33%); 24 months (7%).129 Section 193B(2) – knowingly deal with proceeds of crime3 total cases, 100% prisonTerm of sentence: 12 months, 48 months, 6 years.Non-parole period: 12 months, 18 months, 42 months.Finding as to criminality involved130 Counsel for Hu submits that Hu’s intended use of these words as a menace, there is simply no evidence that Mr Hu knew anything as to what had happened in August, 2006, at the Spice Girls restaurant, particularly in relation to any threats by the manager, Chen, or the actions of Han. While he may not have known exactly what happened, Han did have, at that time, an intent to steal. Hu was a good and long term friend of Han’s, and, given the jury’s verdict, he, Hu, must have known he was participating in the making of an illegal demand.Parity131 Han and Hu were involved in different and separate acts of criminality. 132 Counsel for Hu submits that if Mr Huang is likely to receive a suspended sentence, that principles of parity would warrant the same approach to Mr Hu. I disagree. There is a considerable age difference, difference in prior convictions, and their different roles. I find that Mr Hu was the principal in the matter of the two offenders given his actions and conversations.Local Court133 Counsel for Hu also submits that this matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court as far as Mr Hu was concerned. Further that the Local Court penalties and sentencing opinions should be considered.Consideration134 Against the background of the matters set out above, in my view, the facts of the offence and the circumstances of the offenders make the following matters relevant on sentence:135 In terms of general principles, crimes of extortion and demand with menaces, particularly where they occur in isolated and relatively closed migrant communities, involve vulnerable people. Moreover, difficulties in detection let alone getting those affected to give evidence cause substantial difficulties to law enforcement officers. Depending on the amounts and criminality involved, such matters generally warrant custodial penalties from the point of view of general deterrence. This is particularly the case where, as here, the offences as far as Mr Han’s involvement was concerned, continued over a period of time and involved ongoing contact with and pursuit of AL at his new place of employment.136 Count 1 involved a demand for $17,700 when the amount demanded bore no relationship for the purported justification of goods said to have been stolen by AL in the course of his employment. Even if the offender Han considered that food had been stolen from him by AL as a cook, there was no correlation on the evidence between what was taken in the styrofoam box shown in the video and $17,700. Even at current prices, there would have to be a lot of seafood taken to justify a demand for $17,700.137 What occurred thereafter was an ongoing demand for an amount which AL as a cook could not afford, requiring him to involve his partner/girlfriend CL. She was effectively forced to become ‘a guarantor’ of what was said to be the debt. The threats grew proportionately larger. Having observed her giving evidence, there was no doubt in my mind of her fear.138 It is unclear precisely who used the words which had that impact on AL, either Han or Chen. However, even if the words were used by Chen, those were uttered in the presence of, or in the immediate vicinity of, Mr Han and for his clear purposes. The Crown case was that as a joint criminal enterprise, Mr Han was either in the room or in the immediate vicinity. The arrangements made to confront AL were made with Han’s knowledge and at his direction.139 The words used must be viewed in the context of having been made in the restaurant area to which the victim, AL, had been taken and where he was, in the company of others when CL was asked to arrive. The background of the other language used to AL about the offender’s other activities must also be taken into account as a clear, if implied, threat of violence. Any ordinary person of normal stability and courage – let alone a person such as AL in his circumstances, relatively isolated in a foreign country – would be, and be known to be, fearful in such a situation.140 I find that Han, who instigated and planned the demand money with menaces by Mr Hu and Mr Huang, is therefore more morally culpable than his co-offenders. Moreover, the attempt to recover the amount was extended through from August 2006 to April/May 2007 when AL was discovered working in a different restaurant some distance away. It was submitted that the evidence establishes AL’s new work address was obtained by one of Mr Han’s employees. Mr Han made the arrangements after that with Mr Hu. To continue a demand in those circumstances bespeaks a determination and persistence that is a continuation of the planning and premeditation that took place in the original offence. 141 The impact on AL to know at this later date that he was under this continuing surveillance and that he would be subject to continuing demands must have been considerable. He was a person who, by virtue of his language limitations and employment experience, was likely to be confined to working within the world of Chinese restaurants. AL is likely to have felt that he had no opportunity to escape the pressure that was being placed on him as soon as his re-location to obtain alternative employment was discovered. Hu and Huang visited him, then re-visited him, at those premises. The telephone intercepts make it clear that was done at Mr Han’s urging and with his full knowledge.142 I do not accept that there can be any cultural misunderstanding of the nature of commercial debt recovery as seems to have been implied, or a sense of misplaced entitlement arising out of an employment relationship. Han did contact the police but only after AL had contacted the police. 143 The message must be sent through this sentence that such attempts at debt recovery are not justified nor to be tolerated in Australia. 144 I do not find that Mr Han was a member of any criminal organisation. Nor do I accept that there was any provocation of Mr Han by AL in any legal sense. However I find that Mr Hu and Mr Chen made references to Big Circle, which was an inference from Mr Hu saying he was ‘from’ Big Circle, which would be calculated to induce fear into AL. There was a clear inference as to what that meant. AL said several times that he was scared, in my view, on the evidence, with good reason.Role145 The evidence establishes that Mr Han was the instigator and principal player in establishing the circumstances in which the initial demand was made. He persisted with that activity and, having discovered AL’s new place of employment, then turned to Mr Hu who in turn recruited Mr Huang to recover the amount demanded. The period of time over which the offences occurred requires a separate sentence. 146 The telephone conversations referred to above between AL and Han make Mr Han’s continuing involvement clear as well as his clear commercial motivation and awareness of the illegality of the matter by his queries as to whether AL had contacted the police.147 In relation to the second series of offences, the jury’s verdict means that the jury accepted that Hu and Huang intended to demand the money with menaces. Hu’s role was to “do the talking” and Huang’s role, which he must have accepted with knowledge of what Hu was to do, was to accompany Hu. To return, as both did, to the restaurant to confront AL demonstrated that both were intending to pursue the matter to its conclusion.Han148 Mr Han accepts that he was certainly the instigator of having AL brought to the room, shown the tape, and being presented with an IOU. He accepts that he threatened the offender but only with disclosing the theft to others if the debt was not paid. Consistently with the jury’s verdict, I do not accept that. I find that Mr Han did have intent to steal both at the times of both counts 1 and 3. The difference amounts referred to, and the language used, as well as the totality of the circumstances do not indicate that it was a legitimate debt recovery exercise. 149 Mr Han also accepts that he was the instigator in instructing Mr Hu to recover money from AL at Carlingford but does not accept that he ever instructed Mr Hu to use the term “Big Circle.” While that may be the case, he involved Mr Hu in his actions to recover or obtain money from AL having had many years association with Mr Hu. It is a matter of overwhelming inference from the evidence generally and the telephone intercepts that Han knew of Mr Hu’s prior activities and likely method of operation. He was not shown any weapons nor was there any evidence that weapons were present.150 The criminality involved however, did not involve actual violence. There was some apparent justification for the view on Mr Han’s part that he had been the subject of ongoing stealing by a staff member although not AL. 151 For these reasons, I regard the criminality involved as far as Han was concerned as being of low to mid-range. It was not a situation where Han had simply decided on an unconnected individual – for example, as part of a wider protection/extortion racket – which in my view would warrant a different finding as to criminality and an increased penalty.152 Similarly with Hu, I regard the criminality involved as being low to mid range. Again I would have had a different view had there been actual violence or weapons involved or if there had been evidence of some wider protection/extortion racket involved. 153 What made the criminality above low range was the time period and planning and premeditation involved.154 In terms of subjective factors, I regard Han’s prior convictions as being not directly on all fours with the criminality involved in this case – although given the relative recency of that offence and sentence, it does not entitle him to any leniency. He is supporting his children and particularly his 15-year-old son for whom he is effectively solely responsible. However given his other family and considerations, I do not regard those factors as establishing the exceptional circumstances which require, or entitle, a reduction in the sentence for those reasons alone in accordance with the decision in R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510; T v R (1990) 47 A Crim R 29; and R v X [2004] NSWCCA 93 at [24], nor the impact on his business.155 Hu’s prior convictions and sentence were, however, for the same kind of offence.156 Counts 4 and 5 involved minor amounts essentially brought to establish the evidentiary connection between the offenders and the amounts received by them. The real criminality in relation to both those matters is really reflected in the main counts and are appropriately recognised by recording a conviction in relation to each offender. Concurrence/totality157 The offences involved the one victim and the one continuing course of conduct as far as Mr Han was concerned. However, his actions extended over a period of some eight months and involved the repetition of his overall demands of AL, on the second occasion with different individuals, namely, Hu and Huang.158 In my view, there needs to be a separate sentence to mark the criminality of that offence but it can be served concurrently. There is some leniency to Mr Han in this approach but in my view that is appropriate.Special circumstances159 Put on behalf of each of the offenders were the following factors which would warrant a finding of special circumstances such as to reduce the ratio to which the non-parole period bears to the head sentence:Han160 His age and family background as well as the likelihood that he will be able to obtain or generate employment on his release together with the language difficulties and consequential difficulties he is likely to experience while he is in gaol161 Taking all those matters into account in my view there should be a finding of special circumstances such that the statutory ratio the non-parole period bears to the total sentence be reduced to 2/3.Hu162 His age and family background together with the language difficulties and consequential difficulties too he is likely to experience while he is in gaol.163 Taking those matters into account in my view there should be a finding of special circumstances such that the statutory ratio the non-parole period bears to the total sentence be reduced to 2/3.Huang164 His age and family background together with the language difficulties and consequential difficulties too he is likely to experience while he is in gaol, as well as the absence of any prior convictions.165 Should the matter become relevant in the future in relation to Mr Huang, in my view, taking all those matters into account in my view there should be a finding of special circumstances such that the statutory ratio the non-parole period bears to the total sentence be reduced to 50%.Sentence166 The offenders were convicted of each of the offences following the jury’s verdict.Count 1 – Han167 The offender Han is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 1 February 2009 and expiring on 31 January 2012, with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 1 February 2009 and expiring on 31 January 2011.Count 2Hu168 The offender Hu is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 18 months imprisonment commencing 24 January 2009 and expiring on 23 July 2010, with a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 24 January 2009 and expiring on 23 January 2010.Huang169 The offender Huang is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 23 March 2009 and expiring on 22 September 2010 such imprisonment to be suspended pursuant to section 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act on condition that he is of good behaviour throughout that period and complies with the terms of his bond in particular in notifying the Probation and Parole Service of his residential address and employment details.Count 3 – Han170 The offender is sentenced to a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment commencing on 1 February 2009 and expiring 31 January 2010 to be served concurrently with the sentence on count 1.Count 4 – Hu171 Conviction recorded.Count 5 – Huang172 Conviction recorded.Parole173 The conditions of parole for each offender are the same namely that:· That he be of good behaviour; and· That he notify Probation and Parole of his address (both residential and employment), his associates and any travel arrangements.

     HEADNOTE 
      
     [This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment] 
    On 16 July 2008 the respondent, Dennis Raymond Partridge, was convicted in the Local Court of New South Wales of driving whilst disqualified contrary to s 25A(1)(a) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998. His traffic record disclosed that on 17 January 2008 he had been convicted of the offence of high range prescribed concentration of alcohol, being a contravention of s 9(4) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999, and had been sentenced to a fine and had been disqualified from driving for 12 months, that disqualification having commenced on 5 December 2007. For the driving while disqualified offence, he was dealt with by the Magistrate by way of a bond for 12 months under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He was also disqualified from holding a licence for two years, the disqualification to commence on 5 December 2008. The respondent appealed to the District Court against the severity of the sentence, specifically the length of the disqualification period the Magistrate had imposed. The issue before the primary judge was whether the Magistrate erred in disqualifying the respondent for driving for two years. The primary judge stated the following case for the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912: 
     
      
       
      “Will I err in law if by virtue of the provisions of s 25A(6)(b) and s 25A(10)(b) of the  
      Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act  
      1998 I characterise the automatic disqualification period in the circumstances of this matter as being 2 years.” 
      
    Held, answering the question posed by the stated case in the affirmative (per McColl JA, Grove and Howie JJ agreeing): 1 Section 25A uses the concept of “a second or subsequent offence” for two purposes: it operates hierarchically to address firstly the penalty for the s 25A offence and, secondly, the period of disqualification flowing from a conviction for such an offence: (at [55]).

     2 The concept of “a second or subsequent offence” in s 25A(6) is used to determine the maximum penalty as set out in subs 25A(1) – (3): (at [56]). 3 Subsections 25A(7) – (10) address the consequences of a person having been convicted of an offence under subs 25A(1) – (3)(a): either automatic disqualification by virtue of the conviction for the “relevant disqualification period” (s 25A(7)(a)) or automatic disqualification for the “relevant disqualification period” and such additional period as the court may order (s 25A(7)(b)): (at [57]-[58]). 4 For the purpose of automatic disqualification, the concept of “a second or subsequent offence” is determined only by reference to whether the offender has previously committed an offence under subs 25A(1), (2) or (3)(a): (at [59]-[62]).

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCOLL JA: On 16 July 2008 Dennis Raymond Partridge, the respondent in this Court, was convicted in the Local Court of New South Wales of driving whilst disqualified contrary to s 25A(1)(a) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 (the “Driver Licensing Act”). He was dealt with by the Magistrate by way of a bond for 12 months under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the bond to date from 16 July 2008 and ordered to pay court costs of $73. He was also disqualified from holding a licence for two years, the disqualification to commence on 5 December 2008.  
     
      
    2 The respondent appealed to the District Court against the severity of the sentence, specifically the length of the disqualification period the Magistrate had imposed. 
     
      
    3 The appeal was heard by Judge Hosking SC. It was common ground before his Honour that the respondent had not hitherto been convicted of an offence pursuant to s 25A. His traffic record disclosed, however, that on 17 January 2008 he had been convicted of the offence of high range prescribed concentration of alcohol (the “first offence”), being a contravention of s 9(4) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (the “Safety and Traffic Management Act”), had been sentenced to a fine and had been disqualified from driving for 12 months, that disqualification having commenced on 5 December 2007. 
     
      
    4 The issue before the primary judge was whether the Magistrate erred in disqualifying the respondent for driving for two years. 5 The Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), the appellant in this Court, submitted before the primary judge that by virtue of ss 25A(6) and 25A(10) of the Driver Licensing Act, the relevant automatic licence disqualification period was two years. The respondent argued that it was one year. He relied on the decision of his Honour Judge Berman SC in Shane William Johnson [2008] NSWDC 47. 
     
      
    6 The primary judge formed a preliminary view that the appropriate disqualification period was two years. He noted that Judge Murrell SC had not followed Johnson and had construed s 25A(10) in the way he favoured: Wheeler [2008] NSWDC 165; (2008) 7 DCLR (NSW) 271. 
     
      
    7 Having regard to the difference of views within the District Court concerning the interpretation of s 25A(10) the primary judge stated a case for the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The question of law identified for the purposes of the stated case is: 
     
      
       
        
        “Will I err in law if by virtue of the provisions of s 25A(6)(b) and s 25A(10)(b) of the  
        Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act  
        1998 I characterise the automatic disqualification period in the circumstances of this matter as being 2 years.” 
        
       
       
      Legislative framework 
      
    8 The Driver Licensing Act was passed in 1998 as a part of a group of statutes referred to in s 5 of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (the “General Act”) as “road transport legislation”, each Act in the package dealing with a separate aspect of the control of motor vehicles on public roads: Re Application by Attorney General (No 3 of 2002) [2004] NSWCCA 303; (2004) 61 NSWLR 305 (at [19]) per Howie J (Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL, Grove and Dunford JJ agreeing). The Safety and Traffic Management Act forms part of the road transport legislation. 
     
      
    9 The objects of the Driver Licensing Act, set out in s 3, relevantly include: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “(a) to provide for the establishment of a driver licensing system, in accordance with agreements scheduled to the  
        National Road Transport Commission Act  
        1991** of the Commonwealth, as part of a uniform national approach to driver licensing, that is designed to provide:  
         
          
          (i) uniform licence classes for the drivers of motor vehicles, and  
          (ii) uniform attendant eligibility criteria for those licence classes, and  
          
         
        (b) to define the responsibilities of people in respect of driver licensing, and  
        … 
        (d) to facilitate the regulation of drivers of motor vehicles in the interests of safety and efficiency and law enforcement generally, and … 
        (h) to improve road safety and transport efficiency and reduce the costs of administering road transport.” 
        
       
      ** According to the Notes to s 3, the 1991 Act has been repealed and replaced by the  
      National Transport Commission Act 
       2003 (Cth), and the agreements scheduled to the repealed Act have been independently terminated and replaced by the  
      Inter-Governmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Road, Rail and Intermodal Transport 
      . 
       
      
    10 The provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) apply to the interpretation of the Driver Licensing Act and the regulations: s 5(1). The Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) also applies to the Driver Licensing Act and the regulations to the extent that it can do so consistently with the application of Commonwealth Act: s 5(2). 11 Section 25A of the Driver Licensing Act, as in force at the time the respondent was convicted provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        25A Offences committed by disqualified drivers or drivers whose licences are suspended or cancelled 
         
         
        (1) A person who is disqualified by or under any Act from holding or obtaining a driver licence must not: 
         
          
          (a) drive a motor vehicle on a road or road related area during the period of disqualification, or 
          (b) make an application for a driver licence during the period of disqualification and in respect of the application state his or her name falsely or incorrectly or omit to mention the disqualification. 
          Maximum penalty: 30 penalty units or imprisonment for 18 months or both (in the case of a first offence) or 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years or both (in the case of a second or subsequent offence). 
          
         
         
        (2) A person whose driver licence is suspended must not: 
         
          
          (a) drive on a road or road related area a motor vehicle of the class to which the suspended driver licence relates, or 
          (b) make an application for a driver licence during the period of suspension for a motor vehicle of the class to which the suspended driver licence relates and in respect of such an application state his or her name falsely or incorrectly or omit to mention the suspension. 
          Maximum penalty: 30 penalty units or imprisonment for 18 months or both (in the case of a first offence) or 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years or both (in the case of a second or subsequent offence). 
          
         
         
        (3) A person whose application for a driver licence is refused or whose driver licence is cancelled must not: 
         
          
          (a) drive on a road or road related area a motor vehicle of the class to which the cancelled licence or the refused application related without having subsequently obtained a driver licence for a motor vehicle of that class, or 
          (b) make an application for a driver licence for a motor vehicle of the class to which the cancelled licence or the refused application related and in respect of the application state his or her name falsely or incorrectly or omit to mention the cancellation or refusal. 
          Maximum penalty: 30 penalty units or imprisonment for 18 months or both (in the case of a first offence) or 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years or both (in the case of a second or subsequent offence). 
          
         
        (4) For the purposes of subsection (3) (b), a person who applies for a driver licence for a class of motor vehicle need not mention a previous cancellation of a driver licence (or refusal of an application for a driver licence) for that class of motor vehicle if the person has obtained a driver licence after any such cancellation or refusal by means of an application that stated his or her name correctly and mentioned the cancellation or refusal. 
        (5) Subsections (1) and (3) (a) do not apply to the driving of a motor vehicle in circumstances prescribed by the regulations. 
        (6) An offence under this section is a second or subsequent offence for the purposes of this section if:

          (b) within the period of 5 years immediately before the person is convicted of the offence, the person was convicted of: 
           
            
            (i) a major offence within the meaning of the  
            Road Transport (General) Act  
            2005, or 
            (ii) an offence under section 6 (1C) or 7A of the Traffic Act 1909 (as in force before its repeal), or 
            (iii) an offence under section 25 (2). 
            
           
          
         
        (7) If a person is convicted by a court of an offence under subsection (1), (2) or (3) (a), the person: 
         
          
          (a) is disqualified by the conviction (and without any specific order) for the relevant disqualification period from the date of expiration of the existing disqualification or suspension or from the date of such conviction, whichever is the later, from holding a driver licence, and 
          (b) may also be disqualified, for such additional period as the court may order, from holding a driver licence. 
          Note. Section 26 of the Road Transport (General) Act 1999 provides for the effect of a disqualification (whether or not by order of a court). **

        (10) In this section, the relevant disqualification period is: 
         
          
          (a) in the case of a first offence under subsection (1), (2) or (3) (a)—12 months, or 
          (b) in the case of a second or subsequent offence under subsection (1), (2) or (3) (a)—2 years.” (emphasis in original)

        (a) a person who is, in respect of the death of or bodily harm to another person caused by or arising out of the use of a motor vehicle driven by the person at the time of the occurrence out of which the death of or harm to the other person arose, convicted of:  
         
          
          (i) the crime of murder or manslaughter, or  
          (ii) an offence under section 33, 35, 53 or 54 or any other provision of the Crimes Act 1900, or  
          
         
        (b) a person who is convicted of an offence under section 51A or 52AB of the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900, or  
        (c) a person who is convicted of an offence under any of the following provisions:  
         
          
          (i) section 42 of the  
          Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act  
          1999 of driving a motor vehicle on a road furiously or recklessly or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public,  
          (ii) section 42 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 of driving a motor vehicle negligently (being driving occasioning death or grievous bodily harm),  
          (iii) section 43 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999,  
          (iv) section 9 (1A), (1), (2) (a) or (b), (3) (a) or (b), (4) (a) or (b) or section 15 (4) or 16 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999,  
          (v) section 22 (2) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999,  
          (vi) section 12 (1) (a) or (b) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999,  
          (vii) section 29 (2) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999,  
          (viii) section 70 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999,  
          (ix) section 11B, 18D (2), 18E (9), 18G (1) or 24D (1) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999, or  
          
         
        (d) a person who is convicted of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of, or being an accessory before the fact to, any such crime or offence. 
         
        
       
      
    14 It was common ground that the first offence fell within the definition of “major offence”, having been a contravention of s 9(4) of the Safety and Traffic Management Act.  
     
      
    15 The objects of the Safety and Traffic Management Act include “improv[ing] safety … of transport on roads and road related areas”: s 3.16 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) 1999 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “18 Interpretation of provisions imposing penalties 
         
         
        (1) The penalty: 
         
         
          
          … 
           
           
          (b) specified at the end of a subsection of a section of an Act, but not at the end of the section  
           
           
          … 
           
           
          indicates that a contravention of the … subsection … is an offence against the Act, punishable on conviction by a penalty not exceeding the penalty so specified . “ 
          
         
        
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    17 The competing contentions can be briefly stated without, I hope, doing disservice to the detailed and helpful submissions prepared by counsel for both the appellant and the respondent.  
     
      
    18 The appellant submits that the definition of “second or subsequent offence” in s 25A(6), assuming a circumstance which falls into either subs 25A(6)(a) or subs (6)(b), applies both to the penalty provisions in s 25A(1) (and, presumably, subs 25A(2) and (3)) and to the disqualification provisions in s 25A(10). 
     
      
    19 Accordingly the appellant argues where, as here, prior to committing the offence of driving whilst disqualified contrary to s 25A(1)(a) of the Driver Licensing Act, the respondent had been convicted of a major offence within the meaning of the General Act – being his conviction pursuant to s 9(4) of the Safety and Traffic Management Act, the relevant automatic disqualification period under s 25A(1) was two years. In support of this construction the appellant points to the fact that s 25A(6) makes an offence a “second or subsequent offence for the purposes of this section” (emphasis added), a phrase the appellant contends means for the purposes of s 25A as a whole. 
     
      
    20 The appellant also submits that the history of the legislation supports his interpretation. He draws attention to the Explanatory Note to the Traffic Amendment (Penalties and Disqualifications) Bill 1998 which amended the Traffic Act 1909, which in turn was repealed at the time the road transport legislation was introduced: s 3, Sch 1, Road Transport Legislation Amendment Act 1999. That Bill, as passed, amended, among other provisions, s 7A of the Traffic Act, a provision in substantially similar terms to s 25A. The Appendix to the Explanatory Note headed “Summary of Increased Penalties and Disqualifications” stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A period of disqualification is a period of automatic disqualification from driving that is imposed by the Act by virtue of the conviction for the offence concerned (and generally without any specific order of the court). 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A reference to a second or subsequent offence is  
        generally 
         a reference to the second or subsequent occasion on which the offence was committed in the previous 5 years or the first occasion on which it was committed if the person had committed a major offence...”. (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    21 The respondent argues that s 25A(6) applies to the expression “a second or subsequent offence” which appears in the maximum penalty provision at the end of subsections 25A(1), (2) and (3). The expression works, he contends, to increase the maximum penalty prescribed by each of those subsections where the offence is a second or subsequent offence within the meaning of s 25A(6). He accepts that his prior conviction of an offence under s 9(4) of the Safety and Traffic Management Act means he had committed a “second or subsequent offence” for the purpose of the penalty provision appearing at the end of subsection 25A(1).22 The respondent submits however that s 25A deals with the “relevant disqualification period” for the purposes of s 25A(7) separately in s 25A(10). He points to the fact that s 25A(10) refers only to offences under ss 25A(1), (2) or (3). He argues that as he had not previously been convicted of an offence under s 25A of the Driver Licensing Act, the offence he committed on 16 July 2008 was “a first offence under subsection (1)…” for the purposes of the “relevant disqualification period” in s 25A(10)(a). A fortiori, he argues, his offence was not, and could not be, “a second or subsequent offence under subsection (1)…” within the meaning of s 25A(10)(b).  
     
      
    23 The respondent argues that the appellant’s construction of s 25A(6) produces the curious result that an offender in his position would fall within both “a first offence under subs (1), (2) or (3)(a)” and also “a second or subsequent offence under subs (1), (2) or (3)(a)”, a proposition he contended was so unreasonable as to underline its fallacy. 
     
      
       
      The District Court: differing approaches to s 25A 
       
      
    24 Judge Berman SC considered s 25A in the ex tempore decision of Johnson. Johnson had been convicted of driving on the road whilst suspended: s 25A(2)(a). He had been convicted of a drink driving matter within five years before. A magistrate fined Johnson and disqualified him from driving for two years.  
     
      
    25 Johnson appealed against his sentence. He sought, in lieu of the fine, an order under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Berman SC DCJ declined that application.  
     
      
    26 Johnson also challenged the length of his disqualification. That issue turned on whether, by virtue of his conviction on the drink driving matter, he had committed a “a second or subsequent offence” for the purposes of the disqualification provisions of s 25A. The Crown relied upon s 25A(6). Of that submission his Honour said (at [8] – [9]): 
     
      
       
        
        “8. …However, even if it is a second or subsequent offence for the purposes of subsection 6, it is not all second or subsequent offences which are to be looked at in determining the relevant disqualification period under subsection 10. The section makes it, and I use the Crown’s term, as clear as crystal that it is only some second or subsequent offences which give rise to the extended relevant disqualification period. 
        
       
       
        
        9 I am satisfied that the proper interpretation of Section 25A in the circumstances of this case is that the relevant disqualification period is twelve months. …” 
        
       
      
    27 The second case, and as I have said, that which found favour with the primary judge, is Wheeler. Wheeler was also an appeal against the severity of penalties imposed by a magistrate, in this instance for offences of fail to submit to breath analysis and drive whilst suspended. The failure to submit to breath analysis offence occurred prior to the drive while licence suspended offence. The magistrate imposed a disqualification period of two years in relation to the drive while licence suspended matter, it being accepted, it appears, that by virtue of the conviction of fail to submit to breath analysis, Wheeler had committed a “major offence” for the purposes of s 188(c)(iv) of the General Act. 
     
      
    28 Wheeler argued that the automatic disqualification period was one year for reasons similar to the submissions advanced by the respondent in this case. He relied on Johnson. 
     
      
    29 Her Honour Judge Murrell SC DCJ rejected Wheeler’s submission. She disagreed with Johnson saying (at [7]) “on that interpretation of subsection (6), part (b) [sic, ‘par’] would have no work to do.” 
     
      
       
      R v Sirocic 
       
      
    30 The appellant also relied upon R v Sirocic [2000] NSWCCA 325; (2000) 32 MVR 165. 31 Sirocic had been convicted in July 1998 of driving in a manner dangerous to the public in breach of s 10A(1)(b) of the Traffic Act. This was a major offence: s 2(1), Traffic Act. In June 1999 he pleaded guilty to driving while disqualified in March 1999. The magistrate found the offence proved but dismissed the charge pursuant to s 556A of the Crimes Act 1900. The Crown appealed against the inadequacy of the sentence. 
     
      
    32 Christie DCJ upheld the appeal. He convicted and sentenced the respondent. He also disqualified Sirocic from driving a motor vehicle for 12 months from the day of the magistrate’s decision, having concluded he did not have to disqualify him from driving for the “statutory period of two years as specified by section 7A(3)(b)(a) [sic section 7A(3A)(b)] of the Traffic Act, 1909 …”.  
     
      
    33 Christie DCJ then stated a case for consideration by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The stated case raised two questions of law, both of which turned in substance on whether the disqualification periods specified in s 7A of the Traffic Act were automatic (as the Crown had contended) or discretionary (as he had held). 
     
      
    34 Priestley JA (with whom Foster AJA and Smart AJ agreed) concluded, in an ex tempore judgment, that Christie DCJ had erred. His Honour set out the relevant terms of s 7A of the Traffic Act. It is unnecessary to repeat those provisions. It is sufficient, in my view, to note that s 7A(2)(a) – (f) substantially corresponded to s 25A(1) – (3). Section 7A(2)(g) set out the penalty for a first offence against any of subsections 7A(2)(a) – (f), while s 7A(2)(h) set out the penalty for a second or subsequent offence. 
     
      
    35 Subsection 7A(2B) provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2B)  
        For the purposes of subsection (2) 
        , an offence under subsection (2) is a second or subsequent offence if: 
         
          
          (a) it is the second or subsequent occasion on which the person is convicted of the offence within the period of 5 years immediately before being convicted of the offence, or 
          (b) within that 5-year period, the person was convicted of a major offence …” (emphasis added) 
          
         
        
       
      
    36 Section 7A(3) provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) Where a person is convicted of an offence under subsection (2) (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e), the person shall be disqualified by such conviction and without any specific order for the relevant disqualification period from the date of expiration of the existing disqualification or suspension or from the date of such conviction, whichever is the later, from holding a driver licence and may also be disqualified, for such additional period as the court may order, from holding a driver licence.” 
        
       
      
    37 Section 7A(3A) was in substantially the same terms as s 25A(10), save that where the latter provision refers to “subsection (1), (2) or (3)(a)”, subs 7A(3A) referred to an offence “under subsection (2)”. Section 7A(4) was in like terms to s 25A(8). 
     
      
    38 Priestley JA prima facie concluded (at [14] - [15]) that the literal effect of s 7A(2), (2B), (3) and (3B) led to automatic disqualification of Sirocic for two years, leaving the Court with a discretion to increase the minimum period. 
     
      
    39 He then considered Sirocic’s submission that Christie DCJ’s approach had been correct. This submission turned on the application of s 10A of the Traffic Act, which was in substantially similar terms to s 188 of the General Act and permitted the court if it thought fit “to order a shorter period (but not shorter than 6 months) or longer period of disqualification” and s 10 which conferred a power on a court before which a person had been convicted of an offence against the Traffic Act or regulations, to disqualify a person from holding a driver licence “for such period as the court specifies”.  
     
      
    40 Priestley JA noted (at [17]) that s 10 was expressed to be subject, inter alia, to s 7A, leading (at [18]) to the result that s 7A was the “disqualifying regime … not affected by the more general power of disqualification conferred by section 10.” Accordingly he held that Christie DCJ had erred in not disqualifying Sirocic for 2 years. 
     
      
    41 The appellant submits that Sirocic provides “some support” for his argument. The respondent, on the other hand, contends that Sirocic should be confined to the point it determined, namely whether a general power to determine the disqualification period for an offence allowed the Court to override otherwise automatic disqualification periods: cf Coleman v Power [2004] HCA 39; (2004) 220 CLR 1 (at [79]) per McHugh J. 
     
      
      Consideration 
      
    42 Statutory provisions imposing an increased penalty by virtue of a second or subsequent offence have a long lineage. Commentary upon such provisions appears in Coke’s Institutes of Law where, as Smith J explained in Farrington v Thomson & Bridgland [1959] VR 286 (at 288), the learned author observed that such provisions should be understood to operate only in circumstances where the alleged repeat offender has previously been convicted of the relevant offence. This proposition was explained by Lord Alverstone CJ in The King v The Licensing Justices for the County Borough of South Shields [1911] 2 KB 1 as demonstrating that such enactments aim at “a persistent breach of the law after a previous conviction”. That proposition is well accepted in Australian law: see O’Hara v Harrington [1962] Tas SR 165 (at 169) per Burbury CJ; Police v Nowak [2000] SASC 82; (2000) 76 SASR 551 (at [9] – [12]) per Doyle CJ (Debelle and Bleby JJ agreeing); Reid v Rowbottam [2005] NTSC 7; (2005) 190 FLR 17 (at [17] – [41]) per Martin (BR) CJ, Riley and Southwood JJ agreeing). 
     
      
    43 Another line of authority considers whether the term “subsequent offence” can include a conviction for an earlier offence committed under a subsequently repealed or amended statute. The underlying principle which has been applied in such cases is that where the offence remains substantively the same, offences committed under a previous legislative scheme will constitute subsequent offences under the new legislation: Pointon v Police [2004] SASC 4; (2004) 143 A Crim R 416 (at [24] – [29]); Police (SA) v Whitehouse [2005] SASC 220; (2005) 92 SASR 81 (at [45] ff) per Layton J (Duggan and Besanko JJ agreeing). 
     
      
    44 Conversely, Bray CJ held in Bartlett v D’Rozario [1971] SASR 88 that a second offence could not be a “subsequent offence” within the meaning of s 47(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 (SA) as the offences with which the case was concerned were different in nature. 
     
      
    45 Section 25A reflects these fundamental principles, albeit not entirely consistently.  
     
      
    46 First, s 25A(6) provides that an offence is only a “second or subsequent offence” if the person has previously been “convicted”. 
     
      
    47 Secondly, s 25A(6)(b)(ii) expressly provides that “an offence under ss 6(1C) or 7A of the Traffic Act (as in force before its repeal)” constitutes a “second or subsequent offence”, thus avoiding any argument as to whether, for example, an offence under subsections 25A(1) – (3) is substantively the same as was an offence under s 7A. 
     
      
    48 Thirdly, s 25A(6)(b)(i), (ii) (insofar as it refers to s 6(1C) of the Traffic Act) and (iii) extends the reach of s 25A to offences which are different in nature to those in s 25A(1) – (3). 
     
      
    49 The inconsistency to which I referred (at [45]) is that s 25A(10) refers to “offence” rather than conviction. It is consistent, however, with the authorities to which I have referred (at [42]) that s 25A(10)(b) would only be attracted in the case of an earlier conviction, not merely the commission of an offence. 
     
      
    50 In examining the terms of s 25A, it is useful to bear in mind the following statement in the joint judgment of McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355: 
     
      
       
        
        “70. A legislative instrument must be construed on the prima facie basis that its provisions are intended to give effect to harmonious goals.  
        Where conflict appears to arise from the language of particular provisions, the conflict must be alleviated, so far as possible, by adjusting the meaning of the competing provisions to achieve that result which will best give effect to the purpose and language of those provisions while maintaining the unity of all the statutory provisions 
        . Reconciling conflicting provisions will often require the court ‘to determine which is the leading provision and which the subordinate provision, and which must give way to the other’. Only by determining the hierarchy of the provisions will it be possible in many cases to give each provision the meaning which best gives effect to its purpose and language while maintaining the unity of the statutory scheme.  
         
         
        71. Furthermore, a court construing a statutory provision must strive to give meaning to every word of the provision. In  
        The Commonwealth v Baume 
         Griffith CJ cited  
        R v Berchet 
         to support the proposition that it was ‘a known rule in the interpretation of Statutes that such a sense is to be made upon the whole as that no clause, sentence, or word shall prove superfluous, void, or insignificant, if by any other construction they may all be made useful and pertinent’”.(emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    51 Section 25A uses the concept of “a second or subsequent offence” at three points. It is first used in the maximum penalty provision subscribed to each of subsections (1) – (3). Subscribing the maximum penalty to the end of each subsection indicates that a contravention of the subsection is an offence against the Driver Licensing Act, punishable on conviction by a penalty not exceeding the penalty so specified: s 18, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    52 The concept next appears in s 25A(6) to determine whether “[a]n offence under this section” is “a second or subsequent offence for the purposes of this section”.  
     
      
    53 Finally, the concept of “a second or subsequent offence” appears in s 25A(10)(b) as one determinant of the “relevant disqualification period”, a phrase which first appears in the section in s 25A(7). 
     
      
    54 It must be acknowledged that s 25A contains some confusing, and potentially conflicting, signposts. Both subs 25A(6) and 25A(10) are expressed to apply to s 25A generally, in the sense that subs 25A (6) defines a “second or subsequent offence for the purposes of this section...”, while subs 25A(10) provides that “[i]n this section …”. (emphasis added)55 It is necessary, accordingly, to determine whether this conflict can be resolved. In my view it can. When s 25A is analysed, it can be seen that it operates in the hierarchical sense to which the joint judgment in Project Blue Sky referred, first to deal with the penalty for the s 25A offence and, secondly, to deal with the period of disqualification flowing from a conviction for such an offence. 
     
      
    56 The maximum penalty provision to each of subs 25A(1) – (3) provides one penalty for a first offence and a greater penalty for a second or subsequent offence. Subsection 25A(6) defines a “second or subsequent offence” first, by reference to whether it is the second or subsequent occasion on which the person is convicted of “any offence under subsection (1), (2) or (3)(a)” within the relevant antecedent period and secondly if, again within the relevant antecedent period, the person had been convicted of one of the offences referred to in s 25A(6)(b)(i)–(iii). 
     
      
    57 Subsections 25A(7) – (10) depend upon the person having been convicted of an offence under any of subs (1), (2) or (3)(a). Conviction assumes that a penalty has been imposed, and that the sentencing court has adverted to whether the conviction was for a first or second or subsequent offence so as to determine the appropriate penalty. The logic of the structure of s 25A is that the sentencing court looks to s 25A(6) to answer that question. Once it has used s 25A(6) for that purpose, the remaining provisions in s 25A address the consequences of the conviction in terms which indicate that the function of s 25A(6) has, subject to one matter to which I will come, been exhausted. 
     
      
    58 Subsection 25A(7) provides for the consequences of a person having been convicted of an offence under subs 25A(1) – (3)(a): either automatic disqualification by virtue of the conviction for the “relevant disqualification period” (s 25A(7)(a)) or automatic disqualification for the “relevant disqualification period” and such additional period as the court may order (s 25A(7)(b)). The disqualification referred to in subs 25A(7) is in addition to any penalty imposed for the offence (s 25A(8)), thus underlining the distinction between the matters with which subs 25A (7) – (10) deals and the preceding provisions. 
     
      
    59 The reference in subs 25A(7)(a) to the “relevant disqualification period” takes the reader to s 25A(10). That also defines a first and second or subsequent offence, but only by reference to an offence under subs 25A(1), (2) or (3)(a). Significantly, there is no reference in s 25A(10) to the extended concept of second or subsequent offence which appears in subs 25A(6)(b). That is a clear indication that the legislature intended to distinguish between the factors taken into consideration for the purposes of determining the penalty for an offence under subs 25A(1), (2) or (3)(a) and the automatic disqualification which flows from a conviction for such an offence. 
     
      
    60 That distinction, in my view, reflects the fact that persons who have committed an offence which falls within s 25A(6)(b) will already have suffered an automatic disqualification by virtue of, in order, s 188 of the General Act, s 6(1D) and s 7A(3) of the Traffic Act and s 25(3) of the Driver Licensing Act. When it is borne in mind that disqualification itself is a form of penalty (Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] HCA 42; (2004) 220 CLR 129) a legislative concern to impose automatic disqualification in a carefully discriminatory manner can be discerned. Adopting such a discriminatory approach reflects the devastating effect licence disqualification can have upon a person’s ability to derive income and to function appropriately within the community: see Re Application by Attorney-General (at [116]) per Howie J. 
     
      
    61 As I have explained a s 25A(6)(b) conviction can be taken into account in determining the maximum penalty for a s 25A offence. Section 25A(10) is confined to offences under s 25A(1) – (3)(a), however, to ensure a s 25A(6)(b) offender does not face two automatic licence disqualifications. 
     
      
    62 A second or subsequent offence under s 25A(1) – (3)(a) attracts a longer automatic disqualification because the offender has already been subject to an automatic disqualification of 12 months pursuant to s 25A(10)(a). 
     
      
    63 However s 25A does leave it to the discretion of the sentencing court pursuant to s 25A(7)(b) to decide whether to impose a longer period of disqualification than the automatic disqualification imposed pursuant to s 25A(7)(a). It would be open to the Court to take into account at that stage the fact that a person had previously been convicted of a s 25A(6)(b) offence and, too, the period of disqualification the person suffered by virtue of that conviction. 
     
      
    64 This construction gives meaning to every word of s 25A: Project Blue Sky (at [71]). On the appellant’s approach, conversely, there is a tension between s 25A(6) and the phrase “under subsection (1), (2) or (3)(a)” which appear in s 25A(10)(a) and (b). If “second or subsequent offence” is completely defined in s 25A(6), what is the purpose of including that phrase in s 25A(10)? The answer can only be, in my view that that phrase works in s 25A(10) for the purposes of disqualification, while the earlier definition works for the purposes of penalty.  
     
      
    65 Once it is accepted that s 25A operates hierarchically to address both the issue of penalty and the issue of disqualification, it can be seen that the potentially conflicting signposts to which I earlier referred can be given a harmonious meaning. Each provides the definition of a “second or subsequent offence” applicable to the issue it addresses. 
     
      
    66 So analysed the meaning of s 25A is clear. Its interpretation is not assisted by use of the Explanatory Note upon which the appellant relied: see s 15AB, Acts Interpretation Act (Cth). It might be noted, too, that the Explanatory Note purported only to convey a general understanding of what a reference to a “second or subsequent offence” might be, and then in relation to the Traffic Act. The appellant submitted that s 7A of that Act was of the same tenor as s 25A. I accept that that is so, however I would not construe s 7A in accordance with the statement in the Explanatory Note. In my view s 7A contained the same hierarchical structure as s 25A. In other words an offence was only a “second or subsequent offence” for the purposes of the disqualification period if the offender had previously been convicted of an offence under s 7A(2). To the extent Sirocic appears to have held otherwise, it was, with respect, wrongly decided.  
     
      
    67 In my view the question posed in the stated case should be answered yes. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    68 In my view the primary judge will err in law if by virtue of the provisions of s 25A(6)(b) and s 25A(10)(b) of the Driver Licensing Act he characterises the automatic disqualification period in the circumstances of this matter as being two years. 
     
      
    69 Accordingly I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) The answer to the question posed by the stated case is yes. 
       
        
       
      (2) Appellant to pay the respondent’s costs of the stated case.

     JUDGMENT 
      
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with Blanch J.2 BLANCH J: The appellant stood trial in the District Court in Sydney from 4 September, 2007 to 6 September, 2007 on an indictment containing the following count: 
     
      
      Count 1: Threaten to cause injury or detriment to person with intent to influence witness to give false evidence or withhold true evidence or not to attend as a witness on 27 February, 2007.  
      
    This is an offence contrary to s322(a) Crimes Act, 1900 and it has a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.3 There was an alternative count under s323(a). However, he was convicted on the first count and sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years from 2 February, 2009 and a balance of term of 1 year to expire on 1 February, 2013.4 The evidence related to events alleged to have occurred during the trial of the accused at Campbelltown District Court on a charge of armed robbery. It was asserted by the Crown that while a witness, Savuth Nuth, was giving evidence as a prosecution witness, the appellant behaved in a manner calculated to threaten the witness so as to intimidate him into withholding evidence.5 The prosecution case consisted of evidence from three witnesses. Detective Senior Constable Pawsey gave evidence that there had been an earlier trial of the appellant in 2006 on the robbery charge. As the Officer in Charge of the case he became aware of the fact that the witness Nuth, who had given a statement to the police implicating the appellant in the robbery, had changed his mind and said that the statement he had made to the police was not true. That evidence given in cross-examination of Detective Pawsey clearly indicated that Nuth was a reluctant witness. This police officer also gave evidence of getting CCTV footage of the witness Nuth giving evidence on 27 February, 2007 when the appellant was being tried again for the robbery. He said that he obtained one reliable still image from the CCTV footage and that photograph was tendered, together with an edited version of the CCTV footage.6 Lisa Johnson, the associate to Judge Keleman, who presided over the trial, gave evidence. She said she was situated in the courtroom two steps above court level. The appellant was on her right one step above floor level and she had a view of the appellant seated five metres away from her at a 45 degree angle. She said that on 27 February, 2007, the second day of the trial, Nuth was called as a witness and after being questioned by the prosecutor, an application was made in the absence of the jury. She said when Nuth first went into the witness box the appellant glared at him or gave him “a dirty look”. The application by the Crown was to cross-examine its own witness. Ms Johnson said Nuth was not present during that application and she went out to bring him into the court room and he went into the witness box. She saw the appellant sitting with his legs crossed and staring at Nuth. The appellant was holding two fingers across his left cheek with his right thumb on the right side of his face tapping his fingers on his face. As the jury was about to re-enter the room, he stood with his left hand across his right wrist. He had his thumb pointing straight up and the two adjacent fingers pointed straight down tapping on his leg a couple of times and looking at Nuth. Ms Johnson said the CCTV footage was not as clear as the view she had because facial expressions could not be seen, it was in black and white and she was closer to the appellant. Her interpretation of the actions of the appellant was “I thought they were quite threatening”. She identified the position on the CCTV footage where these actions occurred.7 Savuth Nuth also gave evidence. He said he looked at the appellant sometimes and he was asked: 
     
      
      “Q. And did you see him do anything in particular that attracted your notice while you were giving evidence? 
      
    A. The only thing that’s – when he had his, like – had his arm up like his hand up against his chin and his neck and that. 
     
      
      Q. And what if anything did he do with his hand while it was against his chin? 
       
      A. Well I thought he was giving me like a threat- 
      
     
     
      
      HIS HONOUR  
       
      Q. Giving you what? 
       
      A. Like a threat, like this. 
      
     
     
      
      CROWN PROSECUTOR 
       
      Q. And what was it about what he did that made you think it was a threat? 
       
      A. ‘Cause it’s like he’s giving me the gesture where he’s going to want to cut my head off or something.” 
      
    8 He said it made him nervous and that it did make a difference to his evidence and he explained that by saying: 
     
      
      “Well I just didn’t want to answer any questions, nothing.” 
      
    9 This witness agreed that he had first made a statement to the police in 2005 implicating the appellant in the armed robbery. He agreed that when he was called at an earlier trial he said he had made up some of that statement including about the appellant. He agreed that in the February, 2007 trial he said he couldn’t remember what he knew about the matter and he subsequently agreed when cross-examined by the Crown that he had made an earlier statement. 10 It appears that as a result the trial of the armed robbery at Campbelltown aborted.Grounds of AppealGround 1: Counsel for the accused did not adduce evidence from the police witness or the witness Mr Nuth of the circumstances of how Mr Nuth became aware of this matter and the making of his statement to police, in circumstances where Mr Nuth agreed he never raised any alarm about feeling intimidated at the time with police. The failure to adduce this crucial evidence to Count 1 on the indictment has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.11 In cross-examination Nuth agreed that he did not tell anyone about what he interpreted as a threat while he was giving evidence. He agreed he did not approach the police or anyone else. It is submitted counsel for the appellant should have pursued that line of inquiry to find out how Nuth was recruited as a prosecution witness. The suggestion is that he or the police officer should have been questioned to determine if the police officer had somehow induced him to become a witness or put in his mind the suggestion he had been threatened and thereby render his evidence less reliable.12 Counsel for the appellant in fact addressed the jury on the basis that the police had placed the suggestion in his mind that somehow he had been threatened. The Crown Prosecutor did subsequently ask the judge to direct the jury about this point and the judge told the jury about it: 
     
      
      “You may recall that Ms Hickleton in the course of her address put to you that it is fair to assume that the idea was placed in his mind by the police. Well I am simply telling you what the evidence is. The plain fact is that there is no evidence that that was done at all. There is no evidence at all as to what the surrounding circumstances were.” 
      
    13 The witness Nuth’s credibility was clearly a matter which had been brought to the attention of the jury by virtue of his contradictory statements on oath about his recollection of the involvement of the appellant in the armed robbery offence. The jury had also been alerted in the cross-examination of Detective Senior Constable Pawsey that Nuth was arrested for unrelated matters on the day of the alleged robbery on 3 January, 2005 and that he had been arrested again in March or April, 2005. There was no evidence at all before the trial court to indicate the police had planted some idea in his mind about the behaviour of the appellant at his trial at Campbelltown and there is no evidence before this Court to suggest any impropriety on the part of the police. It was clear to the jury that Nuth had not volunteered any information about the threatening behaviour and he had become a witness because he was approached by the police.14 In my view a failure to cross-examine further about this issue could not lead to a miscarriage of justice in this case. It is the fact that the principal evidence relied upon by the Crown was the evidence of the judge’s associate supported to some extent by the photograph and CCTV footage. The evidence of Nuth does add some support to the prosecution case but the jury was well acquainted with the circumstances which required his evidence to be treated with caution.Ground 2: The evidence derived from the CCTV footage, which was tendered during the trial, was misleading and was presented in an unfairly prejudicial way. The evidence should not have been admitted.15 This ground argues that the single photograph of the appellant should not have been admitted into evidence and nor should the “aide memoire” to the CCTV footage be admitted into evidence. As to the single photograph, the argument is that the Crown should not have tendered one single photograph where the evidence was that the police attempted to take a number of still photographs off the CCTV footage. Detective Senior Constable Pawsey explained this by saying that he had attempted to take more still photographs from the CCTV footage but he couldn’t “because the quality of the images, if you try and blow them up it just pixelates…” Contrary to the submissions of the appellant, there is no evidence that there were other photographs taken by the police which could have been tendered and the evidence of the police officer explains precisely why that occurred. It should be noted there was no objection to the tender of the still photograph and there was no special attention drawn to it during the course of the trial. 16 The essential inquiry relating to both the CCTV footage and the still photograph was whether it provided any support for the account given by the judge’s associate. That evidence clearly did support the associate’s testimony and to that extent it was prejudicial in the same way that any evidence against an accused is but it was not impermissibly prejudicial.17 The other matter relied on in this ground by the appellant is the fact that the police officer prepared a brief summary of the points in the CCTV footage where various events occurred. The reason for this was that the original CCTV footage showed the appellant being taken down into the cells and it was edited to remove that part of the footage. Unfortunately, in doing that, the counters on the original footage were also removed. What was then done was to provide an index or summary relating to the evidence.18 The complaint is made that this “aide memoire” is an interpretation of the evidence by the police officer. However, it simply contains entries which state: “15.12.25 to 15.12.27 NUTH returns to court”. Then there are other entries which point out times of things such as “GORDON right hand goes to cheek/face” and “GORDON hand on chin”. All of these entries do not interpret what is depicted in the footage. It simply gives a basic description of it and it was easy for the jury to view the CCTV footage and form their own view of what was occurring. In my view, the admission of this material could not in any way have influenced the jury.19 The material was tendered with the “aide memoire” containing other entries which were objected to. The material was edited and the “aide memoire” which was tendered for the assistance of the jury was done without any objection from defence counsel.20 An argument is advanced that the admission of this document infringed s76 of the Evidence Act, 1995 which states in s76(1): 
     
      
      “Evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed.” 
      
    21 There is an exception to the rule where what is sought to be tendered is a summary of voluminous or complex documents – see s50(3). Moreover s77 provides that: 
     
      
      “The opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed.” 
      
    22 In this case it was admitted purely to assist the jury to find the relevant parts of the CCTV footage. That was a sensible thing to do to assist the jury as appears to have been acknowledged by counsel at the trial. In my view, having considered the material, there was no possibility of prejudice to the appellant arising from this document.23 I would refuse leave under Rule 4 for the ground to be relied upon on any of the bases put.Ground 3: The conviction is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.24 Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1912 states that the Court of Criminal Appeal must allow an appeal against conviction if the Court is: 
     
      
      “…of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the grounds that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the Court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice”. 
      
    The High Court considered the history of this section of the Act in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487. The majority of the Court in a joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane J, Dawson J and Toohey J considered the terms which have been used over the years in setting aside a verdict as unreasonable. These terms include “unjust or unsafe”, “unsafe or unsatisfactory”, or “dangerous or unsafe”, see at page 492. They went on to quote the view of Isaacs J in Hargan v The Queen (1919) 27 CLR 13 at page 23: 
     
      
      “If (the appellant) can show a miscarriage of justice, that is sufficient. That is the greatest innovation made by the Act, and to lose sight of that is to miss the point of the legislative advance.” 
      
    25 They also quoted the statement of Barwick CJ in Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR at page 516 that: 
     
      
      “It is the reasonable doubt in the mind of the court which is the operative factor”. 
      
    26 It was suggested in the majority judgment that some cases had indicated that such broad tests place insufficient emphasis upon the fact that the jury had seen and heard the evidence. In Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657 at page 687 Dawson J said: 
     
      
      “In particular, a court of appeal does not usually have the opportunity to assess the worth of a witness’s evidence by seeing and hearing that evidence given … These considerations point to important differences between the functions of the jury and those of a court of appeal. A jury is able, and is required, to evaluate the evidence in a manner in which a court of appeal cannot.” 
      
    27 In M v The Queen Brennan J at page 504 to 505 expressed the view that the test was “…to determine whether a jury, acting reasonably and appreciating the burden and standard of proof, could have convicted on the evidence available to support the conviction.” Applying that test to the facts of that case he concluded the conviction should not be overturned whereas the majority concluded the conviction should be overturned. McHugh J at page 525 came to the conclusion that the appropriate test was “If, after considering the evidence, the court concludes that a reasonable jury must have acquitted, the verdict is unreasonable even though there may be sufficient evidence, in law, to support the verdict.” Applying that test he also concluded the conviction should stand.28 In the majority judgment at page 494 it was said: 
     
      
      “But it is, we think, possible to make too much both of the view expressed by Barwick C.J. and of the qualification suggested. In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the Court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above.” 
      
    29 In the context of an appeal relating to the application of the proviso to the various Criminal Appeal Acts in Australia in Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300 in a unanimous judgment of six judges, the High Court said at paragraph 39 on page 315: 
     
      
      “Three fundamental propositions must not be obscured. First, the appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. Secondly, the task of the appellate court is an objective task not materially different from other appellate tasks. It is to be performed with whatever are the advantages and disadvantages of deciding an appeal on the record of the trial; it is not an exercise in speculation or prediction. Thirdly, the standard of proof of criminal guilt is beyond reasonable doubt.” 
      
    And at paragraph 41 on page 316 it was said: 
     
      
      “That task is to be undertaken the same way an appellate court decides whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the “natural limitations” that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty.” 
      
    30 It is necessary for this Court to make its own assessment of the evidence in order to determine if it was reasonably open for the jury to convict. In my view the evidence of the associate was compelling, particularly when it was supported by the CCTV footage which I have viewed. 31 The associate made it clear that she had a better view than that shown by the CCTV camera. Even so the footage shows what the associate described and at the time she said it happened. The actions of the appellant in tapping his cheek are consistent with him drawing the attention of the witness to what he was doing.32 I would come to that conclusion even without the evidence of Nuth but even though his credibility was significantly undermined, it provides some further support to the prosecution case. 33 The appellant admitted giving Nuth a “dirty look” and couldn’t remember if that was more than once. He said he didn’t like Nuth because of the untrue statement he made to the police implicating him in the robbery. The events about which the associate gave evidence occurred immediately after Nuth was brought back into the Court. He had been asked to leave the Court while the Crown made an application to cross-examine him on his earlier statement implicating the appellant. The appellant was therefore alerted to the fact that when Nuth came back he would be asked about that statement. He thus had a clear motive to intimidate the witness at that stage of the trial.34 On my own assessment of the evidence, I do not believe it can be said the verdict was unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence.Ground 4: The sentence was manifestly excessive.35 The sentence imposed in respect of this matter was one of a non-parole period of 3 years from 2 February, 2009 with a balance of term of 1 year which expires on 1 February, 2013. At the same time the appellant was sentenced to a number of other sentences:1. For two breaches of recognizances he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 months with a balance of term of 2 months from 15 February, 2008. 2. In respect of an armed robbery offence, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years, 11 months and 18 days from 15 May, 2008. That non-parole period will expire on 2 May, 2011. The head sentence involved in the sentence was one of 3 years.3. The sentence for this offence was then imposed, being a non-parole period of 3 years from 2 February, 2009 which expires on 1 February, 2012 and a balance of term of 1 year which will expire on 1 February, 2013. 
     
      
      4. In respect of an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months from 30 January, 2011. That will expire on 29 July, 2012 and there was imposed a balance of term of 6 months which will expire in its entirety on 29 January, 2013. 
      
    36 It can be seen that the non-parole period fixed for this offence commences well before the non-parole period for the robbery offence expires. It is true that the non-parole period fixed exceeds the period in custody in respect of the non-parole period fixed for the armed robbery offence. However, the non-parole period fixed for the break, enter and steal offence also commences before the non-parole period for the robbery offence expires and it expires on 29 July, 2012 which is after the non-parole period for this offence expires. In other words, the sentence imposed on this offence does not require the appellant to spend any extra time in custody at all and the only effect of it is that his head sentence will expire on 1 February, 2013 as opposed to the head sentence for the break, enter and steal which will expire on 29 January, 2013. There are thus two days added to his head sentence.37 Crimes committed against the administration of justice have always warranted deterrent sentences. In this appellant’s case he has a prior criminal history and it is clear he was attempting to intimidate an obviously reluctant witness so that he might escape the consequences of the armed robbery offence. In all of the circumstances, I do not believe the sentence could be described as excessive.38 Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed; 
       
      2. Appeal against sentence dismissed. 
      
    39 PRICE J: I agree with Blanch J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The respondent was convicted in the Local Court of an offence against s 91H(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. That section provides that it is an offence for a person to have “child pornography in his or her possession.” Section 91H(1) provides a definition of “child pornography” in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Child pornography means material that depicts or describes, in a manner that would in all the circumstances cause offence to reasonable persons, a person under (or apparently under) the age of 16 years: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) engaged in sexual activity, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) in a sexual context, or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) as the victim of torture, cruelty or physical abuse (whether or not in a sexual context).” 
        
       
      
    2 The respondent successfully appealed his conviction to the District Court following which the Director of Public Prosecutions required a case to be stated for determination by this Court pursuant to s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The question provided in the stated case is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Did I err in law in concluding that the manner and circumstances in which the images in question were recorded, including the secretive nature of the filming and the concentration of the camera, in part, on the genitalia of the young persons filmed, was not relevant to whether the images depict a person, under the age of 16 ‘in a sexual context’, pursuant to the definition of child pornography contained in s 91H(1) of the  
        Crimes Act (NSW) 
         1900.” 
        
       
      
    3 The essential issue raised by the stated case is whether, when the “material” in issue is a video film, the motivation of the person making the film and the circumstances in which it was made, other than the circumstances revealed by the film itself are relevant to the question of whether or not the images contained in the “material” are “child pornography” as defined. 
     
      
    4 The respondent was found to have in his possession video images, which he was alleged to have taken using a concealed camera, of boys, apparently and obviously, in some cases, under the age of 16, dressing and undressing in the change room of a local swimming pool. The primary judge said that the images showed “boys with no clothes on, others with some clothes on. There can be little doubt that some of the earlier images on the earlier footage on the exhibit concentrate on genitalia.” His Honour expressed the view that there was “little doubt that the images were obtained secretively.” 
     
      
    5 His Honour was urged by the prosecution to have particular regard to, four matters when determining whether or not the material constituted child pornography. Those matters were: 
     
      
       
        the way the photos were taken – they were not taken openly. 
       
       
        the concentration, in some of the images, on the genitalia on the young persons filmed. 
       
       
        all of the images are of young boys. 
       
       
        the camera was disguised and the filming activity was planned and took place over a period of approximately 4 hours. 
       
      
    6 The prosecution submitted to his Honour that it was appropriate to have regard to the reason for taking the images, which was suggested to be the respondent’s own sexual gratification, as relevant to whether or not the material came within the definition. 
     
      
    7 The primary judge concluded that for the prosecution to succeed it must prove two matters, described as “essential ingredients of the offence”. Firstly, it must prove that the material depicts a person under or apparently under the age of 16 in a “sexual context” and secondly that the manner of that depiction would in all the circumstances cause offence. His Honour concluded that the matters which the prosecution submitted to be relevant gong to the “rights and wrongs of the alleged behaviour” could not be considered. In reaching this conclusion his Honour excluded from his consideration the four matters to which I have earlier referred. His ultimate finding was that the images depicted boys under the age of 16 but “not in what could be regarded as a sexual context.”  
     
      
    8 His Honour does not explain the reasons for his finding and, in particular, does not identify the matters of significance for his conclusion. His Honour remarked further: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is essential to the Crown case to establish that the images depict persons apparently under the age of 16 in a sexual context. That applies whether they have got clothes on or not. In my view, that is not the case here and the Crown cannot prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that first essential ingredient of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    9 Further explanation of his Honour’s reasoning process is available from the stated case. After again relating the facts his Honour recorded the matters relevant to his determination. He repeated his stated approach to s 91H(3) and the two essential ingredients which the Crown had to prove. His Honour said that he “found that the images do depict persons apparently under the age of 16 but not in what could be regarded as in a sexual context.” His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In making that finding I further determine that the test to be applied in considering whether the material depicts a person, under the age of 16, in a sexual context, is an objective test. In applying that objective test a judicial officer does not take into account the manner and circumstances in which the images were taken, including the following factors raised by the prosecution in the matter in question: 
        
       
       
        
        (i) the fact that the images were taken over a period of time in the men’s change room; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the fact the images, in part, concentrated on the genitalia of young persons filmed,  
        
       
       
        
        (iii) that all the images were of young boys; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) the disguising of the camera and the fact that the incident was obviously planned; 
        
       
       
        
        (v) the reasons for taking the images, such as for sexual gratification. 
        
       
       
        
        In my view, one simply looks at the images, in applying the objective test, in determining whether or not the images depict a person, under the age of 16, ‘in a sexual context.’ “ 
        
       
      
    10 In my opinion his Honour was correct to determine that the question which the definition in s 91H raises is objective and is to be answered by considering the content of the material about which complaint has been made. The fact that the images were secretly recorded is not relevant to whether or not the material is child pornography. Furthermore, the reasons which motivated the photographer are not relevant. These matters may inform an understanding of the context in which the film was made but are not relevant to an understanding of whether or not the video depicts boys in a “sexual context.” That question must be answered after considering the content of the film itself. 
     
      
    11 For that reason the content of the images contained in the video is relevant to the issue raised by the statute. The fact that all the images were of young boys and the camera has concentrated on their genitalia are both relevant to the question of whether or not the images depicted are of a person or persons in a “sexual context.” Of course it may be that after consideration of the content of a video, including a video containing a sequence of images of the genitalia of young boys, it could not be concluded that the video depicts boys in a sexual context. The images may have been made for a medical or artistic purpose and are depicted in that context. However, a conclusion that the images depict persons under 16 in “sexual context” may be informed by the number of images, the gestures of those photographed and the portion or portions of the body, including the genitalia, depicted. 
     
      
    12 It follows that the primary judge’s approach was only partly correct. Although the motivation of the photographer and the method he used to film the boys was not relevant all of the content of the images, including that all the images were of young boys, concentrated on their genitalia and were taken over a period of time, and, if this is apparent from the video, were taken in a men’s change room were relevant to the question of whether or not the material depicted a person “in a sexual context”. Whether, when these matters are considered, an offence is proved in the present case is not a matter for this Court. 
     
      
    13 The answer to the question asked in the stated cases is yes, in part. The proceedings should be remitted to the District Court to be dealt with in accordance with these reasons.

   DECISION: 
   1 Grant leave to appeal.2 Allow the appeal.3 Confirm the sentences imposed in respect of counts 2 and 3.4 In respect of count 1, allow the appeal and quash the sentence imposed in the District Court.5 In respect of count 1, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, sentence the applicant to a non-parole of 2 years 9 months with an overall term of 4 years to commence on 22 July 2008. The total term will expire on 21 July 2012 and the non-parole will expire on 21 April 2011 on which date the applicant will be eligible for release on parole. The total effective sentence is thus one of 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months.

     Judgment 
      
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with Buddin J and wish only to make brief comments about two matters. 
     
      
    2 The learned sentencing judge detailed the considerable activity in which the applicant must have engaged when he formed his conclusion that the applicant’s offence was “part of planned or organized criminal activity” and thus constituted a factor of aggravation in accordance with s 21A (2) (n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. For the reasons given by Buddin J that conclusion was wrong, however the legislatively created dilemma which faced the judge might be mentioned.  
     
      
    3 It is a well established common law sentencing principle that the absence of a factor which would elevate the seriousness of offending in a particular case is not a matter of mitigation. In plain language, it does not make what has been done by an offender less serious because it could have been worse. 
     
      
    4 As Buddin J has observed, the legislation in s 21A (3) (b) has prescribed that it is a mitigating factor to be taken into account that the offence was “not part of a planned or organized criminal activity”. It is difficult to detect a rationale for the counterpoise between s 21A (2) (n) and s 21A (3) (b), and the circumstances detailed by the sentencing judge in this case make it obvious why it might be considered that the applicant should not be the beneficiary of mitigation by reason of the latter prescription. Certainly a judge is not bound to increase or reduce sentence simply because specified aggravating or mitigating factors “are relevant and known to the court” (s 21A (5)) but the existence of the positive and the negative in the identified provisions are, in my respectful opinion, a recipe for unnecessary complication in the determination of their application as well as being a source of possible confusion. 
     
      
    5 Second, Buddin J has noted the increase in the available maximum penalty for offences such as the present. Neither the cases to which he has referred nor the outcome of this appeal can contribute to any useful perception of an established sentencing pattern, as future sentences for offences such as the present must be guided in their assessment by the legislative intention which is inherent in the increase. 
     
      
     
     
     
      
      BUDDIN J:  
       
      Introduction 
      
    6 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court. The applicant originally pleaded guilty in the Local Court and adhered to those pleas when he stood for sentence. 
     
      
    7 The offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty were three counts of possessing child pornography contrary to s 91H(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for that offence at the relevant time was 5 years’ imprisonment. Four other charges were taken into account on a Form 1. They entailed two further charges of possessing child pornography, one charge of possessing a prohibited drug and one charge of having custody of an offensive weapon, being a wooden baton. 
     
      
    8 In respect of each of the second and third counts, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years with the total term being 3 years 9 months imprisonment. Both terms were ordered to commence on 22 July 2007 which was the day the applicant went into custody. 
     
      
    9 In respect of the first count, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months with the total term being 5 years imprisonment. That sentence was ordered to commence on 22 July 2008. The total effective sentence is thus an overall term of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months. 
     
      
       
      The factual background 
       
      
    10 An Agreed Statement of Facts was before the sentencing judge. What follows is a summary of that material. The applicant was arrested on 22 July 2007 and a search was conducted of his motor vehicle.  
     
      
    11 In the vehicle police found an external hard drive which contained 19,030 images of explicit child pornography. There were 18,718 image files, 259 movie files and 53 archive files. The possession of these images gave rise to count 1. The images were of children ranging in age from less than 12 months to early teens. The images ranged in classification on the COPINE scale from 1 to 10 (level 10 is the most serious category, involving pain or sex with animals). The photographs included photographs of young children (including babies) performing sexual acts, of them being tied up, of them being penetrated by objects, and of them performing sexual acts with animals. The video files contained movies of male and female children of various ages performing sexual acts with adults and other children. During the search of the vehicle 0.2 grams of cannabis leaf and a wooden baton were also located. Those discoveries gave rise to the first two charges on the Form 1. 
     
      
    12 The following day police executed a search warrant upon the applicant’s premises. Amongst other things they located an external hard drive, a lap top computer, and a number of DVDs and CDs. The external hard drive contained 15,400 image files, 416 movie files and 24 archive photographs all containing images of child pornography. The possession of this material gave rise to count 2. The images again ranged from level one to level ten on the COPINE scale. There were images of children performing oral sex on children and adults, of children tied up with bondage equipment, of babies with penises inserted into their mouths and anuses, of children performing sexual acts with a dog, and of children performing sexual acts. The video files contained movies of children of various ages performing sexual acts with adults and other children. 
     
      
    13 The laptop contained 1690 images and 12 video files (although the video files had been deleted). These images gave rise to count 3. The images were rated from level 1 to level 9 on the COPINE scale. There were images of children performing oral sex on children and adults, of children tied up with bondage equipment, and of babies with penises inserted into their mouths and anuses. 
     
      
    14 As I have said, a number of DVDs and CDs were located in the applicant’s premises. The possession of four of the DVDs gave rise to the third charge on the Form One. These DVDs were entitled ‘Golden Boys – Teen Special Part One’, ‘Teen Special – Golden Boys Part Two’, ‘Teen Special – Part 3’, and ‘Teen Special – Part 4’. In each case the videos depicted males aged between 10 and 15 years performing sexual acts with themselves and each other, and, in particular, depicted mutual and self-masturbation, oral sex, and anal intercourse. In each case the scenes were primarily at level 7 on the COPINE scale being ‘explicit sexual activity’. 
     
      
    15 A further DVD and two CDs were also located. This material gave rise to the fourth charge on the Form One. The DVD was entitled ‘Boys Affairs – Smiling Boys’. It was damaged but included a scene of a boy aged between 14 and 15 performing oral sex on another male. One CD was entitled ‘Porno’ and contained 1198 files, mainly images. In terms of the COPINE scale the images ranged from level 5 (deliberately posed pictures of naked children or provocative poses) to the most serious level, level 10. The ages of the children ranged from children below 12 months to teenagers. The images included images of children performing oral sex and being sexually assaulted by adults, in one instance whilst the child was tied down. The other CD was entitled ‘Porn’. It contained images of children aged from below 12 months through to teenagers. There were images of pre-pubescent boys and girls performing oral sex and being sexually assaulted by adults, some images of bestiality, and one image of a female baby with a needle or similar device ‘inserted from one side of her clitoris to the other side’. 
     
      
       
        
          
        
       
      
    16 In all, thousands of children appeared in the more than 45,000 images and about 700 child pornography movies which the applicant had in his possession. His Honour observed that: 
     
      
       
        
        [h]arsh sentences are required in cases such as this, not only so that judges do what they can to reduce the demand for such appalling acts of cruelty, but also to mark in a very real way the community’s horror at such treatment of entirely innocent and defenceless children. 
        
       
      
    17 His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        The possession of child pornography is a crime which requires that attention be paid to the means of production of the material.  
         
         
        The harm caused by offences of this nature takes many forms, but the most obvious harm is caused to those young children who are used by the manufacturers of child pornography as they satisfy the demands of people such as the offender. When considering the gravity of an offence of possession of child pornography the authorities require that I take into account those who are harmed by its creation.  
        
       
       
      Relevant sentencing considerations 
       
      
    18 It is convenient at the outset to further identify some of the principles which inform the sentencing process in cases of child pornography. 
     
      
    19 In R v Gent (2005) 162 A Crim R 29 this court considered a case which involved the importation of child pornography in contravention of the Customs Act 1901. Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreed) examined a number of authorities which have considered this issue. Amongst them was R v Stroempl (1995) 105 CCC (3d) 187 in which Morden ACJO in the Ontario Court of Appeal said: 
     
      
       
        
        The possession of child pornography is a very important contributing element in the general problem of child pornography. In a very real sense, possessors such as the appellant instigate the production and distribution of child pornography – and the production of child pornography, in turn, frequently involves direct child abuse in one form or another. The trial judge was right in his observation that if the courts, through the imposition of appropriate sanctions, stifle the activities of the prospective purchasers and collectors of child pornography, this may go some distance to smother the market for child pornography altogether. In turn, this would substantially reduce the motivation to produce child pornography in the first place 
        .  
        (at 191) 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    20 That statement was referred to with approval in R v Jones (1999) 108 A Crim R 50 by Kennedy J who went on to say that: 
     
      
       
        
        [t]he production of child pornography for dissemination involves the exploitation and corruption of children who are incapable of protecting themselves. The collection of such material is likely to encourage those who are actively involved in corrupting the children involved in the sexual activities depicted and who recruit and use those children for the purpose of recording and distributing the results. The offence of possessing child pornography cannot be characterised as a victimless crime. The children, in the end, are the victims. (at 52 ) 
        
       
      
    21 Having completed his review of the relevant authorities, Johnson J said: 
     
      
       
        
        As cases such as  
        Liddington 
        ,  
        Jones 
        ,  
        Assheton 
         and  
        R v C 
         make clear, a range of factors bear upon the objective seriousness of an offence of possession or importation of child pornography. These factors include:  
         
          
           
          (a) the nature and content of the pornographic material – including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed; 
           
           
          (b) the number of images or items of material possessed by the offender; 
           
           
          (c) whether the possession or importation is for the purpose of sale or further distribution; 
           
           
          (d) whether the offender will profit from the offence. 
          
         
         
         
        It might be worth noting, however, that the number of images as such may not be the real point. In a case of possession of child pornography for personal use only, the significance of quantity lies more in the number of different children who are depicted and thereby victimised. (par 99) 
         
        
       
      
    22 The English Court of Appeal issued a guideline judgment in respect of child pornography in Regina v Oliver, Hartrey and Baldwin [2003] 1 Cr App R 28. In that case Lord Rose, who delivered the judgment of the Court, said: 
     
      
       
        
        There are specific factors which are capable of aggravating the seriousness of a particular offence. We identify these as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) If the images have been shown or distributed to a child. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) If there are a large number of images. It is impossible to specify precision as to numbers. Sentencers must make their own assessment of whether the numbers are small or large. …  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) The way in which a collection of images is organised on a computer may indicate a more or less sophisticated approach on the part of the offender to trading, or a higher level of personal interest in the material. An offence will be less serious if images have been viewed but not stored. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iv) Images posted on a public area of the internet, or distributed in a way making it more likely they will be found accidentally by computer users not looking for pornographic material, will aggravate the seriousness of the offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (v) the offence will be aggravated if the offender was responsible for the original production of the images, particularly if the child or children involved were members of the offender’s own family, or were drawn from particularly vulnerable groups, such as those who have left or have been taken from their home or normal environment, whether for the purposes of exploitation or otherwise, or if the offender has abused a position of trust, as in the case of a teacher, friend of the family, social worker, or youth group leader. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (vi) The age of the children involved may be an aggravating feature. In many cases it will be difficult to quantify the effect of age by reference to the impact on the child. But in some cases that impact may be apparent. For example, assaults on babies or very young children attract particular repugnance and may, by the conduct depicted in the image, indicate the likelihood of physical injury to the private parts of the victim. Some conduct may manifestly (that is to say, apparently from the image) have inducted fear or distress in the victim, and some conduct which might not cause fear or distress to an adolescent child, might cause fear or distress to a child of, say, 6 or 7. (at 20) 
          
         
        
       
      
    23 It is to be observed however that the guideline was not confined to the offence of possessing child pornography, whilst Gent as I have indicated, was concerned with the importation of child pornography. Useful as those authorities are, it is nonetheless important to bear in mind when referring to them, as counsel did in submissions, that they are not solely concerned with offences of the kind currently under consideration. 
     
      
       
      The applicant’s subjective features 
       
      
    24 The applicant was born on 8 September 1972 and was accordingly 34 at the time of the offences. His father is of Aboriginal descent. Although he left school in Year 9 the applicant has generally been in employment since then, mainly working for local councils. At the time of these offences he was working for Willoughby Council as an Assets Manager. 
     
      
    25 The applicant identifies himself as a homosexual and was in a committed relationship at the time of the offences. The evidence revealed that the applicant had abused amphetamines for some time but that he had ceased taking drugs following his incarceration. 
     
      
    26 The applicant has a criminal record which includes two previous sentences of imprisonment. In 1992 he received a minimum term of 3 years imprisonment with an additional term of 12 months for an offence of assault and rob in company. An offence of obtaining money by deception attracted a concurrent fixed term of 12 months imprisonment. In 2000 the applicant received a sentence of 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months for an offence of sexual intercourse without consent. An identical sentence, which was slightly accumulated upon that sentence, was imposed for an offence of aggravated break and enter and commit felony. On three occasions the applicant has been convicted for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. However those offences, and various other matters have been dealt with by way of bonds or community service orders. In short, there is nothing in the applicant’s criminal record which is of a kind that bears any real similarity to the present offences. 
     
      
    27 The applicant wrote a letter to the sentencing judge. His Honour acknowledged that in it the applicant accepted responsibility for his actions. However his Honour concluded that “there was no evidence to suggest that [the applicant] had acknowledged that by creating demand for material of this kind he had contributed to the enormous suffering of many many children”. That being so, the sentencing judge concluded that the applicant had failed to provide evidence of the kind that is now required by s 21(A)(3)(i) before an offender is able to have taken into account on his behalf any discount for remorse.  
     
      
    28 In this context the sentencing judge also referred to the applicant’s account to a psychologist as to the circumstances in which he had acquired possession of the pornography. The sentencing judge rejected that explanation as being “inherently unbelievable”. His lack of candour with the psychologist was regarded by the sentencing judge as providing an additional reason as to why the applicant was not truly remorseful for his actions. Nor was the sentencing judge able to find that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. As the sentencing judge observed even the psychologist, who prepared a report on the applicant’s behalf, was “guarded” on the question of the likelihood of his committing further offences. 
     
      
    29 The sentencing judge noted that, as at the time of sentence, the applicant was on protection which meant that he was spending 22 hours a day in a locked cell with one other inmate. Although there was no specific evidence as to what conditions he would be subjected to after sentence was passed, his Honour concluded that “there is a risk that he will serve his sentence in conditions which are harsher than those which apply to prisoners not serving their sentences on protection”. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    30 The following grounds of appeal are relied upon by the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        1 His Honour erred in finding that there was ‘planning’ in the commission of the offence, and that this amounted to an aggravating factor. 
        
       
       
        
        2 His Honour erred in finding that ‘the offence involved gratuitous cruelty’. 
        
       
       
        
        3 His Honour erred in not taking into account in his assessment of the objective gravity of the offences the fact that (a) the applicant did not have the pornography in his possession for the purposes of dissemination; and (b) did not intend to profit from the pornography. 
        
       
       
        
        4 His Honour was in error in imposing the maximum penalty on count one. 
        
       
       
        
        5 The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
      Ground one 
       
      
    31 In sentencing the applicant, his Honour had regard to the various aggravating and mitigating factors which appear in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (the Act). A sentencing court is prohibited from taking into account as an aggravating factor an element of the offence: s 21A(2). The prohibition extends to taking into account a matter that amounts to an inherent characteristic of the offence: Elyard v R [2006] NSWCCA 43. Section 21A(2)(n) provides that it is an aggravating factor if the offence “was part of a planned or organised criminal activity”. Conversely s 21A(3)(b) provides that it is a mitigating factor if the offence was not planned or part of organised criminal activity then. Complaint is made about his Honour’s finding that he was satisfied “that the offence was planned in the sense that the offender set about to obtain child pornography over the internet and did so”. It is apparent from an overall reading of his Honour’s remarks that he proceeded upon the basis that this case fell within the scope of s 21A(2)(n).  
     
      
    32 As his Honour made plain, the applicant acquired the prohibited material by downloading it from the Internet. Since the applicant had amassed a very large quantity of child pornography it followed, the respondent submitted, that the applicant must have spent a considerable amount of time in doing so. Furthermore, it was pointed out that the applicant utilised not only the Internet but two external hard drives as well as a laptop and CDs in order to store the material. So much may be accepted. However, neither of those factors in my view could properly be regarded, on the facts of the present case, as constituting “planned or organised activity” as that expression would normally be understood. In the present case, for example, nothing is known of the circumstances in which the material was stored, for what purpose it was stored, or for how long it was stored. That is not to say of course that these factors were not important considerations to be taken into account in an assessment of the applicant’s objective criminality.  
     
      
    33 Consideration of some of the decided cases serves only to fortify my view. In Fahs v R [2007] NSWCCA 26 Howie J (with whom Simpson J and I agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        The aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(n) is that “the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity”. The wording of this provision seems to me to convey more than simply that the offence was planned. The fact that there was a “level of planning in the offences” as found by the Judge does not necessarily give rise to the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(n). In  
        R v Wickham 
         [2004] NSWCCA 193 the Court stressed the importance of making findings under s 21A in accordance with the words of the provision.  
        
       
       
        
        Had the only relevant factor been the existence of planning in the commission of the offence, there might have been a valid argument that planning was an inherent characteristic of every offence involving on-going or commercial drug trafficking: see  
        Elyard v R 
         [2006] NSWCCA 43. But it is not an inherent characteristic of supplying drugs that it is “part of a planned or organized criminal activity” in the sense that those words convey. For example, I do not believe those words apply to the normal street dealer who purchases drugs from various sources simply to obtain the wherewithal to purchase drugs for his own use. Therefore, in an appropriate case this aggravating factor can be taken into account when sentencing for drug trafficking offences. In this case it would have been open to the Judge to find that such a factor existed in respect of each of the offences because it was clear that the applicant was committing the crimes as part of a drug trafficking organisation capable of supplying large amounts of different types of drugs to order. (pars 21-22) 
        
       
      
    34 In R v Yildiz (2006) 160 A Crim R 218, Simpson J observed: 
     
      
       
        
        As in  
        Elyard 
        , there was no evidence that would permit a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the degree of planning in this case exceeded what would ordinarily be expected of an offence of this kind – that is, the degree of planning that would be inherent in the possession of a large quantity of drugs for the purpose of supply. I therefore conclude that what was said was an error. However, in my view, it was something that, at most, marginally affected the selection of the ultimate sentence. (at par 39) 
        
       
      
    35 In Bowden v R [2009] NSWCCA 45, Hall J, with whom Beazley JA and Kirby J agreed, applied the same reasoning. See also R v Hewitt (2007) 180 A Crim R 306. 
     
      
    36 In my view, a similar line of reasoning should be applied in the present case. I accept there was no evidence of any planning on the part of the applicant in the sense in which that expression has been construed in the cases, and certainly none that went beyond that which is inherent in the offence. Accordingly, in finding that the offence was “planned” and treating it as an aggravating feature, the sentencing judge fell into error. 
     
      
       
      Ground two 
       
      
    37 Section 21(2)(f) lists as an aggravating feature the fact that “the offence involved gratuitous cruelty”. In relation to that issue the sentencing judge observed: 
     
      
       
        
        It is an aggravating circumstance under s 21A(2)(f) that  
        “the offence involved gratuitous cruelty”. 
         Some might argue that the word  
        “involved” 
         means that where a person merely looks at a depiction of gratuitous cruelty that is not something which is  
        “involved” 
         with the offence. Others might argue to the contrary. But whether the terms of s 21A(2)(f) are met here, there is no doubt in this case that many of the children depicted were subject to gratuitous cruelty, nor is there any doubt that this circumstance makes the offender’s conduct more culpable, which in turn requires a longer sentence than would otherwise be the case.  
         
         
        As it seems necessary for me to make findings by reference to s 21A, I am prepared to give a wide meaning to the word  
        “involved”  
        such that I am satisfied that this statutory aggravating factor is present in this case. 
         
        
       
      
    38 What this passage makes abundantly clear is that whatever misgivings the sentencing judge may have had about doing so, his Honour ultimately decided to also treat this factor as an aggravating feature for the purpose of sentencing the applicant. The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge again erred in doing so. The applicant took as his starting point the statutory definition of “child pornography” which is defined to mean: 
     
      
       
        
        material that depicts or describes (or appears to depict or describe) in a manner that would in all the circumstances cause offence to reasonable persons, a person under (or apparently under) the age of 16: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) engaged in sexual activity, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in a sexual context, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) as the victim of torture, cruelty or physical abuse (whether or not in a sexual context). 
          
         
        
       
      
    39 Accordingly, it is submitted that because depiction of torture, cruelty or physical abuse is an element of the offence, it was impermissible to take it into account as an aggravating factor: s 21A(2) of the Act. The Crown submitted that because there are three kinds of material which may constitute “child pornography” it is not necessarily an element of the offence that the material depicts torture, cruelty or physical abuse.  
     
      
    40 The Crown relied, by way of analogy upon the decision in Hamze v R [2006] NSWCCA 36, in which it was held in respect of a charge of aggravated armed robbery, that it was permissible for the sentencing judge to take into account as an aggravating factor, pursuant to s 21A(2)(b) of the Act, that actual violence had been inflicted upon the victim. That was because although the offence may be established following the infliction of actual violence, it was not an essential element because the threat of violence would suffice. For that reason, it could not be said that actual violence was an essential ingredient of the offence for the purposes of the limitation in s 21A(2). 
     
      
    41 I am not persuaded that Hamze provides any real assistance in resolving the present argument because it is clear that the sentencing judge found that each of the three aspects of the definition of “child pornography” were present on the facts of this case including the fact that children had been the victims of torture, cruelty or physical abuse. Because the images depicted the victims in a fashion that warranted those descriptions, it is apparent that that fact had already been taken into account by the sentencing judge in determining the objective gravity of the offence. To that extent, it is apparent that there has been impermissible “double-counting”. 
     
      
    42 In the circumstances it is strictly unnecessary to consider the reasoning process undertaken by the sentencing judge in arriving at the conclusion that s 21A(2)(f) did apply. It is axiomatic that the images that the applicant possessed depicted acts of gratuitous cruelty. As I have said, that fact bore heavily upon an assessment of the applicant’s objective criminality. Furthermore, there can be no doubt that this factor would be a highly relevant aggravating feature in the sentencing of those responsible for producing these abhorrent images.  
     
      
    43 However, the question remains as to whether the offence with which the applicant was charged (namely possession of the images after they had been created) involved gratuitous cruelty. Although there is no direct authority upon this issue, I am inclined to the view that it did not given that there was no evidence that the offender engaged in any activity which contributed in any way to the creation of the images which were in his possession. Those cases which do exist however support the conclusion that some activity on the part of the offender is required. For example, in R v King (2004) 150 A Crim R 409 this Court found that an offence of malicious wounding with intent involved gratuitous cruelty in circumstances where the offender kicked a pregnant woman. In R v Hoerler (2004) 147 A Crim R 520 a similar conclusion was reached in a case of manslaughter in which the offender engaged in a prolonged attack on an infant.  
     
      
    44 I would uphold Ground two. 
     
      
       
      Grounds three, four and five 
       
      
    45 These grounds may conveniently be dealt with together. Although it was contended in Ground 5 that each of the sentences was manifestly excessive, the real complaint was directed to the sentence imposed in respect of count 1, which as I have said, attracted the maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. Ground 4 raised essentially the same complaint and in that sense the two grounds overlapped. 
     
      
    46 It will be observed that the sentencing judge concluded that prima facie each offence warranted the maximum penalty. Nevertheless, his Honour explained his reasons for imposing the sentences which he did in the following fashion: 
     
      
       
        
        The offender pleaded guilty to these three offences in the Local Court and was committed for sentence to this Court. He is therefore, absent any other considerations, entitled to the maximum discount for the utilitarian benefit of his pleas of guilty. But there is one other factor which must be taken into account. That is that on one of the offences the offender asks that I take into account a number of matters on a Form 1, in particular two other offences of possessing child pornography. Consistent with the view I have taken regarding accumulation of the sentence in this case, and consistent with the guideline judgement of  
        Attorney General's Application Under S37 Of The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 Of 2002 
          
        (2002) 56 NSWLR 146, I consider that the Form 1 matters cannot simply be ignored. I consider the true position to be that the sentence to be imposed upon the offender for that offence to which the Form 1 is attached must be longer than it would otherwise have been in order to reflect those Form 1 offences. In fact having considered the nature of the offences on the Form 1, in particular the number and nature of the items of child pornography covered by two of the offences on the Form 1, I am of the opinion that a substantial increment should be allowed to reflect the Form 1 matters. The presence of the serious Form 1 matters, one of which involves a series of images accurately described as depicting the torture of a baby less than 12 months of age, places the first charge in that rare category of offence where the maximum penalty is appropriate even given the utilitarian benefits of the plea of guilty, and the subjective features relied on by the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        So serious do I regard the offences, in particular the number and nature of the images possessed, and so relatively insignificant do I regard the mitigating features of this case that, absent the pleas of guilty, I would have imposed the maximum penalty in each case. For charges two and three the sentence will be 25% less than it would otherwise have been to reflect the utilitarian benefits of the offender’s pleas of guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        However for the first charge, as I have explained earlier, this is one of those cases where the maximum penalty is appropriate despite the plea of guilty, something that was specifically contemplated both when statutory recognition was given to the discount for a plea of guilty (see second reading speech, Hansard NSW Parliament, Legislative Assembly 4 April 1990 at 1689) and also in the guideline judgment of  
        R v Thompson and Houlton  
        (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [158]. I should emphasise that the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty may still lead to the offender being better off than he would be if he had been found guilty after trial, because the plea of guilty is something which I have taken into account in considering the question of the extent of the accumulation of sentences and the principle of totality.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
         
         
        I should also record that I have not lost sight of the fact that charge three involves no pornography of COPINE level 10, and there are fewer separate items of child pornography than in either charges one or two. Nevertheless I consider that, absent the plea of guilty, the maximum penalty would still have been appropriate for charge three and the circumstance I have just referred to only goes to emphasise the gravity of the other two counts. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        In my view the sheer numbers of child pornographic items and the separate locations in which they were stored require some level of accumulation. The level of accumulation is less than I would have regarded as appropriate in the absence of pleas of guilty. 
         
        
       
      
    47 It is thus clear that notwithstanding the sentencing judge’s view that counts 2 and 3 were sufficiently heinous to attract the maximum penalty, his Honour nonetheless decided not to impose that penalty in respect of either count. Indeed his Honour allowed the applicant a discount of 25% from the total sentence for each of those offences. In respect of count 1, by way of contrast, the sentencing judge declined to allow any discount at all from the total sentence for the plea of guilty. His Honour’s reason for doing so lay in his conclusion that the two further offences of child pornography that were on the Form 1 document, were of such seriousness as to warrant the imposition of the maximum penalty.  
     
      
    48 It is to be observed that the images which gave rise to the two Form 1 offences were located on DVDs and CDs which were found in a drawer of the bookshelf of the applicant’s bedroom. The material, which was the subject of counts 2 and 3, was also located in the applicant’s bedroom albeit in different parts of it. That is apparently the basis upon which separate charges were laid, although all that material could just as easily have given rise to only the one charge. Be that as it may, and even allowing for the fact that the offences on the Form 1 mandated a longer sentence in respect of count 1, it seems surprising that that factor should have had the consequence that the offence was thus converted into one deserving of the maximum penalty, and that the applicant was thereby deprived of any discount at all (from the total term) for his plea of guilty. In the final analysis, the non-parole period which was imposed in respect of count 1, was 18 months longer than the non-parole periods fixed in respect of counts 2 and 3 which, as I have said, were ordered to be served concurrently with one another. Moreover, the non-parole period in respect of count 1 was then accumulated by 12 months upon the non-parole periods imposed in respect of counts 2 and 3. In my view, that outcome is of itself sufficiently anomalous to demonstrate without more, that the sentencing process miscarried and that the sentence imposed in respect of count 1, was manifestly excessive. That conclusion in my view warrants this court’s intervention. 
     
      
    49 Ground 3 raised the complaint that the sentencing judge erred in imposing the maximum penalty in respect of count one because, it was submitted it was not open to the sentencing judge to find that these offences fell into the worst class of case. Essentially the argument advanced in support of this ground was the same one that counsel had urged upon the sentencing judge. It was to the effect that because there was no evidence that certain factors which, had they been present, would have aggravated the offence, then it followed that the sentencing judge erred in concluding that the offences fell into the worst category. In rejecting that submission his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        Of course it is well known that the maximum penalty is reserved for those cases falling within the worst category of case for which the penalty is prescribed, see  
        Ibbs v The Queen 
         (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-452. It is not possible to prescribe a list of cases falling within the worst category because human ingenuity can always conjure up a case of greater heinousness:  
        Veen v The Queen (No 2)  
        (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 478. I have considered this matter carefully and I am satisfied that, particularly in the light of the number of separate items of child pornography covered by each offence, the age of many of the children being such that they were likely injured during the sexual acts depicted, and the level of gross depravity displayed in many of those items, it is appropriate to describe each of the offences for which the offender is to be sentenced as being in the worst category. 
        
       
       
        
        [Counsel] suggested that the offences were not in the worst category because the offender was not disseminating child pornography, nor did he have it in his possession for such a purpose, and nor was he obtaining any financial benefit from his possession of the pornography. None of those matters take these offences out of the worst category. It is not a mitigating feature of one offence to say that another, more serious, offence was not committed (I say this in reference to the fact that s 91H(2) 
         Crimes Act 
         1900 is an offence of disseminating child pornography). 
         
         
        As to the submission that the offender did not have the pornography for dissemination and did not make any money out of its possession, in my view to conclude that those matters meant that the offences were not in the worst category would be to engage in the reasoning specifically prohibited by the High Court in  
        Veen v The Queen (No 2)  
        [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465, that is, it would be to allow the mere fact that human ingenuity can postulate a worse offence to lead to a conclusion that these offences were not in the worst category. 
        
       
      
    50 Because I have already formed the view that this court should intervene in respect of the sentence imposed for count 1, it is unnecessary to explore this issue at any great length. That said, I do not detect any error of principle in the manner in which the sentencing judge approached this aspect of the matter. It is to be observed that in Mouscas v R [2008] NSWCCA 181 this Court held that it was open to the sentencing judge to find that the offending in that case was “at the upper-end of the range of seriousness” although there was no evidence that that offender had the pornography in his possession “for the purpose of sale or further distribution or that he would profit from the offence” (at par 18).  
     
      
    51 It is apparent from what I said earlier that the applicant has succeeded in demonstrating error in relation to Grounds 1 and 2. I am also of the view that Ground 4 and Ground 5 have been made out, at least insofar as it has been established that the sentence for count 1 was manifestly excessive. In my view this court should proceed to resentence the offender. In doing so, it is necessary to have regard to the appropriate range for offences of this kind. Because there have been relatively few instances of this specific offence that have been dealt with by the courts it is difficult to accurately determine what the appropriate range of sentence might be. Indeed the court was informed that statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission revealed that there were only 4 such cases for the period between January 2005 and December 2007. In those circumstances, there is utility in examining some of the decided cases, the first three of which were specifically referred to in submissions by counsel for the applicant in support of the submission that the sentences were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    52 In Gent (supra) the offender was charged with the importation of child pornography, an offence which attracted a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The charges related to his importation of two CDs. One of the CDs contained 16 video images, involving acts of oral and anal penetration and masturbation of young children. The second CD contained 601 images of young boys and girls engaged in sexual acts with adults or with each other. The majority of the boys were aged between 8 and 11. The girls appeared to range in age between 6 and 14. At least some of the images depicted sado-masochist images of a child being penetrated by an adult, the child being in “obvious and extreme pain”. 
     
      
    53 That offender was 39 years old at the time of the offence. He was a teacher who had had twice previously had to cease employment after having accessed child pornography on school computers. He had no prior convictions. That offender was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months. He appealed to this Court. Leave to appeal was granted, but the appeal was dismissed. Johnson J (with whom the other judges of this Court agreed) said that it had not been established that the sentence lay outside the permissible range of sentence for this offence. 
     
      
    54 In Power v DPP (NSWDC, unrep 19 July 2007, Boulton ADCJ) the offender had pleaded guilty to a single count of possession of child pornography. The material included 31 videos of adult males engaging in sexual acts with children 10 years and less and with adolescents including penetrative oral and anal sex, bondage and masturbation. One of the videos depicted a 5 year old child who was handcuffed and then anally raped. It also included over 28,000 images of homosexual pornography, of which 433 were images of child pornography. The offender had no prior convictions and was of unblemished prior character. He was also suffering from depression. In the Local Court he was sentenced to 15 months with a non-parole period of 8 months. On appeal, the non-parole period was reduced to 6 months. 
     
      
    55 In Mouscas (supra) the offender was found to be in possession of a computer hard drive and compact disks which contained 41,923 graphic files and 251 video files of child pornography. The photographs included photographs of adult men having oral, anal and vaginal sex with girls as young as 4 and 5. There were photographs of children being bound, gagged and blindfolded. There were photographs of children involved in sexual acts with animals. There were many hundreds, if not thousands of victims. That offender who had a good employment record and no prior convictions was sentenced to a head sentence of 2 years 9 months, with a non-parole period of 18 months. In his appeal to this Court, leave to appeal was granted, but the appeal was dismissed. As I remarked earlier the Court rejected an argument that the sentencing judge had erred in concluding that the offending was at the “upper-end” of the scale of objective seriousness. That offender was convicted of one charge of possessing child pornography with a further charge of using a carrier service to access child pornography being placed on a certificate.  
     
      
    56 In R v Leonard [2008] NSWDC 211 the offender was dealt with for possessing child pornography, an offence to which he pleaded guilty, together with an offence of using the internet to make available child abuse material. He was convicted by a jury of that latter offence. The offender was the operator of a website. Forensic investigations of the computer and hard drive revealed that the offender had, at an earlier time, been in possession of a number of child pornographic images which had not been deleted. A number of the images depicted naked male children masturbating. Other photographs were of sexual acts between young boys. Some images depicted young boys having oral sex. There were 19 images of naked male children performing anal sex on other naked male children. There were 276 images depicting naked male children apparently between 7 and 13 years, in erotic or sexual poses. Many of the images focussed on the genitals of the young boys. The offender was aged 74 and had health problems. He had a prior history of convictions for child sexual assault which consisted of sexual intercourse with children between the ages of 10 and 16. The offender received a non-parole period of 9 months with a total term of 12 months imprisonment for the offence of possessing child pornography. 
     
      
    57 In R v Elliott [2008] NSWDC 238 the offender pleaded guilty to 5 charges of possessing child pornography and 4 of disseminating child pornography. The latter charges attracted a maximum penalty in each case of 10 years imprisonment. The offender was arrested at his work place following inquiries which had commenced in the USA. Count 1 related to his possession of 3 USB thumb drives found at his home. They contained 17 child pornography movie files which depicted adolescent males between 10 and 15 years of age engaged in self masturbation, oral sex, penetrative anal intercourse and anal penetration with a vibrator. Count 2 related to a collection of CDs, DVDs and floppy discs all containing child exploitation material. There were 27 movie files and approximately 3,100 still images. A number of images were between level 7 and 10 on the Copine scale. The images contain children ranging in age between 2 and 15 being subjected to pain and humiliation as well as sadistic images of children being bound, gagged and sexually assaulted. It revealed children being penetrated anally or vaginally by an adult male with on one occasion a young female grimacing in pain. There is an instance of a male having penetrative sex with an infant aged between 2 and 5. Another instance involved a man ejaculating into the mouth and face of a young girl and others where objects were inserted into the anus or penis of male children. Count 3 related to the offender’s possession of 13 movie films and 3 videotapes. Most of the images and movie files were assessed as level 7 on the Copine scale. Count 4 related to the offender’s possession of a computer seized from his home. On the hard drive there were 29,000 images of male children engaged in sexual activity both with one another and with adults. The majority of images were assessed as being between 7 and 10 on the Copine scale.  
     
      
    58 Following his arrest upon those matters, the offender was released on bail with a condition that he not utilise the internet except for work purposes. A police investigation revealed that the offender was part of a paedophile network operating in New South Wales. The offender was placed under surveillance and contact with him was made by a police operative. Counts 5 to 8 were offences of disseminating child pornography to that operative whilst on bail for the earlier offences. In each instance the offender either supplied or showed the police operative a CD containing child pornographic images. Many of the images which related to these charges were assessed as being between 7 and 9 on the Copine scale. In due course the offender was again arrested and a search warrant was executed upon his premises. The material seized on this occasion gave rise to count 9. It was of a similar kind to that which was the subject of count 2. The sentencing judge regarded the material, the subject of counts 2, 4 and 9, as being the most serious and as falling at the “upper end of the range”. 
     
      
    59 The offender, who was 51 at the time of the offences, had no prior convictions and had entered pleas of guilty at an early opportunity. That offender was sentenced to an effective total term of 5 years 6 months imprisonment with an effective non-parole of 4 years 1 month. 
     
      
    60 In R v Jones [2009] NSWDC 8 the offender pleaded guilty to two offences of possessing child pornography. The first offence occurred when the offender took his computer to a computer repair shop. The repairer discovered images of girls aged between 6 and 12 who had their genitals exposed. In one image, a girl was lying naked with her legs parted and an artificial penis was placed on the bed between her legs. The offender’s computer hard drive contained 51 images and one video of child pornography which was of 20 minutes duration. It depicted a girl between the ages of 6 and 10 engaged in vaginal and anal intercourse with an adult male. The second offence occurred following the execution of a search warrant at the offender’s residence. Police located 25 compact disks which contained about 23,000 image files and 220 video files of child pornography. Many of the images were graded 9 or 10 on the Copine Scale and were deeply disturbing. The children included babies, 18 month old toddlers and girls up to the age of 12. The images included a variety of oral and vaginal intercourse, bondage, images of children in apparent pain and children being urinated or ejaculated upon. That offender was 64 at the time of the offences and had no prior criminal record. He had been introduced to child pornography in the course of his employment as a Customs officer. In 1971 the offender had been the victim of two armed robberies which had put him in considerable fear. He had a significant back problem and suffered from prostrate cancer, the prognosis for which was uncertain. For the second offence the offender received a non-parole period of 20 months with the total term being 27 months to be served by way of periodic detention. The first offence attracted a bond. 
     
      
    61 For completeness, I should refer to one other matter. As I have already said the maximum penalty at the time of these offences was 5 years imprisonment whereas a person who produced or disseminated child pornography was liable to a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The sentencing judge made plain his view that the maximum penalty for the offence of possession of child pornography was quite inadequate. However, since the applicant was sentenced, the maximum penalty for the offence of possessing this material has been increased to bring it into line with the offences of producing and disseminating it. Since January 2009 the maximum penalty for each of the three offences is now 10 years imprisonment. It follows from the increase in penalty that the decisions to which I have referred will not provide any useful guidance so far as future offences of this kind are concerned. 
     
      
       
      Determination 
       
      
    62 Even allowing for the fact that the applicant had the material in his possession solely for his own private use, the total number of images, the ages of the children involved and the sheer depravity of what was displayed in the images, compel the conclusion that these offences are properly to be regarded as falling into the upper echelons of this kind of offending. The analysis of other comparable cases serves to confirm that categorisation. 
     
      
    63 In resentencing the applicant I have also had regard to the contents of an affidavit sworn by the applicant. He remains in protective custody. He is employed in the kitchen and has completed the necessary training to become a kitchen manager. He has not received any disciplinary charges and he also expressed his regret for having been involved in these offences. 
     
      
    64 In my view the sentences imposed in respect of counts 2 and 3 should not be disturbed. I would however reduce the sentence imposed for count 1. Had I been sentencing at first instance I would have structured the sentences somewhat differently. Nevertheless in order to now do justice as best I can I would reduce the sentence on count 1 in such a fashion as would allow the applicant some substantial benefit for his plea of guilty whilst still ensuring that he receives an appropriate additional penalty for the Form 1 matters. It is to be recalled that that sentence is accumulated to a significant extent upon the sentences imposed in respect of counts 2 and 3.  
     
      
    65 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1 Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      2 Allow the appeal. 
       
       
      3 Confirm the sentences imposed in respect of counts 2 and 3. 
       
       
      4 In respect of count 1, allow the appeal and quash the sentence imposed in the District Court. 
       
       
      5 In respect of count 1, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, sentence the applicant to a non-parole of 2 years 9 months with an overall term of 4 years to commence on 22 July 2008. The total term will expire on 21 July 2012 and the non-parole will expire on 21 April 2011 on which date the applicant will be eligible for release on parole. The total effective sentence is thus one of 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was tried and convicted of a charge that he conspired to commit an armed robbery between 6 May 2005 and 2 July 2006 with Robert Lee, George Tuifua, Acura Niuqila and other persons. A primary issue at the trial was whether there was the conspiracy as alleged. However, the issue of particular significance in this appeal was whether the Crown had established, to the requisite standard, that the appellant was a party to the alleged conspiracy. 
     
      
    2 The Crown case against the alleged conspirators was primarily comprised of the record of multiple intercepted telephone conversations, DNA from balaclavas and other items and the observations, in particular of police officers, who intercepted the conspirators as they travelled to their target, alleged to be the Commonwealth Bank branch at Seven Hills. The appellant was not identified by the police as being present when the motor vehicles were intercepted but there was other evidence to connect him with the events of that morning.  
     
      
       
      Relevant facts 
       
      
    3 In the middle of May 2005, the police commenced lawfully intercepting telephone conversations between the alleged conspirators, including the appellant and his co-accused. Over 7000 conversations were intercepted out of which 108 contained conversations which the Crown alleged could only be construed as including conversations which revealed the formation of a plan to rob the Commonwealth Bank of Australia on Tucks Road in Seven Hills NSW (“the Bank”). 
     
      
    4 At about 9 am on 1 July 2005 the Crown alleged that the appellant, Lee, Niuqila, Tuifua, Robinson and Sinamoni gathered outside Sinamoni’s house in Blacktown. From there they travelled in a convoy of three cars. Sinamoni and Lee in a stolen black Porsche four-wheel drive; Tuifua and Niuqila in a red Toyota Corolla, owned by Niuqila; and the appellant and Robinson in a blue Ford Laser. These three vehicles were being monitored by undercover surveillance police who were driving in cars and another police officer who was in a helicopter. 
     
      
    5 From Sinamoni’s house the cars travelled to an area behind some shops in McCoy Street, Toongabbie. At that location a blue sport’s bag containing a sawn-off shotgun, a crowbar and other items was moved from the blue Ford Laser to the black Porsche. 
     
      
    6 The three cars then drove in the direction of the Commonwealth Bank on Tucks Road Seven Hills. When the cars were about to turn right into Tucks Road the police intercepted the convoy so as to prevent the robbery from occurring. As a result the Porsche collided with one of the cars driven by the police. 
     
      
    7 It was alleged that Sinamoni then drove the black Porsche away at high speed, managing to evade the police on the ground. However, it could still be seen by the officer who was in the helicopter. The other two cars also managed to evade the police. 
     
      
    8 A few kilometres away, Sinamoni and Lee parked the black Porsche in the car port of a house in Simmonds Street and ran away. They dumped the blue sport’s bag in a laneway. This bag was found shortly afterwards by a resident of the area and handed to the police. It contained a loaded sawn-off shotgun and a crowbar, amongst other items. 
     
      
    9 Sinamoni, Lee and another person were located by police on a main road close by. Tuifua and Niuqila were also arrested a short time later. They were driving in the red Toyota Corolla at the time of arrest. The appellant and Robinson were arrested a week later, on 8 July 2005. 
     
      
    10 Lee and Niuqila had purchased three balaclavas a few days earlier from a shop on George Street in the city. The shop owner identified them both and a receipt for the purchase was also found. 
     
      
    11 Two balaclavas, some gloves and other clothing were found in the red Toyota Corolla. Another balaclava was found in the street nearby to the Toyota. 
     
      
    12 DNA testing was conducted on a number of the items seized by police. A profile consistent with the appellant’s DNA was found on some of them being: 
     
      
       
      a. a grey cloth found in the red Toyota Corolla that Tuifua and Niuqila were arrested in; 
       
      b. left hand glove found within the red Toyota Corolla; and 
       
      c. the balaclava which was located on the street. 
       
      
    13 A profile consistent with the DNA of Sinamoni was also found on the passenger seat of the black Porsche. 
     
      
    14 The Crown case specifically relating to the appellant consisted of the following evidence: 
     
      
       
      a. the intercepted conversations in which the Crown said he took part and which it was alleged demonstrated the appellant’s knowledge of and involvement in the agreement to rob the Bank. 
       
      b. the relevant DNA results. 
       
      c. the fact that the appellant was arrested in the company of the co-accused Robinson on 8 July 2005. 
       
      
    15 As I have indicated there was no evidence from any of the surveillance officers that the applicant was present in the convoy of cars on 1 July 2005. The appellant is apparently Aboriginal and none of the officers were able to say that they observed a person of Aboriginal appearance. He was not present for the hearing of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      The telephone conversations 
       
      
    16 Some of the telephone conversation between the alleged conspirators was spoken in code identified by the Crown as “Pig Latin.” The evident purpose was to avoid any intercepted conversation being understood by the police. Pig Latin is commonly used by persons seeking to mask their true conversation and, so the evidence indicated at the trial, is commonly used by persons intent upon criminal activity. 
     
      
    17 In order to assist the jury in understanding relevant passages in the intercepted conversations the Crown called a police officer, Officer Murray who gave evidence that, although he had no formal training in understanding Pig Latin, he had acquired a knowledge of it since joining the robbery squad. He said that he had been with the squad for about 4½ years and in that role had monitored conversations recorded in over 40 telephone intercept warrants and that in about 85 to 90 percent of those conversations variations of Pig Latin were used. Of course, each warrant authorised the interception of many conversations. He said that he was familiar with the fact that users of Pig Latin commonly removed the first letter of a word and placed in at the end adding “ay” or “ecans” after it. The word “pump” becomes “umpay”. Sometimes “sn” is placed at the start of a word turning “pump” into “snumpay” or “snumpecans.” Other variants are also employed. 
     
      
    18 The Crown relied on 101 of the intercepted conversations of the alleged conspirators. During a voir dire hearing Officer Murray said that he used his knowledge of the language to translate about 20 to 30 Pig Latin words. The appellant objected to this evidence being adduced and submitted that Officer Murray should not have been accepted as a person with the requisite specialised knowledge and accordingly entitled to give the evidence. 
     
      
       
      The appeal – Ground 1 
       
      
    19 The appellant advanced four arguments in support of the submission that the evidence of Officer Murray was wrongly admitted. They are found in Ground 1 of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      The trial judge erred: 
       
      (a) in allowing the Crown to call evidence about the meaning of words in Pig Latin (used in the recorded conversations) from Officer Murray as a person with specialised knowledge in that area; 
       
      (b) in allowing the Crown to call evidence from Officer Murray that the word “snankos” in Pig Latin means “bank” in the absence of evidence from the Officer as to how it was he formed that opinion; 
       
      (c) by not assessing how it was that the Officer formed his opinion wholly or substantially based on his specialised knowledge in that language; and 
       
      (d) by not excluding the evidence of Officer Murray with regard to his interpretation of the words in Pig Latin, particularly the word “snankos.” 
       
      
    20 The trial judge considered the appellant’s objection at a hearing on the voir dire. Her Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept from the evidence given on the voir dire that the officer, Detective Murray, has considerable experience in reviewing intercepted telephone conversations, listening to and deciphering code used by those whose conversations are being intercepted and recognising that code as pig Latin when it is being used and being able to decipher and translate that into English. 
        
       
       
        
        This is almost, it seems to me, in the category of common knowledge to the extent that arguably expert evidence might not be entitled to be called of it. However, it has not quite come to that stage it seems to me that it could be said that pig Latin and the way in which it is used in common knowledge. It must be noted that it is a system well known to many and a definition of it appears in an on-line encyclopaedia easily obtainable by undertaking a Google search. It is easily understood by looking at the entry in that on-line encyclopaedia. It is not a novel, unique, unusual or difficult form of code. I accept that the officer has seen it in use over the last five years during the course of his work and that he has specialised knowledge of its use as a result of his experience in the robbery squad. 
        
       
       
        
        I do not accept that his translation of the words is likely to be have been influenced adversely or prejudicially against the accused because he already believed, at all times, that he was monitoring the conversations of those who were involved in a conspiracy to commit an armed robbery. 
        
       
       
        
        Ultimately it will be a matter for the jury to decide whether or not their opinion coincides with that of the officer and they will be directed to that effect at the end of the trial. 
        
       
       
        
        In the circumstances I propose to allow the opinion evidence to be given of the translations of these words from pig Latin into English as they appear in the intercepted conversations.” 
        
       
      
    21 The appellant accepted that her Honour was obliged to and had made her decision to admit the evidence having regard to s 79 of the Evidence Act 1995. The identified basis for its admission was the finding that the officer had specialised knowledge based on his experience with Pig Latin. 
     
      
    22 Section 79 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge. 
         
         
        (2) To avoid doubt, and without limiting subsection (1):  
         
          
          (a) a reference in that subsection to specialised knowledge includes a reference to specialised knowledge of child development and child behaviour (including specialised knowledge of the impact of sexual abuse on children and their development and behaviour during and following the abuse), and 
           
          (b) a reference in that subsection to an opinion of a person includes, if the person has specialised knowledge of the kind referred to in paragraph (a), a reference to an opinion relating to either or both of the following:  
           
            
            (i) the development and behaviour of children generally, 
             
            (ii) the development and behaviour of children who have been victims of sexual offences, or offences similar to sexual offences.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    23 It was submitted that her Honour’s decision to admit Officer Murray’s evidence was manifestly unjust there being little evidence that the Officer had sufficient specialised knowledge in this area. It was further submitted that there being no express finding that the officer’s opinion was “wholly or substantially based” on specialised knowledge, the second limb of s 79, the reasoning process leading to the formation of the opinion was not exposed or made transparent. 
     
      
    24 It is apparent from the trial judge’s decision in relation to the objection that the challenge made by the appellant to the admissibility of the evidence was directed to the question of the officer’s alleged specialised knowledge. There was no suggestion that the proffered opinion was not based on that knowledge (if there was such knowledge) or that the reasoning process was not exposed. In my judgment the finding that the officer had the requisite knowledge was both open and appropriate having regard to the officer’s evidence. I have summarised the relevant evidence in [17]. Furthermore, he explained in some detail the structure of the language known as Pig Latin and thereby exposed the reasoning process by which he identified the meaning of particular words: Nguyen v The Queen (2007) 173 A Crim R 557 at [53]-[43]. 
     
      
    25 Particular complaint is made by the appellant about the fact that the officer was permitted to give evidence as to the meaning of the word “snankos.” The officer said it meant “bank.” 
     
      
    26 When the recording of the relevant telephone conversation was played to the jury there were some difficulties with its clarity. However, no issue was raised by defence counsel that if the word which was recorded was “snankos” it meant “bank”. Counsel accepted that it had this meaning “on the basis of his code” (using the trial judge’s words) being a reference to Officer Murray’s “code”. The relevant exchange between counsel and her Honour included an acceptance that in the officer’s opinion a user of Pig Latin would commonly place a “sn” sound at the front of a word so that “pump” becomes “snumpay”. On the same principle “Bank” becomes “snankos.” No particular explanation was given for the addition of the letters ”os” at the end of the word. However, no issue was taken about that matter at the trial which was not surprising. The officer explained that it was common for individual speakers to add a variation of their own to the generally accepted manner of speaking. Once it is understood that “sn” was commonly used to commence a word the letter “os” had little significance. Her Honour was correct to admit into evidence the officer’s opinion that it meant “bank.” 
     
      
    27 I reject ground 1 of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – The trial judge erred in allowing evidence to go before the jury that the applicant was reporting on bail. 
       
       
      Ground 3 – The trial judge erred in allowing evidence to go before the jury which revealed that the applicant was submitting to urine testing at the time of the intercepted conversations. 
       
      
    28 These grounds may be conveniently dealt with together. 
     
      
    29 At the time of the alleged commission of the offence the appellant was on bail for an offence allegedly committed in Queensland. This matter was referred to at least indirectly in the telephone conversations. There was an issue at the trial as to whether the portions of the transcript of the telephone calls containing these references should have been excluded from the evidence. The Crown sought to tender this portion of the telephone calls to support the allegation that it was the appellant who was speaking on the relevant occasions.  
     
      
    30 In her judgment on this issue her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is certainly prejudicial to the accused but it is probative. It is probative to the issue of whether or not the accused is the person speaking and to allow the jury to compare the voice in that conversation with other voices in other conversations in which it is asserted that the accused is the speaker, and to determine whether or not Detective Murray’s opinion evidence in relation to the identity of the speaker ought be relied on by them. 
        
       
       
        
        It is circumstantial evidence which is capable of linking an event that surrounds the accused, on the basis of the content of the conversation, with the speaker who is alleged to be the accused Dodds. 
        
       
       
        
        It is prejudicial because it raises in the jury’s mind the fact that he is a person who has been charged at least with another criminal offence. However, the issue is whether or not it is unfairly prejudicial and to that extent the question is whether or not the risk of prejudice can be cured by a direction to the jury. It seems to me that that is capable of occurring. The jury can be directed that it is not relevant to the issue of the accused’s guilt for this offence. It is limited in its use, only as a circumstance which they are entitled to take into account in determining whether or not it is the voice of the accused that they can hear on the intercepted telephone conversation and they can be directed further about the fact that they are not entitled to speculate. The jury is assumed and taken to follow the directions given to them by a judge. It seems to me that that prejudice, such as it is, is capable of being cured by such a direction and I propose to allow that to be called.” 
        
       
      
    31 The appellant criticised her Honour’s decision and submitted that the tests in s 135 and s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 were not considered and that her Honour failed to balance the issues of unfair prejudice and the probative value of the evidence.  
     
      
    32 To my mind the criticism has no substance. Although the trial judge did not refer expressly to either s 135 or s 137 there can be no doubt that she considered the questions required by both sections. Her ultimate conclusion that any unfair prejudice could be dealt with by an appropriate direction was open and in my opinion correct. 
     
      
    33 The appellant submitted that because there was other evidence which indicated that it was the appellant who was speaking during the telephone conversations the particular part of the conversation should have been rejected. I do not accept the submission. The probative value of the disputed evidence was not diminished by the fact that other evidence may have been available. The other evidence did not make it indisputable that the speaker in the telephone conversation was in fact the appellant. “Evidence has ‘probative value’, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty” (R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112 at [61]). 
     
      
    34 A similar controversy arose with respect to remarks in the telephone calls where the speaker revealed that he was required to undergo urine testing which was one of his bail conditions. There was no application to reject this evidence before the transcript of it was provided to the jury. However, when objection was taken her Honour ruled that it should be admitted. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The argument is that the reference to urine testing, also in this conversation, increases the risk of unfair prejudice because of the fact that the jury might speculate or reason that he is a person given to using illegal drugs and, therefore, providing a motive for him to commit this offence. 
        
       
       
        
        It seems to me that similarly to references to his being on bail, and in circumstances where the evidence is relied on for the very limited purpose that I have outlined, that risk of prejudice is capable of being cured by a direction, and as a such is not unfair. 
        
       
       
        
        It is regrettable that his matter has come to light after the evidence has gone to the jury in circumstances where there would appear to be a misunderstanding between the Crown and counsel for Mr Dodds about that particular portion of the conversation. It was never a matter raised in voir dire argument before the trial proper commenced before the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        I accept that the evidence is probative, because as the identification of the speaker is in issue, it is capable of being used by the jury, so that its content assists them to identify the speaker at the time. 
        
       
       
        
        That, coupled with the other evidence of the actual bail condition, would be able to be used by the jury to assist them to determine the identity of the speaker on this occasion. 
        
       
       
        
        The prejudice can be cured by a direction, and that is what I propose to do now once I get the jury back, before sending them home.” 
        
       
      
    35 Complaint was made by the appellant that by tendering this evidence the Crown Prosecutor breached an undertaking given during the course of a prior discussion between counsel that it would not be tendered without first advising the appellant’s counsel. The respondent denies that such an undertaking was given. It is unnecessary to explore the detail of this dispute. Even if such an undertaking was given the prosecutor made plain at an appropriate time that he proposed to tender the content of the conversation, which included the reference to the urine testing. The circumstances of its tender were not such that for this reason prejudice was occasioned to the appellant which would have weighed in favour of rejecting the evidence. The question of its admissibility was required to be determined, as her Honour did, by consideration of both the probative value and the possibility of unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
     
      
    36 With respect to the question of potential prejudice her Honour, as she indicated she would, was careful to instruct the jury that they should not draw any inference, other than in relation to whether the appellant was the speaker, from the reference to bail or the obligation to provide urine samples. 
     
      
    37 Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You no doubt heard during that last conversation that was played a reference by one of the speakers to – he said something like ‘My solicitor rang the house last night and said if I don’t get a urine in by Friday up to Queensland they’re going to pull my bail’ – something along those lines. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown alleges that the person who was speaking on that occasion was the accused Mr Dodds. You will, as I understand it, in a later conversation in this series of telephone calls, hear another reference by a person who the Crown alleges is Mr Dodds, referring to being on bail. 
        
       
       
        
        Normally in trials, if in fact a person who is charged with something happens to be on bail, you wouldn’t hear a reference to that because it’s not relevant. When I told you at the beginning of the trial that an accused person is innocent until they are proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown, that’s not just a platitude. It means what it says, and that is that an accused person has the presumption of innocence, and the mere fact that they are on bail just means that they have been charged with an offence; it doesn’t mean they have been convicted. 
        
       
       
        
        The other thing that I have to direct you is that you’re not entitled to speculate about anything. As will become clear, I hope, in this trial, the Crown is going to be calling some evidence that the accused Mr Dodds was in fact on bail at the time and that there were some conditions of that bail. That will be called later on. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown, as I understand it, relies on that, and in fact I’ve ruled in relation to this that this is the only basis on which it is relevant in the trial, and that is to assist you to determine whether or not the person who is speaking about that is in fact, as they allege, Mr Dodds. In other words, it’s the context of what is said that is relevant, and you’d be entitled to take it into account only on that basis – that is, that it assists you to work out that it was Mr Dodds, if in fact, after all of the evidence is called, you are satisfied that in fact he was on bail at the time and there was a condition.  
        
       
       
        
        You will hear some more evidence about that, and it will be up to you, at the end of the day, to decide whether or not you are satisfied that he was on bail and the extent to which, if at all, that influences your decision about whether or not in fact the person who is speaking on those occasions is the accused Mr Dodds. 
        
       
       
        
        It is only relevant for that purpose, however. It is certainly not relevant in any prejudicial way to the accused. You are not entitled to, and I direct you that you must not, form any adverse view of the accused simply because you know or will know that he is a man who is on bail at the time. That is not relevant. You’re not entitled to use it to reason, for example, ‘Well, if he is a person who was on bail, therefore he is a person who’s likely to commit the crime that the Crown says he committed in this trial.’ 
        
       
       
        
        That is not a permissible reasoning on your part. It is not led by the Crown for those purposes. And if you were to do such a thing, you would have ignored the direction I’ve already given you and that I will reinforce later in the trial. That is, that he remains innocent unless the Crown can prove by admissible evidence beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty of the charge that he is facing in this trial, not something that he might have been facing on another occasion that he got bail for. 
        
       
       
        
        Further, you’re not entitled to speculate about what any reference to urine testing might be. No doubt, you’ve already thought about it, but it’s simply not relevant in this trial. It is only connected with other evidence that is anticipated will be called, relevant for you to use to assist you to determine whether or not you’re satisfied that the person speaking about these things was, in fact, the accused Mr Dodds.” 
        
       
      
    38 Directions to similar effect were given during the summing up. 
     
      
    39 Her Honour was of the opinion that by giving these directions any prejudice which might have been occasioned to the appellant by reference to matters of which complaint was made could be adequately addressed. In my opinion her Honour was correct in taking that view. The submission that by admitting this evidence her Honour erred should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 - Reference to killing Pam 
       
      
    40 This ground was expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
      The trial judge erred: 
       
      (a) in allowing evidence to be called before the jury of a conversation about wanting to kill “Pam” and 
       
      (b) permitting the Crown to invite the jury to draw an inference from that conversation that it relates to wanting to burn the Porsche. 
       
      
    41 This ground of appeal relates to a conversation which took place on 27 June 2005. On that day a telephone call between Tuifua, the appellant, Robinson and Niugila was intercepted. It is necessary to relate the whole of that conversation in order to understand the nature of the dispute.

        V2: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V4: ‘Cause that shit plays on my conscience, man, you know, she fuckin’ saying this and that, she’s pregnant and this and blah, blah … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Bullshit. 
        
       
       
        
        V4: … blah. Yeah I’m gunna fuckin’, I’m gunna kill her. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Did she, did she say she’s gunna tell your missus? 
        
       
       
        
        V4: Yeah, yeah, you know what I mean? That’s what … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V4: … I’m saying, you know, she ends up turning, telling my missus and that, start a big drama, so, um, I’m just out here sorting Pam out. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Yeah, you don’t need it hey? 
        
       
       
        
        V4: What? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: You don’t need that shit. 
        
       
       
        
        V4: Yeah I know, I don’t need that shit.

        V2: All right. 
        
       
       
        
        V4: All right, bye. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Bye. (Call concluded).” 
        
       
      
    42 The Crown called evidence from Officer Murray in which he indicated that in his opinion the reference to Pam in the conversation was the reference to the Porsche four-wheel drive vehicle which had been allegedly stolen to commit the armed robbery. As it happens there was also evidence from Sinamoni that the references to Pam were references to a motorcar. There was also evidence before the jury that motorcars were sometimes referred to by the participants in the enterprise by female names.  
     
      
    43 Her Honour determined to admit the evidence in the telephone conversations. She gave as her reasons: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is a voir dire in relation to the admissibility of the whole of a conversation recorded between two of the accused, Mr Dodds and Mr Robinson, and two others on 27th of June 2005 at 10.14 pm, sequence number 3574. 
        
       
       
        
        It is argued that it would be unfairly prejudicial to the accused to allow the conversation into evidence because during the course of that conversation Mr Dodds, speaking to Mr Robinson and others, makes reference to a person called Pam or Pamela and the intention he expresses to kill that person, specifically to set fire to her hair, to take her out and words to that effect. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown seeks to lead this evidence and seeks that the jury draw an inference that the speakers are referring to an intention to dispose of a motor vehicle, more probably than not a black Porsche motor vehicle that had been stolen earlier in the month on 5th of June and that reference to the disposal in those terms was an attempt on the part of the speakers to speak in code so that their real intention could be hidden. 
        
       
       
        
        I accept that during the course of the 121 intercepted conversations between various parties, including these three accused, that will form apart of the Crown case between 7th of May 2005 and 30th of June 2005, each of them has either referred to or been party to a conversation in which various motor vehicles have been referred to either by the use of names, namely female names, some nick names, reference to sexual behaviour or ability, and otherwise personified in a way that gives the impression of the use of a code. 
        
       
       
        
        At least that inference would be available to the jury from those conversations. Clearly enough the calls are in a strict sense ambiguous and on the face of it might well be capable of a meaning, a straightforward meaning, in accordance with what appears on the face of each of the conversations. 
        
       
       
        
        Taken in context, however, I accept that it would be open to the jury to infer over the course of these conversations that the accused referred to motor vehicles in that coded way. 
        
       
       
        
        There was also in the conversations reference to what the jury would be entitled to accept was the theft of the black Porsche from Mosman on 5th of June and references to either the use or disposal of that and other vehicles and also reference to the intended use of that or other vehicles in the commission of what is alleged to be this intended armed robbery and for that matter other offences as well. 
        
       
       
        
        The vehicle, the Crown contends referred to, was referred to as Pam or Pamela. The Crown would call evidence in chief from Detective Murray that during the course of the conversation he had no knowledge of any associate, partner, girlfriend or other acquaintance of any of the accused with the name of Pam or Pamela. 
        
       
       
        
        Further, there was no indication that any of the accused had, during the course of the investigation, committed any offence of violence against a person known as Pam or Pamela, he did not believe that that was about to occur and he is not aware that any such event has occurred. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown, as I understand it, will make it clear to the jury, if this conversation is led, that the Crown does not contend that the words would be capable of being given their face-value meaning by the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        The argument, as I understand it, on behalf of each of Messrs Dodds and Robinson is that the jury may nonetheless not accept the inference contended for by the Crown but might otherwise accept the words at their face value, which would be prejudicial and which may lead to a view that two of the accused were persons capable of that degree of violence which might then be used impermissibly by them to reason towards their guilt in this trial. 
        
       
       
        
        It seems to me in the circumstances of the full context of this conversation and the evidence that the Crown seeks to call from the officer about other investigations that the chance of the jury in fact giving these words their face value meaning is very low. 
        
       
       
        
        In any event, this is not the only conversation in which one or other or all of the accused have referred to, what on the face of it would appear to be, women in a derogatory way, referring to the possibility, on one view of it, of being engaged in some form of group sexual behaviour with one of them and otherwise referring to sexual conduct with these women, if in fact the words can be taken at their face value. 
        
       
       
        
        There is no objection to the admissibility of any of that additional material. It is going to be necessary to direct the jury in relation to those conversations as well that they cannot be prejudiced against the accused in relation to the words they might use or any views they might have contrary to what on the face it might appear to be views expressed by the accused. And they must be directed in careful terms that no matter what they might think of that, it plays no part in, and can play no part in their reasoning in relation to the offence with which they have been charged in this trial. 
        
       
       
        
        It seems to me in the circumstances, this particular conversation is in no different category than all of those others references and that while there is a risk of prejudice it seems to be not unfairly prejudicial to the accused. The evidence clearly has a probative value because it is a further reference to, if the jury accepts it, the stolen motor vehicle which the Crown contends the accused proposed to use to commit the armed robbery; that conversation held only three days before the day on which the Crown alleges the armed robbery was to be committed. In those circumstances I propose to allow the conversation to be played in evidence to the jury along with all of the other conversations. But I will be directing the jury in due course in relation to all of the contents of the conversations to ensure the risk of prejudice is reduced. 
        
       
      
    44 It was submitted that the conversations were equivocal. It was further submitted that because the jury may infer that the conversations referred to an intention to do harm to a female person, which may be understood literally by the jury, prejudice may be occasioned to the appellant and accordingly the evidence should be rejected. That argument was pressed on the appeal. 
     
      
    45 In my opinion the argument is of no substance. Even without the evidence of Sinamoni, but reinforced by that evidence, when it is understood that the participants in the conversation commonly referred to motor vehicles by a female name the inference that the conversation was a reference to a vehicle was available. The inference was supported by evidence from the police officer and from one of the co-accused. In these circumstances the potential for prejudice to the appellant because the jury would assume the reference to Pam was a reference to a person was limited, if it existed at all. 
     
      
    46 The appellant submitted that her Honour made two factual errors in her reasons. Rather than the appellant stating that he wanted to get rid of Pam, as her Honour suggested, it was Tuifua who expressed that intention. Secondly, her Honour understood that Officer Murray was to give evidence to the effect that he had no knowledge of any associate, partner, girlfriend or other acquaintance of any of the accused with the name of Pam or Pamela. In fact his evidence was that he knew the name of the appellant’s partner and the partners of the other accused persons and there were no Pams amongst them. 
     
      
    47 It was further submitted that her Honour fell into error because she did not expose a coherent process of reasoning to support her finding that an inference could be drawn that the conversation related to cars. 
     
      
    48 Apart from the evidence that the alleged conspirators would refer to a car by a female name there are a number of matters referred to in the conversation which suggest that the conversation was not about harming a known person. Firstly, the evidence strongly indicated that the accused were conscious of the possibility of their conversation being recorded. In these circumstances it would be extraordinary if they were to discuss on the telephone an intention of cutting a person’s throat and otherwise occasioning significant harm to them. Furthermore, although Pamela is referred to on occasions as a person, the reference to “everyone firing off at each other and so, just go and take it off this cunt, man … so no one gets it, you know what I mean” is consistent with there being problems between the alleged conspirators with the stolen car which would be resolved by its destruction. 
     
      
    49 To my mind her Honour’s reasons for the admission of this evidence were adequate and appropriate. I am not persuaded that her Honour erred by admitting it into evidence. 
     
      
       
      Difficulties with respect to surveillance 
       
       
      Ground 5 – The trial judge erred in permitting surveillance police to give evidence without revealing their real identity. 
       
       
      Ground 6 – The trial judge erred in allowing the Crown to parade such officers in front of the jury panel; and 
       
       
      Ground 7 – The trial judge erred in admitting a sealed document handed up by counsel for the Commissioner of Police which defence counsel was unable to see. 
       
      
    50 It is also convenient to deal with these grounds together. 
     
      
    51 The Crown initially proposed to call 15 surveillance officers who had been involved in the investigation. This was later reduced to 13. The trial judge was required by s 14(1)(b) of the Law Enforcement and National Security (Assumed Identities) Act 1998, unless the interests of justice otherwise required, to make orders to ensure that the identity of police officers in respect of whom there was in force an assumed identity approval not be disclosed. To effect this purpose her Honour was empowered by s 14(2)(a) of that Act to allow the officers to be identified by number. 
     
      
    52 Section 14 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If, in proceedings before a court, a tribunal or a Royal Commission or other commission of inquiry, the identity of an officer in respect of whom an assumed identity approval is or was in force is in issue or may be disclosed, the court, tribunal, Royal Commission or other commission must, unless it considers that the interests of justice otherwise require:  
         
          
          (a) ensure that such parts of the proceedings as relate to the identity of the officer are held in private, and 
           
          (b) make such orders as to the suppression of evidence given before it as, in its opinion, will ensure that the identity of the officer is not disclosed. 
          
         
         
        (2) In particular, the court, tribunal, Royal Commission or other commission of inquiry:  
         
          
          (a) may allow an officer in respect of whom an assumed identity approval is or was in force to appear before it under the assumed name or under a code name or code number, and 
           
          (b) may make orders prohibiting the publication of any information (including information derived from evidence given before it) that identifies, or might facilitate the identification of, any person who has been or is proposed to be called to give evidence. 
          
         
         
        (3) A person must not contravene an order in force under this section.  
         
        Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 12 months, or both.” 
        
       
      
    53 Her Honour was satisfied that each of the relevant police officers was an officer, in respect of whom an assumed identity approval (was) “in force” within s 14(1) of the Act. She came to this conclusion having regard to the contents of a confidential envelope which contained relevant details in relation to each of these officers. She did not provide counsel access to those details. Making the contents of the envelope available would have disclosed the identities of the officers. Complaint was made that this was an error which occasioned a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    54 Section 14 is provided for the obvious purpose of protecting the identity of relevant law enforcement officers. That their identities should be protected could not be in doubt. Both the safety of the officer and that person’s continuing capacity to operate as an effective “undercover” officer are at risk if the true identity of the officer becomes known. Although there are many categories of information which in the public interest require protection, but which may be disclosed to counsel with appropriate undertakings, the true identity of an “undercover” officer has a particular sensitivity. 
     
      
    55 It is a serious step for a court when making any decision to have regard to material which has not been made available to the parties. Whether that step is appropriate will depend on the nature of the information involved and the issue in the trial to which it may be relevant. If by reason of the non disclosure of the information a party may be inhibited in their defence (if it be a criminal trial) because the information may go to credit or other issues of primary significance, disclosure in some form may be necessary. It may even be that because disclosure cannot be allowed, the absence of the information is sufficiently unfair to an accused person that the prosecution cannot proceed. 
     
      
    56 The nature of the considerations which are relevant when confidentiality is claimed were considered by Smart AJ in Nicopoulos v Commissioner for Corrective Services (2004) NSWSC 562 which was concerned with an issue arising pursuant to s 130 of the Evidence Act 1995. A balance must be struck between the interest to be protected and the right of an accused person to a fair trial. 
     
      
    57 The need for the protection of the identity of relevant officers was emphasised by the Hon J W Shaw, Attorney General, Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Fair Trading when the Bill for the relevant Act was before the Parliament. The Attorney General said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The bill recognises that investigations and operations that require the use of assumed identities can be dangerous. Protections for law enforcement and national security officers, and operations, are needed at every step in the criminal justice process. For this reason, the bill makes provision for the courts to grant that officers may give evidence in private using an assumed name or a code name, and to suppress any evidence that might disclose that officer’s real identity. A breach of the suppression order is punishable by a fine or 12 months imprisonment, or both. The bill also makes it an offence for any person to directly or indirectly disclose any information relating to the provision of documentation in assumed names or to relevant records.” 
        
       
      
    58 In the present case the relevant information was confined to documents which confirmed that the relevant persons were officers in respect of whom there was in force an assumed identity approval. The consequence for the appellant’s trial was that the true identity of the officers would not be disclosed. However, the entirety of their evidence relevant to the issues in the trial was given in public. There was no suggestion, either at the trial, or in the appeal that apart from making plain that they were “undercover” officers the appellant was prejudiced in his trial. Even if they had not been identified as undercover officers it would have been obvious to the jury that they were police who had been assigned to the surveillance of the alleged conspirators by covert means. 
     
      
    59 In these circumstances in my judgment the decision which the trial judge made to withhold the envelope from counsel was appropriate. The public interest in maintaining the anonymity of the witness far outweighed the prejudice if any, and that is difficult to discern, to the appellant by his counsel not being able to satisfy himself that the officers were the subject of assumed identity approvals. The interests of justice did not require her Honour to take any other course. 
     
      
    60 There was one issue which may have required the identity of the officers to be disclosed. Section 38(7)(a) of the Jury Act 1977 requires that jurors be informed of the identity of principal prosecution witnesses so as to avoid prejudice by reason of a knowledge in a juror of a particular person. Her Honour dealt with this problem by asking the officers to stand before the jurors where they could be observed for the jurors to determine whether they were familiar with any of the officers. As it happened no juror was familiar with any officer. 
     
      
    61 It was submitted that by taking this course her Honour’s discretion miscarried. The submission should be rejected. It will be obvious that in circumstances where a person with an assumed identity is to give evidence the jurors must have the opportunity of determining whether that person is known to any of them. Whether this is done by a separate act of asking the officer to stand before the jury or by the jury being invited when the officer gives evidence to indicate whether that person is known to any of them is of little consequence. The jury will be aware that the person’s true identity is not being disclosed. Provided, as occurred in the present case, the jury are instructed that they should not draw any adverse inference from the procedure which was followed, the receipt of evidence in this form is appropriate.  
     
      
    62 There will of course be cases where the true identity of the prospective witness may be significant. This may arise in relation to credit issues or perhaps where a mistake of a particular character is alleged. There will be other cases. In these circumstances the trial judge is required by the legislation to weigh the competing interests. However, when the only concern is to devise a mechanism whereby the jurors can determine whether they are familiar with the person the course taken in this trial is appropriate. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8 – The Trial Judge erred in allowing Officer Justin Murray to have his evidence led in contravention of s 33 of the  
      Evidence Act. 
       
      
    63 The Crown sought to lead evidence from Officer Murray pursuant to s 33 of the Evidence Act 1995. That section provides, inter alia, in s 33(1): 
     
      
       
        
        “A police officer may give evidence in chief for the prosecution by reading or being led through a written statement previously made by the police officer.” 
        
       
      
    64 However, such evidence “may not be so given unless: 
     
      
       
      (a) the statement was made by the officer at the time or soon after the occurrence of the events to which it refers; 
       
      (b) the officer signed it when it was made; and 
       
      (c) a copy was served on the accused person or his lawyer a reasonable time before the hearing of the prosecution’s evidence.” 
       
      
    65 The appellant submitted that the evidence of Officer Murray should not have been admitted as provided by s 33 because his statements were not made “at the time of or soon after the occurrence of the events to which it refers.” 
     
      
    66 Particular objection was taken to the statements of the officer which were made on 30 October 2006, which was about 18 months after the surveillance and investigations were conducted. The other statement relied upon by the prosecution was made on 9 August 2005. This latter statement related to events on and after 1 July 2005. 
     
      
    67 The essential contents of the statement dated 30 October 2006 was a summary of records relating to the interception of telephone calls including the recordings and transcripts tendered in evidence at the trial. Although, of course, the statement was not made at the time that the interception was effected, it was made when the officer reviewed that material for the purpose of giving evidence at the trial. The statement includes the conclusion that it was the voice of the appellant which could be identified as one of the speakers in the telephone call. Accordingly, in the relevant sense the statement was in relation to matters which were contemporaneous to its making. The interception of the relevant calls and the making of the transcript was established by other evidence at the trial. In these circumstances there was no error in her Honour permitting the officer to read from his statement in the course of giving evidence.  
     
      
    68 The statement of 9 August 2005 relates to events on or after 1 July of that year. As with the other statement the statement was made when the officer was reviewing relevant material including the application for the telephone warrants, his own notes and information contained in the police computer database. Accordingly, in the relevant sense the statement was made in relation to matters which were contemporaneous to its making.  
     
      
       
      Ground 9 – the Trial Judge erred when she did not discharge the jury after Ms England of counsel’s outburst in the presence of the jury in relation to the witness Lucas. 
       
      
    69 Ms England of counsel was retained by the Commissioner of Police to protect the Commissioner’s interests during the course of the trial. The Commissioner’s concern related to the need to secure the identity of particular police officers and the methodology used by the police in the course of the investigation. Of particular concern to the police was that evidence of the precise way in which helicopter surveillance was used should not be made public. To this end the trial judge imposed limits on the evidence of Officer Code No 1464 who observed the events of 1 July 2006 from the helicopter. In particular the trial judge ruled that there could be no cross-examination or evidence called in relation to general issues of police surveillance which might reveal the police methodology which her Honour concluded should be protected as matters of public interest immunity. 
     
      
    70 After this ruling had been made Officer 1464 was called. When cross-examined by counsel for Sinamoni a question was asked as to how many other police, apart from Officer 1464, were in the helicopter. Ms England at that point rose in the back of the court and in court dress said loudly “Objection. I press the ruling.” Counsel for one of the accused objected to this course and the jury was asked to retire. 
     
      
    71 The trial judge gave counsel the opportunity to consider the position and counsel for the appellant sought a discharge of the jury. Her Honour declined to take this course but when the jury returned gave them particular instructions in relation to the events which had occurred. Her Honour said to the jury, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “One thing that is very important that you must follow, which I am going to direct you now, is that you must not take it into account in any way whatsoever in relation to this trial. It has nothing to do with this trial, the interruption that occurred. You should ignore it. You certainly should not take it into account in any way adverse to the accused nor, for that matter, in any way either adverse to or favourable to the Crown. It has nothing to do with this trial and you should just now clear it from your minds. Ignore it and get on listening to the rest of the evidence. Can we have the witness back please.” 
        
       
      
    72 After the jury had retired the judge made plain her displeasure with the course taken by Ms England. Her Honour was right to express these views. Knowledge of the number of officers present in the helicopter had no potential to prejudice, either in the particular case or generally, investigations carried out by the police. The trial should not have been interrupted. 
     
      
    73 However, the interruption did not in my view occasion any prejudice to the appellant or his co-accused. No doubt the jury were puzzled by the events and perhaps amused. However, any possibility of prejudice was appropriately and firmly addressed by her Honour’s directions to the jury. They were sufficient to deal with the matter. 
     
      
       
      Ground 10 – The verdict against the applicant was unreasonable and was not supported by the evidence. 
       
      
    74 The appellant submitted that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 6(1). The correct approach to this question by an appeal court has been considered by the High Court on a number of occasions: M v R (1994) 18 1 CLR 487; MFA v R (2002) CLR 606 at 614 at 615. I summarised the relevant principles in R v Habib [2005] NSWCCA 223 and discussed them in Kaliyanda v R [2007] NSWCCA 300. The court’s task is to consider whether upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. The joint judgment in MFA offered the following by way of guidance: 
     
      
       
        
        “The majority in  
        M 
         pointed out that '[i]n most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced'. In such a case of doubt, it is only where the jury's advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence can explain the difference in conclusion about the accused's guilt that the appellate court may decide that no miscarriage of justice has occurred: 
         
         
          
          'If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a  
          significant possibility  
          that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence'[56]. 
          
         
        
       
      
    75 In their conclusion their Honours acknowledge that it is not uncommon for some aspects of the evidence in a trial to be less than wholly satisfactory although juries are usually well able to evaluate conflicts and imperfections of evidence. ""In the end, the appellate court must ask itself whether it considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred authorising and requiring its intervention"" [96]. 
     
      
    76 In my opinion the Crown case against the appellant was compelling. The intercepted telephone conversations both provide evidence of the conspiracy but also of the appellant’s involvement in it. The extracts from the intercepted conversations which I have set out below are of particular significance to the existence of the conspiracy, although it must be recognised that the appellant was not recorded as a speaker in them. However, the fact that the appellant was associating regularly with the participants in these calls at relevant times is undoubted. 
     
      
    77 Where appropriate I have added the translation which the prosecution suggests should be made of words spoken in “code.”

      This conversation took place in May, over a month before the attempted robbery. The prospect of bank robbery is raised. Mr Niuqila emphatically indicates that he does not want to talk about it on the telephone. The main inference is that he was concerned, rightly as it happens, that the phone call may be intercepted.

      This call relates to a stolen car, which has been placed in a secure spot. The appellant’s co-accused discuss selling the car but Mr Tuifua thinks that it should not be sold but that it should be used in the bank robbery.

      It was alleged by the Crown that in this conversation the two co-accused on the evening of 22 June 2005 are discussing whether to keep the car. They decide to wait until it is time to do ‘the one in Blacktown’. This conversation is taking place a little over a week before the attempted robbery.

        V2: Yeah. Go for a walk down there and have a look.

      This conversation indicates that the appellant is aware that Mr Robinson, one of the co-accused, is under police surveillance. He advised Mr Robinson to be careful because the police may not really know what is going on.

        V2: Bye. (call concluded).” 
        
       
       
      In this conversation the appellant is asking the co-accused Tiufua to make sure that he is invited to the ‘party’. The Crown’s case was that the term party was a code word for the bank robbery. I am satisfied that it was. Although the co-accused Tiufua tells the appellant that he is invited, the appellant is concerned and asks the co-accused to make sure.  
       
      
    83 On 27 June 2005 a telephone call between Tuifua, the appellant, Robinson and Niugila was intercepted. The transcript of that call is at [41] above. I am satisfied that the conversation regarding Pam should be interpreted as a conversation about a car, namely the Porsche. This conversation although in code was about disposing of the car.

      This call occurred on the June 29 2006, 2 days before the attempted robbery. The Crown submitted that this is one of several conversations in which the appellant was involved relating to obtaining tools for the robbery. The Crown case was that “the lubricant for the masturbator” was a reference to a weapon or weapons. The next call is seven minutes later:

      The Crown’s case was that this was a further conversation regarding obtaining tools for the robbery. This call occurs at 2:34 am on June 30 2005, the day before the attempted robbery. The appellant says he has difficulty obtaining “thingo” as the person would not wake up. It was submitted by the prosecution that “thingo” was a further reference to a tool to be used in the robbery. Both the appellant and Mr Niuqila agree that the appellant needs to keep ‘buzzing’ and knocking on the door because “[i]f you can’t do it now, then you can’t do it in the morning.” Later, on June 30 2005 at 07:22:25, he says that he has to go back to get the ‘thingo.’ The appellant says that he was not able to obtain the “thingo” earlier because a woman got angry at the appellant for ringing at that time in the morning (see the following conversation).

        V2: All right, so ring me when you back here.” 
        
       
       
      This conversation occurred at 8:21 pm on June 30 2005, the night before the attempted robbery. Once again that appellant is talking about the “thing” and he is worried about driving around with “that shit” too late. In the context of the previous conversations it can be inferred that the appellant is worried about driving around with some implement to be used in the attempted robbery. 
       
      
    87 The evidence of the co-accused Sinamoni strengthened the Crown case. Sinamoni gave evidence-in-chief that when he and others, including the appellant, were talking about Pam that they were talking about a car. He denied that he was present during the attempted robbery but was permitted to give evidence, without objection, in which he said that he recognised the appellant on the surveillance video taken on the morning of the robbery at 28 Boorea Street, Blacktown. He said “It looked like Mr Dodds, but I can’t be one hundred percent certain.” He stated that he had known the appellant for a couple of years before these events giving him the necessary familiarity with the appellant so that his evidence was either factual evidence or the opinion of an ad hoc expert (see the discussion in R v Drollett [2005] NSWCCA 356). 
     
      
    88 The appellant’s DNA was found on a number of items. It was on a left hand glove found inside the red Corolla. In addition it was found on a balaclava that was located in Metella Road, about 60 meters from where the Corolla was found. It was also found on a piece of fabric cut from a T-shirt or garment of that type which could be used to disguise a person’s face. The balaclava found on Metella Road was materially the same as those bought by Messrs Niuqila and Tuifua on 30 June 2005.  
     
      
    89 The identification of the appellant as one of the speakers in some of the telephone calls was made by Officer Murray. His conclusion was based in part on the fact that on 2 June 2005 the police stopped the appellant and Robinson at Double Bay and took their names. In an intercepted telephone call on 4 June 2005 the person identified as the appellant told Tuifua, in a phone call, that he had been pulled over by police. After surveillance had been carried out on the appellant and Robinson on 6 and 7 June 2005 in an intercepted call at 11.42 pm on 7 June 2005 the appellant and Robinson discussed that surveillance. As a result of the discussion Officer Murray terminated the surveillance.  
     
      
    90 In addition to these matters, as I have already related, the appellant was, pursuant to bail granted in Queensland, reporting to the Rocks police station and was subject to a condition that he undergo urine analysis. In an intercepted telephone call at 1.18 pm on 15 June 2005 the person identified as the appellant told Niuqila that he needed to “do a urine tomorrow or something and get the results back up to Queensland by Friday … they’re going to pull my bail.” In a further telephone call at 3.52 on 29 June 2005 the person identified as the appellant asked Tuifua to meet him at The Rocks because he “was late for reporting.” 
     
      
    91 In addition when Sinamoni gave evidence he identified the appellant’s voice on the recording of a telephone call.  
     
      
    92 The conviction was challenged by the appellant for a number of reasons. It was firstly submitted that the evidence of Officer Murray was unreliable. In particular it was submitted that he admitted that he had made a number of witness statements which he said exhausted the matters upon which he would give evidence. However, when giving evidence he spoke of matters not recorded in those statements. It was submitted that the Officer had only a limited prior opportunity to hear the appellant speak and furthermore, that there were errors in the voice attribution of the transcript of the various telephone calls. It was further submitted that his evidence was diminished by the fact that he did not use the services of an independent voice identification expert or use any equipment to make scientific comparisons of the voices. He accepted that there was always room for error in voice identification.  
     
      
    93 With respect to Officer Murray’s evidence in relation to the Pig Latin code it was submitted that he sought no independent assistance with his interpretation of the conversation. It was submitted that there was room for misinterpretation. 
     
      
    94 The officer’s conclusion that “snankos” meant “bank” was also criticised in the manner in which I have already discussed. It was emphasised that there was no other reference to “snankos” or a code for the word “bank” elsewhere in the transcripts of the many conversations. Accordingly it was submitted that even if the phone calls reflected a conspiracy there was no evidence which proved beyond doubt that the conspiracy related to a proposal to rob a bank. 
     
      
    95 It was emphasised that nowhere in the conversations where the appellant could be identified as a participant was there a discussion of matters relevant to the suggested armed robbery. The appellant was not involved in any conversation about obtaining a shortened shotgun. With reference to the conversation where “a masturbator” is referred to, it was submitted that this was ambiguous and could refer to any number of things used for any number of legal purposes. It did not necessarily relate to the alleged enterprise.  
     
      
    96 The appellant emphasised that there were some telephone intercepts where other persons apart from the appellant talk about planning an enterprise. There is discussion of a “job” and how they should get four people to come along. At one point the Crown submitted that the references to the appellant indicated that he would be one of those persons. However, the appellant emphasised that this does not demonstrate that the appellant was aware of what the other conspirators wished him to do. 
     
      
    97 With respect to the stolen Porsche motor vehicle, which the Crown alleged was referred to as “Pam” the appellant emphasised that his DNA was never found inside or outside the vehicle. This was the case notwithstanding that the Crown alleged the appellant was involved in its theft.  
     
      
    98 The appellant further submitted that there was no evidence that the appellant was present on 1 July 2005. None of the surveillance officers identified the appellant as being present. Evidence was given by Constable Amelia Herring that she had previously identified the appellant who appeared to her to be of Aboriginal appearance. No person of that appearance was identified by the surveillance officers as being present on 1 July 2005. 
     
      
    99 Both the video shown to Mr Sinamoni and the recording of his ERISP were in evidence. I have carefully examined both. Although the image on the video is not entirely clear I am satisfied that one person who was recorded as being present was the appellant. His hair cut and profile are important to my conclusion. The image of the appellant recorded on the ERISP would not indicate to an uninformed observer that the appellant is of aboriginal origin. 
     
      
    100 The appellant also criticised the utility of the DNA evidence. Ms Beilby, a DNA expert, indicated that the relevant items contained not only the appellant’s DNA but the DNA of others. This was not surprising as other people would necessarily have handled them at various times. There was no evidence to indicate when the appellant’s DNA may have been deposited on each item. It was submitted that because balaclavas are a common piece of clothing and can be used for riding motorbikes and camping it was conceivable that the DNA had been deposited in some innocent manner. 
     
      
    101 From the telephone calls it can be discerned that in the weeks preceding 1 July the appellant had been in the company of Robinson, one of the co-conspirators on many occasions. He was in Robinson’s blue car, being the same blue car that was seen together with Robinson, in the early hours of 1 July outside Boorea Street. On some occasions in which he had been in the car with Robinson there were phone calls made to the appellant on Robinson’s mobile phone. On those occasions the phone was passed to the appellant. It was in those conversations that the details in relation to the proposed robbery to which I have earlier referred were discussed.  
     
      
    102 The lack of a confirmed sighting of the appellant by someone present on 1 July 2005 requires careful consideration. However, given the efforts by the participants in the enterprise to mask their identities this is not altogether surprising. To my mind the evidence of Sinamoni is significant. It is confirmed by my own examination of the video recording. Of particular significance is the evidence in relation to the DNA on the items retrieved by the police. When all of this evidence is considered together with the transcript of the various conversations I am in no doubt that the appellant was party to the alleged conspiracy. 
     
      
    103 I am also satisfied to the requisite standard that the participants were intent upon robbing the Commonwealth Bank and only because of the intervention of the police did that robbery fail. 
     
      
    104 In my judgment the prosecution proved its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The verdict was open to the jury and was neither unreasonable nor, having regard to the evidence, was it one that cannot be supported. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    105 The appellant was sentenced to a total term of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years. By the time he was sentenced Lee, Niugila and Tuifua had been sentenced. Lee was sentenced to a total term of 6 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months. Niugila was sentenced to a total term of 7 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months. Tuifua was sentenced to an overall term of 6 years and 9 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 10 months. They were sentenced by Norrish DCJ. 
     
      
    106 Sinamoni who was sentenced at the same time as the appellant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years.  
     
      
    107 The appellant submitted that the trial judge made a number of errors when he was sentenced. It was submitted that a number of findings of fact made by the sentencing judge were erroneous. Beyond these matters it was submitted that her Honour placed inappropriate reliance on the guideline judgment in Henry (R v Henry 1999 46 NSWLR 346) and failed to have appropriate regard to previous decisions in relation to sentencing for conspiracies. Finally it was submitted during the course of the hearing of the appeal that the appellant’s sentence was excessive having regard to the sentences imposed on the co-offenders. 
     
      
    108 There were four factual findings which were challenged by the appellant. They were expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) finding as a fact on sentence that the applicant was present on 1 July 2005 in the absence of any evidence in the trial to support such finding; and 
       
       
      (b) finding that the applicant must have known that the firearm was in the sports bag, without reference to making such finding beyond a reasonable doubt and on which evidence such a finding was made; and 
       
       
      (c) finding that the applicant’s DNA was on a balaclava which was found in red Corolla; and 
       
       
      (d) finding that the applicant played an equal role to all of his co-offenders in the conspiracy in the absence of any evidence to support such a finding beyond a reasonable doubt. 
       
      
    109 I have previously reviewed the evidence in the Crown case with respect to the appellant. To my mind each of the findings of fact now challenged was available on the evidence before her Honour. Although there was no evidence from a surveillance officer identifying the appellant as being present on 1 July the inference that he was the person in the Ford Laser was very strong. The finding that the appellant must have known that the firearm was in the sports bag was available having regard to his involvement in the various phone calls and his close association with the co-conspirators during the course of the planning of the event. 
     
      
    110 Having regard to the material in the telephone intercepts and the coordinated participation of each of the co-conspirators in the events of 1 July a finding that the appellant had an equal role in the conspiracy with the other offenders was clearly open to her Honour. 
     
      
    111 Her Honour said that a balaclava with the appellant’s DNA was found in the red Corolla. This was not the case. In fact the balaclava with DNA was found in the gutter in a street nearby to where the red Corolla was pulled over. However, the available inference was that it had been discarded from a vehicle during the course of the attempted and partially successful dispersion of the conspirators following the interception by the police. The error by her Honour in finding that the balaclava was actually in the red Corolla is of no significance. To my mind there is no other explanation of the presence of the balaclava in the location in which it was found but that it was associated with the appellant’s activity as a co-conspirator on the relevant day. 
     
      
    112 When sentencing the appellant and Sinamoni her Honour indicated that she would have regard to the dicta from this Court in Henry’s case. Her Honour concluded that by reason of the criminal record of the appellant, the lack of evidence of any addiction to drugs and recognising that there had been no plea of guilty a sentence greater than that considered in Henry’s case was appropriate for the appellant. There was no error in her Honour’s approach.  
     
      
    113 It is obvious that the nature of the offence contemplated in Henry was in some respects different to that committed by the appellant. Nevertheless Henry involved an armed robbery and it was appropriate for her Honour to be mindful of what this Court said in that case when seeking to establish an appropriate sentence in the present case. Although her Honour referred to Henry she was careful to identify the fact that she was sentencing the appellant and co-offenders for a conspiracy to commit an armed robbery.  
     
      
    114 Her Honour concluded that although the matter was serious it was not a conspiracy at the top end of the range. The serious elements of the offence were reflected in the fact that it was planned over a period of weeks and a sawn-off loaded shotgun was to be utilised. Although the conspiracy was planned her Honour formed the view that it was not planning of a high order, many matters were left to chance. Furthermore there was no evidence of observation of the target premises for any period before the robbery which may have been expected if it had been carefully planned. 
     
      
    115 Her Honour concluded as was clearly the case that the robbery was timed to occur at opening time. This would have imposed a risk to staff but perhaps fewer customers than might have been expected at other times of the day. The target bank was located in an industrial area where it was probable that there would be less pedestrian movement than if it had been in a shopping centre or commercial area. 
     
      
    116 Her Honour was careful to identify the aggravating factors ensuring that she did not have regard to a factor referred to in s 21A which was otherwise an element of the offence. This is particularly important in relation to a conspiracy charge which of its nature involves more than one person. Her Honour was also mindful of the fact that a conspiracy must involve a degree of planning. Her Honour said: “when looked at as an armed robbery simpliciter, that being the indicative way of viewing a conspiracy to commit armed robbery. It is made somewhat more serious because it was a planned bank robbery and there was use of a shortened firearm but this latter consideration I am not entitled to elevate as a consideration more appropriate, because this was not charged as a conspiracy to commit an aggravated armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, and thus care must be exercised to avoid breaching the De Simoni principles” De Simoni v R (1981) 147 CLR 383 at 389; 35 ALE 265 at 268. 
     
      
    117 Her Honour also diminished the objective seriousness of the offence by reason of the fact the robbery did not actually take place. This, of course, was fortuitous and a result of the police intervening. Her Honour accordingly concluded that it was an offence in the middle range of seriousness. 
     
      
    118 The maximum penalty provided for the offence is a term of imprisonment for 20 years. The subjective circumstances of the appellant were recognised by her Honour. He has a lengthy criminal record. At the time of sentencing he was aged 25 but was aged 23 at the time of committing the offence. He has convictions for possessing house breaking implements, goods in custody, possessing a prohibited weapon, motor vehicle offences including larceny and driving offences, malicious damage to property and attempting to steal a motor vehicle. He had previously received prison sentences for larceny of a motor vehicle and a suspended sentence for attempting to steal a motor vehicle. He has also been sentenced for assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty.  
     
      
    119 The psychological evidence indicated that the appellant had a dysfunctional background as a child. Life has not been easy for him. His parents were users of drugs and alcohol to the point of addiction. His father has been in and out of prison. He was raised by his maternal grandparents.  
     
      
    120 The appellant has two children who at the time of sentencing were aged 3 and 12 months. However, he does not live with their mother and appears to have had limited involvement with his daughter.  
     
      
    121 The appellant was expelled from school in Year 8 and although he has done a bar course and a course in spray painting he has never been in continuous employment. He has a previous history of excessive use of alcohol being a binge drinker although her Honour accepted that this was not a problem at the time of sentencing. He has been a user of cannabis, methamphetamines, cocaine as well as heroin. Her Honour found that he had stopped using these drugs before he committed this offence. Her Honour found that the appellant was experiencing stress and anxiety within the prison system. At the time of the commission of the offence the appellant was on bail from the Supreme Court of Queensland for offences including an offence of attempted armed robbery. Her Honour had regard to the fact that he was on bail as an aggravating feature of the offence. 
     
      
    122 Her Honour was also careful to have regard to the remarks on sentence by Norrish DCJ when sentencing Lee, Niugila and Tuifua. Her Honour was careful to consider issues of parity and after carefully analysing his Honour’s remarks concluded that the sentences imposed on Niugila, Lee and Tuifua were based on a starting point of 9 or 10 years which her Honour believed was excessive. Her Honour remarked that sentences of 8 to 9 years are at the very top of the range for offences of armed robbery. She justified this decision by reference to the statistics of the Judicial Commission. 
     
      
    123 There is a potential difficulty with her Honour’s analysis although it does not justify the appellant’s submission in the present case. The offence of armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. Although the statistics may indicate that sentences significantly less than the maximum have been imposed for those offences captured by the statistics this will not define the very top of the range. That is defined by the maximum term. Although consistency in sentencing is of fundamental importance (Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610; 54 ALR 193 at 196) the utility of the statistics collected by the Judicial Commission should not be misunderstood. If, as her Honour concluded, the statistics indicate that sentences greater than 8 or 9 years have not been imposed this may indicate that offences justifying a sentence closer to the maximum have not been recorded. However, the maximum sentence for the most serious offence remains that provided by the legislature.  
     
      
    124 Her Honour ultimately concluded that the sentences imposed by Norrish DCJ were excessive and her Honour was not bound to follow them. Her Honour concluded that being an offence within the middle of the range of seriousness but committed while the appellant was on conditional liberty, and with a history of repeat offending, a sentence greater than that imposed by Norrish DCJ was appropriate. 
     
      
    125 I am satisfied that it was open to her Honour to conclude that the circumstances of this offence were more serious than the offence considered in Henry. The appellant was not a young offender with little or no criminal history and the offence was committed whilst he was on conditional liberty. Her Honour was required to impose a sentence that properly reflected the objective seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence. Her Honour accepted that there was a need for extended supervision of the appellant following his release and accordingly found special circumstances. 
     
      
    126 Having regard to these various matters I am satisfied that the sentence which her Honour imposed was appropriate. It has not been demonstrated that a lesser sentence was warranted or should have been imposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: The trial of the respondent (and a co-accused not involved in the current issues) has been proceeding in the District Court before Norrish DCJ and a jury for over four weeks. It is understood that the closure of the Crown case is imminent. On Thursday 12 March his Honour ruled on objections to the tender by the Crown of evidence concerning three matters, in respect of two of which he upheld the objection and he overruled the objection in favour of admission in respect of a third. Later the Crown advised its desire to approach this Court pursuant to s 5F (3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and a notice of appeal dated 18 March has been filed. The continued hearing of the trial was suspended for the Judge and jury to await the outcome of the appeal. The Court was convened on 20 March in response to the urgency which obviously had been created.  
     
      
    2 Thorough and focussed written submissions on behalf of the Crown and the respondent were supplied which enabled the appeal to be determined without further delay and the assistance received from counsel is acknowledged. The Court ordered that the appeal be dismissed.  
     
      
    3 The respondent has been indicted on four counts of manslaughter following the deaths by drowning of persons who were crewing the yacht Excalibur, which foundered off the coast near Port Stephens. The respondent was a director and the manager of the company which built the yacht. What was described as the primary case for the Crown was that the yacht capsized because its keel had, during manufacture, been horizontally cut and the pieces then welded together whereby the yacht was rendered unsafe for sailing. The Crown alleges that either the respondent made the cut or he delivered the yacht with knowledge of the cut and welding, in either case being criminally negligent.  
     
      
    4 The present appeal concerns evidence in support of what was described the Crown’s alternative case. This can briefly be described as an allegation that the respondent failed to implement adequate supervision and quality control during the construction of the yacht leading to its being delivered by reason of the defect in the keel in a dangerous and unseaworthy state.  
     
      
    5 His Honour rejected evidence sought to be called from persons who had examined the hull some years after the capsize and, by radiography, detected defective welding of aluminium plates which were constituents of the hull. Defects were said to exist in some nineteen of twenty two weld plate sites which had been randomly selected. None of these defects was asserted to have been connected with the defect which caused the keel to fail. The intent of the Crown is to argue that the failure to avoid those defects in manufacture or to detect them when they had occurred, can be used by the jury to demonstrate the failure to implement adequate supervision and quality control, and thereby conclude that such omission led to the failure to avoid negligent activity in cutting and welding the keel or to detect that that had been done to it. I will refer to this material as the first body of evidence. 
     
      
    6 The second body of evidence, which his Honour ruled could be admitted, concerned other defective welding particularly in the area of the rudder housing which was said to be visually identifiable and about which evidence could be given by two welders who attended to some repair when the boat was berthed at Hamilton Island. At the time the boat was near new and it was only some four months old when the disaster near Port Stephens occurred. 
     
      
    7 The owner had contracted for the building of the yacht for the purposes of offshore racing. To be permitted to enter appropriate events the boat needed to comply with requirements set out in the “Blue Book” of the Australian Yachting Federation. As built, it was asserted that certain safety stanchions were inadequate in number and spaced too far apart (by a margin of about 0.1 metres) to comply with Blue Book Regulations. It was not the Crown case that there was manufacturing defect of the kind revealed by the welding shortcomings detected in the x-rays, but it was sought to rely upon the failure to achieve compliance with standards in the Blue Book as further evidence of omission to supervise and exercise quality control. This third body of evidence was also rejected. 
     
      
    8 When upholding the objection to the admission of the first and third bodies of evidence his Honour found that neither was relevant within the meaning of s 55 of the Evidence Act and it was therefore inadmissible pursuant to s 56. He also held that (necessarily assuming for the purpose that, contrary to his finding, the evidence had some degree of relevance) that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the respondent and accordingly would be refused admission pursuant to s 137. 
     
      
    9 It is sufficient for present purposes to deal with the latter. Early in lengthy reasons which his Honour published on 17 March he had identified the risk in these terms (at page 11): 
     
      
       
        
        “In this case, there is a real (the) danger that the jury may conclude that the accused is a ‘sloppy boat builder’ and, as a result, the evidence may be misused to ‘sheet home’ blame so to speak unfairly or improperly.” 
        
       
      
    10 Although his Honour did not return to this particular expression, it clearly represents the antithesis of assumed probative value. Contrary to a Crown submission, it could not be that his Honour was weighing unfair prejudice against a finding that there was no probative value in the evidence, when he was expressing his findings relative to s 137. Plainly there was correctly directed attention to the possible issue when the ruling was made that the second body of evidence would be admitted and the danger of unfair prejudice avoided by appropriate direction. 
     
      
    11 It would seem obvious that multiplying the factors of identified shortcomings in workmanship would increase the chance that direction would not sufficiently avoid the danger that the evidence might be misused to impose blame on the basis of accumulating instances of generally “sloppy boat building”.  
     
      
    12 As above noted, this trial has been in progress for over four weeks. It cannot be doubted that the presiding judge is in an advantaged position to assess the atmosphere of the trial, the apparent strengths and weaknesses of the contentions being advanced by the parties, and, most significantly, the nature and the extent of any risk of unfair prejudice and an estimate of whether it can be avoided by judicial direction. 
     
      
    13 Whilst the title of the part of the Evidence Act in which s 137 appears has been varied to include the expression “mandatory exclusions”, the balancing required by that section has to be performed by the trial judge in the exercise of discretionary judgment. Intervention by this Court can only be attracted if it is shown that the trial judge’s conclusion was wrong or that there has been a miscarriage of the type described in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 449. 
     
      
    14 Miscarriage of discretion has not been shown nor has it been demonstrated that his Honour’s conclusion in relation to the first and third bodies of evidence that there is conveyed a danger of unfair prejudice which outweighs probative value was wrong. For those reasons I joined in the order of the Court on 20 March 2009. 
     
      
    15 HOWIE J: For the reasons given by Grove J I joined in the order dismissing the appeal in this matter. 
     
      
    16 HALL J: I have read and agree with the reasons of Grove J and have nothing to add to them.

      2008/2802 Regina v Paul James Wilkinson (No. 3)  
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT (on waiver by Applicant of client legal privilege - T100) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: I am presently hearing an application by the Applicant, Paul James Wilkinson, to withdraw a plea of guilty entered by him on 12 November 2008 to a charge of murder.  
     
      
    2 A number of documents, including affidavits of the Applicant and reports of medical practitioners, together with the Crown brief, have been tendered on the application. Oral evidence will shortly be adduced on the application for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty.  
     
      
    3 The Crown has raised, at this point, the question of waiver of client legal privilege concerning communications that the Applicant had with his previous legal representatives, Mr Terry Healey of counsel and Ms Frances McGowan, solicitor.  
     
      
    4 The principal issues arising on this application appear to relate to the period 13 October 2008, when I found that the Applicant was fit to be tried, and 12 November 2008, when he entered a plea of guilty to murder. It is the case that Mr Healey and Ms McGowan ceased to be the legal representatives for the Applicant on 15 December 2008, when they were granted leave to withdraw.  
     
      
    5 The affidavit of the Applicant, affirmed on 26 March 2009, reveals a number of communications that took place between him and his then legal representatives in the period from 13 October 2008 to certainly, 12 November 2008. I note that Mr Healey and Ms McGowan continued to appear for the Applicant at sentencing hearings on days between 12 November 2008 and 15 December 2008. I note as well that, contained within exhibit A tab 32 (the statement of the Officer in Charge) are two ERISP interviews dated 16 October 2008 and 21 October 2008 in which the Applicant reveals to police, from time to time, the substance of communications which he had had with his then legal representatives.  
     
      
    6 In addition, there are contained (to a limited extent) within exhibit 4 (a report of Dr Bruce Westmore dated 31 March 2009) and exhibit C (a report of Dr Stephen Allnutt dated 22 March 2009), statements by the Applicant concerning communications which he had with his previous legal representatives.  
     
      
    7 With respect to the question of waiver, counsel for the Applicant, Mr Sutherland SC, has informed the Court that his instructions are not to waive any client legal privilege, except with respect to the communications on the occasions referred to, and the topics referred to, in the affidavit of the Applicant affirmed on 26 March 2009 (exhibit 2). Thus, there is an acceptance by senior counsel for the Applicant that the disclosure by the Applicant of communications with his previous legal representatives, as contained in that affidavit, involve a degree of waiver of client legal privilege.  
     
      
    8 The Crown does not submit that the circumstances of this case result in a type of blanket waiver with respect to all communications between the Applicant and Mr Healey and Ms McGowan from the time that they commenced to act for him in 2005, until the time that they ceased to act for him in December 2008. Rather, the Crown invites a more focused approach, looking at the occasions and topics which are relevant to the present application and in particular, in the period October to December 2008. 
     
      
    9 Whether the approach to be adopted is application of common law principles concerning waiver of legal professional privilege, as stated in Mann v Carnell (1999) 201 CLR 1, or the statutory test in s.122 Evidence Act 1995 (and I consider that the statutory test is the appropriate one), it is common ground, and in my view correct, that there has been waiver by the Applicant of privilege concerning confidential communications with his legal representatives concerning his plea of guilty to murder in the period 13 October 2008 to 15 December 2008.  
     
      
    10 In circumstances where there is an application to change a plea, and where the Applicant seeks to adduce evidence on that application of communications and dealings with former legal representatives, it is common for waiver to be found by Courts, if not accepted without argument by the Applicant. Likewise, where there is an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal challenging a conviction entered following a plea of guilty upon the basis of what is said to be a miscarriage of justice concerning the entry of the plea. In such circumstances, it is not uncommon for the former legal representatives to be called as witnesses on the appeal before the Court of Criminal Appeal.  
     
      
    11 On the present application, the Crown has caused subpoenas to issue to a number of persons, including Ms McGowan, Mr Healey and Ms Rochelle Macredie, a solicitor engaged by Ms McGowan, who is referred to in the affidavit of the Applicant of 26 March 2009.  
     
      
    12 For present purposes, it is sufficient to observe that the hearing may proceed upon the basis that the Court accepts that there is a waiver of client legal privilege concerning communications between about 13 October 2008 and 15 December 2008 between the Applicant and Mr Healey, Ms McGowan and Ms Macredie with respect to the Applicant's plea of guilty to murder. I put it no more precisely than that.  
     
      
    13 Depending upon the questioning of witnesses, it may be that other issues will arise as to whether privilege in earlier communications is waived, or whether other related topics are likewise the subject of waiver. It is not presently necessary, however, to consider those issues which may or may not arise.  
     
      
    14 What I have said, I think, is sufficient to identify the areas in which waiver has occurred for the purpose of the commencement of the taking of oral evidence. If further issues arise in this respect, I will return to the topic, if necessary.

    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Harrison J. 
     
      
    2 HOEBEN J: I agree with Harrison J and the orders which he proposes. 
     
      
    3 HARRISON J: This Court heard the present appeal on 2 September 2008, which was at that time limited to an appeal against conviction that raised five grounds of appeal. The Court reserved its decision. Since that time the appellant has sought leave to raise further grounds of appeal not argued at the hearing of the appeal and to appeal against his sentence as well. The Crown does not oppose a grant of leave to appeal against the sentence but strenuously opposes the application to rely upon further grounds of appeal against conviction. In order to appreciate the nature and extent of the dispute, it is convenient to deal first with the matters that were argued at the hearing of the appeal in this Court and then to deal with the latest applications in the light of what emerges from that consideration. 
     
      
    Background 
     
      
    4 On 18 October 2006 the appellant was arraigned before Williams DCJ and a jury on an indictment charging one count of obtaining a financial advantage by deception under s 134.2 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code (Count 1) and five counts of attempting to obtain a financial advantage by deception under ss 11.1 and 134.2 of the Code (Counts 2 to 6). On 15 November 2006 the appellant was found guilty on all counts except Count 5 upon which they were unable to reach a verdict. 
     
      
    5 On 30 March 2007 the appellant was sentenced in relation to Counts 1 and 2 to 6 years imprisonment to commence on 15 November 2006 and on Counts 3, 4 and 6 to 6 years imprisonment for each offence to date from 15 November 2008. The overall term of imprisonment imposed was 8 years. The appellant was ordered to serve a non-parole period of 5 years and 4 months so that he becomes eligible for release on parole on 14 March 2012. 
     
      
    The Crown case 
     
      
    6 It was the Crown case at trial that during the period from July 2001 to the end of September 2002 the appellant dishonestly made false claims for refunds of GST in Business Activity Statements (""BAS"") submitted to the Australian Taxation Office (""ATO"") in the names of companies controlled by him. In each case the BAS contained false information concerning alleged purchases claimed to have been made that incurred GST. The BAS falsely claimed that the companies had made (usually) capital purchases and that the companies were entitled to a refund of the GST component. The total amount of GST claimed to be the subject of a refund in all charges amounted to $64,450,896. In respect of each purchase with the exception of Count 5 the appellant created false documentation showing that the purchases were made from another company State Debt Recovery Pty Ltd (Counts 1 and 2) or from the appellant himself using a business name Particle Spin Motors (Counts 3, 4 and 6). 
     
      
    7 In the years 2001 and 2002 the appellant used four companies controlled by him as well as the business name in a scheme that the Crown submitted was created for the purpose of defrauding or attempting to defraud the ATO. These companies were Wandsworth Holdings Pty Ltd (later re-named Innes Creighton Nationwide Pty Ltd), which traded under the name ""Newcastle Prestige Property"", State Debt Recovery Pty Ltd, Ozwide Real Estate Pty Ltd and Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd. 
     
      
    8 On about 3 July 2001 the appellant caused a BAS to be lodged with the ATO on behalf of Newcastle Prestige Property (Wandsworth Holdings Pty Ltd) in relation to its business activities between 1 April 2001 and 30 June 2001. That BAS was the subject of Count 1. It claimed that the business had total sales for the period of $1,133,130 including GST with capital purchases of $6,669,829 and non-capital purchases of $17,948. The BAS claimed that the company was owed $607,980 for ""purchases"" (i.e. input tax credits) and that it owed the ATO $103,012 for GST on sales. The net amount claimed as a refund by the company was accordingly $504,968. 
     
      
    9 Following a request by the ATO for supporting documentation the appellant sent it three invoices. One of these was on the letterhead of ""State Debt Recovery Office"" and the address shown was the same as Wandsworth Holdings Pty Ltd. The invoice purported to record the sale to Wandsworth Holdings Pty Ltd of ""10 Source Code in Visual Basic covering Programs in Specification H564/2005-2014"" at a unit price of $543,166.32 totalling $5,431,663.23 plus a GST amount totalling $543,166.32. 
     
      
    10 On 18 July 2001 the ATO authorised the payment of a refund in the sum of $505,103.30 transferred electronically to the account of Wandsworth Holdings Pty Ltd. An amount of $550,000 was withdrawn from that account on 24 July 2001 and deposited into an account in the name of Ozwide Real Estate Pty Ltd. 
     
      
    11 On 20 December 2001 the appellant wrote to the ATO on the letterhead of Ozwide Real Estate Pty Ltd attaching a copy of a completed BAS for that company for the period from July 2001 to September 2001. That BAS was the subject of Count 2. It recorded capital purchases for the company of $3,425,707 with GST on purchases of $311,427.90. There were no sales by the company disclosed for that period. The BAS claimed a refund of $311,428. There was evidence that the appellant later sought to amend this BAS by claiming sales of $572,785 with GST of $57,278.50. The amount claimed as a refund after that adjustment was $254,149. 
     
      
    12 The letter attached an invoice dated 19 July 2001 from ""State Debt Recovery Office"". It was in the same format as the invoice furnished to the ATO by Wandsworth Holdings Pty Ltd. It purported to record the sale to Ozwide Real Estate Pty Ltd of five ""Source code for W2000 . . ."" totalling $3,425,706 with GST of $311,247.90. 
     
      
    13 On 25 January 2002 the appellant telephoned the ATO and spoke to an ATO officer concerning his personal liability for GST under the trading name used by him of Particle Spin Motors. He said that he had an invention that he had sold but that he would not receive the full price until 1 April 2002. He requested that the ATO agree to an arrangement whereby Particle Spin Motors would pay $16M by way of GST on 1 March 2002 and that he would pay the balance of approximately $5.9M on 1 April 2002. On 31 January 2002 the ATO sent a letter to the appellant agreeing to this arrangement. No monies were ever paid pursuant to it. 
     
      
    14 On or about 30 January 2002 the appellant caused a completed BAS for Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd to be lodged with the ATO for the month of January 2002. That BAS was the subject of Count 3. It reported ""capital purchases"" of $168,025,000 with GST on purchases of $15,275,000. There were no reported sales for the company for that month. A refund was sought in the sum of $15,275,000. 
     
      
    15 On 6 February 2002 the ATO asked the appellant to contact it to discuss the January 2002 BAS for Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd. On 8 February 2002 the appellant wrote to the ATO informing it that Particle Spin Motors had developed a Perpetual Motion Motor that it had sold to Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd for $152,750,000 plus GST. A tax invoice was enclosed. It was in the same format as that from State Debt Recovery Office referred to earlier. It was dated 28 December 2001 on the letterhead of Particle Spin Motors. The customer was recorded as Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd and the subject matter was ""Rights to Perpetal [sic] Motor Design"". The cost was stated to be $152,750,000 plus GST of $15,275,000 making a total of $168,025,000. 
     
      
    16 The ATO wrote to Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd on 17 April 2002 seeking documentation to support the claimed refund of GST in the January BAS. The appellant replied in curious terms that appeared designed to enable him to avoid having to show the invention to an ATO field officer by leaving the motor offshore. Further correspondence ensued. In May 2002 an officer from the ATO visited the appellant at his premises. The appellant showed him minutes of meetings of Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd purporting to confirm the legitimacy of the claimed refund. 
     
      
    17 On or about 3 July 2002 two further completed BASs were lodged by the appellant for Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd. One was the April 2002 BAS, which is the subject of Count 4. It reported ""capital purchases"" of $101,200,000 with GST on purchases of $9,200,000. There were no reported sales for the company for that month. A refund of $9,200,000 was sought. The second BAS was for May 2002, which is the subject of Count 5. The May 2002 BAS reported ""non-capital purchases"" of $379,500 with GST on purchases of $34,500. There were no reported sales for the company for that month. A refund of $34,500 was sought. 
     
      
    18 Also on 3 July 2002 five BASs were lodged for Particle Spin Motors. They covered the months from January to May 2002. The April BAS claimed total sales of $101,217,600 including GST and claimed that the ATO was owed $9,201,600 apparently to reflect the supposed capital purchases of Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd in the April 2002 BAS. The second BAS was for May 2002 and claimed total sales of $397,100, apparently to reflect the supposed non-capital purchases of the company in its May 2002 BAS. No monies were ever paid to the ATO calculated in accordance with either BAS. 
     
      
    19 On 25 July 2002 the AFP executed a search warrant at the appellant's home and business premises and certain documents were seized. 
     
      
    20 On or about September 2002 a further BAS was lodged for Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd for the month of June 2002. It was the subject of Count 6. It reported ""capital purchases"" of $441,375,000 and GST on purchases of $40,125,000. There were no reported sales for the company for the month. A refund of the GST amount was sought. 
     
      
    21 Also on 30 September 2002 a BAS for Particle Spin Motors was lodged with the ATO claiming total sales of $441,392,000 including GST. This was apparently intended to reflect the supposed capital purchases in the June 2002 BAS of Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd. 
     
      
    22 On 26 February 2003 the AFP executed further search warrants at the appellant's home and business premises. 
     
      
    23 Apart from documents created by the appellant there was no evidence that State Debt Recovery Office Pty Ltd conducted any form of business activity or had any available funds. It never filed any income tax or BAS returns for the 2001 year despite the fact that it had registered for GST purposes and it never accounted to the ATO for the GST component of any sale or supply of goods. 
     
      
    24 Ozwide Real Estate Pty Ltd had two bank accounts but the bank records revealed that it never had the funds to make million dollar capital acquisitions. There was also no record of any payment of $3,425,707. The sum of $550,000 paid into its account on 24 July 2001 was the only significant amount that it received. 
     
      
    25 Documents recovered pursuant to search warrants included a computer file containing an invoice from Particle Spin Motors to Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd showing a sale to the value of $101,200,000 including GST of $9,200,000 and an invoice dated 30 June 2002 from Particle Spin Motors to Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd showing total sales of $440M including GST of $40,000,000. These invoices were in the same format as that sent to the ATO with the letter dated 8 February 2002. 
     
      
    26 Police also found a copy of a letter addressed to Holman Engineering Pty Ltd dated 2 September 2001. It referred to attached plans. These were in a document entitled ""The TOC Pulsed Electric Motor Generator"". It was identical to Exhibit CV which was material downloaded from the Internet by an ATO officer relating to an invention by a person named Adams. He had supposedly invented a ""free energy machine"" that converted the perpetual motion of sub-atomic particles, known in physics as ""particle spin"", into conventional electric power. 
     
      
    27 Also located by police were a number of what were alleged to be bogus records apparently created to give an impression of authenticity to the alleged transactions between Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd and Particle Spin Motors. These included minutes of a meeting attended by fictitious persons and entries recording events that did not take place. Another computer document found by police at the appellant's premises suggested that Particle Spin Motors had substantial funds available to it in a cash management account at Sandford Securities and a share portfolio with a value of $163M. However, no such account existed in fact. The appellant had at one time invested something in the order of $50,000 with Sandford Securities but the account was closed on 14 August 2000. There was no documentary or other evidence at the trial as to what the alleged ""non-capital purchases"" were in May 2002, apart from the similarity in amounts in the May 2002 BAS lodged for Particle Spin Motors. 
     
      
    The defence case 
     
      
    28 The appellant did not give evidence at his trial. His case was presented through cross-examination of Crown witnesses and closing argument. It was the appellant's case at trial that the Crown had failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the transactions that resulted in GST refund claims were false. The appellant argued that the relevant businesses undertook their GST accounting on an accruals basis so that GST credits and liabilities were reportable and payable from the time when transactions were entered into. Payment towards settlement of the transaction did not need to occur in the relevant GST reporting period so that bank statements, which appeared to disclose an incapacity on the part of the purchasing businesses to complete the transactions in the relevant periods, did not conclusively establish that the transactions were false. 
     
      
    29 It was also argued that the Crown had failed to establish that the transacted computer software property, relevant to Counts 1 and 2, had no intrinsic value. Investigators had failed to conduct an exhaustive analysis of the software stored on the appellant's computer and so could not exclude the reasonable possibility that he possessed source codes that had commercial value. He argued that the evidence supported the inference that he had the means to carry out commercial software development. 
     
      
    30 The appellant also argued at trial that the Crown had failed to establish that the transactions involved in Counts 3 to 6 were not genuine. The appellant also emphasised that a reconciliation of the figures in the BASs of Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd and Particle Spin Motors left the appellant with a net taxation liability. He argued that this founded an inference that he did not intend to obtain a financial advantage from the ATO. Furthermore, there had been no attempt to disguise the appellant's connection with any of the business entities involved in the transactions, thereby supporting an inference that the appellant had no intention to engage in fraudulent activities and that the transactions were genuine. 
     
      
    Grounds of Appeal 
     
      
    31 The appellant originally appealed against his conviction pursuant to s 5(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. There were three original grounds of appeal: 
     
      
      1. The trial judge erred by failing to give the jury an  
      Edwards 
       direction. 
       
       
      2. The trial judge failed to put the defence case to the jury in his summing up. 
       
       
      3. The trial judge's directions on attempt were inadequate and involved error. 
       
      
    32 On 14 January 2008 the appellant sought to rely upon two further grounds of appeal: 
     
      
      4. The trial was unfair by reason of trial counsel's failure to apply for, and the trial judge's failure to grant, separate trials in respect of Counts 1 and 2, and Counts 3 to 6. 
       
       
      5. The trial judge erred when he directed the jury that as a matter of law the Commissioner of Taxation was not [sic:  
      was 
      ] a Commonwealth entity. 
       
      
    Ground 1 
     
      
    33 The appellant argued that the allegedly false documentation and statements made to ATO officers supporting the existence of the transactions said to give rise to the claimed refunds in the BAS material constituted ""post offence conduct"". As such they were said to be analogous to lies told by an accused after the offence and should therefore have been the subject of an Edwards direction to the jury. The appellant submitted that this followed because the Crown had substantially relied upon evidence of post offence conduct that was motivated by a consciousness of guilt. The appellant contended that the evidence was analogous to the false alibi cases where the accused has lied to prevent discovery of the offence. 
     
      
    34 The appellant referred to Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; (1998) 197 CLR 316 at 333 n [59] where Gaudron and Gummow JJ identified the four key elements of an Edwards direction as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""So far as is presently relevant, it was held in  
        Edwards 
         that, where a lie is relied on to prove guilt, the trial judge must first identify the lie, and the circumstances and events relied on by the Crown to indicate that it constitutes an admission against interest. Secondly, the jury must be told it may take the lie into account only if satisfied, having regard to those circumstances and events, that the lie reveals the accused's knowledge of the offence charged or an aspect of it. Thirdly, the jury must be told that there may be reasons other than realization of guilt why the accused told the lie. Fourthly, the jury should then be told that if it accepts the lie was told for a reason other than realization of guilt, it cannot regard the lie as an admission against interest: [1993] HCA 63; (1993) 178 CLR 193 at 210-211 per Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ."" 
        
       
      
    35 The appellant's argument is erroneous. According to the evidence, the so-called false documentation was either produced by the appellant to the ATO officers to support one of the claimed refunds or was found located at his premises during the execution of search warrants. In either event the false documentation was created as part of the appellant's efforts to convince the ATO of the genuineness of the transactions said to give rise to the entitlement to the refunds. Similarly, the lies told to the ATO by the appellant were told as part of his endeavours to convince the ATO of the authenticity of the claim for the refunds. The creation of the documents and the telling of the lies were not post offence conduct and were not analogous to lies told by an accused after the offence. It had nothing to do with the subject matter of an Edwards direction. 
     
      
    36 Moreover, the Crown did not use the false documentation in some indirect fashion, as the appellant contended, to demonstrate a ""consciousness of guilt"" or corroboration of guilt. No such suggestion was made during the trial. The Crown set out to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the documentation said to evidence the transactions was bogus, as were the claims made by the appellant to ATO officers, and to establish that there were in fact no transactions. It was the Crown case that as there were no transactions there was no proper basis for any of the claimed refunds of GST and that the claims were therefore necessarily made dishonestly. The trial judge was not asked by either party to give an Edwards direction because the circumstances for such a request had not arisen. 
     
      
    37 There were no circumstances in this case that called for the trial judge to give an Edwards direction. 
     
      
    38 Reliance upon this ground requires leave under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. The appellant submitted that leave should be granted because the evidence was important to the Crown case and featured heavily in the Crown's closing arguments. Counsel for the appellant sought to advance arguments at the trial that would have been complemented by an Edwards direction. Furthermore, counsel for the appellant at trial was not ""very experienced"" and had not practised ""extensively in the criminal law"". 
     
      
    39 Having regard to the view I have formed about this ground of appeal, it is strictly unnecessary to express an opinion about whether or not leave should be granted.  
     
      
    Ground 2 
     
      
    40 In Healey v R [2006] NSWCCA 235, Smart AJ (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) said at [62]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[62] There is a substantial body of authority that a summing-up must put the defence case fairly and adequately to the jury. The jury must be given an adequate opportunity of understanding and giving effect to the defence and the matters relied upon in support of the defence. See  
        Stokes v The Queen 
         (1960) 105 CLR 279 at 284,  
        R v Sukkar 
         [2005] NSWCCA 54 at [93] and the cases there cited."" 
        
       
      
    41 At pages 1 and 26 of his summing-up the trial judge expressly stated that he did not intend to review the arguments of counsel. The appellant submitted further that when the trial judge did comment upon the defence case he did so for the purpose of explaining why it could not succeed. The principal argument in the defence case in relation to Counts 3 to 6 was that it was open to the jury to find that: 
     
      
      (a) The appellant lodged countervailing BASs on behalf of Particle Spin Motors that acknowledged GST liabilities for the relevant transactions; 
       
       
      (b) These amounts exceeded the corresponding GST claims of Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Ltd; 
       
       
      (c) The BAS figures supported the inference that the appellant ultimately stood to lose money once the payments were made; 
       
       
      (d) In these circumstances it could not be established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to obtain a financial advantage. 
       
      
    42 The appellant contended that those aspects of the defence case should have been, but were not, summarised and left to the jury. They put in issue the question of whether or not the prosecution had established the requisite intention and dishonesty on the part of the appellant in relation to Counts 3 to 6. 
     
      
    43 In support of his argument the appellant drew particular attention to a passage from the trial judge's summing-up at pages 28 and 29 as follows in the course of which the appellant submits his Honour directed the jury to reject the defence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any or all of those transactions were sham transactions, then it does not matter, for the purposes of the offence, that Particle Spin Motors and Mr O'Meara, who trades as Particle Spin Motors, might have submitted a countervailing business activity statement in which he owed the same amount or virtually the same amount to the tax office because Mr O'Meara's charged with attempting to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage from the Australian Tax Office by submitting a BAS for Semiconductor Motor Corporation, the benefit would go to Semiconductor Motor Corporation Pty Limited, and if that attempt had been successful and Semiconductor Motor Corporation received the refund, then if the process was based on a sham and you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in that regard, then that refund would have been dishonestly obtained by him for the company."" 
        
       
      
    44 The appellant complained further that a redirection provided by the trial judge at the request of counsel for the appellant, in combination with the earlier passage, only served further to confuse the issue as to whether the appellant actually had a defence. It was at page 35 of the summing-up in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Now, I said to you that that factor that the countervailing Business Activity Statement was lodged does not mean to say that an offence of obtaining an advantage for Semiconductor Motor Corporation has not been established, but it is a matter that you can consider on the question of whether Mr O'Meara intended to obtain a financial advantage in those circumstances. Okay?"" 
        
       
      
    45 The appellant submitted that these directions fell short of the requirement of a trial judge to ""put the defence case fairly and adequately to the jury"". 
     
      
    46 In my opinion there is no substance in this ground. If the jury were satisfied that there was no underlying transaction, and therefore no basis for refunds of GST, the subsequent repayment of a sum equivalent to the refunds obtained, or a promise to do so, would not constitute a defence to these counts. The passages in the trial judge's summing up upon which the appellant relies correctly informed the jury that the issue of whether or not the transactions were a sham was the essential issue for it to decide. Both the Crown and the defence comprehensively examined the evidence in addresses. It was in those circumstances unnecessary for the trial judge to refer again to those facts at length in his summing-up. 
     
      
    47 No complaint was made by defence counsel at the trial about these matters. Rule 4 applies. Although strictly irrelevant having regard to the view I have formed, I would not otherwise have granted leave to argue this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    Ground 3 
     
      
    48 The appellant submitted that the directions on attempt were inadequate for three reasons: 
     
      
      (a) At the time the direction was given, the jury was not instructed that the Crown had to prove the appellant's intention to commit the completed offence. A more complete direction on intention was given later after a complaint by defence counsel. 
       
       
      (b) The direction erroneously and confusingly introduced the fault element of recklessness, contrary to s 11.1(3) of the  
      Criminal Code Act. 
       
       
      (c) The direction did not adequately explain that the Crown had to establish conduct by the appellant that was immediately connected with, and which could not reasonably be regarded as having any purpose other than, the commission of the offence. 
       
      
    49 The relevant portion of his Honour's summing-up was at pages 12 to 14 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""For conduct on the part of Mr O'Meara to constitute the crime of an attempt in regard to [Counts 2 to 6], the conduct the Crown relies on must be something more than conduct that is merely preparatory to the committing of an offence or the offence in question and it is a question of fact for you, the jury, to determine whether in any particular case an attempt has been made. So that in regards to counts (2) to (6) one thing that you would have to be satisfied of beyond reasonable doubt is that in each case Mr O'Meara did something that was more than preparatory to committing the alleged offence. It would have to be more than preparatory in order to constitute an attempt within the Commonwealth criminal law . . .You have to be satisfied that whatever was done in counts (2) to (6), constituted an attempt, that is it was more than merely preparing to commit a crime, that it was something that was done beyond that. 
         
         
        Now apart from the fact that there is an attempt in the charges, an attempt in charges (2) to (6), apart from that issue, the legal ingredients for each charge are the same. They are that Mr O'Meara did firstly by a deception, secondly dishonestly, thirdly obtain, or in the case of attempt, attempt to obtain a financial advantage, and fourthly from a Commonwealth entity. . . The words ""by a deception"" simply means that a person puts forward something said to be true when it is in fact not true and that is done intentionally by the person or done recklessly by the person. 
         
         
        Now I do not think you need in this particular case to worry about the question of recklessness but if a person acts intentionally or recklessly in that way that constitutes a deception, and a person has an intention to do something if they mean to do it. Intent and intention are very familiar words and they carry their normal meaning. Intention can be inferred or deduced from the circumstances in which an act or acts take place or from the conduct of an accused person. When you are considering the question of intention in respect of each of these matters the intention is the intention of the accused, not what your intention might have been had you been in this position, nor the intention of any theoretical person. So it is important to remember that. So by a deception simply means that intentionally or recklessly a person means to put forward something said to be true when it is [in] fact not true."" 
        
       
      
    50 With respect to the first contention, the ""complaint"" referred to above was in fact a direction sought by defence counsel in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        "". . .your Honour should direct the jury that they should be satisfied that Mr O'Meara had the intention to engage in the conduct which was to obtain the financial advantage."" 
        
       
      
    51 The further directions that were given to the jury were given by way of a reminder of what they had already been told, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Now you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr O'Meara in each case intended, that is intended or meant to obtain the financial advantage that he either did obtain or that he was trying to obtain . . ."" 
        
       
      
    52 There is in my opinion no inadequacy to be found in his Honour's summing-up on this basis. An essential element of the principal offence was the obtaining of a financial advantage. This was apparent from his Honour's summing-up and it was made plain by his Honour that it also constituted a necessary element in the attempt counts. His Honour's directions were neither inadequate nor erroneous in this respect. 
     
      
    53 With respect to the contention that his Honour's direction erroneously or confusingly introduced the fault element of recklessness, the appellant relied upon the terms of s 11.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        11.1 Attempt 
          
         
         
        (1) A person who attempts to commit an offence is guilty of the offence of attempting to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence attempted had been committed. 
          
         
         
        (2) For the person to be guilty, the person's conduct must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence. The question whether conduct is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence is one of fact.  
         
         
        (3) For the offence of attempting to commit an offence, intention and knowledge are fault elements in relation to each physical element of the offence attempted."" 
        
       
      
    54 The appellant contended that one effect of this provision is that recklessness will not suffice as a fault element in relation to a physical element of an attempt offence. It was also contended that his Honour omitted to direct the jury on the requisite intention at the time he was directing the jury on attempt, that he limited the direction on intention to the element of deceptive conduct and only belatedly expanded the intention direction to address the object of the offence, and wrongly introduced the fault element of recklessness which he failed adequately to correct in a way that removed it from the jury's consideration.  
     
      
    55 The appellant re-emphasised that the failure by the Crown to establish the requisite intention on the part of the appellant had been an important part of his case and submitted that an absence of clear directions on the fault element of the attempt counts had caused the trial to miscarry. That submission is said to be reinforced by earlier contentions that the trial judge did not adequately put the defence case. The appellant submitted that the summing-up did not discharge the basic responsibility of identifying and communicating to the jury what the real issues at the trial were in light of the applicable law. The appellant also contended that the trial judge omitted to instruct the jury that to constitute an attempt, the relevant conduct had to be immediately rather than remotely connected with the offence and could not reasonably be regarded as having any purpose other than to commit the particular crime. 
     
      
    56 In my opinion his Honour's summing-up to the jury on the issue of attempt was perfectly adequate. The appellant's submissions, with one exception, amount in effect to a semantic critique of his Honour's chosen words with a view to finding fault. The difficulty with this approach, in this case, however, is that there is none. For example, his Honour repeatedly told the jury that the conduct of the appellant had to be more than merely preparatory to committing the alleged offence. No other explanation of that concept was required as his Honour also noted. Furthermore, there was also no difficulty with any notion of proximity of the appellant's conduct to the completed offence. The only factual difference between the attempts and the completed offence was that in the case of the attempt counts the appellant did not succeed in obtaining the GST refunds that he sought. 
     
      
    57 The exception to which I have referred relates to the appellant's arguments on the issue of recklessness. The Crown submitted that the intention to commit the crime created by s 134.2 does not necessarily include the state of mind of an accused person as to the nature of the deception involved in that crime. Section 134.2 provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        134.2 Obtaining a financial advantage by deception 
          
         
         
        (1) A person is guilty of an offence if:  
         
         
          
           
          (a) the person, by a deception, dishonestly obtains a financial advantage from another person; and  
           
           
          (b) the other person is a Commonwealth entity.""  
          
         
        
       
      
    58 The Crown argued that there was no barrier provided by s 11.1(3) or otherwise to prevent a person from being convicted of an attempt to commit an offence against s 134.2 where the alleged deception involved in the offence was, or was intended to be, a deception that was known to be either false or where there was a substantial risk that it was or would be false in accordance with the definition of recklessness in s 5.4. That definition is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        5.4  
         Recklessness  
         
         
        (1) A person is reckless with respect to a circumstance if:  
         
         
          
           
          (a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists or will exist; and  
           
           
          (b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk.  
           
          
         
         
        (2) A person is reckless with respect to a result if:  
         
          
           
          (a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the result will occur; and  
           
           
          (b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk.  
          
         
         
        (3) The question whether taking a risk is unjustifiable is one of fact.  
         
         
        (4) If recklessness is a fault element for a physical element of an offence, proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness will satisfy that fault element."" 
        
       
      
    59 Intention is also defined in s 5.2 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        5.2 Intention 
          
         
         
        (1) A person has intention with respect to conduct if he or she means to engage in that conduct.  
         
         
        (2) A person has intention with respect to a circumstance if he or she believes that it exists or will exist.  
         
          
         
        (3) A person has intention with respect to a result if he or she means to bring it about or is aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events."" 
        
       
      
    60 More particularly s 5.1 refers to the fault element of offences in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        5.1 Fault elements  
         
         
        (1) A fault element for a particular physical element may be intention, knowledge, recklessness or negligence.  
         
         
        (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent a law that creates a particular offence from specifying other fault elements for a physical element of that offence.""  
        
       
      
    61 In my opinion there is no room for the appellant's contention that one effect of s 11.1(3) is that recklessness will not suffice as a fault element in relation to a physical element of an attempt offence. No authority is cited for such a proposition. It does not follow as a necessary result from a reading of these quoted provisions or some of them. There is no logical or persuasive reason why it should be so. In any event, even if there were error in his Honour's summing-up in the respect alleged, any such error would not amount to or constitute a miscarriage of justice in the trial process for the reason that the deceptive conduct of the appellant in attempting to obtain the refunds was manifest and clearly intentional. Moreover, his Honour expressly told the jury that he did not think that they needed to worry about the question of recklessness ""in this particular case"". It was never suggested that the appellant did act recklessly and if anything his Honour's reference to it was more likely to have detracted from the Crown case than the other way around. 
     
      
    62 This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
    Ground 4  
     
      
    63 This ground has no merit. No application was made for a separate trial of any of the counts on the indictment. There was a close relationship between the facts and circumstances of all counts and a proper and compelling basis for their joinder in the indictment. The fact that the trial judge ruled that a tendency notice issued by the Crown did not comply with s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 and that it could not use certain evidence as constituting tendency evidence did not mean that there was no longer a proper basis for the joinder of all six counts. Each party at trial addressed each of the counts separately and referred to evidence that was said to be relevant to them. In addition, the documentary evidence tendered during the trial had been physically divided into six separate parts, one for each count. The evidence on Count 5 was different to the evidence in relation to the other counts in a significant respect and the fact that the jury was unable to reach a verdict on Count 5 is a convincing illustration that it actually treated each count separately. No unfairness attended the way in which the counts were tried in this respect. 
     
      
    64 This was not a situation where the concerns brought forward by Howie J in R v El-Hayek [2004] NSWCCA 25; (2004) 144 A Crim R 90 at par [29] apply. 
     
      
    Ground 5 
     
      
    65 For an offence against s 134.2 to be made out, the person from whom the financial advantage must be obtained has to be a ""Commonwealth entity"". The charges in the indictment particularised the Commissioner of Taxation as the relevant Commonwealth entity. The Commissioner of Taxation is appointed by the Governor-General under s 4 of the Taxation Administration Act 1958 (Cth) and has the responsibility for the general administration of that Act. 
     
      
    66 The trial judge outlined the elements of the offences to the jury and at page 13 of his summing-up said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        "" . . . and fourthly from a Commonwealth entity. Now as a matter of law the Commissioner of Taxation is a Commonwealth entity, and I do not really need to say any more about that, but that is a matter that you have to be satisfied of beyond reasonable doubt"". 
        
       
      
    67 I consider that his Honour's direction was accurate and appropriate. The appellant argued that there was nothing about the position held by the Commissioner of Taxation that would support a conclusion that it was coterminous with the expression ""the Commonwealth"". He contended that for his Honour's direction to the jury to have been correct, the Commissioner of Taxation must be a Commonwealth entity, which is defined in the dictionary to the Criminal Code to mean the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority. As a Commonwealth authority is defined to mean a body established by or under a law of the Commonwealth, the appellant argued that it related only to bodies and not to persons and could not therefore extend to apply to the Commissioner of Taxation who is a person but, according to this argument, is not a Commonwealth entity. However, this argument does not properly take account of the fact that the dictionary also says that ""person"" includes a Commonwealth authority that is not a body corporate. Accordingly, the person who is the Commissioner of Taxation is a Commonwealth entity. 
     
      
    68 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    Subsequent events 
     
      
    69 As already noted, after the hearing of the appeal, the appellant sought to raise further grounds of appeal. This occurred in the following way. 
     
      
    70 After the hearing of the appeal the appellant forwarded a document to the Registry on 18 September 2008 that purports to be a Notice of Application for Extension of Time for Notice of Appeal or Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal. The appellant gave the following information as reasons why leave should be granted: 
     
      
       
        
        ""1. Had the Crown advised the court of trial that an assessment, relevant to the proceedings, had issued, section 59 of the  
        Taxation Administration Act 
         1953 would have been ignited. Section 59 would have prohibited the Crown making out the case which it did at trial, that is, a case contrary to the facts in that assessment. 
         
         
        A challenge to facts in an assessment cannot be made in any court outside the  
        Administrative Appeals Tribunal. 
         
         
        At trial the Crown did not advise the court of trial that such an assessment had issued. 
         
         
        2. By letter dated 7 July 2008, Raelene Vivian, Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, has now advised that at least one, and possibly three relevant assessments had issued. That advice was received after the date ordered that the appellant's submissions be filed in the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
         
         
        3. The failure to advise that an assessment had issued is, prima facie, suppression of evidence, a serious indictable offence under s 317 of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900.""  
        
       
      
    71 This document was accompanied by others including a document entitled ""Submissions in support of Grounds of Appeal"". The document contained no grounds of appeal per se but did contain two subheadings that were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""1. The Crown suppressed conclusive evidence at trial. 
         
         
         2. The trial was a nullity."" 
        
       
      
    72 The submissions apparently in elaboration of the first complaint were to the effect that assessments issued by the Commissioner were incapable of dispute in any court other than the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and that therefore, in the absence of a determination from it to the contrary, the assessments were ""conclusive evidence"" that the transactions – i.e. the taxable supplies - upon the basis of which they were prepared were genuine. The appellant submitted that as a consequence ""the countervailing transactions in Count 3, the creditable acquisitions, could not, to be consistent, be sham transactions, and never occurred, as was the Crown case"". 
     
      
    73 However, this does not follow as a matter of course. The transactions that formed the basis of the charges were alleged by the Crown to be fundamentally false. The subject matter of the charges was the transactions, not the assessments. The assessments that were issued by the ATO based upon these false transactions did not operate to convert them into genuine transactions. By the same token, corresponding assessments issued by the ATO adjusting the net liability of the appellant or his companies for GST that were themselves calculated by reference to the original assessments would give the underlying transactions upon which they were based no greater validity than they would otherwise have. The appellant's argument is no more than an attempt to suggest that there is an inconsistency between his conviction and the existence of assessments issued by the ATO on the assumption that the relevant transactions were not shams. The appellant's argument is circular. It ignores the fact that the assessments that were issued were the result of the deception forming an essential element of the offences for which he was convicted. 
     
      
    74 The submissions apparently in elaboration of the second complaint refer to the fact that the indictment was signed by Elizabeth Jane Ryan, a person supposedly authorised by the Director of Public prosecutions under s 9(2) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth) (""the DPP Act""). Section 9 only provides for such authorisation where the Director has instituted the prosecution. The appellant contends that the prosecution was instituted by Federal Agent Patrick Bernard Lott and that ""[A]t some later point, the Director appears to have taken over the proceedings"". The appellant says that he was not notified of that fact. The appellant contends that there is no power for the Director to delegate the authority to sign an indictment where the proceedings have been taken over. The letter of authorisation produced as authority for Ms Ryan to sign the indictment is said to be specific, and limited, to s 9(2)(b) prosecutions, and gives no authority to sign indictments in s 9(3) prosecutions. According to this analysis, Ms Ryan had no authority to sign the indictment so that the trial was a nullity. See R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 281; (2005) 64 NSWLR 10.  
     
      
    75 In my opinion it is unnecessary to consider these submissions. It will be apparent that none of these submissions was available to the Crown at the time of the hearing of the appeal in this Court and no argument was presented to the Court on these topics on behalf of either the appellant or the Crown. The Crown's attitude to the reception of these late submissions is discussed later in these reasons.  
     
      
    76 However the contention is in any event without foundation. Proceedings against the appellant for the offences for which he was ultimately convicted were commenced by court attendance notices returnable on 18 January 2005. The person named as prosecutor on two of the notices was Federal Agent Lawson and Federal Agent Lott for the balance. The Commonwealth DPP carried on those committal proceedings pursuant to the function conferred on the Director by s 6(1)(e) of the DPP Act from the time of the first return of the notices until the time when the appellant was committed for trial on 10 October 2005. Following the appellant's committal to the District Court at Sydney, the Director maintained carriage of the appellant's prosecution on indictment pursuant to the Director's function conferred by s 6(1)(a). 
     
      
    77 Elizabeth Ryan, the Senior Assistant Director, found an indictment against the appellant on 18 September 2006. A copy of the indictment is in the papers provided to this Court on the appeal. The indictment was presented at the appellant's trial. At the time of finding the indictment Ms Ryan held a delegation in writing from the Director in relation to the Director's functions under s 6(1). The indictment complies with the requirements of s 9(2)(b) of the DPP Act. 
     
      
    78 Subsequently, by letter dated 30 September 2008 the appellant forwarded to the Registry a document entitled ""Supplementary Submissions"". It was received on 13 October 2008 and makes a series of what are described as ""Further Submissions"" under the following headings:  
     
      
      1. The Crown suppressed conclusive evidence at trial. 
       
       
      2. The trial was a nullity. 
       
       
      3. The trial court was not informed of the applicable legislation. 
       
       
      4. The Crown suppressed relevant evidence (in addition to the conclusive evidence suppressed). 
       
       
      5. The indictment. 
       
       
      6. The appellant's conduct was not voluntary. 
       
      
    79 Finally, by letter to the Registrar dated 21 October 2008, the appellant forwarded what he described as ""further submissions in the appeal"". He requested that at the hearing of his appeal, which by that time had been heard some seven weeks earlier, a file in the Common Law Division be made available to the Court. Those proceedings would appear to be proceedings commenced by the appellant in the Administrative Law List seeking relief against a series of defendants including the trial judge. No other details of the proceedings are given. No reference to this file or the proceedings to which it relates was made at the hearing of the appeal. 
     
      
    80 The ""Supplementary Submissions – 2"" (as they are called) are expressed to be ""further to the appellant's submissions dated 18 September 2008, and the appellant's supplementary submissions"". They are set out under the single heading ""The indictment"" and purport on their face to be in further elaboration of the appellant's earlier submissions made under that heading on 30 September 2008. 
     
      
    81 Each of the appellant's latest submissions is discursive, repetitive and unstructured. They raise matters that were not the subject of argument at the hearing of the appeal. It will again be apparent that none of these submissions was available to the Crown at the time of the hearing of the appeal in this Court and no argument was presented to the Court on these topics on behalf of either the appellant or the Crown. 
     
      
    82 The Crown's attitude to all of the appellant's further submissions relating to his conviction was the same. It is only in the most compelling circumstances that an appellate court would or should grant leave to a party to raise a further ground of appeal after the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal. See generally R v Elliott and Blessington [2006] NSWCCA 305; (2006) 68 NSWLR 1; Elliott v R, Blessington v R [2007] HCA 51; (2007) 234 CLR 38. The Crown submitted that it was almost inconceivable that circumstances could arise whereby an appellate court would permit an appellant in person to have a second hearing of grounds of appeal abandoned at the original hearing by that party's counsel, at a time when the Court has reserved its consideration of the grounds of appeal argued at the original hearing. 
     
      
    83 According to the Crown's submissions, there is nothing exceptional or compelling in the material submitted by the appellant to warrant or to justify the Court entertaining the appellant's application to argue new and potentially far-ranging matters at this stage. In contrast, there are cogent reasons why this Court should not entertain the application. Principal amongst those is said to be the fact that the appellant's then counsel abandoned most, if not all, of the matters now sought to be raised prior to the hearing of the appeal. The Crown submitted that the appellant's further proposed submissions were both unintelligible and lacked merit. The Crown went as far as to suggest that the fact that the appellant has adopted the course of raising all these further matters only after the appeal has been heard demonstrates that he is acting vexatiously and in abuse of the process of the Court. 
     
      
    84 The Crown's general submission was that in the circumstances of this case the Court should simply refuse leave to the appellant to raise any further matters on the conviction appeal. In my opinion that submission should be accepted. It is usually uncontroversial that an applicant for leave may make out a case for the grant of leave where the proposed new grounds of appeal appear to have merit or are at least arguable and there are compelling reasons why the new grounds of appeal were not raised at an earlier time. In the present case the proposed grounds appear to lack any merit at all and there is no compelling reason why they were either not reinstated (in the case of the grounds that were abandoned) or raised for the first time before the appeal was disposed of in court. The manifold contentions that the appellant seeks to agitate appear to me to be no more than a series of disparate ideas that he has formulated without legal advice and at leisure but which do not withstand scrutiny. By way of comparison with the grounds of appeal upon which the appellant did rely at the hearing of the appeal, of which none has struck me as having any merit for the reasons already discussed above, the latest propositions are very close to an abuse of the process of the Court. In my opinion it would be futile to grant leave to argue them as fresh grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    Appeal against sentence 
     
      
    85 In contrast to the approach taken by the Crown to the appellant's attempt to rely upon fresh grounds of appeal against his conviction, the Crown took a different approach to the appellant's application for leave to appeal out of time against his sentence. The Crown specifically conceded that there was no reason in principle why the Court should not entertain an application to appeal against the sentence imposed on the appellant, even at this very late stage. The Crown specifically did not oppose the granting of leave for this purpose. 
     
      
    86 The Crown relied upon its original submissions on sentence at the trial. There was no discernible error in the approach taken by his Honour to the sentences that he imposed. The Crown submitted that the sentences were well within the range for the very serious offences for which the appellant was convicted. The Crown submitted that the fact that the sentences were not imposed until approximately five years following the acts that constituted the offences was solely attributable to the appellant and there was in the circumstances no reason why the sentences should have been reduced because of that delay. In order to understand this approach it is necessary to examine the appellant's submissions. 
     
      
    87 The appellant lodged submissions on sentence with the registry on 22 October 2008. The submissions are made under five headings that can for present purposes be treated as grounds of appeal on this issue. They are dealt with in turn. 
     
      
    The trial judge erred in not sentencing separately 
     
      
    88 The appellant submitted that his Honour erred in failing allegedly contrary to Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 to sentence him separately in regard to each offence. The appellant submitted that ""the trial judge failed to abide [sic] the above rule of law when he sentenced contrary to that principle"" and that he should therefore be re-sentenced. No other submissions in elaboration of that proposition are advanced. 
     
      
    89 The appellant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment consisting of a total non-parole period of 5 years and 4 months to date from 15 November 2006 and to expire on 14 March 2012. On Counts 1 and 2 the appellant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 6 years to date from 15 November 2006 and to expire on 14 November 2012. On Counts 3, 4 and 6 the appellant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 6 years to date from 15 November 2008 and to expire on 14 November 2014. He was to be eligible for consideration for release to parole on 14 March 2012. 
     
      
    90 It is apparent that his Honour dealt with the offences in Counts 1 and 2 together as they related to facts concerned with what have been called the source codes or computer software charges. He dealt with the remaining Counts 3, 4 and 6 together as they related to facts concerned with what have been called the intellectual property in the perpetual motion engine charges. This distinction is even referred to in the appellant's original written submissions dated 3 January 2007 signed by Mr Buchen of counsel. 
     
      
    91 Clearly where there are two or more offences that contain common elements, the Court should not punish the offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common. If this is the principle upon which the appellant seeks to rely, that reliance is in my view misplaced. In my opinion the appellant in fact got the benefit of the manner in which his Honour dealt with the various counts. Counts 3, 4 and 6 had common elements and the appellant was sentenced for these counts together. It would arguably have been an error by the trial judge to have sentenced the appellant for these offences separately (as he contends should have occurred) because of the considerable accumulation of elements common to all three. The sentences for Counts 1 and 2 related to entirely different facts, the only significantly common element with the other counts being that Count 2 was also an attempt offence. This however is irrelevant. 
     
      
    92 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    The trial judge erred in making the sentences accumulative [sic] 
     
      
    93 The single proposition upon which the appellant relied under this ground was that all the counts upon which he was convicted were in respect of offences that ""arise from the same course of conduct"". This was said to be because the Business Activity Statements lodged by the appellant were in respect of companies with which the appellant was associated and ""[A]ll were done with the view to establishing the value of products in companies with the ultimate aim of going public"". 
     
      
    94 The activities of the appellant for which he was sentenced for Counts 1 and 2 were separate and distinct acts of criminality from those for which he was sentenced for Counts 3, 4 and 6. The partial accumulation of the latter upon the former was an appropriate way for that difference to be recognised and given effect. His Honour did not fall into error in the way that he structured those sentences in the circumstances. 
     
      
    The trial judge erred in not discounting the sentence because the offence was stale 
     
      
    95 The appellant noted that the offences were said to have occurred between July 2001 and September 2002. No charges were laid until December 2004 and the trial was set down for April 2006 following a committal in approximately November 2005. The trial date was vacated on the appellant's motion and relisted on 18 October 2006 on which date it commenced. 
     
      
    96 The appellant does not seek to identify any general or particular prejudice that was occasioned to him by reason of the so-called delays to which he directs attention. There is nothing unusual or exceptional about the dates when the relevant events in this case took place. There is no evidence that evidence was lost or destroyed or that any particular witnesses were unavailable to give evidence at his trial by reason of the delay.  
     
      
    97 This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
    The trial judge make [sic] factual errors in his sentencing reasoning 
     
      
    98 The trial judge's remarks on sentence were not included in the appeal papers that were provided to the Court having regard to the originally limited grounds of appeal. They were attached to the Crown's submissions dated 5 November 2008. However, the appellant relies only upon what his Honour said in those remarks at page 4 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        Each of these offences is an offence against s 134.1(1) of the  
        Criminal Code Act 
        "". 
        
       
      
    99 The appellant was in fact arraigned under s 134.2. The appellant has provided no submissions that appear to be directed to this ground of appeal beyond the submission that he was never arraigned under s 134.1 (1) so ""that casts further doubt on the validity of the record of the trial Court"". He submitted that the error demonstrated ""part of an overall attitude by the trial judge to proceed to conviction and sentence regardless of the facts"". The appellant submitted that as he ""directed the trial judge's attention to that error during his bail application of 30 March 2007, and no attempt was made to correct it during revision, it can only be assumed that it was the intention of the trial judge to convict under s 134.1(1)"". 
     
      
    100 There are a number of difficulties with that submission. It is only necessary to refer to one of them. It is tacitly recognised (correctly) by the appellant that the ""error"" was capable of correction, or revision as he describes it. It was no more than a typographical error that occurred at the time the appellant was sentenced. It is of no consequence. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    The sentences are manifestly excessive 
     
      
    101 The appellant's submissions in aid of this ground were as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""The appellant is currently 65 years old. 
         
         
        It would be fair to say that the possibility of charges lay over his head from the time that the refund in count 2 was stopped. At the very least there was a fair amount of stress placed upon him – he was twice subjected to search and seizures by the AFP, once interviewed by the ATO officers – this could be said to [be] nothing short of stressful. 
         
         
        That state of affairs continued until the appellant was eventually charged in December 2004, three and a half years after the first offence allegedly occurred. 
         
         
        This continued stress, combined with the staleness of the offences warrant, in my submission, if the substantive appeal were to fail, that the sentences be re-determined with the above factors taken into account, leading to a substantial reduction in the sentence. As mentioned above, it is also submitted that there was no basis for accumulation."" 
        
       
      
    102 In comparison to these submissions it is necessary to have regard to at least some of the remarks of his Honour when passing sentence to which the appellant makes no reference in his submissions. Those remarks are as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""I am satisfied that Mr O'Meara set out to deliberately defraud the Tax Office by taking advantage of the self reporting regime that existed for the newly introduced Goods and Services Tax and the suspected inability of the Tax Office to adequately investigate every claim that came before it. This was not just a superficial scheme but one designed to be able to sustain a reasonable degree of probing by the Australian Tax Office into its bona fides. Whilst it is true that Mr O'Meara put in a counter-veiling business activity statement in respect of Particle Spin Motors in regard to counts three, four and six of the indictment, the fact is that Particle Spin Motors had no capacity to pay the GST in question to the Australian Tax Office, whereas the latter did have the capacity to pay the refunds sought by Semiconductor Motor Corporation and all it needed was to have a delay between the claims made by the respective organisations to advance Mr O'Meara and disadvantage the Australian Tax Office to a significant degree. 
         
         
        Count one on the indictment obtained for Mr O'Meara over $500.000. That matter itself warrants a significant term of imprisonment. 
         
         
        Count three involved a refund of over fifteen and a quarter million dollars, which was about to be paid to Mr O'Meara but a stoppage was placed on the cheque by investigators. Had Mr O'Meara received that sum there would have been little prospect of its recovery. The amount in respect of count one on the indictment has not been recovered. 
         
         
         
         ***** 
         
         
        There can be no question of a sentence other than one of imprisonment. These were a fraud, and attempted frauds against the revenue. The amount actually obtained was not as a result of any genuine debt. That amount of money is now not available for use by all Australians by virtue of the application of tax revenue, to necessary public infrastructure like hospitals, roads, health and aged care. Instead it has selfishly benefited one individual. Further, whilst Mr O'Meara did not occupy a position of trust in regards the Australian Tax Office, he did abuse the system of trust which is fundamental to the proper operation of the tax system, at a time when it was particularly vulnerable. In regard to such matters there needs to be a significant element of general deterrence. 
         
         
        Whilst Mr O'Meara's criminal record prior to 2000 appears to have little relevance to the present proceedings, it is disturbing to see that he has since then been convicted of drug, firearms and fraud offences. So that as well as general deterrence in my view, there should be a reasonable level of specific deterrence factored into the sentences to be imposed."" 
        
       
      
    103 His Honour then proceeded to refer to a series of authorities to which he had been referred dealing with arguably comparable cases and the sentences imposed in each. It was not suggested by the appellant that his Honour fell into any error in the way or to the extent that he reasoned from those cases to the sentences he ultimately imposed. 
     
      
    104 I do not in the circumstances of this case consider that the sentences imposed by his Honour were manifestly excessive or excessive at all. The thrust of the appellant's submissions was in fact to emphasise what he describes as stress that was occasioned by investigation of his criminal activities, which was accompanied at the same time by a substantial fear of detection. These are matters that flowed from the appellant's own criminal activities and not in any way from the sentences that resulted. 
     
      
    105 The appeal against sentence fails. 
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    106 I consider that the following orders should be made: - 
     
      
      1. Other than with respect to the appeal against sentence, leave to appeal in respect of all grounds sought to be raised after the hearing of the appeal on 2 September 2008 refused. 
       
       
      2. Appeal against conviction and sentence otherwise dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Buddin J. 
     
      
    2 BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court following his conviction by a jury of two counts of sexual intercourse without consent. The maximum penalty for each of those offences is imprisonment for 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years is applicable to the offence. In respect of each count, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 7 years with a total term of 10 years imprisonment. The sentences were ordered to be served concurrently. 
     
      
    3 The only issue at trial was the identity of the offender and accordingly there was no challenge to the victim’s account of the offences. There is no appeal against conviction. In those circumstances, the facts upon which the applicant was sentenced can be briefly stated. The victim is an Italian citizen who, at the time, was on a working holiday in Australia. On the day in question, she checked into a boarding house in Brighton-Le-Sands where she was allocated room 10 which was on the first floor. Some time later she went downstairs to the manager’s office. The applicant came into the office whilst she was there and began to stare at her. Later still she saw the applicant again whilst she was knocking on the door to Room 14 (where she had gone to speak to a fellow traveller). On this occasion he was coming up the stairs with a friend. She noticed that he was again staring at her.  
     
      
    4 The victim went out that evening. Upon her return to the boarding house she went to bed. She believed that she had locked the door to her room but the sentencing judge said that he “was inclined to the view that she simply overlooked locking her door that evening”. 
     
      
    5 The victim was awoken from her sleep when she felt pressure on her mattress. She was then assaulted by the applicant who punched her in the area of her temple. He only stopped hitting her when she promised that she would not scream. The applicant made his intentions clear by telling the victim that he was there to have sex with her and that he had brought condoms with him for that purpose. Out of fear the victim complied with his demands. After first requiring her to remove a tampon, the applicant then had sexual intercourse with her on two occasions. When the applicant departed, the victim went to a room occupied by a friend of hers and immediately complained to her of having been raped. 
     
      
    6 Although as I have said the applicant denied being the offender, the sentencing judge described the Crown case against him as being “particularly strong”. The victim gave evidence that there was sufficient lighting in the room to enable her to recognise her assailant as being the man she had seen earlier that day on two separate occasions. She was also able to subsequently identify him from a photograph. Furthermore, as the sentencing judge observed, the victim “had the presence of mind to use the light from her mobile phone to illuminate the face of the offender in order to confirm her act of identification”. There was also evidence that DNA, consistent with that of the applicant, was found inside the back of the singlet which the victim had worn when she went to bed. The applicant was living in the boarding house at the time having separated from his wife some years earlier. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was born on 1 March 1964. He was aged 40 when the offence occurred on 17 February 2005. He was born in France but spent much of his life in Greece where he met his first wife. His family still resides in France, although his father passed away in the late 1990s. He has only infrequent contact with his mother and siblings who remain in France. They are apparently unaware that he is in custody.  
     
      
    8 The applicant who came to Australia in 1990 has been married twice. He has two children, with one of whom he currently has no contact at all, and the other whom he sees only occasionally. The applicant has been employed in a variety of positions, although he has mainly worked in unskilled jobs in restaurants and for a demolition firm. There was evidence that he was the victim of an assault whilst he was working as a chef in a kebab shop in 2002. As a result of that incident, he was diagnosed as having severe depression and as suffering from sleep disturbance. A report, dated 26 November 2002, was prepared by a clinical psychologist, Mr Sam Borenstein in support of a claim by the applicant to the Victims Compensation Tribunal. He diagnosed the applicant as having symptoms consistent with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder for which he was given medication. At the time of the offence, the applicant was suffering from some form of agrophobia, as a result of which he spent much of his time indoors watching videos. 
     
      
    9 The main issue which arose during the course of the sentence proceedings related to the state of the applicant’s mental health, a matter to which I shall return when considering the Grounds of Appeal. 
     
      
    10 The sentencing judge accepted a submission made by counsel, then appearing for the applicant, that the degree of planning was “not of a terribly high level”. His Honour also accepted that his prior criminal record, which consisted of two convictions for assault and various driving matters, was not of any great significance. His Honour indicated however that he was unable to make a finding that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation because he continued to deny that he had committed the offences of which he had been convicted. Indeed, he maintained that he was the victim of a police conspiracy. 
     
      
    11 The applicant relies upon the following Grounds of Appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        1 The sentences and sentence in its totality are/is manifestly excessive; 
        
       
       
        
        2 His Honour erred in failing to discount the sentences on the basis that the mental health of the appellant rendered him an unsuitable vehicle for a sentence of general deterrence; 
        
       
       
        
        3 His Honour erred in failing to find that on the balance of probabilities the mental state of the appellant contributed to his offending. 
        
       
      
    12 It is convenient to defer consideration of Ground 1 until later. I will also, as counsel for the applicant did, consider Grounds 2 and 3 together. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 2 and 3 
       
      
    13 The applicant tendered a report from a clinical psychologist, Mr Gregory Fathers, dated 12 October 2007, two reports from a forensic psychiatrist Dr Stephen Allnutt, dated 29 and 30 January 2008 respectively as well as the report prepared by Mr Borenstein to which I referred earlier. Upon the basis of that material, counsel who appeared for the applicant at the sentence hearing, submitted that his Honour should find that the applicant was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions by reason of the applicant’s mental condition: s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999. In making that submission counsel relied primarily on an opinion expressed by Mr Fathers. 
     
      
    14 The sentencing judge accepted, in accordance with well-established authority, that an offender’s mental state may have relevance to the sentencing task in several ways. For example, where it is causally related to the offence, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. It may also reduce the weight to be given to general deterrence: see generally R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228. 
     
      
    15 It was in that context that the sentencing judge made the following finding: 
     
      
       
        
        The current mental state of the offender and his state at the time of the offences is very difficult to determine with any precision. The psychologist, Mr Fathers, concluded the [applicant’s] mental state affected his culpability for his actions by saying this, 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          However some clemency is suggested. In my opinion Mr Dionnet had an abnormality of mind of sufficient degree to substantially impair his mental responsibility for his acts. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        When I first read that I raised with….counsel for [the applicant], what it was in Mr Fathers’ report, in the previous pages, which explained such a conclusion. [Counsel], to my recollection,, indicated that there was some difficulty in identifying that matter. The case was therefore adjourned once again in order that Mr Fathers’ material could be supplemented, if possible. The matter came before me again today but the only thing [counsel] was able to present was the report of Mr Borenstein for the Victims Compensation Tribunal Proceedings. It remains, therefore, as I see the material before me, simply a matter of Mr Fathers’ opinion, unexplained, that the moral culpability of the offender is diminished because of an abnormality of mind. 
        
       
       
        
        The psychologist and the psychiatrists who have seen the offender do suggest that there is some problem with his mental state, although it is difficult to determine what that problem is. I prefer the opinion of Dr Allnutt who notes that because the offender denies that he committed these two offences, it is not possible to draw any firm conclusions about any potential relationship between his mental state and the alleged offence, only to state that he reports active symptoms at around that time. Not everyone who is mentally unwell, or who reports symptoms of mental illness, has impaired judgment in the sense that their moral culpability for offences of this kind is reduced. The onus is on the offender to demonstrate that mitigating matter on the balance of probabilities. I am not satisfied that anything in the offender’s mental state is such as to diminish his moral culpability for his two offences. 
        
       
      
    16 It was contended on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge erred in reaching the conclusion to which I have just referred. However, the only direct evidence which could have established the necessary causal link arose from the opinion expressed by Mr Fathers. His Honour was quite entitled to reject that opinion given that no basis was advanced by the author to justify it. Nor was any submission advanced in this court to suggest that his Honour had erred in that respect.  
     
      
    17 What was submitted however was that there was other material to which Dr Allnutt referred in his reports, other than the extract to which the sentencing judge referred, which was capable of bearing upon this issue. An examination of those reports makes it clear that the highest Dr Allnutt could put the matter was that the applicant reported active symptoms of psychosis and anxiety at about the relevant time. The other reports which were in evidence simply did not address the present issue. Counsel also sought to rely upon evidence given at the trial concerning the applicant’s conduct on the day of the incident. Reference was made to evidence given by the complainant that the applicant stared at her on two occasions and to other evidence that after the assaults took place, rather than running away, the applicant simply returned to his room and went to sleep. It suffices to say in disposing of that submission, that those features of the case apparently did not commend themselves to either the sentencing judge or to counsel then appearing for the applicant because neither of them made any reference to them. 
     
      
    18 It is to be noted that nearly a year elapsed between the jury returning its verdicts and the applicant being sentenced. That delay was occasioned solely by adjournments sought on behalf of the applicant to obtain reports concerning his mental condition. Notwithstanding the latitude which was extended to the applicant, no independent material was adduced which may have shed light upon the applicant’s mental condition at, or about the time, of these offences. In summary, given the state of the evidence, it was well open to the sentencing judge to arrive at the conclusion which he reached and no error in that respect has been demonstrated.  
     
      
    19 So far as ground 2 is concerned, it is instructive to refer to this court’s decision in Zaharos v R [2008] NSWCCA 336 in which McClellan CJ at CL, with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        Where mental illness has played a part in the offending, the need for general deterrence may be diminished:  
        R v Wright  
        (1997) 93 A Crim R 48. However, where an offender understands what he is doing and the gravity of his actions, general deterrence may be of continuing significance:  
        Wright 
         at 51;  
        R v Henry & Ors  
        [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [252]-[254]. The issue is further discussed in  
        R v Matthews  
        [2004] NSWCCA 112; (2004) 145 A Crim R 445 and  
        R v Hemsley  
        [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36]. (par 14) 
        
       
      
    20 There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the applicant did not understand what he was doing or that he did not understand the gravity of his actions. 
     
      
    21 In Sayin v R [2008] NSWCCA 307, Grove J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Howie J agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        Although there may not be a link between a mental illness harboured by an offender, if such a conditions exists it may be that the offender is unsuitable as a vehicle to exhibit general deterrence and if that be the case, logically, the absence or the reduction of the significance of such an element would operate to reduce the assessment otherwise reached:  
        R v Scognamiglio 
         [12991] 56 A Crim R 81. 
        
       
       
        
        However, it does not inevitably follow that the existence of some mental illness must result in a lesser sentence:  
        Courtney v R 
         [2007] A Crim R 371. (pars 24-5) 
        
       
      
    22 Although those remarks are apposite to the present case, the sentencing judge did nevertheless indicate that he was prepared to have regard to the applicant’s mental condition in order to ameliorate the sentence. In that context his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        However, even if the precise nature of the offender’s illness is unclear I am prepared to proceed on the basis that because of his mental state he will do his time in custody harder than would otherwise be the case. [The applicant] appears to have some level of thought disorder and this will inhibit communications with others in gaol and, as I have said, will mean that his conditions of custody will be felt harder by him that would otherwise be the case. 
        
       
      
    23 In the circumstances, I would reject both Grounds 2 and 3. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The sentences and sentence in its totality are/is manifestly excessive 
       
      
    24 As I have said, this was an offence in relation to which a standard non-parole period of 7 years applied. The standard non-parole period applies to an offence which is characterised as being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness: see generally R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. His Honour determined that the offences were above the mid-range. The sentencing judge explained his reasons for arriving at that conclusion in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        It is to be noted that they were preceded by acts of violence. It is to be noted that the offences took place in a room where [the victim] was entitled to feel safe. It is apparent that the offender formed an interest in [the victim] some time before he actually sexually assaulted her and was well aware that she was staying by herself in the room and thus defenceless. I saw both [the victim] and the offender during the course of the trial. [The victim] was much, much smaller than the offender and thus easily overborne. 
        
       
       
        
        The aggravating factor that the offence involved actual and threatened violence is present in this case. Of course I must not take into account any aggravating circumstance which would involve me breaching the rule in  
        De Simoni, 
         but I am able to take into account that these offences only followed actual violence on the part of the offender and then a threat being in these terms, “I’m going to beat you more, if you scream any more I’m going to beat you more. The offences involved penile/vaginal intercourse which is a particularly hurtful invasion of [the victim’s] rights.” 
        
       
      
    25 The submission that the overall sentence was manifestly excessive was founded upon the contention that the offences “fell below the middle of the range of seriousness of offences of this type”. In other words, it was contended that the sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    26 The only matter that was advanced in support of the submission that his Honour had erred in his characterisation of the objective gravity of the offence was a reference to the decision of this court in R v Carvahlo [2007] NSWCCA 344. In that case there was a finding by the sentencing judge that the offending behaviour fell just below the mid-range in circumstances which were said to be comparable to the present case. With all respect to the submission, that can hardly provide an adequate basis for concluding that the finding in the present case is vitiated by error. 
     
      
    27 In Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282, Spigelman CJ observed: 
     
      
       
        
        Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour 
        . 
         (at par 37) 
        
       
      
    28 Simpson J said: 
     
      
       
        
        The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing judge. It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion. As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in  
        House v The King 
          
        [1936] HCA 40; 55CLR 499. The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance. (at par 46) 
        
       
      
    29 Notwithstanding his characterisation of the objective gravity of the offences, his Honour nevertheless decided against imposing a longer non-parole period than the standard non-parole period fixed by parliament. His Honour did so “in view of the [applicant’s] mental state…and in view of the circumstances in which he will do his time in custody”. His Honour then extended a further measure of leniency to the applicant by imposing wholly concurrent sentences upon him even though there were two separate and distinct offences of non-consensual sexual intercourse. 
     
      
    30 In my view, it was well open to the sentencing judge to make the assessment which is now impugned. Moreover, I am not persuaded that the overall effective sentence was manifestly excessive. In the circumstances, Ground 1 should be rejected. 
     
      
    31 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    32 ROTHMAN J: I agree with Buddin J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Rothman J.  
     
      
    2 BUDDIN J: I agree with Rothman J.  
     
      
    3 ROTHMAN J: Marcus Hei Hei seeks leave to appeal and, if leave be granted, appeals the sentence imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Bennett SC. Mr Hei Hei had pleaded guilty to aggravated dangerous driving causing death. The aggravation, to which the offences related in Mr Hei Hei’s case, was a blood alcohol level of 0.162 g per 100 ml of blood. The Crown also appeals, but its appeal is confined to a measure aimed at protecting the intent of his Honour as to the period of disqualification from driving, should Mr Hei Hei be successful in that aspect of his appeal. 
     
      
    4 Mr Hei Hei was sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years expiring on 19 February 2011 with a balance of term of a further 2 years. Further, Mr Hei Hei was disqualified from driving for “a period of three years commencing on 20 February 2011”. 
     
      
    Facts 
     
      
    5 Shortly stated, Mr Hei Hei drank for most, if not all, of the afternoon and evening of Sunday 4 March 2007. Just before 12.30am on Monday 5 March, he drove to the pub to buy more alcohol and play pool. He drove his stepdaughter and her boyfriend.  
     
      
    6 At 12.30am, while driving north along Olympic Drive at Lidcombe, Mr Hei Hei failed to negotiate a sweeping left-hand bend before a straight section of roadway, crossed the concrete median strip, entered the south-bound lanes (i.e. the opposite and wrong side of the road), skidded sideways and mounted the eastern curb of the roadway. The road was a major thoroughfare, with three lanes in each direction. The vehicle then impacted heavily with a paling and brick fence and came to rest on its roof on the wrong side of the road.  
     
      
    7 Mr Hei Hei’s stepdaughter died as a result of the injuries she sustained in the collision. Those injuries were a massive head wound to the rear of the deceased’s head. When ambulance and police officers arrived at the scene, each of Mr Hei Hei and the two passengers were trapped in the vehicle, which was still on its roof. Mr Hei Hei sought to insist that the rescue workers attend to his stepdaughter first. He was abusive and clearly affected by alcohol. He declined to be removed from the vehicle and eventually, after approximately one hour, he was coaxed out of the vehicle. At that time he was the subject of a roadside blood test, which provided an alcohol reading of 0.186 g per 100 ml of blood. He was conveyed to Westmead Hospital (as was his stepdaughter’s boyfriend) and given a further blood test. This blood test (taken approximately two-and-a-half hours after the collision) showed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.162 g per 100 ml.  
     
      
    8 The above facts were largely the subject of agreement and tendered before his Honour at sentencing.  
     
      
    9 At the sentence hearing, the prosecution tendered the criminal and driving records of Mr Hei Hei from both New South Wales and New Zealand.  
     
      
    10 Mr Hei Hei and his stepdaughter had a close relationship, confirmed by the deceased’s boyfriend and the deceased’s mother. Further the deceased’s mother confirmed the changed attitude of Mr Hei Hei to drinking (and drinking and driving) brought about by the incident. Mr Hei Hei had made a solemn promise to his dead stepchild not to drink again (which has a particularly cultural significance) and has, thus far, kept that promise. Further, he had attended the deceased’s former high school and spoken to a group of over 100 students on the topic on the dangers of drink driving. A number of references and reports were tendered on behalf of Mr Hei Hei and a Pre Sentence Report was available to the sentencing judge.  
     
      
    Grounds of Appeal 
     
      
    11 The grounds of appeal against the sentence of imprisonment raise two matters and further there is a ground of appeal against the period of disqualification from driving. The issues raised in the grounds of appeal from imprisonment are: 
     
      
       
      (i) The sentencing judge erred in taking into account s 21A(2)(i) of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       1999 (disregard for public safety) as an aggravating feature of the offence in circumstances where it is a matter inherent in the offence itself; 
       
       
      (ii) The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    12 Further the issue raised on the question of a disqualification from licence relates to the commencing date for the disqualification period. His Honour disqualified Mr Hei Hei from driving for a period of 3 years commencing at the conclusion of the non-parole period, which his Honour had otherwise set. Mr Hei Hei has appealed that commencing date and submits that it was an error to commence the sentence from a date other than the date of conviction.  
     
      
    Ground 1: Error in taking into account disregard for public safety as an aggravating feature when it is an element of the offence  
     
      
    13 The provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act make clear that the Court must not have additional regard to any aggravating factor that is, itself, an element of the offence: see s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    14 Many judgments of this Court have made clear that to take account of a factor in aggravation of an offence, which factor is an element of the offence itself, is to double count the effect of the factor: see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [172]; R v McMillan [2005] NSWCCA 28 at [38]; Elyard v R [2006] NSWCCA 43 at [13]-[17] and at [40], [43]-[45].  
     
      
    15 In Elyard, supra, the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There can be no doubt that the inclusion of the circumstances of aggravation identified in s 52A(7) of the  
        Crimes Act 
         are intended to prohibit conduct which may well occur in disregard of public safety, because the conscious creation of a drug-affected state, combined with the act of driving a motor vehicle, will usually satisfy that description. Accordingly, acting without regard for public safety should not, in such a case, be given additional effect as an aggravating factor in its own right, unless the circumstances of the case involve some unusually heinous behaviour, or inebriation above the statutory precondition.” ( 
        Elyard 
        , supra, per Basten JA at [10] and see also [45] per Howie J.) 
        
       
      
    16 In McMillan, supra, the Court also considered these issues and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the respondent had been charged with an offence based upon the fact that he was driving in a manner dangerous to the public, it seems clear that a court could not take into account that the offence was committed without regard to public safety because that fact is an element of the offence. An offence based upon the fact that the driver was under the influence of liquor does not explicitly contain as an element of the offence that the driving was without regard to public safety. But the offence of driving under the influence, particularly where it is alleged that the driver has a blood alcohol reading over 0.15, is premised on the fact that to drive in such a condition is dangerous to other persons on the road. It seems to me that there would be an element of double counting in finding that the offence was aggravated by those factors mentioned in  
        Jurisic 
         and  
        Whyte 
        , which are generally concerned with the danger posed to members of the public by the driving, and then to find that the offence is also aggravated because the driving was without regard to public safety.  
        
       
       
        
         
        I do not believe her Honour was in error in not finding the offence was aggravated by item (i) in s 21A(2) because that factor is reflected in the elements of an offence under s 52A and in the aggravating factors to which a court is to have regard specifically when sentencing for such an offence.” ( 
        McMillan 
        , supra, per Howie J at [38], [39].) 
        
       
      
    17 The sentencing judge made, in this respect, the following comment: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 21A(2)(i) – disregard of public safety – is a matter, I believe, to be taken into account. To have driven the vehicle with this blood alcohol level was to commit the offence without regard for the safety of the members of the public who might have come into proximity with the offender as he was driving in that state.” 
        
       
      
    18 On one view of the comments of his Honour, he might have been referring to the fact that the disregard of public safety is a matter already taken into account in the nature of the offence. However, it seems that the better view is that his Honour took it into account as a source of aggravation of the offence.  
     
      
    19 In some circumstances, there can be aggravation as a result of the disregard of public safety in an offence of this kind. If the sentencing judge were in a position to be able to determine that there were sources of aggravation, beyond the factors inherent in the charge, then s 21A(2)(i) would operate as a statutory embodiment or source of aggravation. His Honour made clear, however, that there was no evidence sufficient to make findings of fact beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was driving at excessive speed or in some manner dangerous to the other road users, other than the factor of aggravation associated with his alcohol consumption, which is the element of the offence in question.  
     
      
    20 The provisions of s 21A(2) prohibit “double-counting” of a feature that is an element of the offence for which a prisoner is being sentenced: Elyard, supra.  
     
      
    21 Given the inability of his Honour to find any other factor, which is conduct in disregard of public safety, the comment (at page 11 of the Remarks on Sentence) that s 21A(2)(i) “is a matter … to be taken into account” was to “double count” the effect of the aggravation giving rise to this offence.  
     
      
    Is a lesser sentence warranted? 
     
      
    22 I find error and I am required to deal with the provisions of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
     
      
    23 In order to have this Court intervene on a sentence, it is necessary but not sufficient for an appellant to show an error. Over and above the existence of error, the Court must form the opinion that “some other sentence, whether more or less severe, is warranted.” 
     
      
    24 Once there is error, manifest or identifiable, such that the jurisdiction of the Court to overturn an exercise of discretion is enlivened, the statutory requirement imposed by s 6(3) must be satisfied: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79]; R v Boulghourgian [2001] NSWCCA 460; (2001) 125 A Crim R 540 at [34]; Kutchera v R [2007] NSWCCA 121; R v Stewart [2005] NSWCCA 290. 
     
      
    25 In Boulghourgian, supra, Spigelman CJ said at [34]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Even though there is error detected in the reasoning process of a trial judge, s.6(3) does not enable this court, much less require it, to interfere with the sentence unless it is of the view that a more lenient sentence should have been passed.” 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour the Chief Justice, in or to the same effect, said in Simpson, supra, at [79]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows: ‘If it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process.’ That is not the statutory formulation. By s6(3) this Court must form a positive opinion that ‘some other sentence ... is warranted in law and should have been passed’. Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power to ‘quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor’ is not satisfied. As the judgments in  
        Dinsdale 
         to which I have referred indicate, the exercise of the power in s6(3) further requires the identification of error in the requisite sense.” 
        
       
      
    27 There are added difficulties when dealing with the sentence imposed by his Honour. His Honour allowed, apparently, a discount of 30% for the plea of guilty. It may be that his Honour was including in that discount other factors, but the terms of his Honour’s remarks at page 19 of the Remarks on Sentence suggest otherwise. A discount of 30% for the plea of guilty is inconsistent with principle, and qualifies the impact of a commencement point of 7 years’ imprisonment, about which complaint is made.  
     
      
    28 Leaving aside the issue of discount, his Honour was faced with a sentencing exercise of a person who had a long and significant history of criminal and driving offences similar in many ways to that which gave rise to the aggravation in this offence. These include offences for driving whilst disqualified, driving a motor vehicle in a dangerous manner, driving with an alcohol level over the prescribed limits, and driving without a drivers’ licence.  
     
      
    29 In one instance of driving whilst disqualified, Mr Hei Hei was also charged and convicted of careless driving and failing to ascertain an injury as a result of that driving. He has been disqualified from driving on a number of occasions. These offences span his time in New Zealand and in New South Wales. As a consequence of that history, personal deterrence is a major consideration.  
     
      
    30 A 3-year non-parole period is, according to the statistics available, precisely at mid-range for an offence. Similarly, a 5-year total sentence is at mid-range, according to those statistics. While care must be taken in the application of statistics, they can, in circumstances such as this, be a useful guide to the range of sentences that have been imposed by the courts for sentences of this kind.  
     
      
    31 In the circumstances of this case, and bearing in mind the statutory test in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, I am not of the opinion that some other sentence, less severe than that imposed by his Honour below, is warranted in law and should have been passed. In those circumstances, I am not entitled to quash the sentence and pass another in substitution for it. 
     
      
    Ground 2: Manifest error 
     
      
    32 The previous discussion on the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, is relevant to the determination of this ground of appeal. In order to satisfy s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, it is unnecessary to show manifest error. A sentence can be in range and still be more or less severe than is warranted in law or than should have been passed. However the reverse is not true. If no lesser sentence should have been passed, then, by definition, the sentence is not excessive. A fortiori the sentence is not manifestly excessive. For the reasons already provided, this ground of appeal is rejected.  
     
      
    Ground 3: Commencement date of period of disqualification from driving 
     
      
    33 The third ground of appeal relates to a submission that in imposing a period of disqualification from driving, the sentencing judge was required to commence the period of disqualification from the date of conviction. This is a submission that depends, solely, on a proper construction of the provisions of the governing Act.  
     
      
    34 The relevant provisions of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (“the Act”) provide: 
     
      
       
        
        “187(1) Subject to section 188 of this Act, section 40 of the  
        Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 
         and sections 25 and 25A of the  
        Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 
         , a court that convicts a person of an offence under the road transport legislation may, at the time of the conviction, order the disqualification of the person from holding a driver licence for such period as the court specifies.” 
        
       
      
    35 Further the provisions of s 188(2) of the Act are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “188(2)  
        Disqualification if no previous major offence 
         If, at the time of the conviction of the convicted person or during the period of 5 years before the conviction (whether that period commenced before or commences after the commencement of this section), the convicted person is not or has not been convicted of any other major offence (whether of the same or a different kind): 
         
         
          
           
          ... 
           
           
          (d) where the conviction is for any other offence:  
          
         
         
          
           
            
             
            (i) the person is automatically disqualified for a period of 3 years from holding a driver licence, or  
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
             
            (ii) if the court that convicts the person thinks fit to order a shorter period (but not shorter than 12 months) or longer period of disqualification—the person is disqualified from holding a driver licence for such period as may be specified in the order.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    (The offence here committed is an “other offence” for the purpose of this subsection.) 
     
      
    36 At the time his Honour convicted Mr Hei Hei of the offence, his Honour disqualified Mr Hei Hei from driving for a period of 3 years commencing on the date on which Mr Hei Hei’s non-parole period would expire. This ground of appeal urges the Court to adopt a construction of the provisions of s 188(2)(d), cited above, that does not permit the commencement date of the period of disqualification to be set, or to be set at a time other than the date of conviction.  
     
      
    37 The plain purpose of the Act is to establish a national system of the regulation of certain aspects of road transport, including the disqualification of persons from driving in circumstances where it is established those persons have not shown the requisite degree of responsibility necessary to drive. In that regard, the legislative scheme, relevantly, is for the protection of the public from persons with a known risk of dangerous driving. The provisions of s 188 of the Act implement that purpose and, additionally, impose a penalty upon those persons with established driving records of a particular kind. The provisions of s 187 allow the courts to implement such a purpose by disqualifying offending drivers, subject only to s 188 of the Act.  
     
      
    38 It would defeat the purpose of the Act, and render otiose orders for disqualification, if the period of disqualification was wholly concurrent with a period of incarceration, during which, by definition, the disqualified driver would not usually be free to drive. Yet this is the effect or outcome for which Mr Hei Hei submits.  
     
      
    39 Clearly the purpose of the Act would be best served by construing the provision as granting, to any judicial officer, required to exercise the powers under s 188(2)(d)(ii), the discretion and flexibility to set appropriate commencement and conclusion dates for the period in question. Certainly the power in s 187(1) of the Act does not readily imply a restriction on the manner by which the courts may set the period, i.e. by setting the commencement and conclusion date or by some other method.  
     
      
    40 It is clear that the disqualification penalty imposed must be for a definite period: Ex parte Thomas; Re Arnold (1966) 84 WN (Part 1) NSW 493; [1966] 2 NSWR 197; Gardner v R [2003] NSWCCA 199. In each of the foregoing judgments (the first of the Court of Appeal and the second of the Court of Criminal Appeal), it was held that an indeterminate disqualification could not be imposed and a disqualification “for life” was invalid.  
     
      
    41 In Gardner, supra, the Court of Criminal Appeal overturned the imposition of a life time disqualification as not being a disqualification “for a period”. Sheller JA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Thus, in subs (2)(d) the automatic disqualification is for three years. The Court may order a shorter period ‘but not shorter than twelve months’. Alternatively, the Court may order a longer period of disqualification. But no statutory limitation is placed on that. As a matter of language it appears to be left entirely to the discretion of the Court, properly exercised, to determine what the longer period of disqualification should be and whether it be measured by calendar periods of time, such as months or years, or otherwise. The word ‘period’ is indefinite and does not indicate how in the particular case it is to be determined. If the expression ‘longer period of disqualification’ stood alone unqualified in s25(2), … I would hold that the Act did permit the Court to order a lifetime period of disqualification.” 
        
       
      
    42 In Gardner, O’Keefe J (with whom Sheller JA and James J relevantly agreed) considered that the word ‘period’ connoted “an interval, length or portion of time”. The Court, however, did not consider directly the issue in the present proceedings. In discussing an appropriate period for the disqualification, O’Keefe J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The applicant will not be eligible for release on parole until 3 January 2007. The full term of the principal sentence extends until 3 January 2010. In the light of his driving history and the offences of which he has been convicted, he is unlikely to be driving on a public road during the period of his incarceration. A disqualification for a period of ten years from the date on which he becomes eligible for parole would, in my opinion, be appropriate. That being so, I am of opinion that the period of his disqualification should be until 2 January 2017.” ( 
        Gardner 
        , at [61].) 
        
       
      
    43 Notwithstanding the foregoing statement of reasons, the order of the Court in Gardner was, inter alia, to quash the disqualification for life imposed by the sentencing judge and “in lieu of the order … the applicant be disqualified from holding a motor vehicle driver licence until 2 January 2017.” 
     
      
    44 In other words, the Court did not impose an order which reflected a commencing date for the disqualification as the date proposed for the applicant’s release on parole. Indeed, the Court in Gardner did not specify a commencement date of the period of disqualification at all.  
     
      
    45 The difficulty with adopting a construction that implemented the above stated purpose and gave the flexibility for which the Crown contends (and which purpose ought, to the extent possible, be given effect) is that s 188(2)(d) is a sub-paragraph immediately following on a provision relating to automatic disqualification. Section 188(2)(d)(i) provides that the offender is “automatically disqualified for a period of 3 years from holding a driver licence”. It is axiomatic that, absent an order varying the period, the automatic disqualification would apply on and from the date of conviction. The jurisdiction and power conferred in the Court by the provisions of the next sub-paragraph, s 188(2)(d)(ii), is a capacity to order “a shorter period … or longer period of disqualification”. Further, it would seem that, once an order for disqualification issues from a court, the period of disqualification is no longer “automatic”.  
     
      
    46 The context of s 188(2)(d)(ii), following immediately upon the terms of sub-paragraph (i) seems to indicate that the “period” is a period that commences on the date of conviction. It is, for the reasons that follow, unnecessary to determine that issue finally.  
     
      
    47 The intention of the sentencing judge has not been, and cannot be, the subject of criticism. His Honour clearly intended that Mr Hei Hei be disqualified until 19 February 2014. The Crown appeal, as already stated, has been lodged for the sole purpose of correcting any technical defect in the manner that his Honour expressed the order implementing his intention.  
     
      
    48 His Honour’s jurisdiction, conferred pursuant to s 188(2)(d)(ii) of the Act, was, as stated above, to order a “shorter … or longer period” than 3 years’ disqualification. In fact, his Honour did neither.  
     
      
    49 His Honour fixed a 3-year disqualification, commencing from a different date than would have applied under s 188(2)(d)(i) of the Act. Section 187(1) of the Act may confer jurisdiction to fix the commencement and conclusion dates of the automatic period in s 188(2)(d)(i), but the jurisdiction in s 188(2)(d)(ii) certainly does not. Nor did his Honour purport to exercise the jurisdiction in either s 187(1) or in s 188(2)(d)(i) of the Act. Each of the parties to this appeal have assumed that his Honour was acting under s 188(2)(d)(ii) of the Act. The Court should act on that assumption.  
     
      
    50 The argument in favour of the power being able to be exercised, under s 187(i) of the Act, is that s 188(2)(d)(i) of the Act is not a limitation on the power to fix commencement and conclusion dates and, therefore, the subjection in s 187(i) of the Act is not operative.  
     
      
    51 However, s 188(2)(d)(ii) is a limitation. It allows the fixing only of a shorter or longer period than 3 years. The fixing of a 3 year period is not permitted by s 188(2)(d)(ii) of the Act.  
     
      
    52 To the extent that his Honour had power and/or jurisdiction to fix a 3 year disqualification period from a commencement date in the future, which is what he did, that jurisdiction or power would have been under s 187(1) and s 188(2)(d)(i) of the Act. It was not a jurisdiction conferred by s 188(2)(d)(ii) of the Act. An exercise of jurisdiction, otherwise available, under the wrong provision does not necessarily render the exercise invalid: see R v Moore; Ex parte Graham [1977] HCA 20; (1977) 138 CLR 164. Invalidity would depend on the tests to be used in each exercise of jurisdiction.  
     
      
    53 Nevertheless, reliance on s 188(2)(d)(ii) of the Act, for the fixing of a 3-year period of disqualification, was a mistake of law as to the provision under which his Honour was acting.  
     
      
    54 Given that it is unclear which provision under which his Honour was purporting to act, and that, on that basis, arguably, at least, the order was beyond power, it is appropriate to quash the order and re-assess and/or give effect to the disqualification period, ending 2014, that his Honour clearly desired.  
     
      
    55 For the reasons already given, relating inter alia to the purpose of the provisions and the disqualification period, and particularly the history of disobedience of the law that Mr Hei Hei has displayed, a longer period of disqualification than the mandatory term is appropriate and I accept the assessment of the sentencing judge that a period of disqualification concluding 3 years after his release on parole is an appropriate period of disqualification. However, Mr Hei Hei should also not be able to drive on the public roads for the duration of his incarceration e.g. for the purposes of the prison or if he were on day release for some reason.  
     
      
    56 Generally, there are restrictions relating to Crown appeals. In this instance, the Crown appeal should be granted, as to do so would simply implement, in accordance with the unarguably appropriate statutory procedure, the intention of the sentencing judge. In those circumstances, this Court, on appeal, is not interfering with the effect of the exercise of discretion below, but giving effect to it. Nothing in this case detracts from the oft-cited principles associated with Crown appeals: see R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42; R v Presard [2004] 147 A Crim R 385 at [27]; R v Abboud [2005] NSWCCA 251 at [20]-[23]. 
     
      
    57 Neither the Crown nor Mr Hei Hei dealt with the issue as to whether an appeal lies to this Court from the order relating to disqualification. The order of disqualification is a penalty: see Application by the Attorney General under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a Guideline Judgment Concerning the Offence of High Range Prescribed Concentration of Alcohol Under Section 9(4) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (No 3 of 2002) [2004] NSWCCA 303; (2004) 61 NSWLR 305 at 325 [77]. Further it is a penalty imposed, and, if it is to be made, is required to be imposed, by an order by the court of trial on convicting a person of an offence and, as such, is a sentence within the meaning of the Criminal Appeal Act.  
     
      
    58 If the foregoing were incorrect, the penalty could be corrected by the application of s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: see Application by the Attorney, supra, at [77]; R v Finnie (No 2) [2004] NSWCCA 150.  
     
      
    59 The submissions in this case do point to the desirability of clarifying the relationship between s 187 and s 188 of the Act and the power of a court to fix the commencement and conclusion dates of any disqualification period.  
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    60 For the foregoing reasons, Mr Hei Hei has not established identifiable or manifest error in the sentence imposed and the appeal against sentence should be dismissed. On the issue of the construction of the provisions of s 188 of the Act, it is appropriate, in the circumstances of this case, to implement the effect of the exercise of discretion intended by the sentencing judge in a manner that indisputably conforms with the statutory regime, and, to that extent, to allow the Crown appeal.  
     
      
    61 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal be granted; 
       
       
      (2) The appeal against sentence by Mr Hei Hei be dismissed; 
       
       
      (3) The appeal by the Crown against the order of his Honour Judge Bennett DCJ, disqualifying Mr Hei Hei from driving, be allowed and in lieu thereof the following order issue: 
       
       
        
        “(i) Pursuant to the terms of section 188(2)(d)(ii) of the  
        Road Transport (General) Act 
         2005, Mr Hei Hei be disqualified from driving for a longer period than 3 years, being for the period concluding 19 February 2014.”

    JUDGMENT1. I have the task now of sentencing BR for a series of shocking and appalling sexual offences committed against young children. The young children were part of his family. One of the children was in fact his own son. 2. The place to start is to briefly tell the court what BR did to bring about the charges that I am sentencing him for. In about 2002 BR commenced a relationship with a woman whom I will refer to as KJ. I refer to her by initials only because of the law that provides that the victims of sexual offences should not be identified. KJ, when they commenced their relationship, already had four children. One was a girl, LH; she is now aged eleven. The other three were boys, DH now ten, LH now nine and RJS now six. During their relationship a child was born to them both; he is BRJ and is now three. During their relationship BR and KJ lived at various places around Sydney. The offences were committed by BR against all of the children that I have referred to. 3. Exhibit A contains a summary of what happened which is agreed between the prosecution and the defence. The first offence occurred in the first half of 2006. The victim was LH. She was eight or nine at the time. Her mother KJ was either at work or asleep. What BR did to eight or nine year old LH was to remove the clothing from the lower part of her body and then proceed to have sexual intercourse with her. That sexual intercourse was full penile vaginal intercourse. Next were two more offences committed by BR against LH. The first of those occurred in January 2006. KJ’s half brother, a person I will refer to as WH, visited BR’s home. BR asked WH what he would do if the girl LH sucked him off. BR then directed LH, still aged eight or nine, to suck his penis which she proceeded to do. About two or three months later WH again visited the family. BR showed all of the children in the house a pornographic film and they masturbated. BR once again had LH suck his penis. On both occasions this was done in the presence of KJ’s half brother, WH. 4. The events that I have referred to resulted in three charges. The penile vaginal sexual intercourse with LH - which I said occurred in the first half of 2006 but I should correct to say sometime in the eighteen months between 1 January 2006 and 29 June 2007 - resulted in a charge of sexual intercourse with a child aged under ten. That is an offence against s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament has fixed a maximum sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment to that offence. Not only that, Parliament regards it as so serious that in addition it has fixed a standard non-parole period of fifteen years to that offence. The two other events which I have described where LH sucked BR’s penis also resulted in charges under s 66A of the Crimes Act. 5. I am sentencing BR for the offence of having penile vaginal intercourse with LH. That offence I will refer to as count 5 because it appears as count 5 on the indictment. When I am sentencing him for count 5 I will take into account the other two matters involving the sucking of BR’s penis under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Those two charges appear on a form 1 under that Act which has been signed by BR and by me.6. Next there were a series of crimes committed on the same occasion. They all occurred at some stage between 1 July and 27 September 2007. What happened is that BR took LH, then aged ten, into the bedroom which he shared with her mother. Once again her mother was evidently not around at the time. BR had LH remove her pants and spread her legs. Once again he had penile vaginal intercourse with LH and also had her suck his penis. LH’s younger brothers came into the bedroom. BR pointed out to them where a man puts his penis, then he directed RJS, who was aged five at the time, to touch his sister’s vagina. 7. That activity resulted in four charges. Two of them I am sentencing BR for and two of them I will take into account when I am sentencing BR for the first two charges. 8. The first charge was laid under s 61O(2) of the Crimes Act. That was a charge of inciting a child under ten to commit an act of indecency in circumstances of aggravation. The circumstances of aggravation were that the child was under the authority of the offender. That case involved BR making RJS touch his sister LH’s vagina. That crime carries a maximum of seven years imprisonment. When I am sentencing him for that crime I am taking into account a further offence, that offence is under s 61O(1). That offence is inciting a child aged under sixteen to commit an act of indecency in circumstances of aggravation. That offence relates to LH. It is the same circumstances, namely the younger child touching her vagina, but that offence is concerned with LH’s role in her vagina being touched by her younger brother. That offence is on a form 1 and, as I said, I will take it into account when I am sentencing BR for the offence I first referred to, which is called count 2. The form 1 I have has been signed by BR and by the prosecutor and by me. 9. When BR on the occasion in the bedroom that I have been describing put his penis into LH’s vagina, that resulted in a charge of sexual intercourse with a child aged between ten and fourteen, which is an offence against s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act. That has a maximum of twenty years imprisonment attached to it by Parliament. When I am sentencing BR for that offence - which is called count 3 because of its place on the indictment - I will take into account his crime of having LH suck his penis at around the same time. That also resulted in a charge of having sexual intercourse with a child aged between ten and fourteen against s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act. Once again that offence has been put onto a form 1 under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which has been signed by the prosecutor and BR and by me. 10. That does not exhaust a description of BR’s depraved behaviour. On 27 September 2007, BR collected all of the children, except his own son BRJ who was only two at the time, from school. He took them back home. When they all got home this is what happened. The children got their shoes and hats off at the front door and started to move in towards their bedrooms. But BR got in front of them in the hallway. He blocked the hallway and pulled down his shorts. What was exposed was his erect penis. He said to each of the children that they had to “suck to pass”. He demanded that each child suck his penis before they could go into their bedrooms. 11. Each child complied with his demand. Even his son - the two year old boy - complied, having been told by BR that it “was just a sausage”. That depraved activity on BR’s part resulted in five charges, one in respect of each of child. Each charge was one involving sexual intercourse because the act of sucking a man’s penis is an act of sexual intercourse under the Crimes Act. 12. The offence he committed involving LH resulted in a charge under s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act because she was aged ten at the time. As I have already said that carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. Because the other four children were all under ten each of the acts of fellatio which BR had them perform on him resulted in a charge of sexual intercourse with a child aged under ten against s 66A of the Crimes Act. Once again as I have said, each of those offences carried a maximum of twenty-five years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of fifteen years imprisonment. 13. The eldest child LH complained to her aunt on the day that these last events occurred. Her mother was also told. Police were brought in and they started an investigation. BR was arrested the following morning on 28 September 2007 and was charged on 18 December 2007. He has been in custody since 18 December 2007, bail refused. 14. I will refer now to some factors which are personal to BR. He has a criminal record but compared to the crimes that I am sentencing him for it is fairly insignificant. He has been convicted of goods in custody, carrying a cutting weapon and carrying implements to break into a car and swearing near a school.15. He has written a letter of apology, which has been tendered by Mr Hancock who appears on his behalf and became exhibit 1. It is addressed to me and expresses his sincere apologies to the victims and the families for what he describes as the severe trauma which he has imposed upon them. He finds it hard to contemplate how it occurred. He does point out that as a child he was exposed to the same trauma but acknowledges that does not excuse his behaviour. He acknowledges that that the lives of his victims have changed forever. 16. Mr Hancock also tendered a detailed psychological report on BR; it was by Misia Temler and was dated 2 April 2009. That report pointed out that BR had had a fairly stable upbringing so far as his own family was concerned. He was visited regularly in custody by his mother and sisters and his family remains supportive. He has had steady employment over the years in a number of jobs. He has no issue about alcohol or drug use. Significantly, the psychologist noted that BR has a history of recurring sexual abuse over about a year by an elderly man when he, BR, was about eleven. 17. The psychologist noted that BR appeared to be ashamed and embarrassed by his actions. She said he relayed remorse and regret “but his insight into the harm done to the victims was shallow and lacking”. She said that he had great difficulty in explaining why he was sorry and why his behaviour had been wrong. She performed various tests on BR which not surprisingly showed that he had some depression and a low IQ. 18. The psychologist made an attempt to assess the risk of BR re-offending. She thought that was in the medium to low range based upon certain static factors but acknowledged that that did not take into account what she described as the dynamic risk factors. She did at the same time think that those dynamic risk factors suggest that he was amenable to change and would probably benefit from treatment. She recommended that he would be assisted by a sexual offender group therapy program and recommended that he be referred to CUBIT, which is a program offered by the Department of Corrective Services. 19. I take into account as well that BR will have to serve probably all of the sentence which I impose upon him in protective custody. He has been in protective custody since being imprisoned and is, I am satisfied, likely to remain so for the rest of his time in gaol. 20. Each of the victims of BR’s reprehensible behaviour provided a victim impact statement. Some of them were assisted by their mother because of their young age. 21. RJS, his mother noted since the offence, has become more violent and has had many suspensions and detentions and fights at school. He has used a knife. He himself is quoted as saying that he is very angry and sad about what happened to him. He has had to move schools. 22. There is a child whom I may have referred to as LH; he is a male and presently aged nine. He is not the same person as the girl also referred to as LH who is presently aged eleven. The boy LH also provided a victim impact statement. His mother pointed out that he appears very confused about his own sexuality as a result of the offences. He has changed his appearance as a result and has developed certain problems in sleeping. He himself described himself as being sad about what happened and having changed a lot and suffering from nightmares. He also noted that he has had to change schools. 23. DH is the boy now aged ten. He described himself as being really scared and unsure what was going on when BR was committing these offences. He thought he was like a proper father until it started happening. He said he has changed a lot. People found out at school and he has had to change schools. This has resulted in a disruption to his life. He has nightmares, he feels like there is evil in his room. He feels faint and sick when he gets pictures in his mind about what BR did to him. He gets startled when he is touched by people unexpectedly. 24. I am sorry, the one that I have just read out is by LH, the girl who is now eleven. I will now read out the relevant parts of DH, the ten year old boy. He said that what occurred to him affected his learning and he no longer reads as fast as he used to do. He said he is no longer as outgoing as he used to be, his mother observed that he seemed to have lost his spark. 25. The three year old boy’s victim impact statement was provided by his mother. She observed that what occurred had a huge impact upon the boy. She said his GP had noticed that his behaviour had regressed to being more like a two year old than a three year old. He had nightmares and would wake up screaming. He would kick his mother whilst sleeping in the bed and throw himself around yelling out “No, no, no” in his sleep. As it happens he was very close to his own father, the offender. The boy will not try new foods that the offender did not feed him.26. There are some legal principles which I need to refer to in approaching these sentences. The Court of Criminal Appeal pointed out in Regina v Fisher (1989) 40 A Crim R 442 at 445 that “heavy custodial sentences are essential if the courts are to play their proper role in protecting young people from sexual attacks by adults”. In Regina v Dent (unreported NSWCCA 14 March 1991) the court said that children are “...entitled to grow up free from defilement by sexual predators and free from risk of psychological upset, confusion and difficulties in later life, caused by such conduct”.27. I pause to observe that the victim impact statements clearly point to psychological upset and confusion and difficulty so far in the lives of the victims. I say at the same time that those very serious consequences are not surprisingly to be expected from offences such as these and would have been taken into account by Parliament in fixing the maximum sentence. To say that I do not find -and I do not - that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage in each case was substantial in accordance with s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is not to diminish the impact which these offences have had on each of the victims. 28. The standard non-parole period of fifteen years fixed by Parliament to the sexual intercourse offences against a person under ten are for offences in the middle range of objective seriousness following a trial which in turn resulted in a plea of not guilty. Nevertheless the standard non-parole period remains as a reference point after a plea of guilty.29. I should have added when noting BR’s personal information that he is now aged thirty one and pleaded guilty to all of the offences that I am sentencing him for. Some of the offences he pleaded guilty to at the earliest available opportunity. Others are acknowledged by Ms Gray, who appears for the prosecution, as being early pleas although not in the category of the earliest stages of pleading. 30. Returning to the legal principles which I need to take into account, in Regina v Davis [1999] NSWCCA 15 Wood CJ at CL, said on behalf of the court at [66] that “penile/vaginal penetration of a child is significantly more serious than many of the other forms of conduct encompassed within s 66A.”It is also acknowledged as a rule, subject to the facts of each case, that fellatio is regarded as a lesser standard of criminal behaviour than anal or vaginal penetration. At the same time the authorities acknowledge that forced fellatio can nevertheless fall within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Authority for that proposition is contained in Regina v Hibberd [2009] NSWCCA 20 at [10] where Tobias JA referred to the remarks of Simpson J in Regina v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575. Simpson J in the same case said that the kinds of factors which are taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of a s 66A offence include how the offences took place, over what period of time and with what degree of force or coercion, any use of threats or pressure and any immediately apparent effect on the victim. 31. Another factor which I need to take into account is that one of the offences, as I said, involved BR having his two year old biological son suck his penis. In Regina v Skinner (1993) 72 A Crim R 151 the Acting Chief Justice, Kirby J, as his Honour then was, said at 155:  
     
      
      “ 
      A number of the offences were committed against the respondent’s own natural child. In saying this, I do not mean to indicate that offences against the children of others were less serious. However, there is an inevitable element of repulsion and special shock when it appears that a person has committed such an offence against his own child 
      .” 
      
    32. I turn now to what I must do, that is to assess the objective seriousness of the offences that I am sentencing BR for. That involves an assessment of just how serious each of the offences is compared generally to offences of that type. The offence referred to as count 2 which is where BR incited RJS to touch his sister’s vagina was aggravated by being in the presence of a child and committed in the victim’s own home. The child of course was LH and the victim RJS lived in the home where the offence occurred. Those are both aggravating factors under s 21A(2)(ea) and (b) respectively. The crime already takes into account as an element of the offence that it was committed under authority. The maximum as I said is seven years imprisonment. Because of the aggravating features of being in the presence of a child and in the victim’s own home I regard that offence as being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 33. The offence which occurred on the same occasion where BR had penile/vaginal intercourse with LH was also committed in her home and in the presence of other children. That carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. I regard that too as falling within the middle of the range of objective seriousness but towards the lower end of that range. 34. The offence which occurred in the corridor on 27 September 2007 against LH aged ten also carried a maximum of twenty years. It was forced fellatio committed in the presence of other children and in the victim’s home. I regard that too as falling within the middle of the range of objective seriousness but towards the lower end of that range.35. Counts 7, 8 and 9 were the crimes of enforced fellatio committed in the hallway against DM aged nine, LH aged seven and RJS aged five. I should add - just before I speak further about those offences - that in relation to count 6, the sexual intercourse in the corridor with LH, I also take into account that she was the youngest age that a victim of that crime could be. Returning to counts 7, 8 and 9, Mr Hancock argues that I need to take into account that each of those offences was serious but of very short duration, momentary as he said. He argued that the section encompasses or contemplates far more serious behaviour than the momentary fellatio which was the subject of those counts. There was no physical injury involved nor any threats, pressure, force or coercion apart from the offender not letting them pass until they complied with his request. The ages of the victims were nine, seven and five respectively. Mr Hancock argued that those offences were all below the middle of the range of objective seriousness and I accept that submission. They all in my opinion, fall just below the middle of the range.36. Count 10, which is the same fellatio committed in the corridor by the two year old natural son of BR, falls in my opinion into a different category, because of the aggravating feature that BR was the biological father of the victim in that case and because of the fact that it was a gross abuse of trust and committed in the victim’s home as well as in the presence of other children. I regard that case as being within the middle of the range of objective seriousness for such crimes.37. Finally count 5 is the sexual intercourse committed against LH aged eight or nine which was full penile/vaginal intercourse. It was committed against her in abuse of a position of trust whilst she was under BR’s authority and committed in her own home. It is in my opinion, because of the nature of the intercourse and the circumstances of aggravation, within the middle of the range of objective seriousness.38. I now need to fix appropriate sentences for these crimes, having assessed where each lies in the range of objective seriousness. As Mr Hancock correctly points out, this involves fixing a penalty for each offence, considering matters of accumulation or concurrence and importantly the matter of totality. That is, whether the overall sentence reflects the overall criminality of BR’s behaviour.39. I start with counts 7, 8 and 9, the sexual intercourse offences committed against DM, LH - the boy LH - and RJS in the corridor at home. As I said, I accept Mr Hancock’s submission that they are below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Although the maximum is twenty-five years imprisonment for each of those offences, I regard an appropriate sentence for each of those as seven years imprisonment. BR has pleaded guilty to each of those crimes. Although there is some difference between the times at which he pleaded guilty to different offences, I propose to err in his favour. I propose to, because of his plea of guilty, discount that sentence by twenty-five per cent. I will round that off to two years, so that the sentence that I propose to fix for each of counts 7, 8 and 9 will be five years imprisonment. I should say that I take into account in looking at the seven years as an appropriate sentence before the discount, his limited amount of remorse and the fact that he will serve his sentence on protection.40. I turn now to count 2. I regard an appropriate sentence for count 2 as four years. That also takes into account the limited remorse and serving a sentence on protection. I will discount that by twenty-five per cent because BR has pleaded guilty. As a result I regard an appropriate sentence for count 2 as three years imprisonment.41. I turn now to count 6. That carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. I regard an appropriate sentence as eight years, taking into account the limited remorse and the fact that he will serve the sentence in protection. I discount that by twenty-five per cent and I will fix the sentence for that count as six years imprisonment. I should have added, in respect of count 2, that I also took into account the offence on the form 1, again s 61O(1) of the Crimes Act.42. Turning to count 3, taking into account the offence on the form 1 which involved fellatio and was count 4, I regard an appropriate sentence as nine years imprisonment. I propose to reduce that by two years, to reflect BR’s plea of guilty. The sentence for count 3 will be seven years imprisonment.43. Count 5 carries a maximum of twenty-five years imprisonment and a standard non parole period of fifteen years. I take into account counts 11 and 12, both acts of fellatio in company, which were themselves offences against s 66A of the Crimes Act. I need to take into account there as a guide or a reference point, the standard non parole period. I regarded that offence as within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. One starting point would be sixteen years imprisonment. However because of his limited contrition and the fact that he will serve that time in protection, I would reduce the overall sentence to ten years imprisonment. I would in turn discount that by some twenty per cent to eight years imprisonment. Hence the penalty for count 5 will be eight years imprisonment.44. Finally is count 10, involving the two year old BRJ. That too is an offence against s 66A and I need to take into account the fact that a standard non-parole period has been fixed. Again I would start with a nominal sentence of sixteen years imprisonment. Because of the significant aggravating features in that offence, I would regard the discount to ten years which I allowed in count 5 as too much and would regard an appropriate sentence as twelve years. Once again I take into account BR’s plea of guilty and I reduce that by twenty-five per cent, namely three years and I regard an appropriate sentence for count 10 as nine years imprisonment.45. I am going to sentence you now BR, if you would stand up. Obviously Ms Gray and Mr Hancock if you would follow the figures and we will check at the end that they work out.46. For the offence committed against the boy DM aged nine against s 66A of the Crimes Act, being count seven, I sentence you to five years imprisonment to commence on 18 December 2007 and to expire on 17 December 2012. Because of other sentences which I propose to impose there will be no non-parole period.47. In respect of count eight, where you had forced fellatio with the boy LH against s 66A of the Crimes Act, I sentence you to five years imprisonment to commence on 18 June 2008 and to conclude on 17 June 2013. For the same reason there will be no non-parole period.48. For count nine, the forced fellatio against the boy RJS against s 66A of the Crimes Act, I sentence you to five years imprisonment to commence on 18 December 2008 and to expire on 17 December 2013. Once again there will be no non-parole period for the same reason.49. For count two, which is the inciting of RJS to touch his sister’s vagina, an offence against s 61O(2), I sentence you to three years imprisonment to commence on 18 March 2009 and to expire on 17 March 2012. There is no non-parole period for the same reason.50. In respect of count six which is the forced fellatio with the girl LH in the corridor against s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act I sentence you to six years imprisonment to commence on 18 September 2009 and to expire on 17 September 2015. There will be a non-parole period of three years to commence on 18 September 2009 and to expire on 17 September 2012.51. In respect of count three which is the full sexual intercourse with LH aged ten against s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act I sentence you to seven years imprisonment to commence on 18 March 2010 and to expire on 17 March 2017. There will be a non-parole period of three years to commence on 18 March 2010 and to expire on 17 March 2013.52. In respect of count five, which is the full sexual intercourse with LH who was eight or nine years of age under s 66A of the Crimes Act, and taking into account the two offences, I sentence you to eight years imprisonment to commence on 18 December 2012 and to expire on 17 December 2020. There will be a non-parole period of four years commencing 18 December 2012 and expiring on 17 December 2016.53. Finally, in respect of count ten, the forced fellatio with your own biological son BRJ in the corridor against s 66A Crimes Act, I sentence you to nine years imprisonment to commence on 18 December 2016 and to expire on 17 December 2025. There will be a non-parole period of four years to commence on 18 December 2016 and to expire on 17 December 2020.54. The overall sentence is eighteen years commencing on 18 December 2007 and expiring on 17 December 2025. The non-parole period is thirteen years commencing on 18 December 2007 and expiring on 17 December 2020. Have a seat BR.GRAY: Your Honour, I’ve double checked the dates as much as my mathematical ineptitude suffices and they appear to be fine to me. There’s just two things I’d just like to raise. Your Honour in your Honour’s full remarks on sentence referred to the fact that in relation to count two and count three you were taking other matters into account. When your Honour was just formally delivering judgment then you just didn’t mention in relation to count two that you took the matter in the form 1 into account and in relation to count three that you took the matter into account on the form 1. Your Honour did that in relation to count five though.HIS HONOUR: I’m sorry, I don’t follow. I should have taken into account sentencing on count five, two and three.GRAY: That’s correct and you said in relation to count five that you took into account the form 1 but you didn’t make that same pronouncement in relation to counts two and count three just when your Honour was giving the formal--HIS HONOUR: Thank you.55. I add in relation to count two that I have taken into account the offence on form 1 and I have taken into account in the sentence I impose in respect of count three the offence on the form 1.GRAY: Thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: What was the other thing?GRAY: Those were the two things. Thank you, your Honour, may it please the court.HIS HONOUR: The overall sentence is eighteen years with a non-parole period of thirteen years. Mr Hancock?HANCOCK: I haven’t detected any error in your Honour’s calculations.HIS HONOUR: All right. I don’t think there’s much point in making recommendations or is there? I mean, so far as parole’s concerned that’s a long way ahead. Some judges - and I can do this if you like - ask that the psychological report accompany the offender into custody. What do either of you suggest so far as any?HANCOCK: I think your Honour’s suggestion as to the psychological report is appropriate, I would ask your Honour to do that.HIS HONOUR: I’ll do that in a moment, all right. Anything else? Conditions of parole I think I’ve just got to leave that to the Parole Authority.HANCOCK: I think that’s probably, in view of the sentence, appropriate to leave that to the Parole Authority.HIS HONOUR: Yes, all right. Ms Gray?GRAY: The only thing that your Honour did raise in your Honour’s remarks and is included in the psychological report is the referral of the offender to the CUBIT program.56. I direct that a photocopy of exhibit 2 in these proceedings, the psychological report from Duffy Robilliard authored by Misia Temler and dated 2 April 2009 accompany BR into custody and be provided to the appropriate authorities.Now, what physically happens? I can ask my associate to photocopy the original of exhibit 2, which is the appropriate thing to do. What should then happen? What should she do with it once she’s got a photocopy in her hand?GRAY: If your Honour would just pardon me for one moment.HIS HONOUR: Yes.GRAY: If your Honour’s associate would provide a copy of that report without any staples in it to my friend he will give it to his client.HANCOCK: I’ve got a spare copy your Honour that I can--HIS HONOUR: No, we should do it from the original.HANCOCK: As your Honour pleases.HIS HONOUR: Yes, I prefer that so it’s the actual exhibit or photocopy of the exhibit. So I think the exhibit’s on the file, as soon as I adjourn she will photocopy that and make it available to you Mr Hancock with no staples.57. BR, I have got to explain to you the sentence that you have got. I have given you individual sentences for all of those crimes for the reasons that I have given. The overall sentence is eighteen years imprisonment. It is a very heavy sentence. The non-parole period that you must stay in gaol is thirteen years. Your sentence is of course backdated to when you first went into gaol on 18 December 2007. But the first date that you will be eligible for parole is 17 December 2020. The Parole Authority decides whether you will be released on that day or not. Do you understand that? All right.HIS HONOUR: Ms Gray and Mr Hancock thank you for your assistance both of you, it’s been a very difficult sentencing exercise. I’ll now adjourn.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: The Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP) applied for prerogative relief in this Court, seeking to have orders made by his Honour Hughes DCJ on 20 August 2008 in the matter of the appeal of Mohammad Hossein Arab 08/21/0171 quashed.  
     
      
    2 The first respondent, Mr Arab, and the second respondent, the District Court, each filed submitting appearances. In the case of Mr Arab, the submitting appearance was filed in court by counsel for the DPP. The Court was informed that at a directions hearing before the Registrar, Mr Arab had indicated to the solicitor for the DPP that he would submit to the orders of the Court. An interpreter was present during the discussion between the solicitor for the DPP and Mr Arab. Subsequently, the solicitor for the DPP forwarded to Mr Arab a form of submitting appearance, which Mr Arab signed and returned to her. The DPP filed that appearance in court.  
     
      
    3 In the submitting appearance, Mr Arab submitted to: 
     
      
       
        
        “… all orders sought, and the giving or entry of judgment in respect of all claims made, save as to costs.”  
        
       
       
      The DPP informed the Court that it did not propose to seek an order for costs.  
       
      
    4 Mr Chris Withers appeared as amicus and provided valuable assistance to the Court. 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    5 On 14 November 2007, Mr Arab was arrested at a Bunnings Hardware store and was charged with an offence of ‘obtain valuable thing by deception’ and a further offence of larceny.  
     
      
    6 The ‘obtain valuable thing by deception’ charge arose out of a purchase by Mr Arab in circumstances where a Bunnings employee contended he saw Mr Arab swap the cardboard packaging cover of a pruning saw with a similar cover from a cheaper saw. The value of the pruning saw was $24.02. Mr Arab left the store, having paid the cheaper price for the saw and was subsequently stopped by store security. He contended that the substitution was inadvertent.  
     
      
    7 Mr Arab was also found to be in possession of a drill bit and a tape measure at the time he left the store. He claimed a builder at his house gave him the two items before he went to Bunnings. Mr Arab was charged with larceny of these two items.  
     
      
    8 Mr Arab comes from Iran. He came to Australia in 2006. It was accepted that his English is poor and that he requires a Farsi interpreter. An interpreter was present at the police station when Mr Arab was arrested and charged on 14 November 2007. 
     
      
    9 The charges came before a Local Court on 28 November 2007. There was no interpreter present on that occasion. However, Mr Arab was represented in court by a Legal Aid solicitor. The solicitor informed the court that he was instructed to enter a plea of guilty to both charges and to have the matter adjourned to 10 December, to allow Mr Arab time to provide references and the like to the court.  
     
      
    10 On 10 December 2007, Mr Arab appeared in court unrepresented, but with a friend present who could speak English. The matter was further adjourned to 19 December.  
     
      
    11 On 19 December 2007, Mr Arab was represented by a different Legal Aid solicitor. The solicitor informed the court that she had been instructed to enter pleas of not guilty to the charges. The presiding magistrate informed her that pleas of guilty had been entered previously. The matter was stood down in the list to give the solicitor the opportunity to clarify her instructions. During this break, the solicitor ascertained that the first solicitor had provided advice to Mr Arab that pleas of not guilty should be entered, but that Mr Arab had instructed him to enter pleas of guilty nonetheless. That advice had been confirmed in a letter that was available for consideration by the court. It appears that Mr Arab’s mother was ill in hospital and he did not want to burden her further, as he was ashamed of being involved with the law. Upon being informed of these matters, the presiding magistrate stated that she would mark the papers “For preparation of a s 207 application”. 
     
      
    12 The matter was stood over to 10 January 2008, to permit Mr Arab to prepare the application to withdraw his pleas of guilty. However, the matter was not ready to proceed on that day and it was again stood over. 
     
      
    13 The next relevant date was 30 January 2008. On that occasion Mr Arab appeared and was represented by a solicitor from Legal Aid. An interpreter was present. There was some confusion, both at the instance of the presiding magistrate and the solicitor appearing for Mr Arab, as to the source of the jurisdiction the magistrate was being asked to exercise. The solicitor referred to “[s 40] the equivalent of the old s 4”. The magistrate noted that the matter was listed for a s 207 application, “whatever [that] is”.  
     
      
    14 Notwithstanding this confusion, the application to withdraw the plea was made, but was refused. The Court then heard submissions in respect of sentence. At the conclusion of hearing the plea, the magistrate convicted Mr Arab on each offence and fined him $200. The magistrate ordered Mr Arab to pay court costs of $70 and also directed the property be returned to the owner. 
     
      
       
      The proceedings in the District Court  
       
      
    15 On 6 February 2008, Mr Arab filed an application for leave to appeal against a conviction entered after a plea of guilty. The grounds specified in support of his application for leave to appeal were: that he had a defence and wished to plead not guilty; that he was prepared to give evidence and had a witness who was prepared to attend court and give evidence in his case; that on 28 November 2007, he did not have the benefit of an interpreter to explain his case, or to understand the advice given by the Legal Aid solicitor; and that he arrived in Australia from Iran in July 2006. In the accompanying notice of appeal, Mr Arab specified as his only ground of appeal that he was “not guilty”.  
     
      
    16 The matter came before Hughes DCJ on 20 August 2008. Mr Arab appeared in person. Ms Coyle, appearing for the Crown, explained to his Honour the proceedings as they had unfolded in the Local Court. In particular, she informed his Honour that Mr Arab had made an application under the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 207 “for the conviction to be annulled” and that the application had been refused. The statement as to the nature of the application under s 207 was not correct. Section 207 provides for the setting aside of a conviction after the withdrawal of a plea of guilty. Ms Coyle further informed the court that the application for leave to appeal to the District Court was made under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, s 12.  
     
      
    17 Hughes DCJ determined that, as Mr Arab did not understand the proceedings in the Local Court because of his lack of English and the absence of an interpreter, he had effectively not been present when the conviction was entered. In his judgment his Honour stated that “for practical purposes [Mr Arab] might as well have been deaf and dumb”.  His Honour considered that Mr Arab’s application should be treated as an appeal as of right under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 11A pursuant to the refusal by a magistrate of an application for an annulment under s 4 of that Act. His Honour annulled the conviction and sentence and returned the matter to the Local Court for determination according to law. 
     
      
       
      Application for prerogative relief 
       
      
    18 The DPP applied for prerogative relief in this Court on the basis that Hughes DCJ had no jurisdiction to hear an appeal pursuant to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 11A. Mr Arab had not filed an appeal pursuant to that section and the underlying basis for bringing such an appeal did not exist. It was contended that His Honour had acted in excess of jurisdiction, first in deeming Mr Arab’s appeal to the District Court to be an appeal against the Local Court’s refusal of an annulment application and secondly, in purporting to determine such an appeal.  
     
      
       
      The legislation 
       
       
      The  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
        
       
      
    19 The Criminal Procedure Act, s 207, which deals, relevantly, with the setting aside of a conviction or order after a plea of guilty has been entered, provides:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        207 Power to set aside conviction or order before sentence 
         
         
        (1) An accused person may, at any time after conviction or an order has been made against the accused person and before the summary proceedings are finally disposed of, apply to the court to change the accused person’s plea from guilty to not guilty and to have the conviction or order set aside. 
         
         
        (2) The court may set aside the conviction or order made against the accused person and proceed to determine the matter on the basis of the plea of not guilty.” 
        
       
       
      The  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
       
      
    20 The Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, Pt 2 makes provision for the annulment of a conviction by the Local Court. Section 4 provides:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        4 Applications to Local Court 
         
         
        (1) An application for annulment of a conviction or sentence made or imposed by a Local Court may be made to the same Local Court:  
         
         
        (a) by the defendant, or 
         
        (b) by the prosecutor, 
         
         
          
          but may be made by the defendant only if the defendant was not in appearance before the Local Court when the conviction or sentence was made or imposed.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    21 The Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, Pt 3 provides for appeals from the Local Court to the District Court.  
     
      
    22 Section 11 provides an appeal as of right against conviction or sentence where a person has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court. The section does not apply in respect of conviction if the person was convicted in the person’s absence or following a plea of guilty.  
     
      
    23 Section 11A, which permits an appeal as of right in respect of the refusal by a magistrate of an application for annulment under s 4, provides, relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        11A Appeals as of right against Local Court’s refusal of application for annulment of conviction  
         
         
        (1) Any defendant whose application under section 4 for annulment of a conviction or sentence has been refused by the Local Court may appeal to the District Court against the refusal.” 
        
       
      
    24 The appeal that Mr Arab filed was an appeal under s 12 of that Act. Section 12(1) provides, relevantly:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        12 Appeals requiring leave 
         
         
        (1) Any person who has been convicted by a Local Court in the person’s absence  
        or following the person’s plea of guilty  
        may appeal to the District Court against the conviction, but only by leave of the District Court.” 
        
       
      
    25 Section 16 provides that the District Court may determine an application for leave to appeal by dismissing the application or by granting leave to appeal. If leave to appeal is granted, then, pursuant to s 18, the appeal is heard by way of re-hearing on the basis of the certified transcript of evidence in the Local Court. The District Court may, by leave, hear fresh evidence, but only if the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that fresh evidence be given.  
     
      
    26 The District Court may determine an appeal against conviction either by setting aside the conviction, or by dismissing the appeal: s 20. 
     
      
    27 Section 16A deals with the determination of applications under s 11A. If the application is allowed, the District Court must remit the matter to the Local Court. The trial judge purported to act under s 11A.  
     
      
       
      What application did Mr Arab make to the Local Court?  
       
      
    28 As mentioned, there was some confusion as to the basis upon which Mr Arab sought to withdraw his plea of guilty and, indeed, what the nature of that application was. However, it seemed that Magistrate Brennan, on 30 January 2008, accepted that the application was made under the Criminal Procedure Act, s 207, without having an understanding of its provisions. In the District Court proceedings, Ms Coyle also misunderstood the provision. Contrary to her statement to his Honour, the section does not deal with an annulment of a conviction. Rather it makes provision for the setting aside of a conviction, after a plea of guilty, but before the summary proceedings are finally disposed of.  
     
      
    29 The confusion caused the Court to raise the question of the meaning of “conviction” in s 207 and to ask whether Mr Arab’s application was made under that section, and if not, upon what basis it was made. 
     
      
    30 Strictly, these questions are a side wind, for two reasons. First, the question for the Court is whether the trial judge acted in excess of his jurisdiction in treating the application before him as an appeal under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 11A. Secondly, there can be no doubt that the Local Court has power to permit the withdrawal of a plea of guilty. However a brief excursus of the issue is useful so that there is a proper understanding of the processes that were engaged. 
     
      
    31 It is apparent from the considerable body of caselaw dealing with the meaning of “conviction” that the term has no fixed meaning.  
     
      
    32 In Maxwell v R [1996] HCA 46; (1996) 184 CLR 501 Dawson and McHugh JJ observed, at [9]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The question of what amounts to a conviction admits of no single, comprehensive answer. Indeed, the answer to the question rather depends upon the context in which it is asked. On the one hand, a verdict of guilty by a jury or a plea of guilty upon arraignment has been said to amount to a conviction. On the other hand, it has been said that there can be no conviction until there is a judgment of the court, ordinarily in the form of a sentence, following upon the verdict or plea.” 
        
       
      
    33 Toohey J, although dissenting in the case, expressed the same opinion, stating, at [15], that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The meaning of ‘conviction’ generally depends on determining the sense in which it is used in the statute under consideration. For example, where ‘conviction’ is used in the statutory context of sentencing guidelines, it clearly refers to the determination of guilt alone. While in the present case an understanding of conviction or convicted is to be considered in the general context of the Act, there is nothing in the Act relevantly to suggest that the common law understanding of these terms has been displaced.” (Citations omitted) 
        
       
      
    34 Toohey J footnoted the decision of Frodsham v O'Gorman (1979) 1 NSWLR 683. It is apparent from the decision of Hope JA in that case (Moffitt P and Mahoney JA agreeing in separate short reasons) that at common law a “conviction” occurs when there is a verdict of guilty after there is the acceptance of a plea. The matter then moves to judgment, that is, the passing of sentence: see Cobiac v Liddy [1969] HCA 26; (1969) 119 CLR 257. Both Hope JA and Mahoney JA referred to S (an Infant) v Recorder of Manchester [1971] AC 481 as authority for the proposition that, where an accused person has been convicted upon a plea of guilty, the court may, at least until judgment, that is, at least until sentence has been passed, allow the plea of guilty to be withdrawn and may set aside the conviction. 
     
      
    35 These and other cases were reviewed in Keys v West [2006] NSWSC 136; (2006) 65 NSWLR 668 by Hall J.  
     
      
    36 The DPP submitted that the recording of Mr Arab’s plea of guilty on 28 November 2007 and the standing of the matter over for sentence amounted to a “bare conviction” on that date that was sufficient to activate s 207. That is probably correct (see Griffiths v The Queen [1977] HCA 44; (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 301, 302, 311, 318 and 336) but it is not necessary for the disposition of this appeal to reach a firm view on the point. Section 207 allows an accused person “after conviction” but “before the summary proceedings are finally disposed of” to withdraw a plea of guilty. The final disposition of summary proceedings, where there has been a finding of guilt after a hearing or a plea of guilty, must mean after sentence has been imposed and recorded. There is no other “final disposition”. Should there be any doubt about that, Mr Arab would, in any event, have had a common law right to withdraw the plea: see Frodsham v O’Gorman; S (an Infant) v Recorder of Manchester.  
     
      
    37 One matter that can be said with certainty in this case is that Mr Arab did not make an application for an annulment of his conviction under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 4. Nor was he entitled to make such an application. Section 4 may only be invoked by a defendant where the defendant “was not in appearance” before the court when the conviction or sentence was made or imposed. The phrase “not in appearance” bears a certain linguistic novelty. It can only mean, to use the language of other statutes, “does not appear”.  
     
      
    38 Mr Arab appeared in court on 28 November. He was there in person and he had a solicitor appearing for him. There was no interpreter present on that occasion. Nonetheless, it is apparent there was sufficient communication between Mr Arab and the Legal Aid solicitor for the solicitor to be able to give advice to plead not guilty to the charges. Had the matter been forced on for hearing that day, a question of natural justice may have arisen. That, however, is a different question. 
     
      
    39 As Mr Arab did not make any application under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 4 to the Local Court for the annulment of his conviction he could not appeal under s 11A, nor did he purport to so appeal. There was no jurisdictional basis upon which his Honour could deem the application for the withdrawal of the plea of guilty to be an application for the annulment of a conviction. Nor could he treat an application for leave to appeal against conviction after a plea of guilty made under s 12 as an appeal against the refusal of an application for annulment. 
     
      
    40 Accordingly, I propose the following orders and declarations: 
     
      
       
      1. Order that the record of the District Court sitting in its criminal jurisdiction at Sydney on 20 August 2008 in the proceedings in the matter of the appeal of Mohammad Hossein Arab 08/21/0171 be removed to this Court and the orders of Hughes DCJ of that date purporting to annul the convictions and sentences imposed in the Local Court and remitting the matters to the Local Court be quashed;  
       
       
      2. Declare that the District Court fell into jurisdictional error in deeming Mr Arab’s appeal to the District Court to be an appeal against the Local Court’s refusal of an annulment application pursuant to the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
       2001, s 4; 
       
       
      3. Declare that the District Court fell into jurisdictional error in purporting to determine the appeal as an appeal under the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act  
      2001, s 11A; 
       
       
      4. Order that the matter be remitted to the District Court to be determined according to law; 
       
       
      5. No order as to costs. 
       
      
    41 MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Beazley JA. 
     
      
    42 HANDLEY AJA: In this matter I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of Beazley JA in draft. With one minor and presently irrelevant qualification I agree with her Honour’s reasons and the orders that she has proposed.  
     
      
    43 My qualification relates to the characterisation of what occurred in the Local Court at Hornsby on 28 November 2007. The only order evidenced by the transcript is that the matters were adjourned to the 10th of December. However the master cover sheet records the pleas of guilty, the adjourned date and contains the notation “F/S” indicating that the cases had been adjourned for sentence.  
     
      
    44 In Frodsham v O’Gorman [1979] 1 NSWLR 683 CA, 685, 688 Hope JA, delivering the principal judgment of the Court, held that the defendant had not been convicted on 1 July 1976 when the Magistrate accepted her pleas of guilty and committed her for sentence to the District Court pursuant to s 51A of the Justices Act. The conviction occurred on 8 October 1976 when the sentencing judge accepted the pleas and the defendant was called up for sentence. 
     
      
    45 It does not matter whether the respondent was convicted on 28 November 2007 following his pleas of guilty or on 30 January 2008 when his application to withdraw his pleas of guilty was refused and the Magistrate announced, as recorded in the transcript for that day, that the respondent was expressly convicted for each offence, fined and ordered to pay court costs.  
     
      
    46 The Local Court had jurisdiction to entertain his application to withdraw his pleas of guilty either at common law or pursuant to s 207 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 
     
      
    47 The orders proposed by Beazley JA should be made.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On the afternoon of 31 October 2007 the deceased, Kenneth Proctor, was watering the lawn outside his home in Sylvania. Although there were water restrictions in force at the time, it was permissible for the deceased to be carrying out this activity. As the offender was walking along the street, he started to abuse the deceased because he believed that the deceased was acting in breach of the water restrictions. 
     
      
    2 A heated exchange took place between the two leading to the deceased hosing the offender. As a result the offender entered onto the deceased’s property and approached him in a threatening manner, yelling abuse. The offender struck the deceased with a closed fist jolting his head back and causing him to stumble. The offender then pushed him to the chest with both hands causing the deceased to fall backwards forcibly to the ground. As the deceased attempted to get to his feet, the offender kicked him to the midsection with moderate force. 
     
      
    3 The deceased was able to regain his feet and the argument between the two was renewed. Neighbours who had witnessed the incident approached to intervene. One of these was an off-duty police officer. He told the offender to settle down and stop swearing. The offender said he had done nothing wrong and started to leave. The police officer however restrained him, placing him under arrest for assaulting the deceased. The offender said, “I have had a bad day. Look at my back I had to have an operation”. He then lifted his shirt showing a large scar to his lower back. He said, “See, things have been pretty bad, I didn’t mean to do it”. 
     
      
    4 While this conversation was occurring, the deceased became physically distressed and crouched to his knees. He seated himself on the lawn and then lay outstretched. The officer asked if he was all right but there was no response. The deceased’s face changed to a purple colour and there was no sign of breathing. The officer with the assistance of the offender started to perform CPR. Another neighbour then took over attempts to revive the deceased. Eventually the deceased was conveyed to hospital where life was pronounced extinct. 
     
      
    5 The deceased, who was aged 66 years, had a history of hypertension, and an enlargement of the left side of his heart. The autopsy revealed that he had severe and potentially fatal heart disease and had suffered a previous heart attack. His death was a result of a cardiac arrest due primarily to his existing heart disease. Death could have occurred at any time, however it was highly likely that his death was brought on by the altercation with the offender shortly before he died. The plea of guilty by the offender accepts that his acts contributed to the death of the deceased sufficient to make him criminally liable for the death. 
     
      
    6 The offender was arrested by a police officer who had attended the scene. He was weeping and his hands were shaking. He was taken to the police station and eventually charged with murder. He remained in custody until 6 March 2008 when Hidden J granted him bail. He was arraigned before me on 15 December 2008 on a count of murder but pleaded guilty to an alternative count on the indictment of manslaughter. The Crown accepted that plea in full discharge of the indictment. I continued his bail until 6 March 2009 on which date I remanded him in custody for sentence. 
     
      
    7 The offender was born on 23 November 1970 and hence was just short of his 37th birthday on the day of the incident resulting in the death of Mr Proctor. He has a record for driving offences of some seriousness but they can be disregarded in determining the appropriate sentence for the present matter. He has no record for violence. I am prepared to accept that he should be regarded as a person of prior good character. That finding is supported by a number of testimonials from members of the community placed in evidence before me. There is also no doubt that the offender is truly remorseful for the death of the deceased. This was apparent at the time of the death of the deceased by the offender’s attempts to assist in his resuscitation and the offender’s general demeanour at that time and later. It is also apparent in the testimonials before me and the references in reports to his being tearful when recounting the incident. 
     
      
    8 The offender suffered a devastating back injury and underwent spinal surgery in 2006. Unfortunately in early 2007 he fell causing further injury, disturbing the plates that had been inserted and fracturing one of the screws. This resulted in what his surgeon referred to as “intractable pain”. There was further surgery in July 2007 but the problems continued. On 31 October, the date of the incident, the offender had attended upon his surgeon. He was unwell with pain. The surgeon described him as being “sweaty and tremulous”. He had further x rays that day which revealed that one of the screws on the plate was broken. The surgeon revised his opinion of the effects of surgery and determined that the offender did not have a solid fusion. This may have been as a result of an infection. The surgeon “hinted” to the offender that that there would be a need for another operation. 
     
      
    9 There is little doubt that the offender was, at the time when he came across the hapless deceased, suffering the effects of pain that had been noticed earlier that day by his orthopaedic surgeon and frustrated by the fact that he would need further surgery. The pain made him irritable and hence his verbal, and ultimately, physical attack upon the deceased. He had consumed some alcohol but I do not think that has much to do with what happened. 
     
      
    10 Some of the events of the day leading up to the confrontation with Mr Proctor are set out in a psychiatric report tendered before me. I treat that account with some scepticism because the offender did not give evidence and so the material is untested. The offender said that he had taken a large amount of analgesic as he was to attend a TAFE course that evening. He had also consumed cans of alcohol because he was agitated by the consultation with his surgeon, the thought of further surgery and the effect of this prognosis upon his then girlfriend. He met his father and they went to the offender’s flat. The girlfriend was informed of the results of the consultation and was distressed. They went to lunch together but the girlfriend left in an emotional state. It was as he was trying to find her that he came across the deceased. I am prepared to accept this account and to some degree it is in accord with what the offender said to the off-duty police officer about his “having a bad day”. 
     
      
    11 The offender was released to bail from his remand custody in order to undertake further surgery. This occurred in July 2008. The surgeon believed that the procedure went well but the offender was slow to recover. His pain has returned and in January of this year he was still on high doses of narcotic medication. The surgeon does not expect that the offender will ever be pain free and it will be uncomfortable for him to sustain any prolonged position. He will clearly find it more difficult in custody because of his injury and would, I imagine, spend any sentence largely in the prison hospital. 
     
      
    12 There is little else in the psychiatric report of significance to the task of sentencing the offender. The offender has clearly suffered a chronic pain disorder as a result of the injury to his back and the subsequent surgery. I am satisfied that his irritability with Mr Proctor was a result of pain and disappointment with its prognosis. He had been suffering from depression and anxiety as a result of his injury and its treatment. He has also since the incident ruminated on the events leading up to Mr Proctor’s death and its effects upon himself and his family. There is a reference in the report to another matter that may need to be addressed by psychiatric assistance but that is long-standing and does not in my opinion have any relevance to the commission of the offence or to what punishment should be imposed upon the offender. 
     
      
    13 I am prepared to accept that the offender will need some psychiatric treatment to help him cope with a number of problems not the least being pain and the effect upon him of this offence. I do believe that this material gives rise to special circumstances in his case. The difficulty for him in serving a custodial sentence as a result of his constant pain and physical restrictions due to his injury are matters principally to be taken into account in determining the total sentence. 
     
      
    14 Of course sentencing is largely about the offender and I can understand that victims, and in particular the family of the deceased, may feel frustrated by the attention paid to the problems of the offender when they have themselves suffered grievously as a result of the death of the deceased. But sentencing is a complex task with various factors being taken into account in an attempt to derive a sentence that is just, both to the offender and the community. I wish to make it clear that I have not lost sight of the enormous impact upon the family of the deceased as a result of the actions of the offender. However I cannot increase the sentence because of that fact. But I am conscious that it must be particularly hard to cope with the loss of a loved one as a result of such a senseless act of violence inflicted upon a totally innocent person. When he died, the deceased was simply going about his life without wishing to disturb any other person, let alone a complete stranger who happened to come upon him in an irritable state of mind. 
     
      
    15 But sentencing can never be simply about trying to redress the loss suffered by the victim or victims or in some way determining punishment by assessing the value of the loss of a life. That would be an impossible task to perform. The simple fact is that nothing that I could do to the offender would compensate for the loss he has occasioned to the deceased’s family. Retribution is only one aspect of punishment although an important one when the offence involves the taking of an innocent life. But I have to determine the punishment appropriate not only to reflect the result of his actions but also to reflect the actual culpability of what the offender did. That is the difficulty in this particular exercise. 
     
      
    16 No matter how he has been portrayed in the media, the offender is neither a ruffian nor a bully. He is not a bad person in any shape or form. But he has committed a crime and must be punished for it particularly because he has caused the loss of human life. Part of that punishment must include an attempt to deter others from public violence. But in this case deterrence is very much of less significance than might otherwise have been the case where, for example, an intoxicated person picks a fight with another because of some perceived wrong occasioned to him. This case is in marked contrast to others that come before the courts where death has been a result of unprovoked violence arising from public drunkenness, hooliganism or plain thuggery displayed by young men. Those are matters of increasing concern to the community and call for heavy punishment. But this is not such a case. I do not accept the Crown’s submission that this is a suitable vehicle to denounce public violence generally. 
     
      
    17 This is a real human tragedy not just for the family of the deceased but for the offender and his family as well. It was simply the interaction of a number of factors none of which were the offender’s fault that resulted in him being primed as a time bomb waiting to go off on this particular day. The offence is at the low range of manslaughters by unlawful and dangerous act. An assault upon a 66 year old man with sufficient force to knock him off his feet and including a kick to his midsection is a dangerous act within the scope of the offence. It was a nasty assault and totally unwarranted, yet the force used was apparently not great. The injuries inflicted upon the deceased by the assault were relatively minor. If the deceased had not suffered from a very diseased heart, he would not have been seriously injured. If that had been the case, it is likely that the offence would have been no more serious that an assault. In any event had the deceased not died, the offender would not have gone to gaol for what he did. 
     
      
    18 But he must now be punished for bringing about the death of the deceased even though that death could have occurred at anytime without any assistance from the offender. The offence and its punishment must be seen from that perspective. Similarly the aggressive conduct of the offender must be considered in the context of the unchallenged evidence that he was suffering from chronic pain that left him irritable, frustrated and disappointed by the failure of surgery to bring him relief. It is clear that his particular state of mind was a result of the events of that morning and principally arose from the consultation with his surgeon. He was showing signs of distress and anxiety at that time. There was also his concern for his girlfriend and the emotional turmoil that had arisen that morning. 
     
      
    19 It should also be borne in mind that prior to this day the offender had not reacted to his terrible physical state by staying at home and feeling sorry for himself or by taking it out on others because life was unfair to him. Nor had he used his injury and constant pain as an excuse for getting drunk and misbehaving himself. Nor did he turn to illegal drugs as is often the case with people who seek to relieve themselves from life’s difficulties. Rather he had tried to make the best of his position by seeking retraining at TAFE because he was restricted from carrying out his normal trade. Despite his injury, he was endeavouring to be a worthwhile member of the community. 
     
      
    20 I have previously expressed the view that the pattern of sentences for manslaughter are out of kilter with the maximum penalty for the offence and with sentences imposed for other offences. I believe that sentences for manslaughter often fail to reflect sufficiently the loss of life resulting from a serious criminal act. But whatever be the appropriate sentencing range for offences of dangerous act manslaughter, this is a case that would come towards the bottom of it. 
     
      
    21 The offender has been assessed as unsuitable for a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. This is because of a fear that his safety might be at risk because of the nature of the offence. It is ironic that because the offender is not a young thug, he cannot be given an easier option to serve a gaol sentence than has been provided to persons far more culpable than he. But his counsel quite properly conceded that as that option is not available there is no escaping the imposition of a full-time custodial sentence. 
     
      
    22 A question has arisen as to the discount that should be given for his plea of guilty. A letter written by his counsel to the Director was placed before me for this purpose. However, the simple fact is that the offender did not offer to plead guilty to manslaughter in the Local Court. That may have been because of a concern as to whether the causation between the offender’s acts and the death could have been proved. But whatever the reason, the plea did not occur at the earliest opportunity and the utilitarian value of the plea was thereby reduced. The discount should be about 20 per cent from a sentence of 4½ years imprisonment. 
     
      
    23 The offender has served about 5 months in custody. The proper course where there has been a break in the period of remand custody is to backdate the sentence even though that may mean that the sentence commences upon a date when the offender was not actually in custody. There is a degree of fiction in the nominated commencement date. But that course is adopted so that the offender is assured that he actually has received credit for the period spent on remand and the sentence imposed does not appear to be unduly lenient by being reduced by the time served. So this sentence will date from 6 October 2008 but will not otherwise include the period he has already served. As I have already indicated, I have found special circumstances by reason of his need for psychiatric assistance on release. 
     
      
    24 I have considered the cases to which the Crown has referred me which are the one-blow cases of manslaughter or something similar. Although this was more than one blow, none of the assaults were of any significant force so far as causing injuries were concerned. The only injuries observed at the autopsy that can be attributed to the assault by the offender were as follows: grazes and bruising to the upper rear aspect of the scalp, bruising to the left side of the face, bruising and skin tears to both arms. As I have already indicated, I do not believe this offence is in the same degree of seriousness as offences where there was a very much more substantial connection between the assault and the death. The offence is also mitigated because of the cause for the aggressive conduct of the offender that was completely uncharacteristic to his personality. The sentence has been significantly reduced because of the effect of his injuries on his imprisonment. I understand that the sentence is a lenient one and is at the very bottom of the range but I believe it is appropriate.  
     
      
    25 The offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years 3 months made up of a non-parole period of 18 months to date from 6 October 2008 and to expire on 5 April 2010 and a balance of term of 21 months to commence on 6 April 2010. The consequence of that is that he must serve continuous custody until 5 April 2010 and then he is eligible to be released to parole.

   JUDGMENTSENTENCE1. I am going to sentence you now Mr Myatt and you know the routine from your experience with the courts. I am going to talk for about twenty or thirty minutes and then I am going to announce your sentences and I confirm the non-parole period will be no longer than your current one. 2. I am sentencing a young man for a series of crimes involving breaking and entering and damaging property. He was a drug addict at the time. That is not, sadly, an unusual job for a judge to be doing. What distinguishes this case is the remarkable contrast between the young man’s life and future prospects when he committed those crimes and now. Although he is presently in custody he is in the process of turning his life around from being a drug addicted criminal with no future prospects to a drug free life undertaking education and looking at some form of future employment. 3. Matthew John Myatt has pleaded guilty to four crimes. Two of them are break enter and steal against s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. They carry a maximum of fourteen years imprisonment. One of them is break and enter with intent, an offence against s 113(1) of the same Act, carrying a maximum of ten years and the fourth crime is malicious damage to property. That has a maximum of five years imprisonment fixed by s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. 4. The offences were all committed in the early hours of 6 September 2007. Briefly this is what happened. A building at 8-10 Palmer Street, Parramatta is by the sounds of it a commercial building. There are suites in the building which contain offices of various businesses. Mr Myatt has agreed that in the early hours of 6 September 2007 he broke into the building and broke into a number of those offices. From one of the offices he stole a camera and currency, from another office he stole another camera. Another office he broke into but did not find anything to steal. Not only that he obviously made a serious attempt at breaking into a large number of the other offices. 5. Police when they were called the next morning found extensive damage to many doors and glass panels and windows within the office complex. Mr Myatt was obviously determined to get as much as he could from the people who operated their businesses from that building. The damage which he caused was substantial, it took about six months to be completely repaired. It must have caused a huge amount of inconvenience to the owner of the building and to the owner’s tenants.Mr Kiru, I’m just going to stop here. The damages, it says here $50,000 is that right? On page 3 of the facts.KIRU: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: That was the estimate is it, $50,000?KIRU: Yes, that’s the cost of repairs, yes your Honour.6. The cost of repairs is estimated to be in excess of $50,000 which although covered by insurance nevertheless has resulted in a payout of a large amount of money. The consequence also is that insurance companies charge their clients higher premiums and charge other clients high premiums because of having to pay out claims such as this.7. The reason that Mr Myatt committed these crimes becomes obvious when I read exhibit 1 which is a report by Suzanne Freeman dated 20 December 2007. She is a registered psychologist. She highlights a history of very serious drug addiction starting with cannabis graduating through ecstasy and amphetamines to smoking and then injecting heroin regularly. His drug habit at stages, according to the pre-sentence report which is part of exhibit A, got up to $1,000 or $1,200 a day. The pre-sentence report prepared by Pauline Jeffress, a Probation and Parole officer and dated 2 April 2009, also notes a problematic history of alcohol and problems with gambling as well. These addictions in Mr Myatt’s life obviously explain but do not excuse his behaviour. 8. This is not the first time that Mr Myatt has been before the courts. Ever since he was a juvenile he has been committing crimes. Included amongst those crimes are a number of offences similar to the ones which I am sentencing him for. He has convictions for breaking and entering and malicious damage. He has served time in custody for such offences before now. Of significance in this criminal record were sentences imposed on 3 March 2008. They were imposed by the Parramatta Drug Court. They were for aggravated breaking and entering, committing serious indictable offences which were committed on 2 October 2007, about a month after the crimes that I am sentencing him for. He was sentenced to three and a half years imprisonment for one of those crimes and three years imprisonment for the other. The non-parole period effectively expires on 9 September 2010. In addition the Drug Court referred him to the Compulsory Drug Treatment Program at Parklea. 9. That was a very significant referral and explains my opening remarks. Since going into the Compulsory Drug Treatment Program at Parklea Mr Myatt has made very significant progress. There are three stages in the program : he has gone from stage one to stage two although one setback put him back into stage one but he persevered and is now back into stage two. 10. In the stage that he is at now he has undertaken a course of study at TAFE in Information Technology. He is hoping to continue that course beyond the semester that he is currently undertaking. He is enjoying the course which is not surprising because the psychologist’s report notes that he obtained exceptional marks for Science at school and high marks for Mathematics. In fact the psychologist assessed his IQ at 114, in the above average range. He is obviously a young man with a good deal of potential. In addition to the leave which he is granted for his education he has what is called social leave and spends time with his mother at the weekend. His program is very full which explains why he is not looking for employment at the moment but his plans include looking for some form of employment at an appropriate stage. He wants to obtain qualifications, stay clean and live what he described appropriately as a normal life. The rehabilitation programs he is offered in custody are obviously working well with him and he is participating. 11. The pre-sentence report confirms much of the material contained in the psychologist’s report including his history of drug addiction. It noted that he was transferred to the Compulsory Drug Treatment Centre on 18 April 2008, obviously after a successful assessment. The support of his mother will be sustained ,according to the probation officer, as he continues to make efforts to change his life. The report assessed him as unsuitable for a Community Service Order and ineligible for a Periodic Detention Order. 12. I need now to sentence Mr Myatt for these crimes which he has committed. Ms Maranga who appears for him asks that I impose sentences which are concurrent with his present sentences. She points out that the crimes were committed fairly close in time and that I can in fact be more confident of his prospects of rehabilitation than the Drug Court was on 3 March 2008 when it referred him to the program he is now undertaking. I accept that submission and regard his prospects of rehabilitation as good. 13. Mr Kiru who appears for the prosecutor fairly acknowledges the merit of Ms Maranga’s submission and in fact draws my attention to provisions of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 and the Drug Court Act which may be relevant to the amount of time which Mr Myatt should serve on a non-parole period. 14. I propose to accept Ms Maranga’s submission and sentence him to sentences the non-parole periods of which will expire during the currency of his present non-parole periods. The reason that I do that is because of my assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation. In addition I would regard the prospect of him going from the Compulsory Drug Treatment Centre where he will be until late next year into the general prison population to serve out the balance of any non-parole period which I could impose as being highly undesirable for those prospects of rehabilitation. 15. Turning to the sentences for the two offences of break and enter and steal I regard appropriate sentences for each of those as four years but because he has pleaded guilty I propose to sentence him to three years imprisonment for each. There are obviously special circumstances which warrant adjusting the ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term and I will fix a non-parole period of two years. For the offence of break and enter with intent I regard an appropriate sentence as three years but because of his plea of guilty I will reduce it to two years with a one year non-parole period having regard to the special circumstances. An appropriate sentence for the malicious damage which was extensive is eighteen months imprisonment and I will reduce that by six months to twelve months imprisonment because of his plea of guilty.16. Would you stand up Mr Myatt. Mr Myatt, for each of the offences of break and enter and commit serious indictable offence I sentence you to three years imprisonment. I set a non-parole period for each of those to commence on 10 June 2008 and to expire on 9 June 2010. The balance of the term in each case will be one year from 10 June 2010 to 9 June 2011. For the break and enter with intent I sentence you to two years imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one year to date from 10 June 2008 and to expire on 9 June 2009. The balance of the term will be one year to commence on 10 June 2009 and to expire on 9 June 2010. For the malicious damage offence I sentence you to one year imprisonment to commence on 10 June 2008 and to expire on 9 June 2009, because that will expire during your non-parole period I will not fix a non-parole period for that sentence. Have a seat for a moment. Now Mr Kiru, Ms Maranga--KIRU: Your Honour has to refer the matter to the Drug Court.MARANGA: That will be my application your Honour.HIS HONOUR: First though the figures, is there any problem with the figures, any miscalculations, anything that doesn’t add up or work out?MARANGA: No your Honour.KIRU: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right. Now Mr Kiru, you were saying the Drug Court, what’s the Act?KIRU: Section 106W, volume 3 your Honour.HIS HONOUR: That seems right Ms Maranga, I should refer him under section 106W(1), do you agree?MARANGA: Yes your Honour, that’s my application.17. Under s 106W(1) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 I refer Mr Myatt to the Drug Court.MARANGA: Can I ask for the mention today, so that it doesn’t affect his custodial status, I ask if the matter could be mentioned before the Drug Court today.HIS HONOUR: That’s fine by me, do you want me to direct that? Is it sitting today?MARANGA: Yes.KIRU: Yes but I don’t think that’s going to effect, your Honour, I don’t know whether it is practicable because--HIS HONOUR: I’ve referred him, if you can get him in that’s fine. I’ll leave it up to you.MARANGA: Court pleases.HIS HONOUR: I haven’t specified any conditions of parole - no, because they’re under three years I need to direct.KIRU: He’s serving another sentence your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Yes. It looks as though I make the order under section 50 even though he may not be eligible. 18. Under s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make orders directing the release of Mr Myatt on parole on 9 June 2010. KIRU: Subsection 2 your Honour it makes clear that--19. I also direct his release to parole on 9 June 2009. I will explain that to Mr Myatt in a moment but that seems to be what I need to comply with s 50.Are there any other orders that I need to make?KIRU: No your Honour.20. Mr Myatt, I’ve given you three years, I’ve allowed the discount because you pleaded guilty. Your three years I backdated to the same time that your Drug Court sentence started, 10 June 2008, so your three years finishes on 9 June 2011, do you understand that? Your non-parole period effectively two years, there’s a couple of non-parole periods and one fixed sentence. The overall effect is it will finish on 9 June 2010. Although I’ve made an order directing your release on 9 June 2009 and 9 June 2010 that won’t happen. I have to make that order because you’re still subject to the earlier non-parole period which expires in September 2010, do you understand that, but I have to formally make that order. So you will be released on parole, it seems to me on the information that I have or you will be eligible to be released on parole, on 9 September 2010, do you understand that? That’s under the other order, the Drug Court order. You’ve heard what I had to say, you really are underway in changing your life around which is very good for a judge to see. Congratulations, keep up the good work.

   1 The offender pleaded guilty to two offences of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death. Each is an offence contrary to s 52A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Each carries a maximum available penalty of 14 years imprisonment. No standard non-parole period applies.2 In each case, the circumstance of aggravation is that there was present in the offender’s blood the prescribed concentration of alcohol, ie 0.15 grams in 100 millilitres of blood. The alcohol concentration in the offender’s blood when it was tested some time after the accident was 0.161.3 The victims were Cheryl and Peter Lowe, husband and wife. 4 The offender pleaded guilty on 5 November 2008. At that time, she requested the revocation of bail. She has been in custody since 5 November 2008. It is appropriate that the sentences date from then. 5 While the immediate circumstances of the offences are known, the preceding events are unclear. The immediate facts are that, at about 11.45pm on Friday, 1 February 2008, the offender was driving her vehicle south on Cessnock Road towards Gilliston Heights. The road was wet from recent rainfall. The deceased were travelling north on Cessnock Road. There was an unbroken, double line separating north and southbound lanes. The speed limit was 60 kilometres per hour. About 110 metres south of the New England Highway, the offender was negotiating a slight right hand bend. Her visibility was clear. Her vehicle crossed the double unbroken lines onto the wrong side of the road, where it collided head on with the vehicle in which the deceased were travelling. The collision occurred well into the northbound lane, not close to the centre line.6 The deceased were trapped in their vehicle. They sustained critical injuries from which they died at the scene. The offender was trapped in her vehicle. She was taken to the John Hunter Hospital, where she was found to be suffering from a fractured right patella and fractured right ankle. At 1.30am, that is about one and three-quarter hours after the accident, her blood sample was taken, revealing the reading of 0.161 grams per 100 millilitres of blood.7 A forensic scientist from the Police Force states that a concentration of 0.161 would result in some impairment of driving skills, particularly in an emergency situation. In the vast majority of individuals, there would also be impairment to general driving ability.8 When spoken to by police, the offender said that she did not recall anything of the night. There is material in a psychiatric report tendered by the offender. That material is not necessarily accepted by the Crown and I therefore do not place much weight upon it. However, I note that the offender told Dr Allnutt that, against a background of being upset at seeing her ex partner, she was drinking in Maitland. It was raining heavily. She remembers falling asleep in the back of her car, waking and thinking that it was almost morning, although it was still dark, and then driving off in the vehicle. I do not rely upon those assertions. I refer to them because they are, at least, consistent with the statement of facts tendered by the Crown.9 There is no evidence as to the hotel at which the offender was drinking, although it was a Maitland hotel. There is no evidence as to her ultimate destination. Consequently, there is no evidence as to the length of the trip upon which she had embarked when the collision occurred.10 The Court has been provided with a number of victim impact statements. They tell of the tragic and enduring consequences of the offences for the near relatives of the deceased. In particular, I make reference to the only son of the deceased, who lost his parents only 500 metres from their home in Maitland. On the day in question, they had just acquired a new horse float. They were very interested in trotters, in the harness industry, and they trained trotters. They were very happy at the acquisition of the new horse float. They had spent the day with family members. Mrs Lowe’s sister and her family had visited that day. At the conclusion of an apparently happy day, with everything before them, they lost their lives. There are also victim impact statements from other relatives of the deceased, from Mr Lowe’s elderly mother, from sisters of each of the deceased, stating that the deceased were hardworking people with everything to look forward to. The Court acknowledges the loss to the immediate family, particularly the only son of the deceased. 11 There is a good deal of material before the Court in relation to the offender. She was 40 years old at the date of the accident and is now 41. She has no prior criminal record. There are a couple of speeding matters, nothing of any great moment. In 1995 there was an offence of driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol in Queensland but, as the offender’s legal representative has pointed out, that was many years prior to the current offence. She is a person with no significant prior criminal record. She is a person of excellent character. As a sole parent, she is an excellent mother to her son, now 12 years of age. She has been a caring and loving person towards friends and family. 12 The offender left school in Year 8. She has a good work history, mainly in the hospitality industry. There were a number of significant issues in her upbringing to do with abuse, but I need not go into those matters. What is more significant is that for a period of some years leading up to a matter of months before the offence, the offender had been involved in a destructive and abusive relationship with an amphetamine addict, whose behaviour was demanding and controlling. She left him about three months before the offence, but he continued to harass and intimidate her. 13 Although, as far as her immediate family and friends were concerned, she was not someone who abused alcohol or drugs (her immediate family was very opposed to the abuse of such substances) in fact, in the course of the destructive relationship with her former partner, the offender had turned to alcohol and, at times, to amphetamines. At times, she had consumed alcohol to the point of blackout. She told Dr Allnutt that she saw her former partner on the evening in question. It was after that, that she used a great deal of alcohol before having what turned out to be a relatively short sleep, and then driving. 14 It is clear that the destructive relationship drained the offender of many resources, not only personal resources, but also financial resources. There is reference to the fact that she lost her house and a great deal of money in the course of the relationship.15 In sentencing the offender, the Court is required to have regard to what have been referred to as guideline judgments, they being the decisions in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252. Those cases identified what has been referred to as a typical case under s 52A(1) and (3), ie non-aggravated dangerous driving, and to features which might aggravate such an offence. The typical factors and aggravating features are relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the subject offences, although it seems to me that they are generally more designed to determine the objective seriousness of non-aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death or grievous bodily harm.16 When one looks at the circumstances of aggravation set out in s 52A(7), each of those matters is a matter that almost inherently involves an abandonment of responsibility. Therefore, the approach that has often found favour in determining where, on the continuum of moral culpability between momentary inattention and abandonment of responsibility, a particular case lies, is of less use when assessing the objective seriousness of an aggravated dangerous driving offence, as opposed to a non-aggravated dangerous driving offence. 17 In any event, I am called upon to assess the objective seriousness of this offence and in doing so I have regard to the features of a typical case and the aggravating features referred to in Jurisic and Whyte, to the extent that they may be relevant to the circumstances of the present offence.18 The Crown submits that there is a high degree of moral culpability associated with this offence and that it is therefore an offence of high level objective seriousness. 19 While the offence is a very serious offence, as attested to by the maximum available penalty in each case of 14 years, I do not agree that, compared to other cases of aggravated dangerous driving, there is a very high level of objective seriousness associated with these offences. Any offence of aggravated dangerous driving is an offence of grave seriousness. 20 In this case the aggravating feature, that is that the alcohol level exceeded 0.15, is established by reference to the presumption contained in s 52AA(3), but the level by which 0.15 was exceeded was not great. Second, while one may harbour many suspicions as to the length of the journey upon which the offender had embarked when the accident occurred, the evidence establishes no more than that she had travelled a relatively short distance. On the limited evidence available, it would seem that she had travelled at least a kilometre, maybe a couple of kilometres. The total length of the intended journey is unclear. There is no evidence of bad driving prior to the circumstances surrounding the collision and there is no evidence of a prolonged period of bad driving, probably only because the offender had just got in the car I might add. Nevertheless, there is no evidence of a prolonged period of bad driving leading up to the collision. As to the number of other road users who were put in danger, there is evidence from persons in two other vehicles. At 11.45pm on a Friday night, one would infer that there was some traffic on the road but again, in the absence of evidence, I would not infer that there was a moderate to high level of traffic activity on the road at the time of the accident. While other members of the public were put in danger, there is no evidence that there was a large number of such persons.21 One of the factors said to be present in a typical case is a plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value. I take that to mean a plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value in the sense that there is a strong Crown case. In this case, there was a strong Crown case because the Crown was entitled to rely upon s 52AA. By the same token, the plea of guilty was of some utilitarian value because, as the offender’s legal representative pointed out, there is not much difference between a reading of 0.15 and a reading of 0.16 and the circumstances preceding the collision, that is the events of the minute or hours prior to the collision, are not known. Consequently, the pleas of guilty were of some value.22 Any offence of this nature is a very serious matter, as reflected in the maximum available penalty. Compared to other offences of this type, the objective seriousness of this matter is not as high as can be the case, given the fact that there is no aggravating feature that would fall at the upper end of the range, such as evidence of poor driving over a significant distance. In saying that, I do not in any way intend to minimise the seriousness of either matter.23 I am required to consider the relevant aggravating and mitigating features under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. There is no particularly relevant feature under s 21A(2). As to the mitigating features under s 21A(3), the fact that the offender was a person of good character, is unlikely to re-offend and has excellent prospects of rehabilitation are factors that apply in many, if not the vast majority, of cases of this type and are matters to which, in this type of matter, less relevance generally attaches. 24 Remorse is commonly present in the case of offenders who commit this type of offence. I do accept the submission of Mr Little for the offender, that her remorse is of a higher degree than one commonly sees, in that she was so remorseful that she asked for bail to be revoked so that she could commence serving her sentence when she entered the plea of guilty on 5 November 2008. Before the Court, she presents as someone who is still extremely disturbed by her own conduct. That is also the impression that I gleaned from the evidence called before the Court. I accept that, not only is she remorseful within the meaning of s 21A(3)(i), but she has a very high level of remorse.25 This case has not been advanced as a case of hardship, and the offender’s 12-year-old son is being adequately cared for by relatives. However, in setting the overall sentence and the non-parole period, I do take into account the fact that he is a teenage boy. 26 I have referred to the plea of guilty. 27 The Court must have regard to the sentencing purposes in s 3A. The purpose of general deterrence looms very large in relation to matters of this type, particularly where the aggravating feature is the blood alcohol reading. It is for the very purpose of avoiding this outcome that the legislature has introduced a range of provisions designed to severely punish persons who drive with alcohol in their blood to the extent that it may affect the manner of their driving. General deterrence is a very important sentencing objective. In addition, accountability, denunciation and recognition of harm to the victims and their families are the primary sentencing purposes. There is no chance at all that the offender will re-offend, so considerations of rehabilitation and the like are not significant when it comes to sentencing.28 I have considered the JIRS statistics. I have also considered the table of cases to which Mr Little has referred me. The Crown has addressed some of those cases and has pointed out important differences between some of the cases and the matters before the Court. Two recent decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal that do provide some help are the decisions of R v Veatufunga (2007) NSWCCA 54, a Crown appeal, and Whybrow v R (2008) NSWCCA 270, a defence appeal.29 Although the offences occurred simultaneously, is appropriate that the Court impose partially accumulated sentences. That is essential to recognise that the offender’s conduct resulted in the death of not one person, but two.30 You are convicted of each of these matters. In relation to the offence involving Mrs Lowe, you are sentenced to a non parole period of three years. The sentence will commence from 5 November 2008. You will be eligible for release to parole on 4 November 2011. The balance of term is a period of one year. The sentence will expire on 4 November 2012.31 In relation to the offence involving Mr Lowe, I accumulate the sentence by a factor of 12 months. You are sentenced to a two year non parole period from 5 November 2009 to 4 November 2011 and a balance of term of two years. That sentence will expire on 4 November 2013. The earliest date on which the offender is eligible for release to parole is 4 November 2011. The effective sentence is five years with a three year non parole period. The special circumstance is that this is the offender’s first sentence of imprisonment.32 The matters on the s 166 certificate on the Crown application are withdrawn and dismissed.33 The offender is disqualified from holding or obtaining a licence until 4 May 2013.

     Judgment 
      
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Howie J. I agree with the order proposed, and, generally, with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    3 I expressly reserve my position in relation to the decision in R v Pullman (1991) 58 A Crim R 222. Since this Court was not invited to depart from the conclusions there reached, it would be inappropriate to reach a final view. I merely comment that the conclusions as stated are extremely broad; even if narrowed to encompass within the term “breach of some statutory or regulatory prohibition” only breaches of traffic laws, I am unable to see why such a breach could not form the basis of the ”unlawfulness” of an act necessary for a conviction for manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. That is a composite concept, and it is not every breach of traffic laws that would qualify – the act must also be dangerous, and sufficiently dangerous to justify the application of the criminal law. 
     
      
    4 With those reservations I agree with the judgment of Howie J. 
     
      
       
       
       
        
      The facts 
      
    5 HOWIE J: On Sunday 29 July 2007 at about 6.20pm, Mr and Mrs Howle were travelling in their motor vehicle along the Great Western Highway at St Mary’s. They were both aged in their 70’s. Mrs Howle was driving and her husband was in the passenger seat beside her. Mrs Howle had been stopped at a set of traffic lights and had just commenced to turn right out of the highway into a side street when there was an impact between her vehicle and that driven by the respondent. One observer described the impact as an explosion. So forceful was it that Mr Howle was thrown from the vehicle and died instantly. The Howle’s vehicle came to rest some 35 metres from the point of impact. Mrs Howle suffered grievous injuries and died at the scene. 
     
      
    6 At the time of the impact the respondent was engaged in racing two other vehicles along the Great Western Highway. Adam McDonald was driving one of the vehicles and Craig Johnson the other. The race had proceeded over a distance of about 5 kilometres and the vehicle driven by the respondent had reached speeds far exceeding the limit of 60kph. At the time of the collision the respondent’s vehicle was travelling at 120kph. The speedometer needle in his vehicle was stuck at 130kph and the tachometer needle at 2400 rpm. McDonald was travelling at about 100kph at the point when he applied his breaks just before the collision. 
     
      
    7 It was dark but the weather was fine. There were a number of persons in the area at the time who observed the manner of driving of the respondent and his co-offenders. They were seen to be travelling at high speed and weaving in and out of traffic. They stopped at a red traffic light and took off at high speed as soon as the light turned green. It is apparent that at times the three vehicles were in different lanes. 
     
      
    8 At about half a kilometre from the point of impact the vehicles again stopped at a red traffic light. At this stage the respondent was in the lane closest to the median strip. McDonald was in the outside lane and Johnson between the two. Again, when the light turned green, the three vehicles accelerated sharply and continued the race passing through a pedestrian crossing outside a licensed club. 
     
      
    9 As a result of the impact the respondent’s vehicle was out of control and turned 180 degrees to collide with the vehicle driven by McDonald. As a result of that impact the vehicle turned another 180 degrees and ended close to the Howle’s vehicle. Johnson’s vehicle managed to avoid the impact by travelling across the median strip. He did not stop. 
     
      
    10 The respondent was conveyed to hospital with minor injuries. A blood sample taken from him revealed that he had a blood alcohol reading of 0.031 and there was the presence of the residue of cannabis and methylamphetamine. Mr McDonald’s blood was sampled and revealed the presence of the residue of cannabis. Dr Perl was of the opinion that the most likely blood alcohol level of the respondent at the time of the collision was 0.063. She was of the opinion that there would have been some impairment of his driving skill from both intoxication by alcohol and drugs. 
     
      
    11 The respondent attended at a police station on 31 July 2007 and made a statement admitting he was the driver of the vehicle that impacted with Mrs Howle’s vehicle. He was arrested and refused bail. He remained in custody until the date of sentence. 
     
      
       
        
        The sentence 
        
       
      
    12 The respondent pleaded guilty to two charges of manslaughter on arraignment in the Penrith District Court. There had been a committal proceeding where witnesses were called because the Crown had been alleging that he had travelled through a red light. That allegation was subsequently dropped. McDonald pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter in the Local Court. The man Johnson died at some time after the incident. The statement of facts placed before the Judge stated that the basis of the manslaughter charge was unlawful and dangerous act. The nature of the unlawful act was not specified. 
     
      
    13 Manslaughter is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. The Judge sentenced the respondent to a total sentence of 9 years with an overall minimum period of 6 years to date from 31 July 2007. McDonald was sentenced to a total sentence of 8 years with an overall minimum period of 5 years to date from 5 November 2008. 
     
      
    14 The sentence imposed upon the respondent was made up of a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years from 31 July 2007 on the first count, relating to the death of Mrs Howle, and a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 4 years and a balance of term of 3 years from 31 July 2009 on the second count, relating to the death of Mr Howle. As a consequence the respondent is eligible to be released to parole on 30 July 2013. The respondent was disqualified from driving for a period of 6 years from 5 November 2008. 
     
      
    15 The Crown has appealed against the sentence imposed against the respondent. McDonald has appealed against the severity of his sentence. One of his grounds of appeal is disparity with the sentence imposed upon the respondent. The Crown has not appealed against the sentence of McDonald. At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal by the Crown against the respondent, McDonald sought an adjournment. This was not opposed by the Crown and was granted. 
     
      
       
        
        Subjective matters 
        
       
      
    16 The respondent was born on 6 May 1970 and hence was aged 37 at the date of the offences. He has a criminal record dating back to 1984 when he was before the Childrens Court for malicious damage. He received short gaol sentences in 1992 and 1994 for dishonesty offences. He had other offences including malicious damage by fire in 1992, child sexual assault in 1998 and possession of a prohibited drug in 2001. His traffic record includes a low range PCA in 1995 and 1999, a mid range PCA and drive whilst disqualified in 2001 and disobeying traffic lights and making an unlawful u-turn in 2006. 
     
      
    17 There was a psychological report in evidence. It contained little of significance given the respondent’s age and the nature of the offences. He was described as of about average intellectual ability. He was found to have a personality disorder characterised by inadequate impulse control, above average predisposition to substance abuse and low tolerance for frustration. He was said to be remorseful and accepting of responsibility for the deaths of the victims. He expressed a hope of developing a more responsible life-style. He was assessed as having a moderate risk of recidivism. 
     
      
    18 There was also what was described as a “psychosocial assessment report” prepared by a social worker. The respondent maintained to the author that the race was not pre-planned and that he had never been a party to or member of a street racing group. The report added little to that contained in the psychological report or to the considerations in sentencing the respondent for manslaughter. 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown Appeal 
        
       
      
    19 The Judge described the offending as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “It does not need words of mine to indicate that these were very serious offences. What we have is two men behaving in a totally irresponsible manner, with no regard for the rights and privileges of road users either themselves or of other people. They have in fact killed two very worthwhile, elderly members of the community because of their own stupidity and reckless acts. There can be no doubt that this represents a significant serious offence and indeed manslaughter in this case by unlawful and dangerous act, represents a major offence in the criminal calendar, as demonstrated by the fact that the legislature has seen fit to impose a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. The community is fed up to the back teeth with men misbehaving themselves in driving motor vehicles and putting other persons at risk. In this case the risk actually materialised. 
        
       
       
      With respect, the use of the word “stupidity” to describe the conduct of the respondent falls well below a proper characterisation of what was gravely criminal conduct. 
       
      
    20 The Crown submitted that the Judge made three specific errors in imposing what was alleged to be a manifestly inadequate sentence. They were: allowing a discount of 25 per cent for the respondent’s plea; the treatment of delay as a mitigating factor; and failing to treat the respondent’s criminal and traffic record as an aggravating factor. 
     
      
       
        
        Alleged errors by the sentencing judge 
        
       
      (a) Discount for guilty plea 
      
    21 The first matter taken into account by the Judge as a mitigating factor was the plea of guilty. The respondent was charged on 31 July 2007. He did not plead guilty in the District Court until 11 September 2008. There was a contested committal proceeding. The explanation for that proffered by the respondent is that the prosecution was at that stage alleging that he failed to stop at a red light, a fact that the respondent disputed. But that allegation did not in any way prevent the respondent from indicating in the Local Court that he would plead guilty to manslaughter but deny that specific allegation. Had he been prepared to plead guilty the prosecution might well have abandoned that particular allegation. But had it not done so, the respondent should have received the benefit of his preparedness to plead guilty in the Local Court.  
     
      
    22 However, notwithstanding that the plea was not an early one, the Judge gave him the benefit of a discount of 25 per cent. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        …….As I have said he entered a plea of guilty on arraignment. It was strongly argued by the Crown that the utilitarian value of that plea represented somewhere between twenty and twenty-two and a half per cent in accordance with R v Thomson and Houlton. I do not agree. The fact is that [the respondent] has, by his plea prevented the necessity of a trial of the matter and the utilitarian value of his plea, in my judgment, being entered on arraignment, which is the first occasion that he’s appeared before this Court, should carry with it the maximum discount in accordance with the principles set forth in R v Thomson and Houlton. So I allow him a discount of twenty-five per cent for his plea. 
        
       
      
    23 On its face this is with respect a curious statement to make. The Judge purported to give a discount in accordance with the principles in R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 yet determined that the discount should be at the top of the range notwithstanding that the plea was not made at the earliest opportunity. But the application of the guideline in Thomson and Houlton would indicate that the discount should be less than the maximum because it was a late plea entered after the respondent had been committed for trial. There is nothing in the guideline judgment that suggests that the relevant date for the determination of the discount is the first appearance in the trial court or the date of arraignment. 
     
      
    24 It should be noted that the co-accused McDonald pleaded guilty to manslaughter before the Local Court and was committed for sentence. The Judge awarded him the maximum discount on the application of Thomson and Houlton. A member of the community would be entitled to ask, how can it be that two persons get the same discount for their pleas of guilty yet one pleads guilty at the first opportunity before a magistrate and the other pleads guilty only after having been committed for trial some 13 months after arrest? The answer is that, on a proper exercise of discretion in accordance with the principles laid down by this Court, the discounts cannot be the same. The Judge’s discretion miscarried in respect of the respondent. 
     
      
    25 The apparent explanation for the discount given to the respondent lies in what occurred during the submissions on sentence. The following exchange between his Honour and counsel took place after defence counsel indicated why committal proceedings had taken place. The Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        His Honour 
        : Well yes [defence counsel] there’s one observation I want to make and that is and I made it recently and I’ll make it again. The practice in Penrith is to ensure that people are properly arraigned when they stand, come up before this Court, that is the charges are actually read out to them and they are asked to plead. It is not the practice in Sydney or in some other District Courts. The reason why I adopt that practice is that everybody knows that that‘s when the 25 per cent discount ceases. 
         
         
        Defence counsel 
        : Yes your Honour. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : Now people say from time to time, well what about the person who pleas guilty before committal but really that goes more to the remorse aspect of the plea than it does to the utilitarian value of plea. 
         
         
        Defence counsel 
        : Yes your Honour. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : So I’m minded at the moment, subject to hearing anything Mr Crown might wish to say to allow your client 25 per cent discount because he pleaded guilty on arraignment in this Court. 
         
        
       
      The Prosecutor contended that the discount could not be 25 per cent but conceded that it might be within the range of 20 to 22½ per cent. The Judge then went on; 
       
        
         
        HIS HONOUR: I understand what you are saying but Mr Crown the difficulty as I see it is that, as you know only too well, that the reason for the practice that I’ve adopted here is to make it absolutely crystal plain to everybody if they want the maximum discount for plea of guilty, it has to be done at or before arraignment. 
         
         
        PROSECUTOR: Of course your Honour in terms of Thomson and Houlton to get the real maximum discount for utilitarian benefit there should ideally be a plea in the Local Court as Mr McDonald did. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Well even further it should be as soon as he’s spoken to by the police hold up you hands and say “yes”. But I think that people say well where do you draw the line, I think you draw the line at arraignment and you get an extra discount in effect for the remorse factor. 
         
         
        PROSECUTOR: I agree with the remorse factor your Honour, I don’t wish to be heard on that. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: If you plead. 
         
         
        PROSECUTOR: I agree with that your Honour, I don’t wish to be heard in terms of that but as far as utilitarian discount, the Crown still submits 20 to 22 and a half, there is a discount obviously for remorse by pleading at arraignment because that really, that’s the last chance he’s got to try and get, I suppose, to maximise his discount for remorse and contrition and I accept that. 
        
       
      
    26 With respect this exchange shows a number of errors by both the Judge and the prosecutor. They include: the fact that a plea in the Local Court is only a matter relevant to remorse; that there was a discount attributable to remorse either by itself or together with the plea of guilty; and that a practice set up by a particular judge or a particular court could affect the amount of discount that should be awarded for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. With respect this sentencing exercise occurred in November 2008 and yet the law and practice relating to discounts for pleas of guilty was by then so well established by judgments of this Court and so readily available to the bench and counsel that it is difficult to understand how the dialogue set out above could possibly take place. 
     
      
    27 In Thomson and Houlton, the Chief Justice, when discussing the extent of the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [154] There are however two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case: 
         
        (i) The time at which a plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial. 
         
        (ii) The complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea. 
         
        
       
       
      It is clear that statements made by the Judge to the prosecutor failed to reflect that part of the guideline judgment in point (i) above. 
       
      
    28 The result was that the Judge’s discretion miscarried in relation to the exercise of his discretion in determining the value of the plea because he had set up a practice that was inconsistent with the decision in Thomson and Houlton and subsequent decisions of this Court. So far as his Honour was concerned, at least in the Penrith District Court and presumably only when his Honour was sitting in that Court, there was a regional practice that applied whereby the maximum discount was available when the plea of guilty came at arraignment regardless of when that occurred or whether there were committal proceedings in the Local Court. Hence the amount of the discount was being determined with insufficient consideration being given to the true utilitarian value of the plea. 
     
      
    29 With respect to the Judge, who was very senior and experienced, there is no place in the administration of the criminal law in this State for sentencing variations, including the amount of discount to be given for the plea of guilty, between District Courts or judges depending on where the court is sitting or whether there is in place a particular practice for the arraigning of accused persons who have been committed for trial to a particular court. Regional courts and judges of course may develop practices for the better management of their lists and the early determination of the issues at trial. They should be encouraged to do so. But those practices cannot be founded upon rewards for compliance, such as sentencing discounts, that do not accord with the general law of this State as determined by the judgments of this Court unless that variation has been prescribed by the legislature. 
     
      
    30 The Court is aware from sentencing decisions that have come before it that there is, or has been, a similar practice adopted by some judges in other regional courts. Discounts for pleas of guilty have been awarded depending upon when the plea of guilty comes in the proceedings in the District Court and disregarding what has taken place in the Local Court. Such a practice has no validity in law and is offensive to the principle that equal justice applies throughout the criminal courts of this State in accordance with established sentencing principles determined by the legislature or by the appellate courts. 
     
      
    31 As a matter of general practice, the maximum discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty should be awarded only to those accused persons who plead guilty in the Local Court and continue that plea of guilty in the District Court. There may be a valid reason in the exercise of discretion for awarding the maximum discount where the plea of guilty does not occur until the District Court but that would be exceptional and arise from the peculiar factual situation in a particular case. The amount of the discount cannot depend upon the practice of the particular court based upon its administrative arrangements. It is difficult to see how, in the usual case, a plea of guilty on arraignment could justify a discount of more than about 15 per cent. There was nothing in the present case that justified a discount above that range. 
     
      
    32 It should not be necessary to do so, but, because there appears to be discrepancies in the application of the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea, it is apposite to set out in point form the principles laid down by this Court and to be applied by sentencing courts. Of course these are principles of general application and are subject to the scheme set out in Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008 and regulations made under that Act: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas will be determined largely by the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater discount:  
        Thomson 
         at [154] 
        ; 
         Forbes 
         [2005] NSWCCA 377 at [116]. 
         
         
        2. Some allowance may be made in determining the discount where the trial would be particularly complicated or lengthy:  
        Thomson 
         at [154]. 
          
         
         
        3. The utilitarian discount does not reflect any other consideration arising from the plea, such as saving witnesses from giving evidence but this is relevant to remorse:  
        Thomson 
         at [119] to [123]; nor is it affected by post-offending conduct:  
        Perry 
         [2006] NSWCCA 351 
        . 
         
         
        4. The utilitarian discount does not take into account the strength of the prosecution case:  
        Sutton 
         [2004] NSWCCA 225. 
          
         
         
        5. There is to be no component in the discount for remorse nor is there to be a separate quantified discount for remorse:  
        MAK and MSK 
         [2006] NSWCCA 381;  
        Kite 
         [2009] NSWCCA 12 or for the “Ellis discount”;  
        Lewins 
         [2007] NSWCCA 189;  
        S 
         [2008] NSWCCA 186. 
         
         
        6. Where there are multiple offences and pleas at different times, the utilitarian value of the plea should be separately considered for each offence:  
        SY 
         [2003] NSWCCA 291 
          
         
         
        7. There may be offences that are so serious that no discount should be given:  
        Thomson 
         at [158];  
        Kalache 
         [2000] NSWCCA 2; where the protection of the public requires a longer sentence:  
        El-Andouri 
         [2004] NSWCCA 178. 
          
         
         
        8. Generally the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant because, if it is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value is reduced:  
        Stambolis 
         [2006] NSWCCA 56;  
        Giac 
         [2008] NSWCCA 280. 
          
         
         
        9. The utilitarian value of a delayed plea is less and consequently the discount is reduced even where there has been a plea bargain:  
        Dib 
         [2003] NSWCCA 117;  
        Ahmad 
         [2006] NSWCCA 177; or where the offender is waiting to see what charges are ultimately brought by the Crown:  
        Sullivan and Skillin 
         [2009] NSWCCA 296; or the offender has delayed the plea to obtain some forensic advantage:  
        Stambolis 
         [2006] NSWCCA 56;  
        Saad 
         [2007] NSWCCA 98, such as having matters put on a Form 1:  
        Chiekh and Hoete 
         [2004] NSWCCA 448. 
          
         
         
        10. An offer of a plea that is rejected by the Crown but is consistent with a jury verdict after trial can result in a discount even though there is no utilitarian value:  
        Oinonen 
         [1999] NSWCCA 310;  
        Johnson 
         [2003] NSWCCA 129 
          
         
         
        11. The discount can result in a different type of sentence but the resulting sentence should not again be reduced by reason of the discount:  
        Lo 
         [2003] NSWCCA 313. 
          
         
         
        12. The amount of the discount does not depend upon the administrative arrangements or any practice in a particular court or by a particular judge for the management of trials or otherwise. 
         
        
       
      The last of these principles is derived from the present judgment and is included for completeness. 
       
      
    33 There also appears to be some looseness in the use of the expression “a discount” that is apparent in the exchange between the prosecutor and the Judge set out above. Since Thomson and Houlton a “sentencing discount” should be taken to mean a reduction in the otherwise appropriate sentence by a quantifiable amount due to a specific policy consideration. Such a discount is applied after the otherwise appropriate sentence has been determined. There are two sentencing discounts that have been identified: a discount for the plea of guilty and a discount for assistance. Where both these discounts apply they should be combined: R v SZ [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 at [11]. The High Court has indicated that there should be limited use of “arithmetical deduction” in determining an appropriate sentence: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [39]. 
     
      
    34 There are also matters that mitigate the sentence. They are taken into account in the general synthesis to determine what is the appropriate sentence before the application of a discount. The mitigating factors include remorse and what has come to be known as the “Ellis discount”, although R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 was decided at a time when separate and discrete discounts in sentencing had not been recognised. 
     
      
    35 There is the possibility of at least confusion and perhaps even error occurring by referring to any general mitigating factor as giving rise to “a discount”. For example, in his sentencing remarks the Judge stated in reference to the respondent: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………I am satisfied that in fact he is remorseful and that is strongly shown by his plea of guilty. Subsection 3(k) is involved, that is the plea of guilty. I have already indicated how I intend to take it into account in relation to the utilitarian value of the plea. As far as the remorse factor is concerned a plea of guilty is always evidence or contrition and remorse or at least it is in most cases and it certainly is in this case. But I wish to make it plain that I have given one discount for remorse, not two. 
        
       
      
    36 In the present case the discount for the plea of guilty was unduly favourable to the respondent as a result of the erroneous exercise of discretion of the Judge and should have been no more than 15 per cent. However, in light of the fact that the prosecutor erroneously conceded before the sentencing judge that the discount should be 20 to 22½ per cent, I am of the opinion that the Court should not interfere with the sentence on this basis. 
     
      
       
      (b) Delay as a mitigating factor 
      
    37 The next mitigating factor taken into account by the Judge was delay between the date of the arrest of the respondent and the date of sentencing. The Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The next matter to which I wish to refer is the delay that has occurred in this matter coming on for hearing. [The respondent] has been in custody now since 31 July 2007. That is a period of over fifteen months. Some of that delay has been obviously due to the necessity to conduct a committal hearing but nevertheless the fact is that the delay is significant and in accordance with the principles set forth by Sir Laurence Street in R v Todd, I take the delay into account as a discounting factor in [the respondent’s] favour because of the two matters mentioned by Sir Laurence, first that he has managed to behave himself in gaol and there’s no suggestion of anything other than progress and rehabilitation. Second, because he has had this sentence hanging over his head, as a sword of Damocles for a significant period of time. 
        
       
      
    38 The Crown contends that it was an error for the Judge to apply the principles arising from R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 in the circumstances of this particular case. It is noted that the respondent had sought, and was granted, an order for the attendance of witnesses for cross-examination at the committal proceeding. The respondent was committed to stand trial on 18 June 2008 and the matter was listed for arraignment in the District Court on 31 July and 28 August 2008. On both occasions the matter was adjourned on the application of the respondent. 
     
      
    39 Todd was a very singular case where the sentencing proceedings for a “stale offence” had been delayed for 5 years while the offender served a period of custody in another state. The judgment of the Court is principally concerned with the issue of totality but so far as the Judge in the present case sought to rely upon the judgement of Street CJ, the headnote to the case adequately summarises the sentencing principle derived from that decision as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (2) Where an interstate sentence has postponed a sentence hearing, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of the earlier sentence, to the fact that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to the subsequent sentence and to the fact that when sentencing for a stale crime a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility is necessary. 
        
       
      
    40 Of course the principle in Todd has general application where there has been extensive delay for whatever reason between the date of the commission of the crime and the date upon which sentence is imposed. But the decision does not stand for the proposition that delay will result in leniency being afforded to the offender regardless of the reason for the delay, the extent of the delay, or the impact of the delay upon the offender: R v V (1998) 99 A Crim R 297. The degree to which leniency will be granted to the offender will depend upon the particular facts of the case. For example, little leniency is granted where the delay is a result of the offender fleeing the jurisdiction: R v Shore (1992) 66 A Crim R 37 and none where the offender has not disclosed other criminality at the time of the imposition of the earlier sentence: Lewins v R [2007] NSWCCA 189; 175 A Crim R 40. Where the offender is responsible for the delay “it is more difficult for him to call in aid the principle in Todd”: R v Carter [1999] NSWCCA 376. 
     
      
    41 I do not believe that Todd had any significant operation in the present case. The delay, while not to be encouraged, was not in the order of those cases where the principle has operated. It was largely due to the fact that the respondent wished to dispute a fact relied upon by the prosecution rather than to seek to avoid committal for the offences of manslaughter. There was no evidence of any deleterious impact upon the respondent by reason of the delay. He could have hardly been in any doubt about his fate given the fact that he must have known that he was guilty of a very serious offence, if not manslaughter, and that it was inevitable that a lengthy gaol sentence ultimately would be imposed upon him. The sword of Damocles analogy was misplaced in this case. The Judge must have taken into account any rehabilitation achieved by the respondent during the delay when deciding, as a mitigating factor, that he had “substantial prospects of rehabilitation”. The fact that he had been in custody during the period between arrest and sentence was taken into account by backdating the sentence. 
     
      
    42 In my opinion the Judge was in error in taking into account as a “discounting factor” the delay between charge and sentence. 
     
      
       
      (c) Relevance of the respondent’s record 
      
    43 The respondent’s criminal record has been outlined above. In respect of it the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………First of all his record is not such as would bring him within Veen No 2 and accordingly, in my judgment, the only effect of his previous record is that it disentitles him to that degree of leniency which he would have had, had he been a first offender………… 
         
         
        As far as his traffic record is concerned, he has had three previous offences of driving with above the prescribed concentration of alcohol. Two middle range and one being low range. He has also had an offence for driving whilst disqualified and various speeding offences. But I note that his last major driving offence was in 2001. Although there have been minor offences since that date. 
        
       
      
    44 The Crown submits that the respondent’s criminal and traffic record was such that the Judge ought to have found that, consistent with Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 477, the record was an aggravating factor as demonstrating a “continuing disobedience to the law”. 
     
      
    45 The present submission is different to that put forward by the prosecutor before the sentencing judge. There the record was relied upon “not…to aggravate any sentence that can be imposed its to mitigate (militate?) against any degree of leniency that might be extended, particularly to [the respondent]”. Later the prosecutor confirmed that he was not relying upon the record as a matter of aggravation. 
     
      
    46 It is not generally appropriate on a Crown appeal for the Crown to seek to adopt a different stance in this Court than was taken before the sentencing judge. Certainly it would be a matter of considerable significance in the exercise of this Court’s discretion to refuse to intervene that the prosecutor led the sentencing court into error. 
     
      
    47 In any event, the determination of whether the criminal record was an aggravating factor or not was largely a matter of fact for the Judge to determine. This Court will not interfere in a factual determination unless there was no basis upon which the Judge could have reached the conclusion of fact that he did. I am unpersuaded that it was not open to the Judge to deal with the respondent’s criminal record in the way that he did. 
     
      
       
      The nature of the manslaughter alleged 
      
    48 It has been noted that the statement of facts identified the charges against the respondent as being manslaughter based upon an unlawful and dangerous act. Accordingly this is how the sentencing Judge referred to it in the passage of his sentencing remarks set out earlier in this judgment. It is not clear why it was thought necessary to identify the type of manslaughter for which the respondent was to be sentenced. But presumably this statement was made to distinguish this offence from a case of manslaughter based upon gross criminal negligence. 
     
      
    49 However it was made clear in R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 381 that there is no hierarchy of manslaughter verdicts in which, for example, a manslaughter arising from provocation is necessarily more serious and worthy of a heavier sentence than a manslaughter arising from an unlawful and dangerous act. This is notwithstanding that provocation manslaughter involves an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. It is the particular facts of the killing and not the class of manslaughter that determines the seriousness of the offending: R v Dally [2000] NSWCCA 162; 115 A Crim R 582. 
     
      
    50 During the course of argument the Court was referred to the decision in R v Pullman (1991) 25 NSWLR 89. That was an appeal against a conviction for manslaughter where the appellant was alleged to have crossed an unbroken centre line to pass vehicles in front of him forcing a driver coming in the opposite direction to take evasive action. As a result the driver of the on-coming vehicle lost control and came into collision with a motor cycle and a vehicle going in the same direction as the appellant. The motorcyclist was killed and persons in the other vehicle seriously injured. Because there was no impact between the appellant’s vehicle and any other vehicle, the appellant could not be charged with the offence of culpable driving as that offence was then framed. Hence the appellant was charged with manslaughter and two offences under s 54 of the Crimes Act being by an unlawful act cause grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    51 The appellant sought to have the convictions quashed on the basis that there was no evidence sufficient to support the charges. The manslaughter alleged an unlawful and dangerous act being a breach of the then relevant motor traffic regulation prohibiting the crossing of an unbroken centre line. This Court held, at 96-97 per Hunt CJ at CL, that the offence of manslaughter could only be based upon an act that was unlawful “otherwise than by reason of the fact that it infringes some statutory prohibition (by which term I include any regulatory prohibition)”. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        My conclusions, stated very shortly, are therefore: 
         
        (1) An act which constitutes a breach of some statutory or regulatory prohibition does not, for that reason alone, constitute an unlawful act sufficient to found a charge of manslaughter within the category of an unlawful and dangerous act. 
         
        (2) Such an act may, however, constitute such an unlawful act if it is unlawful in itself — that is, unlawful otherwise than by reason of the fact that it amounts to such a breach. 
        
       
       
      The result was that the appeal was upheld and the convictions quashed. 
       
      
    52 Applying this decision, the basis upon which the pleas of guilty to manslaughter were apparently made by the respondent and accepted by the Crown was misconceived, as was the basis upon which the Judge sentenced the respondent. The only unlawful act that has been identified in the respondent’s driving was a breach of the relevant regulation prohibiting the racing of motor vehicles on public roads. Yet according to the authority of Pullman that could not form the basis of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter. 
     
      
    53 The only reason that the decision in Pullman was brought to the attention of the Court was because counsel for the respondent sought to use it to support an argument that, while the sentences imposed upon the respondent might have been inadequate had the charges been based upon gross criminal negligence, they were not so for charges based upon unlawful and dangerous act. The subtleties and ingenuity of that argument need not be considered because it seems to me to have an insuperable difficulty in that it is contrary to Isaacs. 
     
      
    54 Notwithstanding the conflict between the basis of the charges and the decision in Pullman, neither of the parties sought to argue that Pullman was wrongly decided. When the Court raised the suggestion that the matter might be returned for further consideration to the District Court, including, if necessary, an application that the respondent be permitted to withdraw his pleas, counsel for the respondent argued that such a course would be unfair to his client as it would make him liable for re-sentencing with the risk of a greater sentence that would not be tempered by any discretion such as this Court exercises on a Crown appeal. This argument seems to me to have merit. In effect it would be to subject the respondent to triple jeopardy. 
     
      
    55 At the present time, apart from the offences of murder and manslaughter, the Crimes Act contains the following provisions: s 51A, predatory driving causing grievous bodily harm; s 52A, dangerous driving; s 53, furious driving; and s 54, negligent act causing grievous bodily harm. Section 52A contains the following offences: dangerous driving causing death, maximum penalty 10 years; aggravated dangerous driving causing death maximum penalty 14 years; dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm, maximum penalty imprisonment for 7 years; and aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm, maximum penalty imprisonment for 11 years. The circumstances of aggravation are set out in s 52A(7) and include: having a concentration of alcohol of at least 0.15; driving at more that 45 kph above the speed limit; driving to escape police pursuit; and driving while driving skills are very substantially impaired by the influence of a drug or drugs. 
     
      
    56 As the law presently stands, there is a rational, logical and cohesive hierarchy of offences concerned with the infliction of death or serious injury by the use of a motor vehicle. The offences range from negligent driving causing grievous bodily harm (s 42(1)(b) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act with a maximum penalty of 9 months imprisonment) through the driving offences in the Crimes Act to manslaughter by gross criminal negligence. All of these offences involve varying degrees of negligence, however the actual conduct may be described, ranging from a lack of care and proceeding through dangerousness to culpable negligence: R v Buttsworth [1983] 1 NSWLR 658. This structure is acknowledged by s 52AA(4) that provides that on a trial for an offence of manslaughter or an offence under s 53 or s 54 a jury can return a verdict of guilty of an offence under s 52A. It is also seen in s 52A(6), a provision that prevents a person being convicted of both manslaughter and an offence under s 52A arising from the same facts. 
     
      
       
      Are the sentences inadequate? 
      
    57 In my opinion the prosecutor ought not to have identified the manslaughter as based upon unlawful and dangerous act. According to Pullman it was not open to charge manslaughter on this basis. But in any event, it was unnecessary and liable to distract the sentencer from a proper assessment of the criminality of the driving by introducing the concept of an unlawful act. That was particularly so where the unlawful act is the mere breach of a traffic regulation. It is an offence under s 40(1) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act to take part in a race between vehicles on a road, and the maximum penalty for that offence is a fine. But the offence charged was manslaughter and it carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. That was the offence to which the respondent pleaded guilty and that was the offence for which he was to be punished however it may otherwise be described. 
     
      
    58 Of course the offence of manslaughter is notorious for the range of conduct falling within its scope and hence the width of the sentencing discretion when punishing for that offence. This is no doubt why there is no standard non-parole period prescribed for the offence. However, when sentencing for the offence, like all offences, the court must take into account the maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature. Further in cases of motor manslaughter, in my opinion, the sentence to be imposed must also take into account the fact that there is a structure of offences dealing with the occasioning of death through driving and that manslaughter stands at the very pinnacle of that structure as the most serious offence. In particular the sentence must take into account that there is a less serious offence of causing death by driving under s 52A(2) of the Crimes Act that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. Of course it does not follow that the sentence for manslaughter must exceed the maximum for the less serious offence or that the sentence for manslaughter is in some way calculated using the maximum sentence for the other offence: Markarian at [31]. 
     
      
    59 In the present case the Judge failed to take into account the relevance of the range of driving offences presumably because the offence was identified as manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. In my view that was an erroneous approach caused by the prosecutor. But, however the manslaughter was described, it was an offence of the utmost seriousness because of the danger it posed to other persons in the vicinity, because of the flagrant breach of the road rules involved and because the loss of life was almost inevitable. It was more serious than other motor manslaughter cases to which the Court’s attention was taken because it involved three vehicles all being driven dangerously in a joint enterprise and, hence, the potential dangerousness to others in the vicinity was increased dramatically from a case involving the dangerous driving of a single vehicle. In my opinion that fact alone takes this offence well beyond the seriousness of the criminality considered in R v Cameron [2005] NSWCCA 359; 157 A Crim R 70. 
     
      
    60 Further, unlike many other cases of dangerous driving, there were opportunities for the respondent to come to his senses while the vehicles were stopped at red lights. The respondent was not so befuddled by alcohol or drugs that he could not have realised the very great dangerousness of his conduct and desisted. But these were occasions seen merely as part of the race, allowing the vehicles to accelerate away at high speed after coming together at the stoplights. 
     
      
    61 The respondent saw very great significance in a concession by the Crown in submissions to this Court that the sentences imposed would have been appropriate had the respondent been charged with offences under s 52A(2). The Crown saw this fact as supporting the proposition that the sentences were inadequate for offences of manslaughter. The respondent saw this concession as an admission that the sentences were not manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    62 The respondent submitted that it was not axiomatic that a sentence for manslaughter should be longer than a sentence for the same conduct and consequences charged under s 52A of the Crimes Act. He relied upon statements of Grove J in Cameron to support that proposition. But his Honour was there indicating that, because the offence of manslaughter is more serious than an offence under s 52A, it should not be treated as if it were an offence under s 52A. There is nothing in the judgment of Grove J that suggests that a sentence for manslaughter might be the same or less than a sentence imposed for similar conduct charged under s 52A. 
     
      
    63 As I understand the respondent’s argument it was that, because his conduct could amount to an offence under s 52A(2), he should receive no heavier sentence than if he had been charged with that offence. This is notwithstanding that it must be accepted that manslaughter is, as a category of offence, more serious than an offence of dangerous driving and that there are very different maximum penalties prescribed for the two offences. As I have already indicated, this argument is based upon the fact that the offences charged were of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter and not gross criminal negligence manslaughter. Quite frankly, if the respondent’s argument were correct, it would be an affront to logic, common sense and any rational application of sentencing principle that the same offender can receive the same sentence regardless of the nature of the offence charged, or the applicable maximum penalty. If this is the result of having motor vehicle manslaughter based upon unlawful and dangerous act, then it presents the best possible reason for affirming the correctness of Pullman. The respondent’s argument should be rejected. 
     
      
    64 There were two errors by the trial judge that I have identified. But I do not believe that, absent those errors, very different sentences would have been imposed. It was not these errors that resulted in what, in my view, were sentences that were manifestly inadequate to a very significant degree. The Judge must have very substantially underestimated the criminality involved in the offences to have imposed the sentences that he did. That may have been because they were described as unlawful and dangerous act manslaughters. There was little in the respondent’s subjective circumstances that called for leniency. He could not even avail himself of youth. There was nothing in the psychological reports that mitigated his criminal responsibility for the death of the victims or called for a moderation of sentences commensurate with his culpability for the death of two persons. 
     
      
    65 Each of the sentences imposed upon the respondent was itself manifestly inadequate. A sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years for the offence of manslaughter relating to either one of the two victims reveals that the Judge’s assessment of the criminality of the respondent must have fallen well short of what it should have been. The inadequacy of the sentences was compounded by an accumulation between the two sentences of only 2 years. 
     
      
    66 The very least sentence that could have been imposed upon the respondent was, in my opinion, a total sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. Had I been the sentencing judge, I would have imposed a greater sentence. But it is the sentence that I would propose if the Crown appeal were allowed in recognition of the fact that this is a Crown appeal and the application of the principle of double jeopardy. 
     
      
       
      Should the Court intervene? 
      
    67 It has been noted that there was a co-offender, McDonald, who was also sentenced by his Honour. For some reason, which the Crown Prosecutor appearing on the appeal could not explain, the Director of Public Prosecutions did not appeal against the sentence imposed upon McDonald. If the sentence of the respondent were now increased, he would have a justifiable sense of grievance with the sentence imposed upon his co-offender. He would face a minimum period of custody of 9 years, whereas his co-offender, who it could be argued was equally as culpable for the deaths of the victims, would be serving a minimum period of custody of 5 years. There is nothing in their respective subjective circumstances that could possibly justify such different sentences nor could the disparity be justified on the basis that it was the respondent’s vehicle that came into impact with the vehicle driven by the Howles. 
     
      
    68 Counsel for the respondent submitted that this fact alone would cause the Court to refrain from interfering in the sentence imposed upon the respondent. He submitted that this Court would not knowingly create unjustified disparity between the sentences imposed upon joint offenders. In this particular case it was argued that, even if the Court viewed the sentence of McDonald as manifestly inadequate, that finding could not be used to justify the resulting disparity between his sentence and that of the respondent if the Crown appeal were allowed. 
     
      
    69 It is well established that this Court will not reduce a sentence that is otherwise appropriate simply because there is disparity between it and a manifestly inadequate sentence imposed upon a co-offender: R v Diamond (NSWCCA, 18 February 1993, unreported); R v Chen [2002] NSWCCA 447. That is because the sense of grievance held by the offender is unjustified where the co-offender’s sentence is unduly lenient to a significant degree. This is so even where the co-offender’s sentence was imposed by this Court: R v Ismunandar and Siregar [2002] NSWCCA 477; 136 A Crim R 206. There reliance was placed upon the judgment of Gleeson CJ in R v Rexhaj (NSWCCA, 29 February 1996, unreported) where his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The principle which underlies ... [intervention for disparity] ... is that inconsistency in punishment may lead to an erosion of public confidence in the administration of justice ... . There are, however, other things which may also lead to an erosion of public confidence in the administration of justice, and they include the multiplication of manifest errors. That is why numerous judges have stressed the unattractiveness of responding to one wrong decision by making another wrong decision. 
        
       
      
    70 Here there has been, in my opinion, a wrong decision by the sentencing Judge. But it cannot be said that the refusal to interfere to correct that decision is itself a wrong decision. That is because the purpose of a Crown appeal is not simply to increase an erroneous sentence imposed upon a particular individual. It has a wider purpose, being to achieve consistency in sentencing and the establishment of sentencing principles. That purpose can be achieved to a very significant extent by a statement of this Court that the sentences imposed upon the respondent were wrong and why they were wrong. The decision of this Court will have an effect on sentencing for motor manslaughter cases even though the Crown appeal is dismissed in the exercise of discretion. 
     
      
    71 It may well be that members of the public, either in general or in the case of particular individuals, will retain a sense of grievance that the respondent was not appropriately sentenced for his conduct and its consequences. But that grievance, if it exists, will be a consequence of the conduct of the Crown both before the sentencing judge and before this Court. It is not a result of the failure of this Court to recognise the seriousness of the offences and require that appropriate punishment be imposed upon such offenders. General deterrence, which is of the utmost importance in this case, will be achieved by the pronouncement of this Court as to the type of penalty that should be imposed upon similar offending in the future. Although the sentence imposed upon the respondent is manifestly inadequate, it is still a significant sentence for a person of the applicant’s age and record. 
     
      
    72 In my opinion having regard to the nature and purpose of a Crown appeal and the consequences that would flow were the Court to allow the Crown appeal against the respondent in circumstances where the Crown has not appealed against the sentence of the co-offender, this Court must exercise its discretion to dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    73 I propose that the Crown appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA: On 31 October 2007 a jury found the Appellant guilty of a charge of driving a vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person or persons resulting in death. The incident from which the charge arose happened at about 3:15pm on 29 August 2006 when a black BMW sports car driven by the Appellant collided with a red Mazda MX 6 driven by Ms Kate Dodd. The collision occurred when Ms Dodd, who had been travelling north along Pennant Hills Road, West Pennant Hills was in the process of making a right-hand turn to go into Copeland Road, West Pennant Hills. The Appellant was driving south on Pennant Hills Road at the time, and collided with Ms Dodd’s vehicle as it turned. Ms Dodd was killed instantly, or virtually instantly.  
     
      
    2 The weather at the time of the collision was fine and dry. The road itself was dry and in good condition. 
     
      
    3 The Appellant appeals against his conviction. He relies on three grounds. The first relates to whether the jury’s verdict was justified by the evidence. The second alleges that the trial miscarried because the trial judge failed properly to put the defence case to the jury. The third is that a miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence of certain evidence relating to the manner in which traffic lights at the intersection operated. 
     
      
       
      Configuration of the Intersection 
       
      
    4 At the site of the accident, Pennant Hills Road runs in a north-south direction. From the intersection Copeland Road leads off in an easterly direction, while Eaton Road leads off in a westerly direction.  
     
      
    5 Pennant Hills Road carries traffic travelling in a northerly direction, and also traffic travelling in a southerly direction. 
     
      
    6 In Pennant Hills Road on both the northern side and the southern side of the intersection a wide raised concrete median strip in the centre of the road separates the northbound lanes from the southbound lanes. As one approaches the intersection travelling north on Pennant Hills Road there are three lanes for through traffic. There is also, as one nears the intersection, a fourth lane closest to the centre of the road formed by reducing the width of the median strip, which acts as a turning lane for vehicles wanting to turn right into Copeland Road. The evidence referred to these lanes by consecutive numbers going out from the kerb, so that the lane closest to the kerb was lane one, and the through-lane closest to the median strip was lane three.  
     
      
    7 As one approaches the intersection travelling south on Pennant Hills Road, one negotiates a slight left curve and goes down a slight hill. Aiken Road intersects with Pennant Hills Road on its westerly side, at an intersection that is itself controlled by traffic lights. The intersection with Copeland Road and Eaton Road is the next intersection to the south. 
     
      
    8 At the intersection, there are three lanes for southbound through traffic, and no separate turning lane into Eaton Road. Those lanes were also identified in the evidence by numbers, with lane one being closest to the kerb and lane three closest to the median strip. 
     
      
    9 Copeland Road near the intersection has two lanes heading west. Eaton Road near the intersection has two lanes heading east. 
     
      
    10 The passage of traffic in all directions through the intersection is controlled by traffic lights. 
     
      
    11 At the boundaries of the intersection there are pedestrian crossings with walk/don’t walk indicators across Copeland Road, across Eaton Road, and across Pennant Hills Road at the northern boundary of the intersection. There is no pedestrian crossing over Pennant Hills Road at the southern boundary of the intersection.  
     
      
    12 On the median strip in Pennant Hills Road, north of the intersection, is a sign that faces the traffic heading south. It has a picture of traffic lights on it, underneath which is written “prepare to stop”. On top of that sign are two yellow lights that are activated and start flashing alternately as soon as the traffic lights at the intersection of Pennant Hills Road and Copeland Road go to yellow or red for southbound traffic. When the southbound traffic light goes to green the warning signs stop flashing. Somewhat closer to the intersection, on the left-hand kerb, is a sign saying “red light camera ahead”. There is a “no right turn” sign facing the southbound traffic, so it is not permitted for southbound traffic to turn right from Pennant Hills Road into Eaton Road.  
     
      
    13 The only element of the offence that was in dispute at the trial was whether the Appellant was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person or persons. The Crown case was that this element of the offence was satisfied because the Appellant was driving at a speed that was excessive in the circumstances and entered the intersection after failing to stop at a red light. The trial proceeded on the basis that the jury would be justified in convicting only if it found both that he was driving at an excessive speed and also that he had gone through a red light. In that forensic context evidence about the sequence in which the lights were programmed to operate, and about what various eyewitnesses observed concerning the lights at the intersection, assumed particular importance.  
     
      
       
      The Sequencing of the Traffic Lights 
       
      
    14 The traffic lights that face northbound traffic on Pennant Hills Road contain two banks of red, orange and green lights. Each of the lights in one of those banks illuminates a circle. Each of the lights in the other bank illuminates a right-turn arrow. 
     
      
    15 Mr Adrian Paul, the officer of the Roads and Traffic Authority (“RTA”) who is responsible for the operation of about 2,000 sets of traffic lights around Sydney, gave evidence about the sequence in which the traffic lights were programmed to operate on the day of the accident. The accuracy of his evidence was not questioned. Through him, an internal document of the RTA that set out in detail the configuration of the intersection and its approaches, and the phasing of the lights, was tendered.  
     
      
    16 There are four phases in which the traffic lights controlling the intersection can operate. The A phase displays a green circle light to traffic proceeding in both directions on Pennant Hills Road, and red lights to traffic approaching the intersection in both Copeland Road and Eaton Road. During the A phase a car travelling north on Pennant Hills Road and wishing to turn right into Copeland Road can do so if there is a sufficient gap in traffic heading south on Pennant Hills Road.  
     
      
    17 There are sensors in the roadway near the intersection in each lane that traffic can travel on Pennant Hills Road, Copeland Road and Eaton Road. The A phase can be departed from if one or other of the sensors in Copeland Road, Eaton Road, or the turning lane in Pennant Hills Road is activated.  
     
      
    18 A call is made for the B phase to be activated if a car stands on the sensor in the right hand turning lane for cars heading north in Pennant Hills Road, and does not move off within a “preset period of time”. In the B phase, a green circle light and a green right turn arrow is displayed to traffic heading north on Pennant Hills Road, and a red light is displayed to traffic heading south on Pennant Hills Road. A green left turn arrow is also displayed to traffic approaching the intersection on Copeland Road. Red circle lights are also displayed to traffic approaching the intersection on both Copeland Road and Eaton Road. 
     
      
    19 During the C phase, red circles are displayed to both northbound and southbound traffic on Pennant Hills Road, and to all traffic approaching the intersection in Copeland Road. Traffic approaching the intersection from Eaton Road has displayed to it a green circle, and a green right turn arrow. 
     
      
    20 During the D phase, red circles are displayed to both northbound and southbound traffic on Pennant Hills Road. Southbound traffic on Pennant Hills Road also has displayed to it a green left turn arrow. Traffic approaching the intersection from Copeland Road is free to move straight ahead, to left or to right, while traffic approaching the intersection from Eaton Road faces a red circle.  
     
      
    21 Mr Paul gave evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Can you tell the members of the jury how long would it take once the request for the green right signal heading in that right hand turning lane is made. How long would it take from the request being made until the arrow being illuminated? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Once the call has been made to run the B phase at an the appropriate time between the signal cycle determined by the computer, the southbound Pennant Hills Road traffic would face a four and a half second yellow signal, followed by a one and a half second or – red signal. After the termination of the combination of those two times, six seconds, the right turn green arrow would be displayed for traffic turning right into Copeland Road.” 
        
       
      
    22 There are occasions when a red right turn arrow is displayed to traffic heading north in Pennant Hills Road. Mr Paul’s evidence was that such an arrow: 
     
      
       
        
        “… is displayed when the entire approach northbound on Pennant Hills Road is facing a red signal, so it is a red round signal with a red right turn arrow.” 
        
       
      
    23 The RTA plan tendered through him, stated that there were times when there was “timed red arrow protection for A phase pedestrians”, but examination of the plan did not make clear exactly which direction or directions the red arrow or arrows faced, or how that red arrow protection interrelated with the other sequencing of the lights. Nor did the oral evidence make those matters completely clear. 
     
      
    24 However, Mr Paul’s evidence about sequencing included: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. If a driver is in that right-hand turn lane, is it possible he could see a sequence where the lights facing him are – was a red circle and a red arrow? 
         
        A. Yes, your Honour.” 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The red circle goes to a green circle? 
         
        A. Yes, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the red arrow goes off? 
         
        A Yes, that’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So there is no arrow at all? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And then a green arrow comes? 
         
        A. Eventually if someone is in that lane, yes, your Honour.” 
        
       
      
    25 Mr Paul explained the sequence in which the different phases of the lights operated: 
     
      
       
        
        “… if there was a demand for all four phases, yes, they would run in sequence, but if they’re not all demanded they can vary. You know, you can go from A to C or A to D, but they must always go back to A, but if they’re all demanded it would be A, B, C, D back to A.” 
        
       
      
    26 Mr Paul gave express confirmation that if there were vehicles on Pennant Hills Road travelling north, vehicles in Pennant Hills Road waiting to make a right-hand turn, cars stationary in Copeland Road and Eaton Road, and traffic coming south in Pennant Hills Road, that would mean that all phases would be demanded, and hence would run in the A, B, C, D sequence. 
     
      
       
      The Witnesses Called 
       
      
    27 Nine witnesses who were present at or near the intersection at the time of the collision gave evidence for the prosecution. The prosecution also called police officers who made observations and measurements at the crash scene, including senior constable Aram Kraefft, an expert crash investigator. The Appellant gave evidence in his own defence, and also called Mr Mark George, a crash investigator. 
     
      
    28 Of the witnesses present at the scene who were called by the Crown, five were drivers of vehicles heading north on Pennant Hills Road at the time, two were drivers of vehicles heading west in Copeland Road, one drove a vehicle heading east in Eaton Road, and one drove a vehicle heading south on Pennant Hills Road.  
     
      
       
      The Additional Evidence on Appeal 
       
      
    29 The basis for the third ground of appeal arises from an affidavit that the Appellant sought to read on the appeal. The affidavit was made by Mr Frank Cavaleri, a senior network operational officer employed by the RTA. He gave some further evidence about the manner in which the sequencing of the lights at the intersection operated on the day of the collision. That evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The minimum period of time that must pass between a green signal being displayed to northbound traffic in Pennant Hills Road (in “A” phase) and a right turn green arrow being displayed for the same traffic (in “B” phase) would be 14 seconds.” 
        
       
       
      The Crown opposed the reading of the affidavit. The appeal proceeded on the basis that the court would decide in its reserved judgment whether to admit Mr Cavaleri’s evidence. 
       
      
    30 On the hearing of the appeal the Crown read without objection an affidavit of a solicitor in the office of the DPP that attached Mr Paul’s proof of evidence, and deposed to that proof having been sent to the Appellant’s solicitor more than 10 months before the trial started. In the usual way, Mr Paul’s evidence at the trial was given orally and his proof of evidence was not put before the jury. Mr Paul’s proof of evidence included some detail that was not covered by his oral evidence, about how the light sequence in A phase could be affected by pedestrian movement: 
     
      
       
        
        “Pedestrian movement is permitted across both Copeland Road and Eaton Road subject to pushbutton demand. If the pedestrian feature across Copeland Road has been demanded, then a left turn red arrow will be displayed to southbound traffic and a right turn red arrow will be displayed to northbound traffic in Pennant Hills Road at the commencement of the phase for a period of 6 seconds after which time the both arrows are extinguished. All other controlled movements are held by a red signal.” 
        
       
       
      Witnesses Heading North on Pennant Hills Road 
       
      
    31 The five eyewitnesses who were heading north on Pennant Hills Road were Mr Neville Conway (a semi-trailer driver, who was in lane two or perhaps lane one), Mr Ryan Lawes (driving a car in lane three), Mr Scott Matheson (driving a van in lane three), Mr Darryl Davison (driving a car that went into the turning lane immediately behind Ms Dodd’s car), and Mr Stephen O’Neill (driving a car that was two cars behind Ms Dodd’s car, in the turning lane). 
     
      
       
      Mr Conway’s Evidence 
       
      
    32 Mr Conway’s evidence was that he had used the road regularly for about 12 years, and was familiar with the intersection in question. As he drove towards the intersection he noticed a small red sports car heading in the same direction, and admired it because his daughter had always wanted a car like that. As the traffic approached the intersection it slowed down “to probably 50”. Mr Conway thought the traffic was going to stop, but the light on the northbound side of the road “… stayed green first and the traffic was stopped on the other side, so I knew we had the green light, the green arrow come over …”. On his account, in the turning lane there was one car in front of the red car he had been admiring, and another couple of cars behind. He said that the green arrow came on, and one car went through. He said that the southbound traffic was stopped at the intersection, and there was a semi-trailer in the lane closest to the median strip: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was a western steer prime mover semi-trailer letter custom painted. I remember that much. I don’t remember the name on the truck unfortunately, and there was a car next to him in the centre lane.” 
        
       
      
    33 At that stage there was nothing in lane one (closest to the gutter) going southbound. He said that in the northbound turning lane one car went through, then the red car went through, then: 
     
      
       
        
        “All of a sudden the black car come out from the gutter lane, from nowhere, everybody was stopped just like a horror movie. There was an explosion. I saw the black car drive into the passenger side of the red car. Then it somersaulted in the air one hundred yards before it landed bouncing off the gutter five or six times.” 
        
       
      
    34 He immediately stopped his vehicle, ran to the red car and ascertained that the driver was badly injured but there was nothing he could do because she was trapped. He then went to the black car. He heard the driver of the black car talking to another man: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. He said something, someone said something to him – why didn’t you stop. He said something like that, he said ‘I had a green light’.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you say something then? 
         
        A. I was very angry and said ‘Bullshit because I saw the green arrow, and I had the green light and arrow on my way sir so you can’t have had a green light.’” 
        
       
       
      I mention now that Mr Conway was not challenged in cross-examination about whether that conversation had taken place. 
       
      
    35 He described the black car when he first saw it coming out of lane one as “like an airplane taking off from the gutter lane”. He said he was one or two semi-trailer lengths back from the intersection when he observed this. 
     
      
    36 In cross-examination he rejected a suggestion that the black car had never rolled after the collision, and said that it rolled over five or six times.  
     
      
    37 In his evidence in chief Mr Conway had said he was driving in lane number two. It was suggested to him that he had told a police officer soon after the accident that he had been driving in lane number one, and that was different to his evidence in the court. His response was: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … maybe it was but my memory doesn’t remember back that far except – I’ll know for definite there was a green arrow and the green light to my dying day. I can still see it, the car flying through when everything was stopped on the southbound side. So what lane I was driving was irrelevant to me. It was the red light – and the green light that I saw.” 
        
       
      
    38 The totality of his cross-examination concerning his recollection about the semi-trailer was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Are you sure there was a semi-trailer there in that lane number 3? 
         
        A. I’m 100 per cent sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And was it a large semi-trailer with a-- 
         
        A. Prime mover with a taut liner – curtain side, what they call it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So more or less like a pantechnicon body; is that right? 
         
        A. Yes, with sides on it, like curtains. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you wouldn’t describe that as a truck, would you? 
         
        A. Semi-trailer. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That’s right. And you took particular notice of that semi-trailer? 
         
        A. I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Because I think you gave a description to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that it was a certain brand and that you noted that the painting on it was hand painted. 
         
        A. I noticed all scroll work on it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes, which was hand painted, so it must have taken your eye. 
         
        A. I wish it had taken my eye better, to remember whose truck it was.” 
        
       
      
    39 Mr Conway rejected, in cross-examination, suggestions that the semi-trailer heading south was not stopped, and that the car in lane two southbound was not stopped.  
     
      
    40 He said that the car in front of the Mazda (which was “an oldish one”) and the Mazda were able to make their turn without stopping because they had a green arrow. 
     
      
    41 His evidence in chief about how he drove as he approached the intersection was: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. I would have got down to probably 50 – slowing down – stopping for the light because it looked like they were going to stop – I was watching because you can get the arrow and go ahead and other cars southbound get the red. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say stopping for the light – which light?  
         
        A. On the northbound side, but stayed green first and the traffic was stopped on the other side, so I knew we had the green light, the green arrow come over and the traffic, everybody just kept on gliding through, as you do going through gears, again to take off ...” 
        
       
      
    42 In cross-examination he gave further evidence about how he drove as he approached the intersection. He said he always changed gears at that place, and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And I think you said that that’s where you saw the lights change? 
         
        A. No, no, no, I said I thought they were going to change, but I wasn’t sure we were going to get a red because sometimes if the lights don’t trigger for the turning traffic you get a red light for the other side to come through, otherwise you get a straight ahead and so you prepare to stop, chugging up and down the gears, and all of a sudden it doesn’t change and the southbound stops for the right turn and so you go, so you start changing, chopping through the gears again and pull away.” 
        
       
      
    43 He denied that the black car came out of lane number two. The cross-examination established that Mr Conway’s statement to the police had asserted that the black car “came flying through southbound lane number 1”. 
     
      
       
      Mr Lawes’ Evidence 
       
      
    44 Mr Lawes gave evidence that he was travelling north in lane three. There were a couple of trucks in front of him and about five cars stopped in the right-hand turn lane. He noticed that the southbound traffic was slowing down, and when he was slowing to the intersection the southbound was stopped. He said that lane three southbound had a truck stopped in it, that was “one of those landscaping type tipper trucks that carries a lot of dirt in them” and lane two had a car in it. As he approached the intersection the situation concerning the traffic lights was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, the northbound was green, the right-hand turn light was red arrow on the approach. When I got closer it did change to green when the southbound traffic was stopped.” 
        
       
      
    45 According to Mr Lawes, there were about five cars in the right-hand turning lane, all stopped. As he came up the hill the arrow changed. The first car in the turning lane was a red Mazda MX6. He saw that car turn off to Copeland Road after the arrow had turned. The traffic light for northbound traffic at that stage was such that he “still had a green light”. When the red car moved off to go into Copeland Road: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it was halfway into the intersection and I heard this loud noise coming out of nowhere and all of a sudden this black sports car appeared and ran straight into the side of it, and the red car was in the middle of the intersection and the black car just rammed into the side of it, pushed it back towards the lights going further down the intersection.” 
        
       
      
    46 He said the black car came out of lane one southbound, and was “travelling probably about 100 kilometres, maybe more”.  
     
      
    47 After the collision: 
     
      
       
        
        “The black sports car then went up, flipped over the car in the air, flew through the air for about two metres or – two metres, and then landed on its roof and then slid down the road southbound.” 
        
       
      
    48 Mr Lawes immediately stopped his car on the median strip, and called emergency services. He said he heard the man who got out of the BMW say “that he had a green light and that he was in the right”, that “he was being adamant that he had the green light”.  
     
      
    49 In cross-examination he said that as he approached the intersection “we had the green light and I could see that the southbound traffic approaching Copeland Road was slowing down”. The northbound traffic in Pennant Hills Road had a green circle light, and a red arrow, and “when I got closer to the intersection about three or four cars off the actual intersection, the red arrow did turn to green arrow.” He drove through that intersection frequently, and “I have never seen it change any other way”. He drove through that intersection up to 10 times a day, and he had never seen a phase where the green circle would come on and there would be no arrow. He was clear that the truck he saw stopped in lane three southbound was a tipper truck, not a semi-trailer. He rejected the suggestion that when the Mazda turned towards Copeland Road there was just a green circle showing for northbound traffic. 
     
      
       
      Mr Matheson’s Evidence 
       
      
    50 Mr Matheson was driving north in lane three. His evidence was that he was familiar with the intersection. He said that as he drove north up the hill towards Copeland Road, “the lights were red, so I just pulled up. I was about the fourth or fifth car in that third lane pulled up to a stop”. The southbound traffic was stopped as well. There were two or three cars in the turning lane. He said,  
     
      
       
        
        “I noticed the green arrow come on and the cars started to take off. At this point I put me van into gear ready to take off because I know that on most intersections after you’ve had your people turning right you can go straight ahead after that because you’ll get your green light. 
        
       
      
    51 It was as he was waiting in the traffic at the intersection that “I heard a loud bang and as I looked over a car came flying past the van window on the other side of the road”. He could not remember the make and model of the car that was hit.  
     
      
    52 In cross-examination, Mr Matheson said that when he was stopped at the intersection there was a red circle signal in the traffic lights, and also a red arrow going to the right. He said he saw the green arrow come on “after the other cars from other direction had gone through, I suppose”. He agreed that by “other direction” he meant out of Eaton Street and Copeland Road. According to him, both southbound and northbound traffic was completely stopped, and then a green arrow came on and vehicles in the northbound right hand lane proceeded to turn right. 
     
      
    53 Mr Matheson had given a statement to the police soon after the accident, in which he said that as he approached the intersection he saw a red round circle and a red right turn arrow, and that it was because he saw the northbound right turn line of traffic beginning to move forward that he put his van into gear. He had not mentioned in the police statement that he had actually seen a green right turn arrow. When asked for an explanation of this omission he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was a lot of things that – when everything happened so quick there was a lot of things that you can’t get your brain around.” 
        
       
       
      Mr Davison’s Evidence 
       
      
    54 Mr Davison had started to live in Australia in July 2006 (ie one or two months before the accident), and was not familiar with Sydney roads. As he drove north towards the intersection with Copeland Road he moved into the turning lane. He was “pretty sure” the traffic lights facing him were green. There was a small red sports car immediately in front of him, stopped in the right turn lane, so he also stopped. At that stage there was no green arrow, just a green light for northbound traffic. He said “once there was no cars coming through heading south the red car pulled out to make its way over to Copeland”. He saw a black car coming from the north heading south, that looked like it was in the lane closest to the kerb, and was being driven “very fast”.  
     
      
    55 His evidence in chief made no mention of seeing a green right turn arrow before the red car moved off. In cross-examination he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And at that time when the red car moved forward and began to make its turn the only traffic light signal that is showing against you or the red car was the green circle signal. 
        
       
       
        
        A. That is right.” 
        
       
       
      Mr O’Neill’s Evidence 
       
      
    56 Mr O’Neill travelled through the intersection about once a week. As he approached the intersection he pulled into the turning lane to go into Copeland Road. There were two cars in front of him. After he moved into the right hand turning lane, 
     
      
       
        
        “A. We were stationary on red, traffic in both directions was stationary red. Traffic from Copeland Road started to move and once that had happened, we then got the northbound and southbound got a green light go. We still had a red marker for the right-hand turn. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I just want you to concentrate on the signals that were facing you on the northbound carriageway. First of all, can you recall what the colour of the traffic signal was for northbound traffic going straight ahead not making that turn that you were doing? 
         
        A. When I pulled up we were on red. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did it change for the northbound traffic at some stage? 
         
        A. It changed to green.” 
        
       
      
    57 He said that, at the time he moved into the right hand turning lane, the right hand turning arrow: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. … was not lit at that stage. It was red – yes, sorry, it was red in colour. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did it change the signal, the arrow signal at some point? 
         
        A. At some point it did, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what did it change to? 
         
        A. It actually went out and then when the southbound traffic stopped we got a green arrow.” 
        
       
      
    58 Concerning the traffic on the other side of the intersection heading south, he recalled there was a “big truck” in lane three, a vehicle the nature of which he could not remember in lane two and nothing in lane one. 
     
      
    59 He said that the red arrow signal went out for “about a minute” so there was no arrow at all. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. At that point when there was no arrow at all, what colour was the light for northbound traffic proceeding across the intersection? 
         
        A. That was still green. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And after the arrow signal had been out for a minute what happened? 
         
        A. The southbound traffic stopped and we got a green arrow.” 
        
       
      
    60 He described the BMW as “a black flash pretty much”, “absolutely flying”. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Just before you saw [the collision] happen, had you moved your car at all? 
         
        A. As the light gave us the green arrow and the red car moved so did the other car in front of me and we started to move.” 
        
       
      
    61 In cross-examination he reiterated that when he pulled into the right-hand turn lane the two vehicles in front of him were stationary, and that all northbound traffic was stopped by a red circle. He could not say whether there was a red arrow or not, “I just know that the lights that I was facing everybody was stopped because of the red”. It was only when he pulled up that he noticed the vehicles coming out of Copeland Road, and “turning either into Pennant Hills north or south bound”. He disagreed with the suggestion that the Mazda paused, then turned right on a green circle light. He rejected the suggestion that the southbound traffic did not stop at the lights. He described the truck in lane three as one that “… looked to me like a very large B-double or a big truck.” Also, he rejected the proposition that the BMW came from lane two.  
     
      
       
      Witnesses Heading West in Copeland Road 
       
      
    62 The witnesses who were driving west in Copeland Road were Ms Yan Oito (who gave some of her evidence through a Vietnamese interpreter), and Mr Jeremy Hampson.  
     
      
       
      Ms Oito’s Evidence 
       
      
    63 Ms Oito was driving west along Copeland Road, intending to proceed across Pennant Hills Road. Copeland Road has two lanes proceeding westward at that point, and she was in the left-hand lane. As she arrived at the intersection the lights facing her turned red, so she stopped. She thought, but was not sure, that at that time there was another car in the right-hand turning lane of Copeland Road. Traffic heading south on Pennant Hills Road was proceeding through the intersection. She saw a red car waiting in the right-hand turning lane on Pennant Hills Road. When asked whether she could see any traffic in the lanes heading down Pennant Hills Road for traffic going south, she replied, “I feel the movement of the car”. When asked that question again, she said, “I didn’t pay attention, yep”. When asked in substance the same question again, she said once more “Yeh, I feel them”. When asked what she meant by that, she said “I feel the movement of the car”. She said she was stopped there for “about one or two minutes”. She continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “… when I was waiting for the traffic light turn green, suddenly the crash was happened – and dark shadow passed through me, very fast, and the red car was crashed, yeah, and red car stopped in the intersection and – and the dark car, I don’t know where it is.” 
        
       
      
    64 Before she saw the shadow,  
     
      
       
        
        “The red car was going to turn right, yeah. I think the traffic light – (Through interpreter). Well, I think that the red arrow actually have turned green. (Not through interpreter) Yeah, because at that time I – I – I – I – could see truck and a car stopped in front of the southbound lane Pennant Hills Road, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The truck was on the fast lane and another car in the middle lane. I think the dark car was on the – (Through interpreter) Closest.” 
        
       
      
    65 The car that was stopped going southbound was in the “middle lane”. In cross-examination she confirmed that she could not see the traffic lights facing either traffic travelling south, or traffic travelling north, in Pennant Hills Road. The cross-examination included: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. … The truck you said you saw in the fast [far] lane and the car in the other lane, the middle lane, stopped after the accident, not before? 
         
        A. Yeah, because – (Through interpreter) Well, after the accident happened I look around for the cars, then I saw the truck stopped.” 
        
       
      
    66 In re-examination the prosecutor was permitted to ask, over objection: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Can you tell us when it was that you first saw the truck and the car stopped in the southbound lanes on Pennant Hills Road? 
         
        A. (Through interpreter) Well, after the accident happened then I look around for the other cars.” 
        
       
      
    67 That evidence was immediately followed by a Delphic exchange: 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, there is a matter I need to raise before I can finish with the witness. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I have no further questions of the witness, your Honour.” 
        
       
      
    68 While that exchange might make someone familiar with court process wonder whether Ms Oito had departed from her proof, a reasonable jury would not be justified in inferring that she had departed from it, so I leave that exchange out of consideration. 
     
      
       
      Mr Hampson’s Evidence 
       
      
    69 Mr Hampson was “very familiar” with the intersection. He drove west down Copeland Road, intending to turn right into Pennant Hills Road, “the light had turned just before I got there so I was sitting – as the first car in the right turning lane”. There was another vehicle in lane one, that he identified as a white Holden Commodore. (Ms Oito had said she was driving a Ford Laser.) His observation of the accident was: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I was sitting there waiting for the light and there was – I was looking towards light, as there was a break in the traffic, so from the corner of my eye, half looking towards the road, and I saw a flash, a black flash coming through.” 
        
       
      
    70 His first saw the “black flash” in the middle of the intersection. “It seemed to be going very fast”.  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you notice anything, other traffic in the southbound lanes of Pennant Hills Road as you were waiting to make that turn on Copeland Road? 
         
        A. At that time, no, there seemed to be a bit of a break in the traffic, as in, something could be happening, I didn’t notice any traffic, the only traffic I did notice was just that one car coming through.” 
        
       
      
    71 He saw the black car collide with a red car, but did not notice the red car before the collision. He noticed “an Asian guy” walking up from the vicinity of the black car towards the collision shortly after it had happened, and heard him say, “the light was green”. 
     
      
       
      The Witness Heading East in Eaton Road – Ms Bianchini 
       
      
    72 Ms Jane Bianchini was driving east in Eaton Road intending to cross the intersection into Copeland Road. When she arrived at the intersection the lights facing her were red, and she stopped in the kerbside lane. She was the first car stopped at the intersection in that lane. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Can you recall seeing any other traffic in either the northbound or southbound carriageways of Pennant Hills Road as you were waiting there at the red lights? 
         
        A. Yes, on my left there were two lanes of traffic that were stationary and on my right the lanes were still moving, flowing through and at Copeland Road opposite me the lights at – the traffic was stopped. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now, just going back to what you first said about traffic on your left, how many vehicles did you say you saw stopped? 
         
        A. Just two. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And which part of the carriageway on Pennant Hills Road were those vehicles in? 
         
        A. On the, like, the inside turning lanes – not the kerbside, the two lanes closer into the middle of the road. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were those vehicles in the northbound or southbound carriageway of Pennant Hills Road? 
         
        A. South.” 
        
       
      
    73 Once the system of numbering road lanes was explained to her, she identified the lanes that the southbound vehicles were stopped in as being lanes two and three. Concerning the vehicle stopped in lane three, she said “I believe it was a semi-trailer or a large truck”. She could not recall what type of vehicle she saw in lane two, and did not notice any vehicles in lane one of the southbound carriageway. She was waiting at the red stop signal for “probably a couple of minutes” when she saw the collision. One of the cars involved: 
     
      
       
        
        “… came from the south, was heading south from my left – on my left and it was on the kerbside, in the kerbside lane and it came through the light and collected the red car.” 
        
       
      
    74 She said she thought it was travelling “very fast. It seemed a lot faster than the other cars that had been going through that intersection”. She became aware of the red car “pretty much on impact”. She said that she was sure that the vehicle that was stopped closest to her on the southbound carriageway of Pennant Hills Road was a semi-trailer. She rejected a suggestion that there was no car stopped in lane two heading south in Pennant Hills Road. In the statement she made to the police on 8 September 2006 she had said “there were definitely a number of cars stopped in Copeland Road, and I think there were vehicles stopped in the southbound lanes of Pennant Hills Road”. The cross-examination included: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. But here today you say there was ‘definitely’ a semi-trailer? 
         
        A. That is my recollection, that it was a semi-trailer. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You didn’t say that to the police, did you, you only said I thought – or I thought there were vehicles stopped southbound? 
         
        A. That, I did think there were vehicles stopped. I don’t specify semi-trailer. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You weren’t definite about vehicles stopping? 
         
        A. No, I believe, I thought there were vehicles stopped there, yes.” 
        
       
       
      The Witness Heading South In Pennant Hills Road – Ms Rice 
       
      
    75 Ms Donna Rice lived on Pennant Hills Road north of the intersection in question. Her house was near the next intersection to the north (that of Pennant Hills Road and Aiken Road), and on the eastern side of Pennant Hills Road. Thus it was the southbound carriageway of Pennant Hills that ran in front of her home. On the afternoon in question she set off by car from her home on a journey that was intended to take her southward on Pennant Hills Road, then left into Copeland Road. She said she reversed out from her driveway onto Pennant Hills Road at a time when “there wasn’t a single car coming down”. She says she was travelling “about 40, 50ks down to the intersection and I got to about Aiken Road when the black BMW passed me.” It was travelling “very fast”. Ms Rice was on the lane closest to the kerb. She was “very shocked at the speed it was going”. In a period of “less than a minute” after the black car had passed her, she saw it “slammed into the car that was turning right into Copeland Road”. She gave two estimates of where she was when the collision occurred – one was “about 25, 30 metres back from the intersection”, the other that she was just a bit past the bus stop on the left-hand side. When she saw the collision: 
     
      
       
        
        “I then crawled down to the lights and stopped at the light and only – a car came up behind me and beeped me then I looked up at the light and then proceeded to turn left into Copeland Road.” 
        
       
      
    76 At the time of the collision she did not see any other traffic in any of the southbound lanes of Pennant Hills Road: 
     
      
       
        
        “… there were no cars at that time. Only when I crawled down to the lights and stopped did then cars come up behind me.” 
        
       
      
    77 The accident took all her attention, so she did not see what the traffic lights controlling southbound traffic were at the time.  
     
      
    78 In cross-examination she said that after the BMW had passed her, it never changed lanes into lane one. She said that as she was travelling along Pennant Hills Road between Aiken and Copeland Roads she did not see the warning lights that are in the median strip in Pennant Hills Road flash. 
     
      
    79 She rejected a suggestion that the BMW appeared to her to be going fast only because she was driving so slowly, saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “No, because cars normally are travelling 80 down that road. They are normally speeding, going fast and having lived there for 11 years and when that black BMW passed me and I made a mental note to myself that that was shocking of the speed that that car was going, that was just, you know, insane.” 
        
       
      
    80 In response to a question from the judge, she identified the location of her house by reference to a photograph taken from just north of the Aiken Road intersection. That photograph itself shows that the warning sign with flashing lights on the median strip is just a little to the south of the Aiken Road intersection.  
     
      
    81 A police witness gave evidence that from the centre of Mrs Rice’s driveway to the northern side of Copeland Road was 232m, from the southern side of Aiken Road to the northern side of the intersection with Copeland Road was 93m, and the distance from the southern end of the bus stop to the northern side of the intersection with Copeland Road was 51m. The RTA plan shows the sign with flashing lights is 71m north of the intersection with Copeland Road. It follows from these figures that Mrs Rice would have travelled of the order of 150m from her home before the sign with flashing lights passed from her field of vision.  
     
      
       
      The Expert Witnesses 
       
      
    82 While there was a great deal of complex expert evidence, nearly all of it attempted to deduce the speed at which the Appellant's vehicle was travelling when it entered the intersection. The only evidence that bears upon the question of whether the appellant went through a red light is some expert evidence given by Senior Constable Kraefft. 
     
      
    83 He observed, measured and photographed various marks on the road surface, including a gouge mark that he identified as made by the rear passenger side wheel of the Mazda at the time of impact with the BMW. That gouge mark was approximately 5m west of the eastern kerb alignment of Pennant Hills Road. He measured southbound lane one in Pennant Hills Road as being approximately 3.6m wide, and the other southbound lanes are approximately 3.2m wide. Thus the gouge mark occurred marginally to the east of the centre of lane two. The impact was to Ms Dodd’s passenger side front door, and thus occurred a little further towards the east of the gouge mark. 
     
      
       
      The Appellant’s Evidence 
       
      
    84 The Appellant’s evidence about the accident was: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was travelling in lane 2 of Pennant Hills Road and as I approached Aiken Road. As I went past the intersection I glanced down at the speedometer and it showed somewhere around 70 kilometres an hour. And then I continued onwards and then I saw the Mazda somewhere past, just past the bus stop and it appeared to have stopped on its side of the intersection. And so I thought, okay, well I will continue going at the same pace. And once I was almost entering the intersection it turned in front of my vehicle and we collided.” 
        
       
      
    85 He said he believed he was the only vehicle coming south, “with the exception of another car that just exited its roadway in lane 1”.  
     
      
    86 He said the traffic lights facing him were green, and the warning sign between Aiken Road and Copeland Road was not flashing. He said he did not apply his brakes because he believed he was the only vehicle coming down his way with the exception of another car that just exited the roadway in lane one. He said there were no vehicles stationary at the intersection.  
     
      
    87 In cross-examination he denied that he had been travelling at speed, and that he went through a red light. He said he did not recall Mr Conway contradicting his statement about having had a green light. He accepted that his statement to the police differed from his evidence in court because in his statement to the police he had said he was travelling below the speed limit, and had not said anything about glancing at his speedometer. His explanation for the difference was that his recollection had improved.  
     
      
    88 He accepted that in his statement he said nothing about seeing a car as he came down Pennant Hills Road. He accepted that his police statement had said nothing about him seeing the Mazda as he approached the intersection.  
     
      
       
      Grounds 1 and 3 
       
      
    89 It is convenient to deal with these grounds together. 
     
      
    90 The principles concerning reception on a criminal appeal of evidence that was not before the jury are laid down the High Court in Ratten v R (1974) 131 CLR 510; by this Court in R v Bikic [2002] NSWCCA 227 (special leave to appeal refused 11 April 2003) and by the Queensland Court of Appeal in R Katsidis; Ex parte AG (Qld) [2005] QCA 229. Those principles arise in the context where the jurisdiction of a court of criminal appeal is statutory, and the relevant statutory provision, section 6 Criminal Appeal Act 1912, empowers the court to allow an appeal when there is a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    91 In Ratten Barwick CJ, at 516, identified one of the situations where there could be a miscarriage of justice in a criminal trial as being when: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the jury did not have before it evidence not available to the appellant at the time of his trial which, if believed by the jury, was likely to lead to an acquittal, the jury not being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of guilt.” 
        
       
      
    92 His Honour adverted to the distinction between “fresh evidence” and “further evidence” that is drawn in appeals from a civil trial, saying, at 516-517: 
     
      
       
        
        “The rule in relation to civil trials is that evidence, on the production of which a new trial may be ordered, must be fresh evidence; that is to say, evidence which was not actually available to the appellant at the time of the trial, or which could not then have been available to the appellant by the exercise on his part of reasonable diligence in the preparation of his case. However, the rules appropriate in this respect to civil trials cannot be transplanted without qualification into the area of the criminal law. But the underlying concepts of the adversary nature of a trial, be it civil or criminal, and of the desirable finality of its outcome are valid in relation to the trial of a criminal offence.” 
        
       
      
    93 He identified one difference between the circumstances in which further evidence will be received on appeal in criminal trials, by comparison to civil trials, at 517: 
     
      
       
        
        “Great latitude must of course be extended to an accused in determining what evidence by reasonable diligence in his own interest he could have had available at his trial, and it will probably be only in an exceptional case that evidence which was not actually available to him will be denied the quality of fresh evidence. But he must bear the consequences of his own decision as to the calling and treatment of evidence at the trial.” 
        
       
      
    94 He concluded, at 517-518: 
     
      
       
        
        “Thus, there will be no miscarriage simply because evidence which was available to him actually or constructively was not called by the accused, even though it may appear that if that evidence had been called and been believed a different verdict at the trial would most likely have resulted. The accused, nevertheless, will have had a fair trial. But if the new evidence does qualify as fresh evidence it can be said that the trial was not fair. Of course, if by reason of new evidence accepted by it though it may not be fresh evidence, the court is either satisfied of innocence or entertains such a doubt that the verdict of guilty cannot stand, the fact that the trial itself has been fair will not prevent the court upon that evidence quashing the conviction.” 
        
       
       
      McTiernan, Stephen, and Jacobs JJ agreed with Barwick CJ. 
       
      
    95 The course I shall follow in the present case is to consider first whether there is a basis for setting aside the conviction without any reliance on Mr Cavaleri’s evidence, and then what the outcome of the appeal might have been if the evidence were to be admitted. 
     
      
    96 The legal test that Mr Odgers SC, counsel for the appellant, asks this court to apply in overturning the jury verdict is that articulated by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487. Their Honours said, at 493: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.” (citations omitted) 
        
       
      
    97 At 494 their Honours referred to previous cases that had discussed whether the appropriate test for setting aside a verdict on the ground that it is unsafe or unsatisfactory is whether there is reasonable doubt in the mind of the court, or whether it is for the court to decide whether there is a doubt that a reasonable jury ought to entertain. Their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.” (citations omitted) 
        
       
      
    98 That test was reiterated in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [25] per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ, and at [59] per McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ. 
     
      
    99 Mr Odgers seeks to deploy Mr Cavaleri’s evidence to ground a submission that, given Mr Matheson’s evidence that he had stopped at a red light (which would happen for cars travelling in the northbound direction only during C or D phases) and that it was 14 seconds after the green light for northbound traffic came on at the start of A phase, until a green arrow was shown to northbound traffic in B phase, it was inconceivable that he would have been sitting there for 14 seconds, facing a green light, and with no one behind beeping him to move. As Mr Matheson saw the collision, it would follow, Mr Odgers submits, that Ms Dodd turned on a green circle, not on a green arrow. 
     
      
    100 Considering the matter without Mr Cavaleri’s evidence, in my view it was well open to the jury to take the view that Mr Matheson was mistaken in his evidence about the lights facing him being red, and that he stopped.  
     
      
    101 It should first be recognised that there is some evidence that is consistent with Mr Matheson’s evidence that he stopped at a red light. The only circumstance in which the lights facing him would be red was if there was a green light for traffic approaching the intersection in either Copeland Road or Eaton Road. The evidence of both Ms Oito and Mr Hampson was to the effect that there was a green light for traffic in Copeland just before they arrived at the intersection, so Mr Matheson’s evidence about stopping at a red circle light is consistent with that evidence. As well, the evidence of Mr O’Neill is a coherent account of observations of the changes in the lights that would follow one another if he had arrived in the northbound turning lane during the D phase, when there was both a red arrow and a red circle facing the northbound traffic, then of there being a green circle facing northbound traffic (the A phase), and then of there being a green arrow facing the northbound traffic (the B phase). That evidence is consistent with it having been possible that Mr Matheson arrived at the intersection during the D phase and for that reason needing to stop even though he, unlike Mr O’Neill, was seeking to go straight ahead rather than turn right. Further, Ms Oito’s evidence of thinking that she saw the red car pulled up when she (Ms Oito) pulled up at the intersection is consistent with there having been a D-A sequence, and to that extent consistent with Mr Matheson’s evidence of having pulled up at a red light.  
     
      
    102 However the sequence of lights that Mr Matheson said he saw facing the northbound traffic in Pennant Hills Road, namely a red circle light followed by a green arrow, never occurs – the only time the green arrow occurs is in the B phase, and if the B phase happens at all it happens immediately after the A phase, in which a green circle is displayed to northbound traffic. The tenor of his evidence was that there was a red circle followed immediately by a green arrow – it was not (as would be necessary if Mr Odgers’ submissions were correct) that he stopped at a red circle, failed to notice for 14 seconds that the light facing him had turned to a green circle, and then saw a green circle facing him, and no green arrow. It was comfortably open to jury to regard this objective evidence about the light sequence, which directly contradicted Mr Matheson’s evidence, as being far more significant than any inferential support for Mr Matheson’s evidence that might be derived from the matters I have referred to in the previous paragraph. A fatal weakness in seeking to derive inferential support from the matters in the previous paragraph is that there is no evidence that relates the time that Mr Matheson arrived at the intersection to the time that Ms Oito, Mr Hampson and Mr O’Neill respectively arrived at the intersection. If they arrived before Mr Matheson, their evidence would not support him. For evidence to be consistent with some state of affairs means only that the evidence could be true in that state of affairs. That falls short of the evidence justifying, or supporting, an inference that that state of affairs actually exists. 
     
      
    103 As well, there was considerable evidence of Ms Dodd turning on a green arrow – from Mr Conway, Mr Lawes, Mr Matheson himself, and Mr O’Neill. There was evidence of northbound traffic having a green light from Mr Conway, Mr Lawes, Mr Davidson (direct evidence), and Ms Bianchini (evidence of northbound through traffic moving through the intersection). For the jury to accept that Mr Matheson’s evidence provides a basis for having a reasonable doubt about whether Ms Dodd turned on a green arrow would involve the jury in not being sufficiently persuaded by the evidence about her turning on a green arrow. The jury would have been entitled to take the view that an unattractive feature of reasoning that Mr Matheson’s evidence about stopping on a red circle raised a doubt about whether Ms Dodd had turned on a green arrow, is that reasoning in that way is contrary to Mr Matheson’s own evidence that she turned on a green arrow.  
     
      
    104 In deciding whether Mr Matheson’s evidence about stopping on a red circle raises a reasonable doubt, it is important, in my view, that the observation evidence of the witnesses in the present case is a type of evidence concerning which a jury who actually sees the witnesses giving evidence has a considerable advantage over an appellate court reading a transcript. The evidence that a jury accepts concerning matters of observation can be very much affected by matters that do not readily show on the transcript, like whether one witness gave evidence in a confident and clear manner, while another appeared dithery or uncertain. In assessing the evidence, a reasonable jury would be entitled to take into account that the eyewitnesses were all independent of the Appellant, independent of Ms Dodd, and independent of each other. Here, the weight of evidence on the transcript favours the view that Ms Dodd turned on a green arrow, and the persuasiveness of evidence that is directly to the contrary (Mr Davidson, and the Appellant), or that is to the contrary if one prefers an inference open from part of it to a direct statement in another part of it (Mr Matheson) could be affected by the jury’s impression of the witnesses. 
     
      
    105 It will be recalled that both Mr Lawes and Mr Matheson were heading north in lane three, and both were in a position to see the accident when it happened. The accounts that they give of the manner in which the traffic lights changed are quite different. Seeing the witnesses could be a real help to a jury in resolving that difference.  
     
      
    106 Mr Odgers had placed reliance in his written submissions on the unacceptability of Mr Lawes’ testimony that the northbound traffic had a red arrow followed by a green arrow. Mr Arnott SC, counsel for the Crown, submitted that the evidence showed that a possible sequence of lights facing northbound traffic in Pennant Hills Road was that there was first a red circle and a red arrow, then a green circle and a red arrow, then a green circle, then a green circle and a green arrow. That followed, he submitted, both from the evidence of Mr Paul about sequencing (set out at para [24] above) and from the way that the operation of the pedestrian lights across Copeland Road could trigger a right turn red arrow being displayed to northbound traffic in Pennant Hills Road. Mr Odgers accepted, on the appeal, that this submission of Mr Arnott about the sequencing of the lights was correct. When that sequence of lights is possible, Mr Lawes’ evidence about his observations first as he approached the intersection, then as he got close to it (set out at para [44]-[45] above) is not one that is impossible in light of the objective evidence about the sequencing of the lights. 
     
      
    107 As it is only during the B phase of the lights that a green right turn arrow is displayed to traffic heading north on Pennant Hills Road, and the B phase involves a red light being displayed to southbound traffic on Pennant Hills Road, evidence about whether southbound traffic was stopped on Pennant Hills Road is directly relevant to whether the lights were in B phase. The witnesses who said there was a truck (of some sort) and another vehicle stopped at the southbound lights were Mr Conway, Mr Lawes, Mr O’Neill, and Ms Bianchini. While Ms Oito saw the vehicles stopped there, she first saw them stopped only after the accident. At least on paper, she does not present the appearance of being an attentive and careful witness, and in particular, from the fact that it was only from the movement of her car caused by passing traffic that she knew that there was southbound traffic, there is a basis on which a jury might have been concerned about whether she was looking outside the car at all. Mr Hampson did not notice anything stopped there, but neither did he deny that there was anything stopped there. (His rather uncertain evidence in cross-examination was “there seemed to be a period where cars slowed down or weren’t going through, so, from the corner of my eyes I started watching for the light to change and at that time the black car came through”.) While Ms Rice says that there were no southbound vehicles other than herself and the Appellant, it was open to a jury to reject her evidence on that point. 
     
      
    108 A distinct category of evidence supportive of the Appellant having gone through a red light, was Mr Conway’s unchallenged evidence concerning how, immediately after the accident, he emphatically contradicted the Appellant’s statement that he had had a green light.  
     
      
    109 Clearly, there were some aspects of evidence of some of the Crown witnesses that could not be accepted. Mr Conway’s evidence about there being another car stopped in front of Ms Dodd’s car is out of line with all the other witnesses. Mr Conway’s dramatic account of how the BMW moved after the collision is inconsistent both with other eyewitnesses and with the expert testimony. There was some diversity of evidence about the type of truck that was stopped in lane three southbound. The evidence about the precise sequence of lights that was displayed to northbound traffic in Pennant Hills Road was not all consistent. Mr Lawes’ evidence that he had never seen the lights at the intersection change in any other way than from a red arrow to a green arrow does not sit well with Mr Paul’s evidence about the sequencing. The objective evidence about where the rear wheel of Ms Dodd’s car was at the point of impact raises a possibility that the Appellant’s vehicle was at least partly in the prolongation of lane two into the intersection at the instant of collision, which would be consistent with the evidence from some of the Crown witnesses about a car being stopped at the lights in lane two only if the Appellant had moved somewhat to the right while driving through the intersection.  
     
      
    110 However, the fact about which the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt before it could convict was that the Appellant had gone through a red light. On the evidence, if Ms Dodd had turned on a right hand green arrow, not on a green circle, it was inevitable that the Appellant had gone through a red light. I am not persuaded that it would not have been open to a properly instructed jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Dodd had turned on a green arrow. I say that even bearing in mind Mr Davidson’s evidence that Ms Dodd had turned when the lights facing her were a green circle only.  
     
      
    111 What difference might Mr Cavaleri’s evidence have made to this? The jury already had evidence before them that the only time there was a red light facing northbound traffic in Pennant Hills Road was when the lights were in either C or D phase, and that the lights always returned to A phase before the B phase was triggered. It had evidence that the B phase was triggered only after a car had stood on the sensor in the right-hand turning lane for a “preset period of time” without moving off, and that even when the call was made to run the B phase it was only “at an appropriate time between the signal cycle determined by the computer” that the southbound traffic in Pennant Hills Road would face an orange signal, and six seconds after that orange light had come on the green right turn arrow would be displayed to traffic in the turning lane. Thus, the jury already had evidence that it was at least something more than six seconds after the call was registered that the green arrow was displayed. What Mr Cavaleri’s evidence did was to tell them what that “something more” was, as it related to the start of the A cycle. 
     
      
    112 There is no occasion on the present appeal to enter into the difficulties discussed by Giles JA in Bikic at paras [241]–[283] concerning whether it is properly part of the task of a court of criminal appeal to decide for itself whether to accept the new evidence. That is because in the present case the additional material sought to be deployed in evidence has been treated by all concerned as a simple matter of fact, concerning which no question of credibility arises for decision. It is, however, necessary to observe the distinction that Giles JA drew between the ways in which additional evidence sought to be admitted on appeal is treated depending on whether it shows either (1) that the accused is innocent, or else that there is a reasonable doubt about his guilt such that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow the guilty verdict to stand, or (2) that the accused has not had a fair trial, such that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a verdict arrived at through such an unfair process to stand. To decide whether the additional evidence shows that this is a type (1) case, Giles JA said in Bikic at [283]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I must decide whether I believe the evidence and, acting on that belief and my own view of the evidence at the trial, whether I am satisfied that the appellant was innocent or whether there is such doubt as to his guilt that the verdict of guilty cannot stand.” 
        
       
      
    113 Accepting Mr Cavaleri’s evidence as fact, I am neither satisfied that the appellant was innocent, nor in a situation where there is such doubt about his guilt that the verdict of guilty cannot stand. The reasons I have previously given at paras [101]–[107] why it was well open to a jury to take the view that Mr Matheson was mistaken in his evidence about the lights facing him being red, and that he stopped, are, to the extent that they are not ones relating to the advantage that a jury would have over me, reasons that lead me to not accept his evidence in those respects.  
     
      
    114 Turning to whether this is a type (2) case, and assuming for the moment that Mr Cavaleri’s evidence counts as fresh evidence, the test to apply is: 
     
      
       
        
        “whether the appellant has established that there is a significant possibility (or that it is likely) that, in the light of all of the admissible evidence, including the evidence at the trial, a jury acting reasonably would have acquitted the appellant.” ( 
        Katsidis 
         at [3] per McMurdo P, and see per Jerrard JA (with whom White J agreed) at [18]–[19] to similar effect.) 
        
       
      
    115 I do not accept that if Mr Cavaleri’s evidence was accepted by the jury (as there was every reason for it to be) it was likely to lead to an acquittal, or that there was a significant possibility of an acquittal. The jury had ample ground to reject Mr Matheson’s evidence that he had stopped at a red light and then seen a green arrow, and Mr Cavaleri’s evidence in no way qualifies or lessens that ground. 
     
      
    116 It follows that, even if the evidence of Mr Cavaleri were to be allowed on the appeal, ground 1 would not be upheld. 
     
      
    117 In that circumstance it is unnecessary to consider whether Mr Cavaleri’s evidence surmounted the hurdle of being evidence not available to the Appellant at the time of his trial. 
     
      
    118 I would hold Mr Cavaleri’s evidence not admissible, and reject grounds 1 and 3. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – Inadequate Instruction of the Jury 
       
       
      The Summing Up 
       
      
    119 The proceedings before the jury involved evidence being taken on five days that were not consecutive, namely 23, 24 and 25 October 2007, and 29 and 30 October 2007. The addresses of both counsel and the summing up were given in the morning of 31 October 2007. 
     
      
    120 At the outset of the summing up the judge said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the legal issue has been simplified but of course as you probably appreciate from counsel’s addresses, the factual situation is perhaps anything but.” 
        
       
      
    121 When instructing the jury about the elements of the offence, the judge told them that “there is only one element that is really in contention here”. He identified that element as “that at the time of the impact, Mr Wong was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous”. He told them “the Crown says that Mr Wong was driving at an excessive speed in the circumstances and two, that he failed to stop at a red light … They are the two principal facts that the Crown will have to prove to you beyond reasonable doubt.” 
     
      
    122 He stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “There are probably three factual matters that are going to be the most important ones that you are going to have to determine, and counsel have referred to this. The first is, the speed of the vehicle that was being driven by Mr Wong. Now, the evidence in respect of the speed comes from eyewitnesses and, to some extent, from the experts. They have given estimations as to speed. The next thing is the lane that the BMW entered the intersection from, was it lane 1, lane 2, lane 3? Now, the only evidence about that is, comes from some of the eyewitnesses. The third thing is the traffic light signal that was facing Miss Dodd. Again, you have got some eyewitness accounts of what the traffic light signal was, people who have actually observed the light itself and people who observed what the traffic was doing travelling south in Pennant Hills Road.” 
        
       
      
    123 He mentioned to the jury how, immediately after the accident, “the accused maintained to a number of people that he had a green light. Mr Conway disputed that. Well, that dispute of facts is one that you are going to have to resolve.” 
     
      
    124 He said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “The phasing of the lights is obviously an important matter that you will have to have regard to. Again, different witnesses have seen different things there, and [counsel for the appellant] says to you that well, you know, okay, so they did see different things, maybe that’s understandable, but can you be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of what the situation was in those sorts of circumstances.”  
        
       
      
    125 He also said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you find or if you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the accused went through a red light, then really the Crown says that they cannot support a case of driving in a manner dangerous to you, because if you accept Mr Paul’s evidence as to the configuration of the lights and how the phasing operated, if there was not a red light facing the accused, well there would not have been a green arrow facing Ms Dodd when she made her turn.” 
        
       
      
    126 At the conclusion of the summing up the judge asked counsel whether there was anything further they would like him to say to the jury. Counsel for the Appellant (who was not Mr Odgers) answered in the negative.  
     
      
    127 The jury were comparatively quick in arriving at their verdict. They retired at 12:47 pm, and came back with a guilty verdict at 3:05 pm. 
     
      
       
      The Appellant’s Submission 
       
      
    128 The Appellant submits that the judge failed properly to put the defence case to the jury. At the hearing of the appeal, the focus of Mr Odgers’ submission was that the judge simply said nothing about what the defence case was. The Appellant had a positive case at the trial, namely that he was driving at the speed limit, or perhaps a little bit over, that Ms Dodd turned when she was facing a green circle light, but not a green arrow, and that when the Appellant entered the intersection he was facing a green circle light. The Appellant himself gave evidence in support of that case. There was clear direct evidence to support it from Mr Davison. The evidence of Ms Rice also tended to support it because, even though Ms Rice did not say she observed the state of the traffic lights at the intersection, her evidence about there being no cars in any of the southbound lanes at the time of the collision was inconsistent with the light facing southbound traffic at the time being red. There were various criticisms that could be made of the evidence of some of the Crown witnesses (some of which I have mentioned in para [109] above), yet the judge referred to none of them. The only reference that the judge made to the extremely complex topic of the phasing of the lights was the passage I have set out at para [124] above. Mr Odgers submits that the trial judge made no reference to the evidence given by Mr Davison, Ms Rice and Mr Hampson, that he made no reference to the defence submission that the witnesses would have had no reason to concentrate on what happened until after the collision.  
     
      
       
      The Law 
       
      
    129 In RPS v R [2000] HCA 3; (2000) 199 CLR 620 Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ at [41]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The fundamental task of a trial judge is, of course, to ensure a fair trial to the accused. … Subject to any applicable statutory provisions it  
        will require  
        the judge to identify the issues in the case and relate the law to those issues [citations omitted]. It  
        will require 
         the judge to put fairly before the jury the case which the accused makes.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    130 In Alford v Magee (1952) 85 CLR 437 at 466 Dixon, Williams, Webb, Fullaghar and Kitto JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the judge was charged with, and bound to accept, the responsibility (1) of deciding what are the real issues in the particular case, and (2) of telling the jury, in the light of the law, what those issues are.” 
        
       
      
    131 Though Alford v Magee was a civil case, it was cited by the High Court in RPS at [41] as authority for the proposition that “Subject to any applicable statutory provisions it will require the judge to identify the issues in the case and to relate the law to those issues”.  
     
      
    132 In R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355 at [76] Wood CJ at CL said that the task of a judge: 
     
      
       
        
        “… requires the judge to explain why it is that the accused asserts that his guilt has not been established beyond reasonable doubt … So far as the accused is concerned, it is the case which the defence makes that the jury must be given to understand, including any matter that is properly open upon which they might find for the accused:

        (1971) 124 CLR 107.” 
        
       
      
    133 Wood CJ at CL went on, at [82]-[86] to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is essential, if a summing up is to be fair and balanced, that the defence case be put to the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Regina v Schmahl 
          
        [1965] VR 745, Winneke CJ (with whom Scholl and Pape JJ agreed) said, in this respect (at 748): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘… Failure adequately to put the defence is, of course, a well-recognized ground of appeal. See the case of  
          R v Wilson 
           (1913) 9 Cr App R 124. In a case like this where the evidence was lengthy, and by no means easy to unravel, and where it related to a conversation which had taken place so long before, the interests of justice required that the defence of the applicant should be clearly and fully presented to the jury. Failure to make such a presentation where it relates to an important part of the defence makes it dangerous, in my view, to allow the verdict to stand. In such circumstances, the recent decision of the High Court in  
          Raspor v R 
           (1958) 99 CLR 346; [1958] ALR (CN) 1062, shows, if authority for such a proposition be needed, that it is not only the function but the duty of this Court to hold that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. In such a case it is not possible to save the verdict by the application of the proviso to s 568(1) of the Crimes Act 1958 …’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Regina v Tomazos 
         [(NSWCCA, 6 August 1971, unreported)] this Court approved the passage quoted above. Isaacs J added: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘In the result the conclusion appears to me to be inevitable that not only has there been a miscarriage of justice but a substantial miscarriage. The Appellant has not had what in law he is entitled to have, and that is a trial according to law. A trial according to law includes as an essential prerequisite that the trial judge has put fairly, cogently and with clarity to the jury the accused’s defence. The weaker the defence the more essential it is for his defence such as it is to be put to the jury so that they can consider it in the light of the Crown case and evaluate it as part of their assessment together with the Crown evidence to see whether the Crown has discharged its onus of proof. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          […] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          It can properly be said that the accused fairly lost a chance of acquittal because his case was never put to the jury by the trial judge. It is completely insufficient for a trial judge simply to say to the jury in effect, “Well, you have heard all that has been said on behalf of the accused by his counsel; it is unnecessary for me to say anything more”. The trial judge must lend the weight of his judicial position and authority to putting before the jury himself the case for the accused.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Similarly in  
        R v Malone 
         [(NSWCCA, 20 April 1994, unreported)] Blanch J (with whom Grove and Studdert JJ agreed) said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘What is of paramount significance in assessing a summing-up is to determine whether the defence has been fairly put thus allowing a jury properly to consider the issues raised on the accused’s behalf. If a jury is not given the opportunity fairly to consider the defence case, then there has been a miscarriage of justice. Another way this can occur is illustrated in  
          Van Leeuwen v The Queen 
           (1981) 55 ALJR 726 where Gibbs CJ at page 728 said: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ‘A trial judge is not bound in his summing up to comment on all of the evidence or to refer to all of the contentions on which the accused has relied. The adequacy of a summing up in its references to questions of fact must depend upon the circumstances of the particular case. In the present case the learned trial judge not only failed to indicate to the jury the significance of the important piece of evidence but by stating that he did not follow the argument of counsel might have been [thought] by the jury to be depreciating its importance.’’ 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Whether there has been a balance in the summing up, or not, does not however depend upon a comparison between the time that was spent on the prosecution and defence cases, respectively. Almost inevitably the bulk of the evidence is led in the prosecution case, and more often than not more time will need to be spent on it: see  
        R v Courtney-Smith (No 2) 
         [(1990) 48 A Crim R 49] where the Court (Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Lusher AJ) said at 56: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘… It is not the length of the time devoted to the case of the Crown or the accused which is in issue. It is the fairness, balance and impartiality of the summing up which the appellate court must review and safeguard.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    134 In R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 105 Hunt, Enderby and Sharp JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A summing-up should, in every case, not only include directions as to the ingredients of the offence which the Crown has to establish and an explanation of how the relevant law may be applied to the facts of the particular case, but it should also include a collected resumé of the evidence which relates to  
        each 
         of those ingredients and a brief outline of the arguments which have been put in relation to that evidence … The idea of a summing up is to present for the jury the issues of fact which they have to determine.” (original emphasis) 
        
       
      
    135 That statement would now need to be read in the light of section 161 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The predecessor of section 161 Criminal Procedure Act, namely section 405AA Crimes Act 1900, was first inserted in the Crimes Act in 1990 by Criminal Procedure Legislation (Amendment) Act 1990 and commenced 17 March 1991, hence was not in effect at the time of the trial considered by this Court in Zorad. 
     
      
    136 Section 405AA Crimes Act 1900 was in substantially the same terms as section 161 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which says: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) At the end of a criminal trial before a jury, a Judge need not summarise the evidence given in the trial if of the opinion that, in all the circumstances of the trial, a summary is not necessary. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) This section applies despite any rule of law or practice to the contrary. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Nothing in this section affects any aspect of a Judge’s summing up function other than the summary of evidence in a trial.” 
        
       
      
    137 The manner in which section 405AA affected the duty of a judge in summing was considered by this Court Condon v R (1995) 83 A Crim R 335. Allen J (with whom Newman and Simpson JJ agreed) said, at 347-348: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it is the task of the trial judge not merely to give formal directions of law as to the legal elements of the offence charged but to explain to the jury the application of those elements to the respective cases of the Crown and of the accused. In short, it is his duty to give them assistance so that they understand what the critical issues of fact are upon application of the law to the particular case. The trial judge is not relieved from that duty by the arguments of counsel. Indeed … it would not be enough even for the trial judge accurately to state what the case for the accused is as it has been presented … s 405AA does not relieve a trial judge of the duties to which I have referred. The fulfilment of those duties does not require that the evidence be summarised as distinct from the respective cases being stated and the jury instructed as to the application of the law to those cases.”  
        
       
       
      That statement continues to be accurate if the reference to section 405AA  
      Crimes Act  
      is replaced by a reference to section 161  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
      . 
       
      
    138 We were referred to a judgment that is presently the subject of a non-publication order, but which will, when that non-publication order is lifted, be identifiable from its citation as [2006] NSWCCA 235, and in particular to paras [59]–[65] of the judgment of Smart AJ (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed). It suffices to say that there is nothing in those paragraphs that is inconsistent with the principles I have cited at paras [129]–[137] of this judgment. We were also referred to the decision in R v Abbas [2006] NSWCCA 331, but that case does not purport to state any new legal principle, or to be anything other than an application, to the facts of the particular case, of the decision of the High Court in M v The Queen.  
     
      
    139 The Crown drew our attention to Cleland v The Queen (1982) 151 CLR 1 at 10, where Gibbs CJ (with whom Wilson and Dawson JJ agreed on this point) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear in principle that a trial judge, when directing a jury in a criminal trial, must hold an even balance between the cases of the prosecution and the accused and must fairly direct the consideration of the jury to the matters raised by the accused in his defence. In what manner, and in what detail, this should be done must of course depend on the circumstances of each case.” 
        
       
       
      While that statement leaves considerable latitude to a trial judge in deciding what to tell the jury in his or her summing up about the case of the accused, it does not suggest that one of the available alternatives is to tell the jury nothing on that topic. Indeed, it makes clear that, however he or she might decide to do it, the trial judge  
      “must fairly direct the consideration of the jury to the matters raised by the accused in his defence.” 
       
      
    140 The Crown also drew attention to Kim Williams v R [1999] NSWCCA 9; (1999) 104 A Crim R 260 at [37], where Wood CJ at CL (with whom Spigelman CJ and McInerney J agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was next submitted that his Honour failed sufficiently to summarise the key points of the defence case, specifically in relation to weaknesses in the complainant's evidence. The trial was a short one, the evidence having begun and concluded within two days. In those circumstances it was entirely appropriate for his Honour to take the course followed, of not summing up the evidence, as is permitted by s 405AA of the  
        Crimes Act 
        .” 
        
       
      
    141 As Condon makes clear, when section 405AA Crimes Act (or, now, section 161 Criminal Procedure Act) relieves the judge of a positive obligation to summarise the evidence if the circumstances of the particular trial make that not necessary, it does not relieve the judge of the obligation to put the case of the accused to the jury, and instruct the jury about how the law applies to that case. The way in which the accused’s case is put to the jury must make it clear that the onus of proof remains on the prosecution, but the case must still be put.  
     
      
    142 Here, there was neither a putting of the defence case to the jury, nor an application of the law to that case. However, even when asked if there were any supplementary directions requested, counsel for the appellant at the trial did not ask for this deficiency in the summing up to be remedied. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules says:  
     
      
       
        
        “No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.” 
        
       
       
      It follows that ground 2 can be raised in the present appeal only if the court grants leave to do so.  
       
      
    143 In Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 at [10]-[13], Giles JA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The requirements of r 4 do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside:  
        R v Abusafiah 
         (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536.  
        
       
       
        
        In  
        R v Tripodina 
         (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 191 this Court held:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘… It is the duty of counsel appearing at the trial to take objection to matters which, in their view, are irregular, or which might be unduly prejudicial to their client, and in particular to raise, in relation to the summing up, any matters which the trial judge may have overlooked or which, in their view, he has put erroneously.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        A failure by counsel to perform this duty may be explicable because:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) he overlooked the point or was unaware of the law on the subject; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) he deliberately said nothing hoping to gain a tactical advantage at a later stage; or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) he took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, he saw no injustice or error in what was done:  
        R v Tripodina 
          
        (at 193, 191). 
        
       
       
        
        Generally speaking, leave under r 4 will only be granted where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings:  
        R v Tripodina 
         (at 195) or as Mahoney JA said in  
        R v Jeffrey 
         (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993, unreported), at 7, followed in  
        R v DH 
         [2000] NSWCCA 360,  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘… unless there be a convincing reason why the matter was not raised at the trial and unless the possibility of real injustice appears, an accused should be held to what was done by or for him at trial level.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    144 An example of an irregularity that goes to the root of the proceedings, and hence is such that a conviction cannot be saved by an application of Rule 4, is the failure of the judge to direct the jury about an essential element of the Crown case: Ward v R (1996) 88 A Crim R 159 at 164. 
     
      
    145 No explanation was provided, at the hearing of the appeal, as to why the objections were not taken at trial. Counsel for the appellant at the trial was an experienced criminal lawyer. Those two matters are ones that frequently count against leave being granted under Rule 4. Even so, the deficiency in the summing up in the present case is, in my view, one that is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings. There are repeated statements of high authority that the defence case must be put to the jury, and the jury must be instructed about how the law applies to that case. 
     
      
    146 It follows that the summing up had such a deficiency that leave should be granted under Rule 4, and the conviction should be quashed.  
     
      
    147 Mr Odgers’ submission that the judge made no reference to the evidence of Mr Davison, Ms Rice and Mr Hampson is not strictly correct, in that the judge mentioned their names in the course of a listing of all the witnesses in the case, but is correct in the sense that the judge said nothing about the substance of their evidence. This is one of several more specific criticisms that Mr Odgers made of the failure of the judge to refer to particular pieces of evidence that the jury might regard as weaknesses in the Crown case. In the light of section 161 Criminal Procedure Act, a trial judge has a significant discretion about the extent to which evidence needs to be summarised. While there are circumstances in which this court might decide that the failure of a trial judge to refer to certain items of evidence, or to relate certain items of evidence to the accused’s case, was so serious that the judge could not have validly exercised his or her discretion under section 161, it is not necessary to decide whether the present case is such a case. That is because the failure to put the accused’s case to the jury at all, and to apply the law to that case, is a sufficient reason why the conviction cannot stand.  
     
      
    148 There remains a question of what order is the appropriate one to make. The Appellant has been in custody since 14 December 2007. He was sentenced on 15 January 2008. His sentence was to five years imprisonment, dating from 14 December 2007, with a minimum period in custody of three years, and disqualification from holding or obtaining a licence for a period of five years from 31 October 2007 to 30 October 2012. Thus he has now served a little less than half of the minimum period in custody, and a little more than a quarter of the total head sentence. In light of those facts, and of the first and third grounds of appeal not having been upheld, this is not a case in which it would be appropriate to quash the conviction without making an order that there be a new trial.  
     
      
    149 There was another charge against the Appellant concerning which the judge imposed a penalty at the same time as sentencing the Appellant for the offence of driving in a manner dangerous causing death. The penalty imposed was of disqualification for a period of two years concurrent. It is inappropriate to give any more details concerning that charge in this judgment. There has been no appeal relating to that other charge. Quashing the conviction on the charge of driving in a manner dangerous causing death will not have any effect on the penalty concerning that other charge.  
     
      
    150 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. Quash the conviction of the appellant on the charge of driving in a manner dangerous causing death.  
       
       
      2. There be a new trial.  
       
      
    151 GROVE J: I agree with Campbell JA. 
     
      
    152 HOWIE J: I agree with Campbell JA.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Yusuf Aytugrul, was found guilty by a jury of the murder of Ms Sevda Bayrak. The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of 20 years.Facts2 Ms Bayrak was a 33-year-old single mother who lived with her 8-year-old daughter in a home unit in Betts Street, Parramatta. There she was brutally killed shortly after 8pm on Saturday 26 November 2005. Her assailant stabbed her a great many times. Stab wounds were found all over her body. The forensic pathologist said death was due to blood loss following multiple stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.3 I am satisfied that the killing of Ms Bayrak was the culmination of a period of sustained behaviour by the offender towards her that demonstrated that he was utterly obsessed with her. There were a number of acts amounting to stalking and intimidation. 4 The offender met Ms Bayrak in 2002 through their children who attended the same primary school. They had an intimate relationship as boyfriend and girlfriend for about 12 months. Ms Bayrak travelled to Turkey, the homeland of her family, for some five months, returning in late 2004. The offender thought that she had moved to live permanently in Turkey and was surprised when he saw her in a street in Auburn in early 2005. He was later to tell police that he had no love for her at that time and they were just “friends”. 5 There was evidence that he rang her on 5 June 2005. It is unknown what was said but it must be more than just coincidence that it was on the following day that the offender telephoned a man he knew who worked for Centrelink who accessed that organisation’s confidential records and provided the offender with Ms Bayrak’s address in Crown Street, Merrylands. She had only moved in at that address some 3 weeks before. 6 The offender visited Ms Bayrak on one occasion at the Merrylands address. His son was with him and he used the pretext of saying that his son wanted to play with her daughter. Ms Bayrak later told her sister that she was quite surprised at this visit and that she had asked the offender how he had found out her address. She said that he replied, “I have my ways of finding things out. I can find things out whenever I want.” She told another family member that the offender spoke of still loving her and wanting to resume their relationship. She, however, told him that she was not interested.7 On 29 June 2005 he had a letter and a poem published in Turkish News Weekly. They were directed to Ms Bayrak. The letter expressed deep sorrow concerning the ending of their relationship. The poem had the title “I Can Not Give Up”. It included the following (quoting from a translation from the Turkish language):  
     
      
       
        
        Even if you don’t want to remember my name,  
         
        Don’t want to hear my voice 
         
        Even if you say give up, I can not give you up 
         
        Even if you say forget, I can not forget the beautiful 
         
        Days we lived 
         
        Even if you cry all your hate, say give up, 
         
        I can not give up 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    8 It is clear from what Ms Bayrak said to members of her family that she did not want any contact from the offender. She complained that he was following her. There was also evidence of property damage outside of the units at Merrylands, including to her car, but the evidence is insufficient to support a conclusion that the offender was responsible. 9 The property damage at Merrylands occurred in the period August to October 2005. On 25 October 2005 Ms Bayrak moved to a unit in Betts Street, Parramatta. She went to great lengths to keep this address confidential out of fear of further acts of harassment. On 4 November 2005 two men attended her old address at Merrylands in the early hours of the morning inquiring about Ms Bayrak. They were told that she no longer lived there. There is no evidence identifying either man as the offender. However, and again it seems to be more than coincidence, later on that day he rang his contact at Centrelink and found out Ms Bayrak’s new address in Parramatta. 10 There was telephone contact between Ms Bayrak and the offender in November. It included a text message he sent to her in which he referred to her blaming him for her number plates being stolen. Ten minutes later he sent her another message in which he said, “Alright, understood, there’s a god above. What can I say. I pray for your health”. The Crown contended that this was a threat, which I accept it was.11 On 23 November the offender made a phone call to the Centrelink “Report a Fraud” hotline and reported Ms Bayrak for alleged fraudulent conduct in relation to welfare payments.12 On 25 November the offender twice called Ms Bayrak but on each occasion she did not answer.13 On Saturday 26 November Ms Bayrak’s daughter was being looked after by her sister, Ms Semra Bas. At 8.04pm Ms Bayrak telephoned Ms Bas and told her that she was coming over to collect her daughter. That was the last time she was known to be alive. It was common ground that she was murdered a very short time after making that telephone call. Her body was found lying just inside the front door of her unit at around midday the following day.14 There was a lengthy police investigation that culminated in the arrest of the offender on 5 June 2007. He has been in custody since.Subjective features15 The offender was aged 40 at the time of the offence and he is now 43.16 He has no previous convictions and, to that extent at least, he was of prior good character. The law requires that I take these matters into account as mitigating factors. 17 The offender did not give evidence in the trial or in the sentence proceedings. I do, however, have a report by Dr Stephen Allnutt that sets out some of the offender’s background. He was born in Turkey and completed his high school education at the age of 18. His family were loving and supportive. He came to this country at the age of 21. He has worked as a taxi driver and in factories. He was married between 1994 and 1998 and there was one son born to this relationship who is now aged 11. He has no history of alcohol or drug abuse and he has not experienced any medical or mental health issues of note. He has been receiving visits in gaol from family and friends. He is described as being anxious and manifesting some symptoms of depression in the custodial environment, although Dr Allnutt declined to diagnose a major depressive disorder. 18 Dr Allnutt was unable to offer any opinion as to future risk because the offender continues to deny the offence. The doctor was unable to say anything about the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation for the same reason. I note that he is reported to have denied some matters to Dr Allnutt that were either conceded at the trial or were the subject of overwhelming proof but I need not dwell on that.Objective seriousness of the offence19 The Crown has submitted that the offender should be imprisoned for life. That is the sentence that I must impose if I am satisfied that the offender’s “level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence”: s 61(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.20 I can say at once that I am not satisfied that “community protection” is a relevant consideration in making this determination. Certainly the circumstances attending the offence were extremely violent and brutal. However the offender has no previous convictions, there is no suggestion of any prior violent conduct, there is an absence of any mental disorder or psychiatric condition, and Dr Allnutt was not able to make any assessment of future risk. In these circumstances I am not satisfied that the offender would present a danger to the community when released from prison many years in the future solely upon the basis of this single incident, albeit one of such extreme violence. The Crown submitted that the denials made by the offender to Dr Allnutt of various incidents relating to his conduct towards the deceased in the six months before the murder point to future dangerousness but I am not satisfied that is so. 21 What then is the offender’s “level of culpability”? One matter that bears upon that issue is whether the killing was planned or spontaneous. The Crown submitted that I should find that it was planned in that there was the preceding campaign of stalking and intimidation and that on the night of the murder the offender went to Ms Bayrak’s home armed with a knife. There was evidence that a neighbour saw a man outside the front door of Ms Bayrak’s unit with a plastic bag in his hand. It is accepted that this man must have been the offender. The Crown invites the inference that a knife was in the plastic bag. However, Ms Davenport, senior counsel for the offender, referred me to the lack of evidence to establish that a knife already within the unit was used as the murder weapon. That weapon has never been recovered. In my view the Crown’s contention is probably correct. Why else would the offender be carrying a bag? If he took a knife to the unit, it would follow almost inevitably that he planned to kill Ms Bayrak because that is something that must have happened very soon after he gained entry to the unit. However, because it would be a matter of aggravation to find that the murder was planned I would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. There remains in my mind an element of doubt because of the failure to exclude the possibility that a knife already in the unit was used and the fact that the murder weapon was not found. Accordingly, I cannot take into account that the offence was premeditated. 
     
      
    22 What I am satisfied of is that the offender was obsessed with Ms Bayrak and that this obsession particularly soured in the weeks leading up to her murder. He must have been well aware that Ms Bayrak was not interested in having any contact with him and was actively avoiding it. He knew she was in fear of being followed by him. He went to significant lengths to find out her new address, using a contact with access to confidential government information. He sent her a threatening text message and he reported her for having allegedly committed fraud. I interpolate here that doing something with the intention of getting her into trouble is inconsistent with planning to kill her. I am satisfied he went around to her home that Saturday evening intent on confronting her and furthering in some way his campaign of intimidation and harassment. Something occurred in the course of that confrontation - and it must have happened quite quickly - that caused him to vent his feelings in the most violent, callous, brutal and inhumane way. She was an utterly blameless victim. It is also a significant matter that he committed many more violent acts upon her than would have been necessary to simply kill her.23 The fact that the offence occurred within the deceased’s own home where she was entitled to feel safe is an aggravating circumstance. So to is the fact that a weapon was used, although given that this is a common feature of this type of crime it is of minimal significance. Another relevant matter is that the offender was well aware of Ms Bayrak being a single mother. I am satisfied that he knew that killing Ms Bayrak would cause ancillary harm to an eight year old girl in depriving her of her mother, but he went ahead and killed nonetheless: see R v Lewis [2001] NSWCCA 448 at [67]; Aslett v R [2006] NSWCCA 360 at [37]. A final matter to note in relation to these matters bearing upon the offender’s level of culpability and the objective seriousness of the offence is that this is a case that quite clearly involved an intention to kill and nothing less. That is generally regarded as a consideration tending to greater objective seriousness: see Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290 at [49].24 To conclude, I am satisfied that the offender’s level of culpability for the offence is quite significant. However I am not satisfied that it is so extreme that a life sentence must be imposed. Putting that in slightly different terms, I am not satisfied that this case falls into the worst case category. 25 I must then consider whether the objective seriousness of the offence falls within the middle of the range. Ms Davenport did not resist such a finding. If the offence is at that point in the range, consideration must be given to whether the standard non-parole period should be imposed. There is a very wide range of circumstances in which the crime of murder can be committed. Having regard to the circumstances I have just been describing I have concluded that this case falls slightly above the middle of the range. The fact that I have not been satisfied to the required standard that there was planning involved does not necessarily require a finding that the offence is below that point in the range: see Versluys v R [2008] NSWCCA 76 at [34]. The effect of the finding that the offence is above the middle of the range is that I am not required to impose the standard non-parole period. Nevertheless, that period, along with the maximum penalty, remain relevant as benchmarks against which to assess the appropriate sentence to be imposed. 26 It is necessary to consider all of the other features of the case in order to determine where within the range of sentences that would appropriately reflect the objective seriousness of the offence I should identify the appropriate sentence. There are the mitigating features I referred to earlier of no previous convictions and prior good character. These are matters of some significance for a man who has attained the age of 40 and is experiencing imprisonment for the first time. I am unable to find in the offender’s favour that he is remorseful, that he has good prospects for rehabilitation, and is unlikely to re-offend, given that he continues to deny his guilt. A finding in respect of the latter 2 matters would only be possible if there was a greater degree of understanding of the reasons for his offending conduct. I am not persuaded to accept the submission that the mere fact he might be in his sixties when he is eligible for release justifies such findings.27 I should also record that I have considered whether I should find special circumstances and reduce the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period, notwithstanding no submission was made that I should make such a finding. I have concluded that the length of the potential parole period that will be available under a sentence having the usual statutory proportions will be more than adequate to assist the offender reintegrate into the community.Victim impact28 Victim impact statements have been made by Ms Semra Bas, the deceased’s sister, and by the deceased’s daughter. I acknowledge the pain, grief and loss they speak of and I trust that in some small way they feel some benefit in having this acknowledged in a public way. The law is clear about taking into account the effect that the death of a person has upon others (see R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76) but I do wish to say to the writers of these victim impact statements, and to other members of Ms Bayrak’s family and friends, that I do care for your loss and you have my condolences.Sentence29 Convicted30 Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 21 years and a balance of the term of the sentence of 7 years. The sentence will date from 5 June 2007 and the offender will be eligible for release on parole on the expiration of the non-parole period on 4 June 2028.

    JUDGMENT1. The Crown Prosecutor tendered a voicemail message and Mr Brasch who appears for the accused objected to the tender. The evidence is that the voicemail message was received on 11 March 2007 at 6.45pm. The voicemail message was left by the complainant in these proceedings on the voicemail message service of her boyfriend’s phone. The voicemail message was left when the complainant was in hospital having alleged that she was sexually assaulted an hour or so beforehand by the accused. There are other voicemail messages to which Mr Brasch does not take exception. The latest of those voicemail messages was just over an hour before the controversial voicemail message. 2. The message which Mr Brasch objects to is short. The transcript of the message reads, “Hey baby its me [x[ I really need you here… I can’t do this on my own love you bye”.3. Ms Dobraszczyk who appears as Crown Prosecutor tenders that evidence and argues that it is admissible on three bases. The first basis is that it is similar to evidence of distress exhibited by a complainant in sexual assault proceedings. The second basis is that it is evidence which is an essential part of a transaction and close to the time of the alleged crime. The third basis is that it is evidence relevant to the relationship between the complainant and her boyfriend.4. Mr Brasch objects to the relevance of the evidence. As well he asserts that the evidence is hearsay. Thirdly, he argues that the evidence should be excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995.5. I deal first with the second basis of argued admissibility by Ms Dobraszczyk. She relied upon the decision of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Adam (1999) 106 A Crim R 510. In that judgment the court referred to a basis of admissibility of the kind relied upon by Ms Dobraszczyk in the following terms at [20]:  
     
     “ 
     It was also submitted that the evidence was admissible under the principle in O’Leary (1946) 73 CLR 566, that the conduct of the appellant Richard Adam formed an integral part of a ‘transaction’ consisting of connected events….” 
      
     The reference to  
     O’Leary 
      is developed in [23] where the Court quoted from the judgment of Sir Owen Dixon in that case. The passage quoted is this: 
      
     “ 
     Without (the evidence in question) the transaction of which the alleged murder formed an integral part could not be truly understood and, isolated from it, could only be presented as an unreal and not very intelligible event. The prisoner’s generally violent and hostile conduct might well serve to explain his mind and attitude, and therefore to implicate him in the resulting homicide.” 
     
    6. I am not convinced that the voicemail message being tendered in this case is so integral to the events which occurred beforehand - which are claimed to amount to sexual assaults - that those events could not be properly understood without the voicemail evidence. I reject that basis for the tender.7. In pressing her submission that the evidence is relevant in a way analogous to distress being corroborative in sexual assault cases including demeanour and reaction of the complainant, Ms Dobraszczyk referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in R v Grattan [2005] NSWCCA 306. The Court in that case at [122] referred to the well accepted principles set out by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Flannery [1969] VR 586 noting that “before the evidence could be admitted it was necessary to determine whether it is a reasonable inference from the evidence that a causal connection exists between the matter of complaint alleged and the distressed condition”. 
    8. Mr Brasch acknowledges the relevance of the call in question but argues that its probative value is no more than slight. There is in this case evidence of earlier complaint which is not objected to. He also referred to the time gap of about an hour between the events and this telephone call. 9. So far as the time gap is concerned I am not satisfied that it is so significant as to render the evidence irrelevant. In Grattan at [123] the Chief Judge at Common Law with whom Simpson and Rothman JJ agreed said: 
     
     “To my mind, the passing of two months since the happening of a potential traumatic event is an insignificant time. Distress could accompany the retelling of events months or even years after they occurred depending on the nature of the events and their impact on the victim.” 
      
      
     I do not regard in this case a gap of one hour as sufficient to render the evidence irrelevant.  
       
      
    10. But Mr Brasch argues that I should exclude the evidence under s 137 of the Evidence Act because its probative value, which as I said he argues is slight, is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to his client. The unfair prejudice, he argues, is that the evidence would evoke sympathy in the jury which would lead to a process of reasoning not logically connected with the issues in the trial.11. I can appreciate his point and there may well be a tendency for the evidence to evoke sympathy, but it is not unusual that evidence of this kind being relied upon to demonstrate distress of a person who claims to be the victim of a crime would produce feelings of sympathy in those who hear the evidence. In those circumstances the prejudice generated, if at all, in my opinion is not unfair. In the exercise of the balancing required by the section I do not regard the probative value as outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice. I should add that for abundant caution I would entertain an application to direct the jury about an emotional response to the evidence. I do not know which way I would rule but I mention it now so that the parties may consider whether such a direction would be appropriate. 12. The third basis for Ms Dobrasczcyk’s tender of the evidence is that it points to the relationship between the complainant and her boyfriend. This case is a retrial after a jury failed to reach a verdict on a previous occasion. I understand from what I am told that an issue in the previous cross-examination of the complainant arose concerning the precise nature of the relationship between the complainant and her boyfriend. Arguments were put about the nature of that relationship. 13. Mr Brasch acknowledges the force of that argument but once again falls back upon s 137. For the reasons already given I do not regard the probative value of the evidence as being outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice. The probative value - given the issues which are said to arise in cross-examination on the previous occasion - is obviously of some significance.14. Finally Mr Brasch’s overall objection to the evidence is that it is hearsay evidence. The hearsay rule is contained in s 59(1) of the Evidence Act. It provides that evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that it can reasonably supposed that the person intended to assert by the representation. When the tendered message is examined it seems to me that the only fact which it could reasonably be supposed the caller - who is the complainant - intended to assert was that “it’s me, [x]”. I understand that that is not in dispute. In any event the complainant was called to give evidence on the previous occasion and in my opinion that means that s 66 of the Evidence Act applies so that the hearsay rule does not apply.15. As to the balance of the message, in my opinion it falls within s 66A of the Evidence Act. The words “I really need you here…I can’t do this on my own love you bye” are representations or amount to a contemporaneous representation about the complainant’s feelings and state of mind. Because I have that view, the hearsay rule does not apply by reason of s 66A of the Evidence Act.16. For those reasons I ruled yesterday that the evidence which was contained in Item 2 of the VD-A was admissible.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
        
      Introduction 
      
    1 THE COURT: In R v MacDonald (NSWCCA, unreported, 12 December 1995) this Court stressed the importance of the sentence imposed upon an offender fulfilling all the purposes of punishment including the denunciatory purpose of sentencing. That is the purpose of punishment expressly stated in s 3A(f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. MacDonald was a decision dealing with a case of homicide but the principle for which it stands applies to sentencing for all serious offences. Society is entitled to have the sentence imposed denounce the criminal conduct of the offender and, if the sentence does not do so, there has been an error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The sentence imposed upon the respondent falls far short of appropriately denouncing his crime. This is only one of the errors committed by the sentencing Judge in the present case, but it is the most serious. 
     
      
    2 The respondent was sentenced for an offence contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act being an offence of having sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years. He also asked the sentencing judge (Geraghty DCJ) to take into account three offences on a Form 1. These were an act of indecency, a stealing from a dwelling and an attempt to take a motor vehicle. The maximum penalty prescribed for the s 66A offence is imprisonment for 25 years and there is an applicable standard non-parole period of 15 years. 
     
      
    3 The Judge sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for 2 years and suspended the sentence upon the respondent entering into a bond for a period of 2 years. 
     
      
    4 The Crown has appealed against the sentence alleging that it is manifestly inadequate. The respondent was sentenced on 6 February 2009. The Crown filed a Notice of Appeal on 3 March 2009 and it was served personally upon the respondent the next day. 
     
      
    5 The Crown has filed lengthy written submissions setting out a number of asserted errors made by the sentencing Judge as a result of which the Crown contends his sentencing exercise miscarried. However, ultimately the Crown is required to satisfy the Court that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    6 The burden of determining this matter has been greatly relieved by concessions sensibly made by senior counsel appearing for the respondent, Mr Haesler SC. He has conceded that there were two substantial errors made by the Judge. The first is that his Honour erred in applying, what the Judge referred to as, the “Ellis discount” whereby he reduced what his Honour thought was the otherwise appropriate sentence by 25 per cent. The second concession is that the Judge was in error in suspending the sentence imposed. The effect of these concessions is that the sentence must be manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
    7 Further Mr Haesler SC accepted that it was open to this Court, in the exercise of its discretion, to intervene and re-sentence the respondent. It was conceded that, if the Court did uphold the Crown appeal, it would impose a sentence of full-time custody requiring the respondent to be returned to custody. After hearing the appeal and before reserving its decision, the Court indicated to Mr Haesler that the respondent should be present when judgment is delivered and he should expect to be returned to custody. 
     
      
       
        
        The facts 
        
       
      
    8 On 22 November 2007 the complainant, a girl of the age of 4 years, was staying overnight at the home of her grandmother. There were a number of other children staying at the premises including the complainant’s stepsisters, aged 12 and 14, and her sister, aged 3. All the residents of the house were in bed by 10.30pm. The complainant was in the front bedroom which she was sharing with another child. However, they had separate beds. There were lights on in the kitchen and a bathroom at the rear of the house. 
     
      
    9 The respondent entered the house through the rear door by opening the bottom half of it. He entered the bedroom in which the complainant was asleep. He turned off the night-light and removed his pants and underpants. He then removed the complainant’s pyjama pants and panties. The complainant woke and told him to go away. The respondent penetrated the child’s vagina with his finger. This conduct gave rise to the offence for which the respondent was to be sentenced. He masturbated while leaning over the child, ejaculating onto the bedclothes. This conduct gave rise to the act of indecency offence on the Form 1. He then left the room leaving behind his underpants. 
     
      
    10 He went into the kitchen and took a bottle of juice from the refrigerator and a can of drink from the bench. He took a number of sets of keys from a rack in the hallway. He walked to a car parked on the property and consumed the can of drink. He tried to enter the car with the sets of keys that he had taken but without success. He tried to use a pair of scissors but they broke. He then smashed the side window with a paver. He entered the vehicle and took off his singlet. Apparently he was unable to start the motor vehicle and left it with the door open. This conduct gave rise to the two dishonesty offences on the Form 1. 
     
      
    11 As soon as the respondent left, the complainant ran to the bedroom where her stepsisters were sleeping. She said that a man was in her bedroom, he had “licked my fanny” and wet her bed. At first her stepsisters did not believe her but later they saw the backdoor open. The complainant slept with them until morning. 
     
      
    12 The next day the complainant’s grandmother noticed the back door was open, saw keys on the grass outside with the can of drink and bottle of juice. She also saw the smashed window of the car. She then rang police. The complainant’s stepsisters told her what had happened the previous night. Police found the respondent’s palm print on a window of the car. DNA evidence ultimately identified the involvement of the respondent in the offence. 
     
      
    13 The complainant was taken to Grafton Hospital and then to Brisbane. She was examined by a paediatrician who observed “an area of increased erythema to the right of the hymen which was consistent with trauma”. This injury was consistent with symptoms of pain on urination and tenderness on examination. The trauma would have involved penetration through the labia but she could not tell whether there had been penetration of the hymen. The complainant was interviewed on 24 November and told police that the man “licked my fanny” and he “put his bits on me”. When asked what he used to lick her fanny she said “his finger” and “his hand”. She also told him that he “wet the bed……with his bits”. 
     
      
    14 The respondent was arrested on 28 November 2007. On two occasions while being conveyed in a police vehicle he asked to speak to one of the officers. The vehicle was stopped and the conversations tape-recorded. At one point in the trip he said to the officer, “….I didn’t rape that little girl, I just stuck my finger inside her”. He then asked for the vehicle to be stopped again and said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I did not rape her but, I did go there and I did molest her but, I was leaning over and masturbating and then I was looking for the keys for the car, and I was trying to start the car. And then I fucked off and I left my shirt and shit there and then I went to my uncle’s. Then I slept in the car and that’s the dead set truth. That’s how I can remember the night. 
        
       
      
    15 He made other admissions and at one stage was asked how he was feeling. He replied: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Shittin’ just shittin’. Doing years, thinking 34, 30, 36, I’ll be getting out probably. I’m fucked just for doing that. 
        
       
      
    16 Police later conducted a formal interview during which the respondent adopted the conversations in the vehicle that had been recorded and made further admissions. At one stage he said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I didn’t rape her. I was like more just masturbatin’ myself and playing with that slut……… 
        
       
       
        
      Subjective matters 
      
    17 The applicant was aged 23 at the time of the offences. He is of the Aboriginal race. He has a criminal record that commenced in 1999 when he appeared in the Childrens Court for offences of break, enter and steal and malicious damage. Since then there have been repeated appearances in the Childrens Court and later in the Local Court for offences of dishonesty, principally for the theft of motor vehicles or for break, enter and steal offences. In 2003 he was given the benefit of a suspended sentence for taking a conveyance without the consent of the owner. In 2005 he was given a full-time custodial sentence for malicious damage and a break and enter. He breached parole when released under that sentence and spent about 8 months in custody serving the balance of his parole. In August 2007 he was before the Local Court for driving having never been licensed and drive with high range PCA. On each of those two offences he received a suspended sentence. He committed the offence, for which he is now before the Court, in November 2007 while both of those suspended sentences were current. 
     
      
    18 There was a pre-sentence report before the Judge. It noted that the respondent had been using alcohol and cannabis since Year 7 and was doing so daily at the time of the offences. He often consumed alcohol until he blacked out. The report indicates that twice in 2005 the respondent had been asked to leave rehabilitation courses because of his drug usage. His parole was revoked in 2006 for further offending. 
     
      
    19 The respondent normally resides with his parents and they attempt to support him, as does his extended family. The respondent reported a good relationship with his parents. He has never held paid employment although he completed a Horticulture and Chainsaw Course at TAFE. The respondent’s mother stated to the author of the report that his behaviour since the age of 14 had been of concern to her and her husband but they had been unable to control him even with professional help. 
     
      
    20 He was asked about his attitude to the offending and he said that he was “the scum of the earth” and that his behaviour was “disgusting”. He maintained that he would not have committed the offence had he been sober. He was assessed as unsuitable for community service or periodic detention. However he needed a high level of intervention by the Probation Service in areas including “Anger Issues” and “Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse”. 
     
      
    21 There was a report from a psychiatrist, Dr Westmore. The respondent reported to him that he had been drinking alcohol since the age of 14 and that he would drink anything he could get. He acknowledged that he had a problem with alcohol. He had used cannabis as a teenager and since had consumed other drugs including ecstasy and amphetamines. He had left school at the age of 10 and taught himself to read and write in prison. He denied any thoughts of sexual conduct with children. Dr Westmore concluded: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……..he is a young man with multiple problems of an intellectual, social and psychological type. He has medical problems of drug and alcohol abuse and, if his risks of reoffending are going to be reduced in any significant way, he will need to enter into sobriety. For that to occur he will require considerable support both while in custody and particularly on his release. He will need to attend a long term, community based drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. 
        
       
      
    22 There was a letter from an Aboriginal Elder who had known the respondent since he was a child as his sister was the respondent’s grandmother. He had found the respondent a good worker except when he consumed alcohol and drugs and became “a different person”. He indicated the support that the respondent has from his family and extended family. 
     
      
    23 The respondent gave evidence. When asked how he felt about the offence on the child, he said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I feel absolutely ashamed of myself, embarrassed. I’m terribly sorry for what happened, I can’t imagine what that little girl’s going through at the moment. I’m just afraid and scared for what happened and ashamed and I’m very sorry. 
        
       
       
      He explained that he was on protection and could not have contact visits with his parents. He was usually in his cell for 23 hours a day. 
       
      
    24 His mother also gave evidence. She explained the effect of alcohol on the respondent and referred to his binge drinking until he had no more money. He would often ring her up at all hours of the day asking her to come and pick him up from wherever he had been drinking. Asked how the respondent felt about what he had done, she said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Oh so ashamed, so hurt, so upset, he cries but we can do nothing the big glass……….it took a long time for him to even put his head up and talk to us through the glass…. because of his shame. 
        
       
       
      The “big glass” was a reference to the fact that the respondent did not have contact visits with his parents because of his protected status. 
       
      
    25 The respondent had been in custody since his arrest on 28 November 2007, and, as has already been noted, was on protection. The sentence imposed upon the respondent had to take into account the time he had served. 
     
      
       
       
        
      The grounds of appeal 
      
    26 As it must do so on a Crown appeal, the Crown asserts that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. In effect the submission is that the sentence imposed does not reflect the criminality of the respondent’s conduct and could not act as a deterrent to others who are minded to sexually assault young children. In particular the Crown relies upon both the maximum penalty prescribed and statements made by this Court on many occasions as to the seriousness of this type of conduct and the necessity that it be visited with condign punishment. 
     
      
    27 We have at the very outset of this judgment indicated our view that the sentence imposed failed to appropriately denounce the respondent’s conduct. In effect that is because a sentence of two years, even had it not been suspended, did not manifest the seriousness of what the respondent did and could not reflect the community’s legitimate sense of outrage at this gross violation of a four year old child sleeping in her grandmother’s house by an intruder in that house. 
     
      
    28 It does not matter that the respondent may have already in effect served a sentence of more than 14 months. In MacDonald the respondent had served 17 months in custody on remand, but this Court held that an order deferring sentence upon him, even in light of the time he had served in custody, was manifestly inadequate because a bond was an inappropriate response to the offence committed. Although, unlike the respondent in MacDonald, the respondent here was subject to a sentence that on its face also failed to reflect the seriousness of the respondent’s conduct. The suspension of the sentence simply increased the inappropriateness of the Judge’s response to the respondent’s criminality. 
     
      
    29 However, the Crown relies upon a number of what it asserts to be specific errors in the Judge’s exercise of discretion. It is unnecessary, because of the concessions made upon the respondent’s behalf, to deal with all the matters raised by the Crown. However, there is a significant dispute about whether the Judge’s assessment of the seriousness of the criminality of the respondent’s conduct was correct or at least should be allowed to remain. It is important to resolve this issue notwithstanding the concessions made by Mr Haesler because it is crucial to the sentence the Court is to impose on resentencing. 
     
      
       
      Objective seriousness of the offending 
      
    30 The Crown contends that the Judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence and his approach to the standard non-parole period. The Judge was aware that there was a standard non-parole period and that, while it did not strictly apply because the respondent had pleaded guilty, it remained as a “signpost”. 
     
      
    31 One of the difficulties in this matter is that the Judge did not approach the task of determining the relevance of the standard non-parole period in the way that decisions of this Court have required. There is a staged approach that the Judge failed to follow. That approach was set out in MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; 164 A Crim R 93 at [33] and approved in Mencarious v R [2008] NSWCCA 237. The Judge was first to assess the objective seriousness of the offence, then to consider those matters in s 21A that either aggravated or mitigated the offending. The Judge next should have considered the matters on the Form 1 and the affect that they would have upon the assessment of the appropriate sentence for the offence. Then, having reached that stage and having determined the appropriate sentence with regard to the standard non-parole period, the Judge was to apply the discount for the plea of guilty. Depending upon the result, the Judge should ultimately have determined how the discounted sentence was to be served and, if necessary, what the appropriate non-parole period should be. 
     
      
    32 There are grounds of complaint by the Crown alleging the Judge’s failure to take into account the matters on the Form 1 and an alleged failure by the Judge to determine the sentence before deciding how it was to be served. But because of the manner in which the Judge went about his task, it is difficult to extract the relevant portion of the sentencing remarks and consider them in isolation. For example, there is a reference to at least one Form 1 matter when the Judge was assessing the objective seriousness of the sexual intercourse offence. The seriousness of the principal offence should be determined without regard to the matters being taken into account on the Form 1. However by reason of the concessions made, it is unnecessary to consider whether the Judge erred in the manner in which he determined to suspend the sentence. 
     
      
    33 The Judge, in assessing the criminality of the respondent, took into account the following matters: that the complainant was aged 4 and the respondent was aged 23; that it was digital penetration for a “very brief time”; there was no persuasion or threat involved since the child was asleep; there was no evidence of any major damage; the respondent was not in a position of trust but the offence occurred in a house; and there was no planning or pre-meditation since the offender was seriously affected by alcohol. His Honour concluded that the s 66A offence:  
     
      
       
        
         
        …………….seems to me to be well below the mid range of seriousness and towards the lower end of the scale for the reasons I have given. 
        
       
      
    34 The Crown submits that the Judge was in error in his assessment of the seriousness of the offending. Notwithstanding the earnest submissions made on behalf of the respondent to the contrary, we believe that the Judge’s determination of the seriousness of the s 66A offence was a gross underestimation. This Court has indicated that a determination of the objective seriousness of an offence is a finding of fact and generally there will be no interference with that finding unless it was clearly not open to the Judge to make it: R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 140. We are of the opinion that it was not open for the Judge to find that the offence was “towards the lower end of the scale” of offences falling within s 66A. 
     
      
    35 The Crown contends that the Judge must have placed too much weight on the fact that this was digital penetration, relying upon what was said by his Honour during the course of submissions. It is unnecessary to enter into a debate about the significance in sentencing of different types of penetration that fall within the concept of sexual intercourse: see R v Hibbert [2009] NSWCCA 20. The simple fact is that the respondent inserted his finger into the child’s vagina for however brief a period of time so as to cause her a physical injury with pain at least of a transient nature. He did so notwithstanding that the child awoke and told him to stop. 
     
      
    36 The respondent argues that it was open for his Honour to find that digital penetration was less serious than penile penetration and this was a very significant fact in the assessment of the degree of criminality. But it has been made clear that it is not a case of simply considering the nature of the penetration in isolation as being ranked in some form of hierarchy: R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575. What is to be considered is the type of penetration in all the circumstances surrounding the offending. The type of penetration is simply one factor and by itself does not indicate how serious the particular offence is. The simple fact is that had the intercourse in this case been penile penetration it would have been an offence of very great seriousness if for no other reason than because of the age of the child. In such a case the seriousness of the offence may have been above mid range. But the fact that it was not penile penetration does not mean that the offence is reduced to low range. 
     
      
    37 What then were the matters that the Judge considered reduced the objective seriousness of the offence to the “lower end of the scale”? It could not be the age of the child. She was so far short of 10 years that this was a highly aggravating feature. As was the fact that she was in her grandmother’s house. These two facts alone seem to deny that the offence could fall into the low range of criminality. 
     
      
    38 The Judge noted that the respondent was not in a position of trust, but the absence of that aggravating feature was offset to a significant degree by the aggravating feature of the respondent being a person who had broken into the house as a burglar. He had no right to be in the house, let alone be in the presence of the child, and then to sexually assault her. 
     
      
    39 Although the Judge seemed to view it as a matter of mitigation that the act of intercourse lasted a “very brief time”, we do not consider that this is a matter of any great weight in this case. The penetration was long enough and deep enough to result in injury and pain to the child. That was the significant aspect of the act of penetration not the length of time over which it occurred. 
     
      
    40 The fact that the Judge had no evidence of prolonged damage to the child is of no mitigating value. He assumed there was some residual damage remaining, but only of a fairly transitory nature, “because the victim was unable to go to sleep and then continued to shake even though she was asleep”. That is a reference to the effects upon the child on the night of the attack. His Honour noted that he had no evidence before him of “major damage”. But, with respect, we do not understand what evidence he might have expected in respect of a four-year old child. 
     
      
    41 No one could know at the date of sentencing what emotional or psychological harm might have been occasioned to the child in the long term. The early complaint makes it obvious that the child knew that the conduct was wrong and that she found it distressing. It is significant that the act was committed by a stranger. It should not be assumed, without evidence to the contrary, that there is no significant damage by way of long-term psychological and emotional injury resulting from a sexual assault of a child who is old enough, as was the complainant, to appreciate the significance of the act committed by the offender. It should be assumed that there is a real risk of some harm of more than a transitory nature occurring. That should be a factor taken into account when sentencing for a child sexual assault offence. It is an inherent part of what makes the offence so serious. It was the appreciation of the likelihood of harm resulting that Mason P saw as changing the community attitude to sexual assaults against young children: see R v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368 at [57]. 
     
      
    42 The Judge noted that it was a significant matter that the respondent remained in the presence of the child for sufficient time to masturbate over her and the bed. That of course was a matter on the Form 1 and that act of indecency could not be taken into account on an objective evaluation of the act of intercourse. But it was a matter of some seriousness that should have had a significant influence upon the final sentence imposed for the sexual intercourse offence. 
     
      
    43 The Judge took into account that there was no planning in the offence. Certainly the respondent was not a sexual predator, but planning or pre-meditation is not a factor that has any great significance in the evaluation of child sexual assault offences. They are usually opportunistic. But the offence was not an instantaneous reaction to seeing the child. The respondent took off his pants and underpants and removed the complainant’s pyjama pants and panties before sexually abusing her. 
     
      
    44 However there were offences on the Form 1 that had to be taken into account in the final determination of the sentence, and one of those was planned; the attempt to steal the vehicle. The respondent was in the house, in order to steal car-keys to take the motor vehicle parked at the premises. Although that was not a relevant matter in determining the seriousness of the sexual intercourse offence, it was relevant in determining the ultimate sentence to be imposed for that offence. The Judge never considered the impact of the Form 1 matters in assessing the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the sexual assault offence. We will return shortly to the significance of the presence of this motor vehicle offence and that of stealing in a dwelling on the Form 1. 
     
      
    45 The Judge took into account that the respondent had no prior record of such offending. That was true so far as sexual offences was concerned. But the respondent’s record generally was relevant and could not mitigate the offence. The sexual assault offence was committed during the course of an unlawful entry to the house in order to steal property. His record was clearly relevant to that aspect of the offending. The Judge never took into account the respondent’s criminal record except to find that “he is a young person without any prior convictions for such offences”. That was true so far as the offence was a sexual one. But, with respect, it misrepresented the seriousness of the respondent’s record and its impact upon sentencing for the sexual assault offence by reason of the presence of the Form 1 matters. 
     
      
    46 None of the matters we have mentioned either singularly or in combination could lead to a conclusion that the offence was low in the range of seriousness. To the contrary in combination they indicate that the sentence was significantly above that point. However, it seems that his Honour appreciated this fact. Having referred to the various circumstances of the offending that we have discussed, the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It is unimaginable what he did and a serious assault on a vulnerable person of the community. The community looks down on such offences with horror but nonetheless being a moment of unexplained and drunken madness it seems to me to be well below the mid range of seriousness and towards the lower end of the scale for the reasons that I have given. 
        
       
      
    47 This paragraph reveals a substantial error in the Judge’s assessment of the seriousness of the offending. Although his Honour found that the offence was “unimaginable” and was a “serious assault on a vulnerable person” and one that the “community looks down on…with horror”, he found it was at the lower end in criminality because “it was a moment of unexplained and drunken madness”. It is clear that the Judge gave substantial weight to the respondent’s intoxication as reducing the seriousness of his conduct. In light of the respondent’s history of alcohol abuse and the commission of crimes while intoxicated, there was no mitigation in the fact that he was intoxicated. It may explain what was out of character conduct so far as the sexual assault was concerned but it did not excuse it. By reason of his record and his failed chances at rehabilitation, his intoxication was aggravating so far as his entering the house in order to steal property was concerned. 
     
      
    48 The Judge’s assessment of the seriousness of the offence as being toward the lower end of the scale was unreasonable and cannot be allowed to stand. The offence was only slightly below mid range in seriousness. 
     
      
       
        
        The “Ellis discount” 
        
       
      
    49 As was noted in the introduction, Senior Counsel for the respondent conceded that the Judge erred in respect of discounting the sentence by 25 per cent for what the Judge found to be the respondent’s “disclosure of unknown guilt”. Notwithstanding the concession it is necessary to refer to the matter briefly. 
     
      
    50 As has been noted in the facts, the respondent made admissions to the police that he had penetrated the complainant with a finger and had masturbated over her. These admissions came because the respondent wanted to make it clear to the arresting police that he had not raped the complainant. 
     
      
    51 It was the Judge who, during the course of the sentencing hearing, raised the question whether the respondent was entitled to an “Ellis discount”. This use of this term is a misnomer as there is no such discount: see R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102. There is, however, a matter of mitigation that arises where an offender has revealed to investigating authorities unknown criminal conduct and it may, depending upon the circumstances, result in significant leniency: R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. 
     
      
    52 The Judge thought that the respondent’s admissions were so crucial that the prosecution could not have succeeded at trial on a charge under s 66A because of the age of the child. His Honour found that, apart from the admissions, the prosecution only had evidence sufficient to charge an indecency offence arising from the respondent masturbating in the bedroom. There was no basis for this finding. There was ample evidence to prove an offence under s 66A. There was early complaint that an intruder had touched her on the vagina. That complaint would have been admissible as to its truth. There was evidence to prove that the respondent was in the bedroom from the presence of his DNA. There was evidence of the injury to the child that was consistent with her being penetrated and consistent with her complaint that her vagina had been touched however she described the touching. In our opinion, rather than there being no evidence of sexual intercourse committed by the respondent, the circumstantial case was overwhelming. 
     
      
    53 But even had the Judge been correct in his assessment of the significance of the respondent’s admissions, that was not a finding that engaged the principle arising from the decision of Ellis: it was not the disclosure of otherwise unknown guilt. Nor does such a mitigating factor, even when it validly arises, justify the reduction of a sentence by a quantifiable discount: S v R [2008] NSWCCA 186; Borkowski, at [33] - [34]. 
     
      
    54 Mr Haesler, while acknowledging that the approach taken by his Honour was erroneous, submitted that the admissions made by the respondent were of significance in the assessment of his remorse, as was the fact that the complainant and child witnesses were spared the necessity of giving evidence. That submission is valid but there was ample evidence of the respondent’s remorse for the sexual assault offence. That remorse was merely one of a number of factors to be considered in the synthesis leading to the determination of that sentence. We are of the opinion that his Honour gave far too much weight to that matter in his finding of mitigating factors to justify the sentence he imposed. 
     
      
       
        
        The effect of the Form 1 matters 
        
       
      
    55 The Crown argues that the matters on the Form 1 are not reflected in the sentence imposed. This is really a particular of the general complaint that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. However, the matters on the Form 1 had a significance that appears to have been overlooked by his Honour but is of relevance in determining the sentence to be imposed by this Court in resentencing the respondent. 
     
      
    56 Although the respondent was not being sentenced for the matters on the Form 1, they were of course relevant to the ultimate sentence to be imposed for the s 66A offence. The act of indecency was taken into account by his Honour when assessing the seriousness of that offence and that was technically an error. However, it was a serious matter that would have a significant effect upon the sentence to be imposed for the sexual intercourse. 
     
      
    57 But it was also of importance that the other two matters on the Form 1 were offences of dishonesty, one being the attempt to take the motor vehicle and the other a stealing from a dwelling. They were of course offences overshadowed in their seriousness by the sexual intercourse offence. But the presence of those offences meant that the Judge was at least misleading himself in stating that the respondent “was a young person without any prior convictions for such offences”. The respondent had multiple convictions for dishonesty offences including taking motor vehicles and stealing property from houses. His criminal history could not be disregarded simply because the Judge was sentencing him for sexual intercourse of a child. The prior record was relevant to the impact that those offences on the Form 1 should have on the sentence to be imposed for the sexual assault offence. 
     
      
    58 The Judge does not make reference to the significance of the respondent’s serious criminal record anywhere in his sentencing remarks, either as indicating that he could not expect leniency or, more significantly, that it was an aggravating feature having regard to the matters on the Form 1. The incident giving rise to the charges against the respondent was merely another instance of the respondent’s disregard of the property rights of members of the public both in relation to their homes and their motor vehicles. Rather than the lack of similar offending being used as a mitigating factor, as his Honour viewed it, the respondent’s criminal record was a matter that indicated specific deterrence was a highly relevant consideration in relation to his propensity of entering homes and stealing property when drunk. 
     
      
    59 But the failure of the Judge to have appropriate regard to the respondent’s criminal record also affected the Judge’s assessment of whether the respondent was likely to re-offend. The Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        As to his likelihood of re-offence, in view of his profound shame and reaction and because this was, it seems to me, a moment of drunken madness, disgusting as it all was, that there is little likelihood of him reoffending. 
        
       
      
    60 It is clear that the Judge gave no weight at all in this finding to the matters on the Form 1 or the fact that the principal offence was committed during the course of entering a home for the purpose of stealing. The mitigating factor in s 21A(3)(g) is not limited to a likelihood of re-offending in the particular way in which the person offended on the occasion for which he is being sentenced. It is re-offending in general. The overwhelming likelihood was that the respondent would continue to re-offend. He had been given opportunities in the past and refused to accept the restrictions of rehabilitation or parole. Efforts by his parents and professionals to address his drinking and hence his offending had proved fruitless. His Honour’s finding flew in the face of the psychiatrist’s assessment of the likelihood of the respondent’s further offending without treatment. 
     
      
       
        
        The Judge’s reasons for suspending the sentence 
        
       
      
    61 The Crown submitted that the Judge formed the view that a suspended sentence was warranted before having determined what the appropriate sentence should have been: see R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17. Although in light of the respondent’s concessions it is unnecessary to consider this complaint in detail, it has substance. The only reason the Judge gave for suspending the sentence was the fact that the respondent had already spent over 14 months in custody. Clearly that fact alone could not justify taking the course he did. But there are other findings of the Judge that should be considered in light of this Court’s need to re-sentence the respondent.  
     
      
    62 The Judge found that the respondent had “considerable mitigating factors”. Apart from the fact that the respondent had been serving his period on remand in protection, we cannot identify any matter of significant mitigation in his background or personal circumstances. His parents were loving, caring and supportive, and he had a considerable extended family from whom he could have obtained assistance. There are many persons of all races in the community who are not so fortunate. The respondent could no longer rely significantly upon youth, he was 24 at the date of sentencing, especially having regard to his record of offending. As we have noted, the respondent had been given ample opportunities to reform including being given two suspended sentences shortly before the current offence was committed. He had flouted them all. 
     
      
    63 One of the matters the Judge took into account as a matter of mitigation was the respondent’s stated intention of becoming involved in the CUBIT programme. However, that is a sex offender’s course conducted in prison. As the Judge had decided to impose a non-custodial sentence, the intention of the respondent to participate in that course was irrelevant. 
     
      
       
        
        The sentence is manifestly inadequate 
        
       
      
    64 It is unnecessary to deal any further with the Crown’s specific complaints. We have sufficiently indicated our view of the relevant sentencing considerations that should have been applied by the Judge and that this Court must take into account in re-sentencing the respondent. The sentence that was imposed was manifestly inadequate and to a very substantial degree. This is chiefly because the Judge was in error in his assessment of the seriousness of the sexual intercourse offence. But he also had insufficient regard to the matters on the Form 1 both as they impacted upon the sentence to be imposed for the sexual assault offence and in the manner in which they reflected upon other aspects of the sentencing of the respondent that we have discussed above. There was insufficient regard paid to the fact that the respondent was subject to suspended sentences at the time of the offending and the impact of that fact and his earlier parole violation on his prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      The Court’s discretion to intervene 
      
    65 Because of the manner in which Mr Haesler argued his client’s case and the concessions he made, it has been unnecessary to refer to the principles that this Court applies in considering a Crown appeal against sentence. As we have already noted, the respondent’s counsel accepted that it was open to this Court to uphold the appeal and re-sentence the respondent. However, he relied upon a significant amount of material placed before this Court relevant to the sentence that this Court should now impose upon the respondent. We should note, however, that we do not accept Mr Haesler’s submission that the seriousness of the respondent’s offences fell well below mid range, if not at a low range. It is because the sentence imposed falls so far short of what was required, that we have formed the view that the Crown appeal must be allowed and the respondent re-sentenced to a very significant minimum term of custody. 
     
      
    66 The first of the material placed before the Court on behalf of the respondent was an affidavit by him. A significant part of it concerned the conditions of his custody prior to being sentenced by the Judge. He was threatened by other prisoners and verbally abused even while he was on protection because of the nature of the offence he committed. As a result he was placed into stricter security known as “non-association protection”. This resulted in him spending 23 hours of the day in his cell. He has been moved between various prisons and his form of custody changed as a result. It was at Grafton where he was physically assaulted receiving a laceration that required 5 sutures. Again he was placed into non-association protection. We accept that for some time of his sentence he will spend it in harsher conditions than other child sex offenders.  
     
      
    67 After his release following sentencing by the Judge the respondent became for all intents and purposes housebound in his family’s home because of his fear of personal attack by members of the public as a result of media coverage given to the sentence imposed and criticism of it. Examples of the response to the sentence in the written media have been placed before the Court. 
     
      
    68 The affidavit contains the following paragraph: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Before I was sentenced I was expecting to spend more time in custody. I had prepared myself for the worst. I had brought many appliances like a rice cooker and a jug and a television to make my gaol easier. I was shocked and surprised and happy when I got the suspended sentences because I knew I was going home. At the same time I was in no rush because I was scared about public reaction. When the Crown appealed my head dropped. Not knowing what is going to happen, and not knowing if I will go back to gaol, have stopped me from everything. I can’t make plan(s) for the future and can’t even leave the house because I’m too embarrassed. Both me and my family are living in limbo. 
        
       
      
    69 This is an example of the effect upon an offender of a court imposing a sentence that is manifestly inadequate. It has been recognised by this Court that such a sentence does the offender no favour. In this case the effect upon him was severe if not cruel. Public outrage at the sentence was turned upon the offender such that he understandably feared physical punishment at the hands of vigilantes. Had a sentence that appropriately denounced his conduct been imposed upon him, he would have been spared further public humiliation and anger. He could have simply got on with serving his sentence as he had been prepared to do. The respondent has always been realistic about the gravity of his offending and the sentence that he expected to be imposed upon him. As has already been noted, he said to police shortly after his arrest, when asked how he felt about what he had done: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Shittin’ just shittin’. Doing years, thinking 34, 30, 36, I’ll be getting out probably. I’m fucked just for doing that. 
         
        
       
      
    70 However, notwithstanding the matters raised in the affidavit, and with real sympathy for the position of the respondent due to the manifestly inadequate sentence imposed upon him that neither he nor his legal representative encouraged or expected, a sentence of some severity must be imposed. The term of imprisonment that ought to have been passed upon the respondent by the Judge after a 25 per cent discount should have been in the vicinity of 9 years. As there were no special circumstances warranting a reduction in the minimum period of custody, the non-parole period should have been 6 years and 9 months. Such a sentence would have shown due regard to the standard non-parole period notwithstanding that it was a sentence imposed after a plea. 
     
      
    71 However, taking into account the disappointment of the respondent, a degree of extra-curial punishment and the fact that this is a Crown appeal, the Court will impose a sentence of significantly less severity than should have been imposed by the Judge. The sentence will be backdated to the date of the respondent’s arrest notwithstanding that he spent a short time at liberty as a result of the sentence imposed upon him. He will receive the benefit of a finding of special circumstances because this is a Crown appeal and in a last effort to help him to turn his life around. 
     
      
    72 The Court makes the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The appeal is allowed. 
         
         
        2. The sentence imposed in the District Court is quashed. 
         
         
        3. Taking into account the matters on the Form 1 the respondent is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years 6 months. The sentence is to date from 28 November 2007. The respondent is eligible for release to parole on 27 May 2012.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with the reasons expressed by R A Hulme J for the orders made by the Court on 21 April in which I joined. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: For the reasons given by R A Hulme J, I join in the order made by the Court dismissing the appeal. 
     
      
    3 RA HULME J: At the conclusion of the hearing of this matter the Court made orders granting leave to appeal but dismissing the appeal. These are my reasons for joining in those orders.4 The applicant, Brendan Bradley White, sought leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him for an offence of affray. 5 He was sentenced by her Honour Judge English on 23 July 2007 to imprisonment for 18 months with execution of the sentence being suspended upon him entering into a bond to be of good behaviour pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. One of the matters that it was submitted that Judge English should take into account was a period of 9 weeks of pre-sentence custody.6 The applicant breached the bond by failing to submit to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. He admitted the breach when he was called up before her Honour Judge Hock. On 25 September 2008 Judge Hock revoked the bond. By virtue of the provisions of s 98(1)(c)(i) the effect of that revocation was that the order of Judge English suspending the execution of the sentence ceased to have effect. S 98(1)(c)(ii) stipulates:  
     
      
       
        
        “Part 4 applies to the sentence, as if the sentence were being imposed by the court following revocation of the good behaviour bond, and section 24 applies in relation to the setting of a non-parole period under that Part.”  
        
       
      
    7 This meant that Judge Hock was required to set a non-parole period (s 44) or give reasons for not setting a non-parole period (s 45). She was also required to specify the date of commencement of the sentence (s 47). In setting the non-parole period she was required to take into account any time for which the applicant had been held in custody in relation to the offence, the fact that the applicant had been the subject of a good behaviour bond, and anything done in compliance with his obligations under the bond (s 24). In relation to s 47 it should be noted that in deciding upon the date of commencement of the sentence a court “must take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence to which the sentence relates”. So, if there is some period of pre-sentence custody, there are two ways in which it can be taken into account, either in determining the length of the non-parole period or in backdating the commencement of the sentence.8 Judge Hock set a not parole period of 9 months, finding special circumstances on the basis that the applicant “would benefit from a longer period on parole”. She specified the date of commencement of the sentence as 25 September 2008, the date of revocation. The applicant will be released on parole on the expiration of the non-parole period on 24 June 2009.9 Two grounds of appeal were proposed if leave were to be granted. 
     
      
       
        
        1. Judge English erred by failing to demonstrably take into account the pre-sentence custody when imposing the term of the suspended sentence. 
         
         
        2. Judge Hock erred by failing to backdate the sentence after revoking the bond to take into account pre-sentence custody. 
        
       
      
    10 The two grounds involve consideration of the same issue, whether Judge English took into account the pre-sentence custody. This is because Judge Hock proceeded on the assumption that Judge English had done so. If Judge English did not, it is contended that one or the other of the judges was in error and it does not matter whom.11 The desirable practice in allowing an offender credit for pre-sentence custody is to backdate the sentence but in some circumstances that is either inappropriate or impossible: see, for example, R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588 at 590-591; R v Deeble, unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal 19 September 1991; and R v Newman; R v Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102; (2004) 145 A Crim R 361 at [21] – [33]. 12 There are a number of situations in which it would, or might, be inappropriate to adopt the preferable backdating approach. There is the example referred to in R v Deeble, supra, of a sentencer preferring to discount rather than backdate a sentence to three years or less so as to make the offender’s release on parole on the expiration of the non-parole period an entitlement rather than an eligibility: see, similarly, R v Leete [2001] NSWCCA 337; (2001) 125 A Crim R 37 at [29]. Alternatives to imprisonment and alternatives to full-time imprisonment are inapt for backdating and there is a statutory bar in the case of periodic detention (s 70). 13 It was submitted on the applicant’s behalf that in the remarks on sentence of English DCJ there is no clear statement that she took the pre-sentence custody into account by reducing the term of the sentence and that there is nothing that she said that would support an inference that this was what she did. It was then submitted that Hock DCJ was in error in assuming that English DCJ had taken the prior custody into account.14 In the proceedings on sentence before English DCJ the Crown Prosecutor included reference to the pre-sentence custody in her opening outline of the case. She correctly informed the judge that the applicant had been refused bail upon arrest on 13 December 2005 and had remained in custody until released on bail on 14 February 2006. The applicant gave evidence in the proceedings in which he made mention of his experience in custody. He told her Honour of how he had been placed in a “special cell” for “a couple of days” because of concern that he might self-harm. He described being in this special cell as a worse experience than being in the cell he had previously occupied. During the course of submissions there was an exchange between the applicant’s counsel and her Honour in which she sought confirmation of the period in which the applicant had been in custody. Counsel then continued by submitting: 
     
      
       
        
        “When one has regard to the importance of that two month period, in my respectful submission, a sentencing court when considering the actions of Brendan would not be contemplating a sentence anything near a period of two years imprisonment. The reason I raise that your Honour is so that I might raise for the benefit of s 12, because were a court to consider the period of imprisonment which might be otherwise imposed for this offence, taking into account the two months and the circumstances in which that two months were apparently served, then the court would say to itself a sentence of less than two years imprisonment is appropriate. The court would then inquire, is it reasonable in the circumstances of this offender to suspend the imposition of this full time sentence”  
        
       
      
    A little later he added: 
     
      
       
        
        “(Y)our Honour would be well within your Honour’s discretion to consider that in the circumstances of this young man’s case any sentence of imprisonment which might be imposed, taking into account that earlier period, ought be suspended”  
        
       
      
    15 These extracts from counsel’s submissions make it clear in my view that he was imploring the learned judge to have regard to the pre-sentence custody by imposing a sentence of less than two years and suspending its execution. 16 On the topic of pre-sentence custody her Honour said in her remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        “The imposition of a custodial sentence is appropriate, but I find to impose a sentence which is to be served either by way of fulltime custody or periodic detention would be to cause him grave physical harm. He is a vulnerable young man who needs considerable assistance. That can best be afforded to him outside the prison system. He will, of course, be at risk if he breaches the conditions of his liberty and that should act as a sufficient warning to him. He did spend two months in custody and no doubt received a short, sharp shock as a result. Some of that time was spent in segregation due to concerns for self harm”.  
        
       
      
    17 The conclusion is inescapable, it seems to me, that the issue of pre-sentence custody was very clearly in her Honour’s mind and she gave the applicant credit for it by acceding to the submission that had been made by counsel on his behalf. Counsel invited her Honour to give effect to the pre-sentence custody by imposing a sentence of less than 2 years duration and by suspending it. This is precisely what her Honour did. 18 Ms Francis, who appeared for the applicant in this Court but not the court below, submitted that the authorities on the subject of pre-sentence custody require that it be “demonstrably taken into account” and that there is no clear indication in the remarks on sentence of English DCJ that she had done so. One matter emphasised in the submissions was the lack of identification in her Honour’s remarks of a “starting point”. I would not so parse and analyse her Honour’s words. A submission was made to her that she should do something that she obviously accepted and gave effect to. 19 There is no merit in the contention that her Honour did not take into account the pre-sentence custody. It follows that her Honour Judge Hock was correct to proceed on the assumption that Judge English had done so. 20 For these reasons I joined in the orders of the Court.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    3 PRICE J: SS and JC, who are young offenders, seek leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon them by Hughes DCJ (the Judge). The appeals were for the sake of convenience heard together. As the applicant SS was sentenced before the applicant JC I will initially detail matters relevant to the appeal of SS. 
     
      
    4 The applicant SS seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed upon him in the District Court at Penrith by the Judge on 27 July 2007 following his pleas of guilty to five charges involving robbery. The applicant had asked that a further six offences listed on a Form 1 be taken into account on sentence.  
     
      
    5 The first charge was an offence of robbery in company that was committed on 3 December 2005 at the United Petroleum petrol station in Berkshire Park. The second charge was also an offence of robbery in company that was committed on 4 December 2005 at Liquorland in Kingswood Park. The third charge was an offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon that was committed on 12 December 2005 at Briggs Liquor in Colyton.  
     
      
    6 Each of these offences contravened s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    7 The fourth charge was an offence of robbery in company with wounding that was committed at the United Petroleum store in Berkshire Park on 28 December 2005. The fifth charge was also an offence of robbery in company with wounding on 28 December 2005 at the United Petroleum store. These offences were committed with the applicant JC and contravened s 98(1) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 7 years has been prescribed for an offence contrary to s 98(1).  
     
      
    8 The offences included on the Form 1 were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Take and drive conveyance on 26 October 2005 contrary to s 154A(1)(a) of the  
        Crimes Act 
         ; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Robbery in company on 29 November 2005 at United Petroleum, Berkshire Park contrary to s 97(1) of the  
        Crimes Act; 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Robbery in company on 4 December 2005 at the 7-11 convenience store, Werrington contrary to s 97(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ; 
        
       
       
        
        (4) Robbery in company on 12 December 2005 at Liquor Stax, Colyton contrary to s 97(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ; 
        
       
       
        
        (5) Attempt robbery in company on 22 December 2005 at the United Petroleum store in Berkshire Park contrary to s 97(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ; 
        
       
       
        
        (6) Malicious damage on 28 December 2005 contrary to s 195(b) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        .  
        
       
      
    9 A discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty was assessed by the Judge at 25 per cent and special circumstances were found.  
     
      
    10 In respect of the first, second and third charges, the Judge sentenced SS to fixed terms of imprisonment of 3 years commencing on 28 December 2005 and expiring on 27 December 2008.  
     
      
    11 For the fourth charge, SS was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 28 December 2005 and expiring on 27 December 2009 with a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 28 December 2009 and expiring on 27 December 2011.  
     
      
    12 For the fifth charge, SS was sentenced to 6 years and 4 days imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 24 December 2006 and expiring on 23 December 2010 with a balance of term of 2 years and 4 days commencing on 24 December 2010 and expiring on 27 December 2012.  
     
      
    13 As a result of partial accumulation and concurrency, the effective overall term imposed was 7 years commencing on 28 December 2005 and expiring on 27 December 2012 and the effective overall non-parole period was (4 days short of) 5 years commencing on 28 December 2005 and expiring on 23 December 2010. 
     
      
    14 The Judge said that he would take into account the matters on the Form 1 when he sentenced for “the s 98 offences”. It was accepted on appeal that the offences on the Form 1 were taken into account on the sentence imposed for the fifth charge.  
     
      
    15 The applicant SS, who was born on 29 March 1990, was at the time of the commission of the offences 15 years old and 17 years old on sentence. The Judge ordered pursuant to s 91 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 that the whole of his sentence be served in a juvenile detention centre.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    16 The applicant SS and several co-offenders which included the applicant JC had become members of a gang called the ‘Dark Lotus Phamily’ (DLP). The ideas of a rock group called the ‘Insane Clown Posse’ were said to have inspired the gang. All of the co-offenders, the Judge said in his sentencing remarks, implicated an older male Eli Byrne as being the gang leader.  
     
      
    17 A statement of agreed facts was tendered which the Judge recited during his remarks on sentence. A summary of the facts of each offence is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Charge 1 3 December 2005  
        
       
       
        
        At about 11.45pm, SS and a co-offender Christopher Allen had entered the United Petroleum petrol station Berkshire Park. They had travelled there in the company of Rhys McDicken, Eli Byrne, Thomas Smith and JC. SS jumped over the counter to be on the same side as the staff member. Allen ran back to the electronic doors and waved. JC then attempted to open the doors. Smith used a shopping trolley to ram the doors opening them. Both Smith and JC ran into the store. SS told the staff member to “just go back” and pushed him back. JC and Smith jumped over the counter so that all of the co-offenders were on the other side of the counter with the staff member. They demanded he open the cash register. One of the offenders removed from the staff member a head-dress of religious significance which he had been wearing. Smith started punching the staff member and pulled his hair until he opened the till. They took approximately $300 from the till and about $500 worth of cigarettes. All of the co-offenders then decamped to the getaway car which was driven by McDicken.  
        
       
      
     Charge 2 4 December 2005  
     
      
       
        
        At about 12.50am, McDicken drove SS, JC, Smith, Allen, Byrne and an unknown male to a Liquorland store at Kingswood Park. SS, JC, Smith and Allen entered the store while the unknown male remained outside as a lookout. Smith punched the store attendant three times to the head. Another staff member entered the store. SS directed him to the rear of the store where bottles of alcohol were thrown at both store attendants by the co-offenders. The store attendants and SS became engaged in a wrestle. Smith stole $370 from the cash register, whilst another co-offender stole nine bottles of alcohol. The co-offenders fled to the car and drove to Byrne’s home. One of the store attendants suffered bruising to the left eye.  
        
       
      
     Charge 3 12 December 2005  
     
      
       
        
        At about 10.40am, SS with Joshua Curtin and Damien Gore-Lensky entered the Briggs Liquor store at Colyton. The co-offenders selected a number of ‘Jim Beam’ bottles having a total value of $576.95. When asked for payment by a staff member, Gore-Lensky swung a silver coloured metal tomahawk at the staff member who moved backward out of its path and grabbed the tomahawk with his left hand. Gore-Lensky tried to pull the tomahawk back from the staff member. As this was occurring, one of the co-offenders was placing the bottles into a bag. The staff member told Gore-Lensky to let go of the tomahawk. The staff member punched him a couple of times in the face but Gore-Lensky continued to hold onto the tomahawk.  
        
       
       
        
        Another staff member attempted to assist but was pushed by SS to his neck area. The staff member took hold of SS by his jacket and SS hit the staff member in the left cheek. A co-offender Joshua Curtis threatened the staff member by raising a bottle of alcohol above his head as if he was going to strike the staff member and said “Let him go”. The staff member let go of SS. The staff member who had hold of the tomahawk felt his hand being cut and let go of it. Gore-Lensky raised the tomahawk over his shoulder at the staff member. SS grabbed a couple of bottles of alcohol from the store. The three co-offenders ran from the store and were seen to enter a vehicle parked nearby. The total value of the alcohol stolen from the store was $402.95. 
        
       
      
     Charges 4 and 5 28 December 2005  
     
      
       
        
        At about 2.20am, SS and JC entered the United Petroleum petrol station at Berkshire Park where Abdul Khan aged 73 years and Kasim Khan aged 16 were working. SS was armed with a crowbar and JC was armed with a baseball bat. Both offenders jumped onto the counter. SS struck Kasim Khan to the head with the crowbar. At the time no resistance was being offered by Kasim Khan who after being struck fell to the ground and remained on the floor at the inside corner of the front counter. 
        
       
       
        
        JC approached Abdul Khan and struck him in the head with the baseball bat. SS was at this time attempting to open one of the tills without success. JC went to another till and opened it and both offenders took money from it. They also took cigarettes from the shelves directly behind the front counter. Abdul Khan picked up a chair and threw it at SS who then hit Abdul Khan in the head twice with the crowbar. The offenders continued to take money and cigarettes from behind the counter. SS asked Kasim Khan “How do you open the safe?” to which Kasim Khan responded that he did not know as he was a new worker. JC jumped back over the counter.  
        
       
       
        
        SS said, “I’d better call an ambulance.” He was observed to pick up the handset of the phone situated behind the counter and was heard to be pressing the phone buttons. He then dropped the handset and jumped over the counter. Both offenders then ran from the store taking with them as they left other items of property including a bunch of flowers.  
        
       
       
        
        Both Kasim Khan and Abdul Khan were taken to hospital. The injuries Abdul Khan had suffered included an occipital bone fracture, a small intracranial haemorrhage to the head, a laceration to the top of the head and swelling to the right frontal side of the forehead and a superficial skin tear of the right forearm. Kasim Khan sustained a large deep laceration about 15 centimetres long to the back of the skull and the skull bone was somewhat exposed.  
        
       
       
        
        The Judge said that Doctor Balasingham reported that “Kasim Khan sustained a serious injury to this head and he was lucky enough to escape serious brain damage or even death.” (ROS at 13) 
        
       
      
    18 It is necessary to detail the facts of the robbery offences on the Form 1 to appreciate their seriousness.  
     
      
       
      Form 1 offence 2: 29 November 2005  
       
       
        
        At about 2.35am, the co-offender Smith entered the United Petroleum service station at Berkshire Park. After selecting a drink, Smith jumped over the counter, looked around, jumped the counter again and then motioned to the three co-offenders who were waiting outside to enter the store which they did. One of the co-offenders approached a second staff member and threatened him with violence, while Smith and the two other co-offenders went behind the counter. They punched the first staff member twice, causing a small cut to his lip. They took money from the till and cigarettes. The group then forced the second staff member to open an overdraft cash register from which they removed more money. The total amount of money stolen was about $1500 and an undetermined large volume of cigarettes was also stolen. All of the co-offenders then ran from the scene.  
        
       
      
     Form 1 offence 3 4 December 2005  
     
      
       
        
        At about 12.50am SS and Smith knocked on the locked entry doors of the 7-11 store attached to the service station. The attendant allowed them entry. Smith selected a drink, approached the counter, handing over money. When the attendant attempted to give Smith some change, Smith took hold of his arm and refused to release it. SS attempted to kick open a glass door that divided the store from the staff area behind the counter, without success. The co-offenders then jumped through the security wiring and started to push the attendant who was cowering and not resisting. SS removed a quantity of cigarettes from behind the counter whilst Smith attempted to gain entry to the till. Smith was unable to do so and pulled the attendant back to the register and demanded that he open it. After the till was opened by the attendant Smith then removed the contents from it. Whilst Smith was doing this, the attendant continued to cower. Smith punched him on a number of occasions and kneed him to the head. JC entered the store and placed cigarettes in a bag. All fled with the proceeds and were driven away by McDicken.  
        
       
       
      Form 1 offence 4 12 December 2005  
       
       
        
        About 5.50pm, SS and Gore-Lensky were throwing bottles of Jim Beam from the shelves of the Liquor Stax store into a bag. A female store attendant approached them asking, “What are you doing?” Gore-Lensky raised his right arm and made a fist at her. The store attendant stepped back as she was fearful of being assaulted and both offenders walked quickly out of the store.  
        
       
      
     Form 1 offence 5 22 December 2005  
     
      
       
        
        At about 4.30am, SS in company with JC entered the United Petroleum service station store at Berkshire Park. They jumped on top of the counter in a threatening manner. Store attendant Raza Khan grabbed a cricket bat and held it up in a defensive manner, facing the co-offenders who then jumped off the counter. Another store attendant Abdul Khan swung a broom at the co-offenders making contact with the back of the legs of SS. They were chased out of the store by the store attendants. Both co-offenders entered a vehicle and were driven away.  
        
       
       
      This summary of facts has been extracted from the statement of agreed facts and the sentencing remarks of the Judge.  
       
       
       
       
       
      
     The subjective case for SS  
     
      
    19 During the proceedings on sentence SS gave evidence. He testified that when he first met up with the members of the gang called ‘DLP’ he did not understand they were involved in illegal activities. He said that he did the robberies as he was scared for his safety and the safety of his family. He had seen them cut Gore-Lensky’s arm. He had been threatened. SS said: (POS 13/6/07 at 22) 
     
      
       
        
        “If I didn’t take part in the armed robberies that they might have to pay me a nasty visit was one of them, they would tie me down and hurt my nephews and my mother and that in front of me.” 
        
       
      
    20 Two Juvenile Justice reports were tendered to the Judge. The applicant’s parents separated when he was 18 months old. Following separation, he lived with his father for two years. During this time he had visitation rights with his mother for a short period of time before she realised she was unable to cope with the children – the applicant had an older brother. A neighbour, JC’s mother, took informal custody of the applicant at age four and half years. The applicant’s mother advised Juvenile Justice that her family saw JC’s mother as a foster mother to SS. He lived with JC’s family off and on during his remaining formative years. SS had no contact with his father who he had assumed no longer wanted anything to do with him.  
     
      
    21 SS indicated to Juvenile Justice that his transition to High School was unsuccessful and fraught with difficulties for him. He stated that he completed part of Year 7, during which time he truanted on many occasions and when he was in attendance he engaged in disruptive behaviour. SS was referred to the Penrith Adolescent Centre, a special school designed to address the needs of behaviourally challenged students. He reported to not coping with either the programme or those attending and was involved in disruptive behaviour, fighting with other students and truanting. He left the programme at the age of 13 after an alleged assault on a teacher. Despite extensive efforts by the Home/School Liaison Officer to engage him in further education, SS failed to return to school. Consequently, his education level was described as low and his mother described him as functioning at little more than primary school level. Ms Anderson, a psychologist, had opined in 2004 that, due to the young person missing large sections of schooling during his formative years, this had impacted on his ability to function on a day-to-day basis at a level of his potential ability.  
     
      
    22 Prior to his arrest SS worked as a casual part-time labourer and with a panel beater.  
     
      
    23 SS stated that he would smoke marijuana on a daily basis spending up to $50 per day on his habit from the age of 12 years. He would consume alcohol approximately 2-3 times per week and use $50 worth of speed each fortnight. He had no direct issues with substance abuse since being on remand. However, he had undertaken counselling to address these issues as they arose.  
     
      
    24 Ms Karen Clarke, a psychologist, in a specialist background report opined that SS was a young man who had experienced much instability in his life and hence presented with many psychological issues. He fitted the criteria for conduct disorder – early onset. Further his personality characteristics were such that he overreacts, she said, to environmental situations with anxiety, suspicion and over-concern and has limited inbuilt coping mechanisms. Additionally, he shows elements of an underlying personality disorder or the possible emergence of one. Testing administered by the psychologist to provide a measure of the applicant’s educative ability or fluid intelligence disclosed that he fell within the average range for his age group. The psychologist noted that SS took partial responsibility for the commission of the offences. He had indicated that whilst he knew he did wrong he believed, if he had not been under duress, he would not have committed the offences.  
     
      
    25 The Judge detailed in his sentencing remarks (ROS at 27) a letter written by SS to him in which SS apologised for the crimes that he had committed and had stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        All I can say is that I was under pressure at the time by older boys to carry out the crime. I know in spite of this I still have to take responsibility for my actions.” 
        
       
      
    26 At the time of the commission of the offences, SS was on 12 months probation to be of good behaviour which had been imposed at the Cobham Children’s Court on 22 March 2005 for the offence of malicious damage.JC’s Appeal  
     
      
    27 The applicant JC was sentenced by the Judge at Penrith District Court on 18 February 2008. He had pleaded guilty to two charges of robbery in company with wounding on 28 December 2005 contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act. These were the fourth and fifth charges with which SS had been charged the facts of which I have summarised at [17]. JC asked that the Judge take into account four offences on a Form 1, each of which was an offence of robbery in company contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    28 Included on the Form 1 were:  
     
      
       
        
        (1) The offence of robbery in company on 3 December 2005 at the United Petroleum Petrol store at Berkshire Park. This was the first charge to which SS had pleaded guilty; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The offence of robbery in company on 4 December 2005 at the 7-11 convenience store (offence 3 on the Form 1 in the sentence proceedings for SS); 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The offence of attempt robbery in company on 22 December 2005 at the United Petroleum store at Berkshire Park (offence 5 on the Form 1 in the sentencing proceedings for SS); 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The offence of robbery in company on 4 December 2005 at the Liquorland store in Kingswood Park. This was the second charge to which SS had pleaded guilty.  
        
       
       
      The facts of these offences are also summarised at [17]. The Judge on reciting the facts of the attempted robbery on 22 December 2005 when he sentenced JC noted that (ROS at 7): 
       
       
        
        “The victim Khan has taken a cricket bat from behind the counter and swung it at the offenders. Both males have then turned and ran from the store, with the victim chasing them.” 
        
       
      
    29 A discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty was assessed by the Judge at 25 per cent. A further discount of 25 per cent for assistance to the authorities was allowed. Special circumstances were found. 
     
      
    30 For the first charge, JC was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 1 November 2007 and expiring on 31 October 2009 with a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 1 November 2009 and expiring on 31 October 2011.  
     
      
    31 For the second charge, a sentence of 4 years imprisonment was imposed consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 1 February 2008 and expiring on 30 January 2010 (sic) with a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 31 January 2010 and expiring on 30 January 2012.  
     
      
    32 The effective overall term imposed was 4 years 3 months commencing on 1 November 2007 and expiring on 31 January 2012 and the effective overall non-parole period was 2 years 3 months commencing on 1 November 2007 and expiring on 30 January 2010. 
     
      
    33 The Judge directed that the whole of the sentence be served in a juvenile detention centre.  
     
      
    34 JC seeks leave to appeal against the severity of these sentences. 
     
      
     Subjective circumstances  
     
      
    35 JC was born on 6 December 1988 and at the time of the commission of the offences being charges 1 and 2 had just turned 17. He was 18 years old when sentenced. The Juvenile Justice Background Report records that he is of white Anglo-Saxon and Torres Strait Islander descent. It was reported that JC was conceived as a result of his mother being raped by a member of a motorcycle gang and he has never known his father. When JC was approximately 3 years old, his mother invited her brother to commence living with them as he had been recently released from prison and was homeless. JC informed the author of the report his uncle was an extremely harsh disciplinarian who regularly beat him. This resulted in his uncle being evicted from the home. When he was about 11 years old, JC’s mother moved her family to reside on a small pig farm where his uncle was employed. Initially the move was positive, however, according to JC he was verbally threatened and physically assaulted on a regular basis by the uncle. JC reported that his uncle introduced him to cannabis when he was 12 years old.  
     
      
    36 When his mother returned the family in 2003 to the Mount Druitt area JC said that he was not happy about his return to Sydney. It was around this time that he commenced to have a number of domestic disputes, which resulted in him attempting self-harm. He, however, had been expelled from Galston High School towards the end of Year 8 due to ongoing misbehaviour. In 2005 he commenced and completed his Year 10 studies through the WSTEC school provided by Mission Australia. Upon receiving conditional bail for the offences the subject of this appeal, he completed a 12-week course in Horticulture Certificate 3 and commenced a Conservation and Land Management course. He also obtained some part time employment in marketing. 
     
      
    37 JC reported that whilst at the WSTEC school he was offered and regularly used a wide variety of illegal drugs which were supplied to him by Byrne. He reported that he was not currently using any illegal substances. His initial period of incarceration when refused bail assisted with his detoxification as did his strict supervision whilst on conditional bail.  
     
      
    38 Juvenile Justice records revealed that he had not been supervised previously on any community based orders. During the course of the interview he had expressed concern and remorse towards the victims of his crimes. JC did not have a prior criminal history. 
     
      
    39 JC had informed the author of the Juvenile Justice report that Byrne, a teacher, had gained his trust by offering him additional music tuition in Byrne’s home after hours. Byrne had given him drugs and alcohol and told him that he would have to pay Byrne back for these favours by committing crimes for him. JC reported that Byrne would threaten both him and his family. JC said that Byrne and Ben Teasdale broke into his family home at 11.00pm on 27 December 2005 and woke him up. When he awoke Byrne waved a bowie knife in front of his face whilst Teasdale had a tomahawk style weapon. They appeared angry and JC believed that this was because of the failed robbery attempt the week before. JC reported that when these men were in his home he was afraid for the safety of his family members.  
     
      
    40 During the proceedings on sentence, JC testified that after being woken, he was given a baseball bat by Byrne and SS took a “metal pinch-bar.” He had also given evidence of threats made about his baby brother before the attempted robbery on 22 December 2005. JC‘s testimony included a history of his drug addiction. He had commenced smoking cannabis on a daily basis when he was 11 years old. Byrne had supplied him with prohibited drugs and alcohol when he was 16. 
     
      
      
     
      
      The Grounds of Appeal of SS  
       
       
      Ground 1:  
      The sentences in their aggregate are unduly disproportionate to those imposed in the case of a co-offender giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
       
       
      Ground 2:  
      The proportion of the effective non-parole period to the effective term of sentence is unduly disproportionate to that in the case of a co-offender, giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
       
      
    41 These grounds of appeal raise the issue of parity relative to the sentences imposed upon JC and may be conveniently considered together. The focus of the complaint was the sentences imposed for the offences of robbery in company with wounding (charges 4 and 5) which were committed with JC. 
     
      
    42 The starting point for the sentences for JC and SS for these offences, his Honour determined, was 8 years imprisonment. No complaint was made by SS about the same starting points of the head sentences. SS, however, complained about the difference in the extent of accumulation of the sentences for these offences. The sentences imposed in the case of JC were accumulated by a period of 3 months whereas for SS the accumulation was for one year. SS argued that no rational basis existed for the difference in accumulation and the sentences imposed upon him were unduly disproportionate to those imposed on JC giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. Counsel for SS in oral argument in this Court contended that the disparity could neither be justified by the principle of totality nor the additional offences on the Form 1. 
     
      
    43 SS and JC were charged differently. JC (charges 1 and 2) and SS (charges 4 and 5) each stood for sentence for the robberies with wounding committed on 28 December 2005 at the United Petroleum store. SS was also charged with robbery in company on 3 December 2005 (charge 1), and robbery in company on 4 December 2005 (charge 2). The offences of robbery in company (charges 1, 2) were the first and fourth matters included on the Form 1 for JC. JC had not been separately charged with these offences. The second and third offences included on the Form 1 for JC were matters 3 and 5 on the Form 1 for SS.  
     
      
    44 SS was further charged with an offence of armed robbery on 12 December 2005 (charge 3) whereas JC was not nor was it a matter included on the Form 1. The offences on the Form 1 for SS included a robbery in company on 12 December 2005 (no 4), take and drive conveyance on 26 October 2005 (no 1) and malicious damage on 28 December 2005 (no 6). JC was neither charged with these offences nor were they included on a Form 1.  
     
      
    45 The Judge was obliged to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as questions of totality: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. An overall sentence which was just and appropriate to the totality of the offending behaviour of the applicant SS was required in structuring an overall sentence. Questions of concurrence or accumulation are discretionary matters for the sentencing Judge but “that discretion is generally circumscribed by a proper application of the principle of totality”: R v MMK (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 at [13].  
     
      
    46 The structure of the sentences imposed upon SS included concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for charges 1, 2 and 3 which were totally subsumed in the sentence for charge 4. The sentence for the fifth charge was partially accumulated upon the sentence for the fourth charge by almost a year. It was open to his Honour to structure the sentences in this way provided that the overall sentence did not offend the principle of totality.47 The parity principle is “an aspect of equal justice”: Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301. As was pointed out by Dawson and Gaudron JJ “like should be treated alike, but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them.”  
     
      
    48 The totality of the offending behaviour of SS for which he was sentenced was greater than that of JC. Different considerations of totality applied for which the sentencing Judge in my opinion made due allowance. The disparity in the accumulation of sentence does not offend the principle of equal justice and does not give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. Ground 1 of the appeal has not been established.  
     
      
    49 By Ground 2 of the appeal, SS complains of disparity which is said to arise from the effective non-parole periods set for JC and for himself after the Judge found the same special circumstances. It was pointed out that in the case of SS the effective non-parole period of 5 years was approximately 71.43 per cent of the effective overall term of 7 years whereas in JC’s case, the effective non-parole period of 2 years 3 months was approximately 52.94 per cent of the effective overall sentence of 4 years 3 months. SS submitted that the disparity gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    50 The Court’s attention was directed to what was said by Howie J (with whom Studdert and Latham JJ agreed) in Regina v Do [2005] NSWCCA 209 at [19]:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        I maintain the view that I expressed in those passages that generally disparity does not arise simply from the fact that a finding of special circumstances was made in respect of one co-offender but not in respect of the other. I am prepared to accept that there may be a case where, all relevant facts and circumstances being equal, a finding of special circumstances in the case of one offender but not in the other may give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. But in the present case not all things were equal because of the different findings made in respect of the criminality of the two offenders and the appropriate head sentences.”  
        
       
      
    51 The special circumstances found by the Judge in the case of each of the offenders were their youth and first time in custody. His Honour also found in the case of SS (ROS at 32): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The good progress he appears to have made in the institution he is currently in.” 
        
       
       
      and in the case of the applicant JC that he was “well on his way to rehabilitation.” (ROS 18/2/08 at 14) 
       
      
    52 As I have previously explained, the totality of their respective offending was not identical and all relevant circumstances were not equal. No justifiable sense of grievance arises which is to be ameliorated by the principle of parity. I do not consider that there was error on the part of the Judge. For this reason Ground 2 of the appeal fails.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3:  
      The sentencing Judge erred in determining the effective non-parole period relative to the effective term of sentence, having found that special circumstances existed.  
       
      
    53 The main thrust of the complaint was that in respect of the sentences for which non-parole periods were set (charges 4 and 5), the proportion of the non-parole period (4 years) was 66.67 per cent of the term of 6 years. However, as a result of the partial accumulation of the sentences, the proportion of the effective overall term of the sentence (7 years) was approximately 71.43 per cent.  
     
      
    54 SS submitted it was doubtful that the Judge intended to provide for a variation of approximately 3.57 per cent from the statutory ratio. A further argument was that partial accumulation of sentence may itself warrant a finding of special circumstances which the Judge did not make reference to in his sentencing remarks.  
     
      
    55 The principal submission for the Crown was that the effective non-parole period of 5 years did not indicate that the Judge had failed to reflect an intention to ameliorate the minimum custodial term to be served by SS and was not itself manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    56 Section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 requires that the balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one third of the non-parole period unless the court decides that there are special circumstances. Should his Honour have applied the statutory ratio, the effective overall non-parole period would have been 5 years 3 months. If the proportion of 66.67 per cent had been maintained in the adjustment of the overall sentence following the finding of special circumstances, the effective overall non-parole period would have been 4 years 8 months. 
     
      
    57 The factors identified by the Judge as constituting special circumstances were youth, first time in custody and the good progress made towards rehabilitation whilst in custody. SS was 15 years old at the time of offending and 17 years old on sentence. A variation of the statutory ratio by three months does not seem to me to adequately reflect his Honour’s findings. Although this Court is slow to intervene in the size of an adjustment to the statutory ratio which is essentially a matter within a Judge’s discretion, it makes little sense, in my respectful opinion, that the proportion of 66.67 per cent was not preserved in the overall sentence. Such an adjustment would result in a reduction in the overall non-parole period of about 4 months. The non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence which is the ultimate constraint in the sentencing discretion after special circumstances have been found: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 701 per Spigelman CJ at [63]. An overall non-parole period of 4 years 8 months would not, in my view, offend against that principle.  
     
      
    58 Although an accumulation of sentence might constitute special circumstances: see, for example, R v Simpson; R v Close (1993) 31 NSWLR 743 to which the Judge made no mention in his sentencing remarks, his Honour was not obliged to find special circumstances for this reason.  
     
      
    59 I am, however, persuaded that the Judge overlooked the impact that the accumulation of sentences would have upon his finding of special circumstances and an adequate adjustment was not made. Ground 3 of the appeal has been established.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4:  
      The sentencing Judge erred in failing to properly apply principles applicable in the sentencing of children.  
       
      
    60 SS complains that the Judge did not refer to the principles applicable in the sentencing of children in s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act which SS argued itself manifests error. SS drew attention to what was said by the Judge in his sentencing remarks as demonstrating his Honour’s misunderstanding of the relevant sentencing principles when he said (ROS at 30):  
     
      
       
        
        “I have to take into account the purpose of sentencing which is the punishment, the general deterrence, the protection of the community, to denounce the conduct, and to make the offender accountable for his actions, to promote rehabilitation and recognition of harm to the victims and the community and of course general deterrence looms in this case that we cannot, that society could not stand criminal gangs who are nihilists whose object was to rob convenience stores and liquor outlets and who are vulnerable to those things. Unless we want society to become an armed camp the justice system has to make sure that there is general deterrence and punishment and to protect the community. Citizens ought to be able to go about their business running little shops and things like that without having young hooligans coming in and almost killing them for small gains.” 
        
       
      
    61 Section 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act contains a statement of principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction for young offenders. Section 6 was at the time of sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
      “ 
      Section 6 Principles relating to exercise of functions under Act  
       
       
        
        A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home; 
        
       
       
        
        (e)  
        that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind.” 
         
        
       
      
    62 It is important, however, to place his Honour’s remarks in context. His Honour had previously said (ROS at 28):  
     
      
       
        
        “Turning then to the matter of the guidelines and the law as I have been assisted by the parties. In the judgment of the now Chief Justice of Australia but then the Chief Justice of New South Wales, in the matter of  
        R v CS and T 
        . Even though the Chief Justice thought the sentences were lenient he did not propose in two of the incidences to change what Judge Shadbolt had decided…”  
        
       
      
    63 The Crown’s written submissions which were provided to the Judge during the sentencing proceedings drew attention to the principles contained in s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act as did the counsel for SS during oral submissions. R v C, S and T (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 October 1989, unreported) to which the Judge referred was a case in which Gleeson CJ accepted a submission that: 
     
      
       
        
        “…in sentencing young people …the consideration of general deterrence is not as important as it would be in the case of sentencing an adult and considerations of rehabilitation should always be regarded as very important indeed.” 
        
       
      
    64 The Judge did not refer to s 6 or its terms. A failure by a sentencing Judge to make some reference to the statement of principles in s 6 does not of itself constitute error: R v MHH [2001] NSWCCA 161; R v AD [2005] NSWCCA 208. Such a failure might indicate, however, that a proper consideration has not been given to the principles which apply to the sentencing of young offenders: see DB v The Queen (2006) 167 A Crim R 393 and it is always preferable that the statement of principles is referred to in sentencing remarks. The principles in s 6 are, however, well known and his Honour’s attention was directed to them by both parties in submissions on sentence. It is evident from the whole of his Honour’s sentencing remarks that he paid close attention to the applicant’s age at the time of the offending and to his prospects of rehabilitation. I am not persuaded that the Judge did not take into account the principles relating to the sentencing of young offenders when he came to sentence SS.  
     
      
    65 The relevance of the principles in s 6 depends upon the seriousness of the offence and the age and circumstances of the young offender. In the present case, charges 4 and 5 were offences punishable by imprisonment for 25 years and were each a “serious children’s indictable offence” as defined in s 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act and were required to be dealt with at law. It has long been held that the principle that rehabilitation plays a more important role and general deterrence a lesser role is subject to the gravity of the crime: R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112, R v Bus (Court of Criminal Appeal, 3 November 1995, unreported); R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58. Considerations of specific and general deterrence, the protection of the community, retribution and the recognition of harm to the victim are not irrelevant when a young offender is to be sentenced.  
     
      
    66 SS was 15 years old when he committed the offences. His Honour was required to give more weight to the question of the applicant’s rehabilitation than in the case of an older offender. To be balanced against that factor was the objective seriousness of the offences for which SS stood for sentence. Charges 4 and 5 were grave offences in which both victims had been violently assaulted and seriously injured. One of the victims, Abdul Khan, was 73 years old. I do not consider that his Honour erred in the weight that he gave to general deterrence.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 of the appeal has not been made out. 
      
     
     
      
      Re-Sentencing 
       
      
    67 As error has been identified, it is necessary to consider whether “some other sentence …is warranted in law and should have been passed”: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. SS has tendered an affidavit affirmed 2 December 2008 in which he deposed to the progress he has been making whilst in custody.  
     
      
    68 I propose to adjust the sentences so as to adequately reflect his Honour’s finding of special circumstances. The effective overall term of the sentence will remain at 7 years with the non-parole period being decreased to 3 years 8 months. No other lesser sentence is warranted in law.  
     
      
    69 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Leave to appeal be granted.  
        
       
       
        
        (2) Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court on 27 July 2007 in respect of charges 4 and 5 being offences of robbery with wounding contrary to s 98(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        .  
        
       
       
        
        (3) The applicant SS in respect of charge 4 is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years 8 months commencing on 28 December 2005 and expiring on 27 August 2009 with a balance of term of 2 years 4 months commencing on 28 August 2009 and expiring on 27 December 2011.  
        
       
       
        
        (4) The applicant SS in respect of charge 5 (including the offences on the Form 1) is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years 8 months commencing on 28 December 2006 and expiring on 27 August 2010 with a balance of term of 2 years 4 months commencing on 28 August 2010 and expiring on 27 December 2012.  
        
       
       
        
        (5) The sentences imposed in the District Court on 27 July 2007 in respect of charges 1, 2 and 3 are confirmed.  
         
         
        (6) Confirm the Judge's order that the whole of the sentences be served as a juvenile offender.  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The earliest date on which the applicant SS will be eligible for release to parole is 27 August 2010.  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
       
       
       
      The Grounds of Appeal of JC  
       
       
      Ground 1:  
      His Honour erred in his application of the parity principle leaving the applicant with a legitimate sense of grievance as to his sentence when compared to the sentence of his co-accused SS.  
       
       
      Ground 2:  
      His Honour failed to reduce the sentence by his findings of mitigating factors pursuant to s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The significant mitigating factors found being: 
       
      
     (a) Offence committed whilst acting under duress; (b) Good character; 
     
      
     (c) Good prospects of rehabilitation; and  
     
      
     (d) Remorse.  
     
      
    70 It is convenient to consider Grounds 1 and 2 together as they overlap.  
     
      
    71 When he came to sentence the applicant JC, the Judge considered the issue of parity with the sentence imposed on SS. The Judge said (ROS at 13-14): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown in its submission has submitted that his friend’s [SS] sentence is one that I should be guided by on the matter of parity since they were both involved in the same two crimes. The defence, by Mr Carroll, said they can be distinguished. He says that [SS] did not offer assistance and that is true and I am taking that into account as well. Mr Carroll has pointed out that [SS] was younger by twelve months as I understand it. They’re both youths. However, [SS] was already under conditional liberty for offences of malicious damage and had, as I pointed out already, has a record whereas JC has not. And the Crown says taking all those things into account they balance each other out. There is also the question of parity which a co-offender receiving a different sentence to the other co-offender may harbour, as the Court of Criminal Appeal says, a justifiable sense of grievance. 
        
       
      
     … 
     
      
       
        
        However, I accept the Crown’s submission that to do otherwise than give similar sentences than that of [SS] would be wrong and I would fall into appealable error. And for the reasons that I read out from the Crown’s submission I think this correct, that the youth of [SS] and even though it is only twelve months.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Well I did give [SS] eight years in the head sentence. I took off twenty five per cent, which made it six years, for an early plea.  
        
       
       
        
        I believe that [JC] is entitled to another twenty five per cent for assistance, so that will make an eight year head sentence and fifty per cent off that makes it four years.” 
        
       
      
    72 JC contended that the Judge was unduly influenced by the fact that SS was 12 months younger than he. JC argued that his Honour failed to recognise that there were significant differences in the objective criminality of his offending and his subjective case to that of SS. Having the same starting points for the sentences, JC submitted, gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. A number of discrete matters were raised which were said to give rise to a difference between the co-offenders and called for in the case of JC a lesser notional starting point.  
     
      
    73 The first matter, JC argued, was that it was SS who caused the injuries to the victims and it was SS who returned to assault Abdul Khan. The level of violence of his co-offender, JC submitted, was significantly greater than his and as a consequence his culpability was less. JC complained that the Judge’s finding that the striking of Abdul Khan by JC with the baseball bat caused “him to have internal bleeding” was not supported by the report of Dr Taoum. 
     
      
    74 SS struck Kasim Khan to the head with a crowbar. The Judge found that JC struck Abdul Khan three times to the head with a baseball bat. After Abdul Khan threw a chair at SS, SS hit him twice in the head with the crowbar. Following the assault, Abdul Khan was treated initially at Hawkesbury Hospital and then transferred to Nepean Hospital where he was seen by Dr Taoum who noted that a CT scan of the patient’s head showed occipital bone fracture and a small cranial haemorrhage. During oral argument in this Court, JC pointed to the recording in Dr Taoum’s report that Abdul Khan described being hit by a “metal bar” and contended that the injuries sustained by the victim were not caused by him.  
     
      
    75 Little weight in my view can be given to the reliability of the history in the report as the victim had been struck heavily both by a crowbar and baseball bat and as the report reveals was initially unable to remember his date of birth. The cause of Mr Khan’s injuries could not be confined to the blows struck by JC.  
     
      
    76 Although there are cases where the culpability of participants in a joint criminal enterprise may be differentiated this was not such a case. A high level of violence was contemplated by each of the participants in the commission of the robbery. JC and SS were armed as six days earlier they had been repulsed by the store attendants who had a cricket bat, a brick and broom. The acts of violence committed by each of them were intended to eliminate any resistance that might be offered. It seems to me that in the present case where violence was contemplated and violence was used in the commission of the offence, JC’s culpability is not reduced because of the level of violence that he employed was not as high as that of his co-offender. It was also unnecessary for the Judge to determine which of the blows that struck the victim caused his injuries.  
     
      
    77 The second discrete matter of difference, JC contended, was the failure by the Judge to reduce his culpability by the finding of duress. This argument was supported, it was said, by the same notional starting point of the head sentence of SS. JC submitted that the level of duress was extreme as it was committed after he was awoken by Byrne at knife point who ordered him to commit the offence. Byrne gave him the baseball bat which he (JC) used in the robbery.  
     
      
    78 Section 21A(3)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that where an offender is acting under duress a sentencing Judge is to take this into account as a mitigating factor. This was recognised by the Judge when he said (ROS at 14): 
     
      
       
        
        “I do take into account, and I am aware of, a mitigating factor; he was acting under duress. I am convinced that this was so, even if there was little evidence of it actually. I am convinced that [JC] acted believing he was acting under duress.” 
        
       
      
    79 His Honour had earlier in his remarks quoted extensively from those parts of the Juvenile Justice report in which duress had been raised by JC.  
     
      
    80 As has been recounted at [19], the applicant SS had also testified during his sentence proceedings of threats made to him and of his fears for his safety and the safety of his family. The Judge recited what SS had told the author of the Juvenile Justice report about these matters and the letter written by SS to him which included the passage quoted at [25] when he came to sentence SS. Although no specific finding was made of duress, there is no reason to think that the Judge did not take it into account.  
     
      
    81 The views expressed by the Judge in the passage quoted at [71] suggest that his Honour saw no reason to distinguish between the levels of pressure placed upon either of the applicants. The significance of duress as a mitigating factor was to my mind significantly reduced in the case of both co-offenders by what occurred when the robbery was carried out. Shortly after entering the store SS struck Kasim Khan with the crowbar and JC struck Abdul Khan with the baseball bat. Each of the victims was struck before any resistance was offered. In my opinion the applicants could not be considered to be acting under duress when they engaged in the violence which was the gravamen of their offending on 28 December 2005.  
     
      
    82 I neither consider that in the case of JC insufficient weight has been given by His Honour to the finding of duress nor has the notion of equal justice been violated by His Honour’s consideration of this factor of mitigation.  
     
      
    83 The main differences between the offenders were their age and prior record. SS committed the offences whilst subject to conditional liberty – a factor of aggravation: s 21A(2)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. JC was a first offender – a factor of mitigation: s 21A(3)(f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. If all things had been equal, JC would have been entitled to a lesser sentence than his co-offender by reason of those factors. All things were not equal as those factors had to be balanced against the age difference and consequent immaturity between JC and SS. JC was almost 16 months older (and not 12 months as identified by the Judge) than SS. JC was 17 years old and SS 15 years old at the time of the offending.  
     
      
    84 JC argued that before age could be considered a factor to warrant a difference in sentence it had to be large and significant. The Court was referred to the age difference of 2 years 7 months in R v Rushby  [1999] NSWCCA 104 which Barr J (with whom McInerney J agreed) considered at [26] to be a “very substantial disparity in chronological ages of the offenders and a corresponding disparity in their maturity.” 
     
      
    85 It is pointless to attempt to precisely identify what might be considered to be a sufficient gap in the chronological age of co-offenders to justify a difference in their sentences. It is a matter of evaluation for a sentencing Judge which will include considerations of the stage of development, level of maturity and education of the respective young offenders as well as their chronological ages.  
     
      
    86 The Judge was in the best position to make such an evaluation as he had seen and heard both young persons giving evidence before him. The Judge’s evaluation on this issue was essentially one of fact and akin to the exercise of a discretion. As such, the normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 400, applies. The applicant JC has not demonstrated, in my opinion, that the Judge’s evaluation was not open on the evidence, or that some wrong principle was applied, or irrelevant consideration taken into account (or relevant consideration overlooked).  
     
      
    87 In all the circumstances, it can neither be said that the applicant JC has a justifiable sense of grievance about the differences between the sentences nor that the Judge failed to give sufficient weight to his findings of mitigating factors.  
     
      
    88 Grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal have not been established.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3:  
      His Honour erred in finding as a matter of aggravation that there were multiple victims.  
       
      
    89 The Crown concedes that the Judge erred when he found as a factor of aggravation “that there were multiple victims.” (ROS at 14). Whilst in the present case there were multiple victims and acts of criminality (including the Form 1 offences), the applicant JC was sentenced for each of them in accordance with the principle of totality. It was wrong to aggravate each offence on the basis that each involved multiple victims: R v Tadrosse (2005) 65 NSWLR 740; R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288.  
     
      
    90 Ground 3 of the appeal has been made out.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4:  
      His Honour erred in finding as a matter of aggravation that the offence was part of a planned or organised activity.  
       
      
    91 A factor of aggravation to be taken into account on sentence is that an offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity: s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    92 The Judge said (ROS at 14): 
     
      
       
        
        “I am satisfied also that…it was planned, or at least if it was not planned it was an organised activity, if not by [JC], at least by the Insane Clown Posse gang in the form of Mr Byrne.” 
        
       
      
    93 JC contended that it was clear from his Honour’s reasoning that he had impermissibly imported a level of planning by Byrne to be a matter of aggravation. JC further submitted that there was no evidence that would permit a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the degree of planning undertaken by Byrne exceeded what would ordinarily be expected of an offence of this kind. 
     
      
    94 The fact that an offence was planned does not necessarily give rise to the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(n): Fahs v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 26; R v Hewitt [2007] NSWCCA 355. For the planning of an offence to be taken into account as a factor of aggravation, the degree of planning must exceed what would ordinarily be expected of the kind of offence under consideration: R v Yildiz (2006) 160 A Crim R 218. 
     
      
       
      
    95 There was no evidence that JC had participated in the planning or organisation of the robbery on 28 December. All of the evidence pointed in the other direction. There was JC’s evidence of his participation in the offence because of the threats made to him. 
     
      
    96 The offence was undoubtedly planned by Byrne. The Crown, however, concedes that the evidence of the degree of planning of the robbery was not so much greater than that inherent in such an offence as to warrant the finding of an aggravating circumstance and error has been established. 97 During submissions, the Crown referred to a present lack of clarity as to whether planning under s 21A(2)(n) applies only where the offender has been involved in the planning of the offence, or whether it is sufficient where the offence itself was planned, to take planning into account as an aggravating factor. This Court, it was suggested, has adopted two different approaches to this issue which are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Simpson J in  
        Legge v R 
         [2007] NSWCCA 244 (with whom Spigelman CJ and Harrison J agreed) said at [34]: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “No doubt the offence was planned: but, on the applicant’s evidence, he was not involved in the planning and was not responsible for it. That evidence was not rejected. S 21A(2)(n) was not, in my opinion, intended to be used to aggravate an offence where the offender being sentenced was not involved in, or part of, the planning and organisation.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In  
        DPP v Cornwall 
         [2007] NSWCCA 359 Latham J (with whom Basten JA and Rothman J agreed) said at [56]: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “The respondent’s claim that he was not involved to any extent in the planning of the offence is of limited relevance. Section 21A(2)(n) fixes upon this characteristic of the offence, not the degree to which an individual offender contributes to the planning.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    98 Given the Crown’s concession, it is unnecessary for present purposes to attempt to resolve the apparent difference in these statements. 
     
      
    99 In any event, it seems to me that where, as in the present case, duress is raised, there is a logical difficulty in giving weight on the one hand to a finding as an aggravating factor that the offence was planned even though the offender did not take any part in its planning or organisation and on the other hand giving weight to a finding as a mitigating factor that the offender’s participation in the offence stemmed from pressure and duress.  
     
      
    100 Ground 4 of the appeal has been made out.  
     
      
       
      Ground 5: His Honour erred in rejecting the circumstances of the applicant’s drug addiction as a matter of mitigation. 
      
    101 The Crown concedes that the Judge erred when he said (ROS at 8): 
     
      
       
        
        “The consumption of alcohol or drugs is not an excuse for this behaviour, nor should it be an excuse for this kind of behaviour.”  
        
       
      
    102 The Judge was stating the general rule that the fact of drug addiction is not a mitigating factor: R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. The occurrence of a drug addiction at a very young age has, however, been recognised as an exception to the general rule: R v Henry per Wood CJ at CL at [273]. As was said by Hulme J in R v Todorovic [2008] NSWCCA 49 at [58]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In R v Henry (1999) NSWLR 346 this Court considered at length and firmly rejected the proposition that, in general, addiction to drugs should be regarded as a mitigating factor. In doing so the Court recognised that there would be cases where the general rule would not apply, for example, where the addiction was the result of youth …” 
        
       
      
    103 JC told his Honour during his testimony that he commenced smoking cannabis on a daily basis when he was 11 years old. Byrne had supplied him with prohibited drugs which included methylamphetamine, ‘LSD’ and cannabis when he was 16 years old. This evidence was not rejected by his Honour. In these circumstances JC’s drug addiction could be regarded as a matter of mitigation. 
     
      
    104 Ground 5 of the appeal has been made out. 
     
      
     Re-Sentencing  
     
      
    105 The errors which have been established give rise to the application of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. An affidavit of JC’s solicitor affirmed 5 December 2008 has been tendered which annexes certificates which speak of JC’s achievements and a letter from JC in which he expresses his remorse and intention not to re-offend. JC also discloses that he has the continuing support of his partner and their first child was born last October.  
     
      
    106 Nevertheless, I do not think that the errors made by the Judge impacted upon the sentences that were imposed. The effective overall term was 4 years 3 with an effective overall non-parole period of 2 years 3 months. In my opinion, any lesser sentence would not adequately reflect the criminality of JC’s offending. I am not of the view that any lesser sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed.  
     
      
    107 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Leave to appeal be granted.  
        
       
      
     (2) Appeal dismissed.

    HIS HONOUR:  
     
      
       
      Introduction 
      
    1 The plaintiff, by an amended summons filed in court on 12 March 2009, claims relief in respect of a search warrant issued on 14 November 2008. The warrant was issued on the application of the second defendant, New South Wales police officer Constable Scott McKinley. The subject premises in Busby, were the residential premises of the plaintiff. The warrant was issued under the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW) (“LEPR Act”). 2 The plaintiff claims a declaration that the warrant is invalid, an order in the nature of certiorari that it be set aside or quashed, and a declaration that the execution of the warrant was contrary to law.3 A further order is sought in the nature of prohibition preventing the defendants from relying on the validity of the warrant. 4 The plaintiff additionally claims an order in the nature of mandamus or an injunction against the defendants, their servants or agents, requiring them to deliver up to the plaintiff any property seized and any audio, video, digital or computer recordings and/or transcripts or copies or notes made from the recordings. An order is also sought for the destruction or disposal of property identified in specified Exhibit Books. 5 Mr M Robinson, of counsel, appeared on behalf of the plaintiff. The Crown Advocate, Mr L Babb SC, appeared of behalf of the second and third defendants. A submitting appearance was entered on behalf of the authorised justice, the first defendant.6 The plaintiff, in support of the amended summons, relied upon two affidavits of Lesly Deborah Randle, sworn respectively on 25 August 2008 and 18 September 2008 respectively, and an affidavit of Louise Coorey sworn 3 March 2009. 7 The second and third defendants relied upon the affidavits of Benjamin McIntyre and Scott McKinley sworn on 20 December 2008 and 24 December 2008.Grounds relied upon8 The plaintiff relied upon three matters in support of the relief claimed in the amended summons. The first raised the validity of the warrant. The second the validity of the occupier’s notice. The third that the application for the warrant by the second defendant was made in bad faith and/or affected by fraud.  
     
      
    9 This last mentioned ground is the subject of a separate judgment in respect of which a non-publication order has been made. That order has been made in the interests of ensuring fair trial principles are maintained until the final disposition of the charges against the plaintiff.10 A central contention in the plaintiff’s case considered in this judgment is to the effect that the warrant is invalid on its face as it failed to recite, or sufficiently recite, an offence in accordance with the requirements prescribed by the LEPR Act and Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Regulation 2005 (“LEPR Regulation”). In support it was claimed that the warrant failed to provide reasonable particularity of any alleged offence, including a failure to specify the date/s of the alleged offence. As a result, it was contended the occupier’s notice suffered from the same deficiencies. 11 Accordingly it was argued, the warrant is invalid and its execution unlawful and the relief claimed should be granted. Background to the charges12 The immediate facts giving rise to the application for the warrant occurred on 14 November 2007. It was on that date that it was alleged that police observed the plaintiff and searched his vehicle. The plaintiff was then arrested. Chamber Magistrate Kepreotis, the first defendant, issued the warrant on 14 November 2007. It was executed on the same date. 13 On 2 June 2008, the committal proceedings were commenced before Magistrate Walquist at Liverpool Local Court. On 3 June 2008, those proceedings were adjourned for the purpose of allowing the plaintiff to commence proceedings in this court in respect of the validity of the search warrant. On 7 July 2008, the original summons was filed in this court. The search warrant14 The authority purportedly conferred by the warrant was in the following terms:-  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        2 To search those premises for any of the following things:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Drugs in the form of (ice) Crystal Methamphetamine, (speed) Amphetamine. Money associated with the sale of prohibited drugs. Drug ledgers and things connected with the sale of prohibited drugs. 
          
         
         
          
          The police officer has reasonable grounds for believing that those things:- 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (a) are connected with the offence(s) of:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            Supply Prohibited Drug Section 25 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            Possess Prohibited Drug Section 10 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    Plaintiff’s submissions 15 It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that as a matter of statutory interpretation, the LEPR Act and Regulation mandate that “particular” and “relevant” offences must be “specified” on the face of the warrant. 16 The contention was that the legislative regime instituted by the LEPR Act and the LEPR Regulation require a particularity by way of a more detailed statement of “offences” than was previously required by the Search Warrants Act 1985 and the statutory scheme the subject of the High Court’s consideration in State of New South Wales v Corbett (2007) 230 CLR 606. Particular attention was drawn to the terms of s 66 of the LEPR Act, which states, “A warrant is to be in the form prescribed by the regulations”. Whereas, section 14 of the Search Warrants Act 1985 provided that “a search warrant shall be in or to the effect of the prescribed form”. It was submitted that the different wording in the LEPR Act imposed a mandatory legislative requirement.17 On the latter point, I do not consider that there is any substantive difference in the effect of sections 66 and 14 of the last mentioned Act. They both impose mandatory requirements. 
     
      
    18 It was argued that the warrant in this case does not satisfy this requirement in the LEPR Act and Regulation in that the warrant:- 
     
      
       
      (a) merely refers to sections of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
       1985;  
       
       
      (b) does not include dates or ranges of dates of the offences alleged; 
       
       
      (c) does not refer to any alleged importation; and, 
       
       
      (d) does not particularise the alleged offences.  
      
    19 As a result the warrant, and the resulting occupiers’ notice, were said to be invalid. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s case is that the warrant , as issued, was not authorised under the LEPR Act and an order in the nature of certiorari should issue. 20 In support of the order sought for the delivery up of the material listed in the amended summons, reliance was placed on Pressler v Holzberger (1989) 44 A Crim R 261 and Love v Attorney-General (NSW) (1990) 169 CLR 307 for the availability of a delivery up order where items had been seized in contravention of law. Defendants’ submissions 21 The second and third defendants submitted that the court should not exercise its jurisdiction on the basis that the fragmentation of the criminal process is to be actively discouraged. In relation to the first issue raised in the amended summons, the validity of the warrant, it is contended that the Local Court is fully capable of determining that matter, and that should this court make a determination, the Local Court may in any event need to reconsider the same facts in deciding whether to exclude the evidence under s.138 of the Evidence Act 1995. In relation to the second issue, it was submitted that the fraud or bad faith allegation, was quite unmeritorious. 22 Mr Babb SC submitted that in any event the plaintiff’s case as to the validity of the warrant should be rejected as the warrant specifies the relevant offences by describing them in words and by identifying by specific provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. 23 The defendants submitted that this case was quite unlike the position in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Cloran (1984) 4 FCR 151 where the structure of the particular section was such as to create a number of different offences. Mr Babb SC also submitted that the question of sufficient particularity in this case should be resolved by looking at the warrant as a whole. In that respect, the specificity of the items to be searched for as stated in the warrant was instructive as to the objects of the authorised search.24 On the question of the order sought for delivery up of items seized, Mr Babb SC submitted that the Court has a discretion as to whether to return seized items under an invalid warrant. Where criminal proceedings are on foot, he submitted that discretion will normally be refused. Reference was made to the decisions of Tye v Commissioner of Police (1995) 84 A Crim R 147 and Wright v Queensland Police Service (2002) 2 Qd R 667. In the circumstances, it was submitted no delivery up orders should be made. Jurisdictional Considerations 25 As noted above, in the present case, the plaintiff has been charged and committal proceedings have commenced. I have considered whether, as a discretionary matter, this Court should assume jurisdiction or whether the issues as to the validity of the warrants and/or the lawfulness of their execution should be left for determination by the trial court.26 In former times it was not uncommon for persons facing criminal charges to institute applications for judicial review in order to challenge decisions which were vulnerable to “collateral attack”. Applications for judicial review generally resulted in delays, some of which were quite lengthy. 27 The dangers of fragmentation of the criminal justice process, and the need for caution on the part of civil courts in undertaking judicial review of decisions made in the course of that process have been clearly recognised and been the subject of consideration: see Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Jiang (2001) 183 ALR 604 at [7]; ACS v Anderson [1975] 1 NSWLR 212 at 215-217; Conwell v Tapfield [1981] 1 NSWLR 595 at 601, 603-605; Cain v Glass (No 2) [1985] 3 NSWLR 230 at 244-245, 253; Anderson v Attorney General (NSW) [1987] 10 NSWLR 198 at 200-202; and Carroll v Attorney General (NSW) (1993) 70 A Crim R 162. 28 Discontinuity, disruption and delay should be avoided in the public interest of the expeditious resolution of allegations of criminal offences: Seymour v Attorney-General (Cth) (1984) 4 FCR 498 at [501]; Flanagan v Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (1996) 60 FCR 149 at 187–8.29 Accordingly, the power to make declaratory orders should be exercised sparingly where the declaration would touch the conduct of criminal proceedings: Gedeon v Commissioner of the New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] HCA 43; (2008) 249 ALR 398 at [23]. This principle is not limited to declaratory relief, but has been held to apply to claims for prerogative relief: R v Iorlano (1983) 151 CLR 678; R v Elliott (1996) 185 CLR 250.30 However, this Court may as a matter of discretion exercise its jurisdiction where criminal proceedings are pending if considered appropriate to do so in the circumstances: see Commissioner of Police v Atkinson [1991] 23 NSWLR 495. 31 I reproduce a statement of the general propositions derived from the relevant case law I formulated in Ballis v Randall [2007] NSWSC 422 at [73]:-  
     
      
       
        
        “(a) There ought to be sound justification in point of practical utility in a Court intervening by way of granting declaratory relief in criminal proceedings. Otherwise, discretionary considerations will point against the grant of such relief (see Conwell (supra) at 601 per Street CJ). 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Where an application for declaratory and ancillary relief raises important questions both of statute law and of evidentiary principle, the resolution of which may have a substantial bearing upon criminal litigation, then this Court may exercise its jurisdiction where such relief is sought (see  
        Conwell 
         ( 
        supra 
        ) at 601). 
        
       
       
        
        (c) There is a distinction between proceedings in which a declaration is sought as to the construction of a statute which provides for the issue of search and seizure warrants from those in which in criminal proceedings a declaration is sought on a question of evidence or procedure. In the case of the latter, the circumstances must be exceptional to warrant the grant of relief:  
        Sankey v Whitlam 
         (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 25 per Gibbs ACJ. See also  
        ACS v Anderson

        supra 
        ) at 216 per Hutley JA;

         ( 
        supra 
        ) at 253 per McHugh JA;  
        Anderson 
         ( 
        supra 
        ) at 200-201 per Kirby P and  
        Carroll 
         ( 
        supra 
        ) at 168. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) An application for declaratory and other relief which involves evident unmeritorious delaying tactics ought not be permitted to fragment the criminal justice process 
        .” 
        
       
      
    32 In Ballis v Randall (supra), the construction and application of the Search Warrants Act 1985 in relation to occupiers’ rights required resolution. Similarly in Gedeon (supra), the High Court found there was a considerable public interest in the observance of due process by law enforcement authorities by putting beyond doubt important questions concerning the construction of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997. The present proceedings raise an issue concerning the construction of the LEPR Act upon which there has apparently been no judicial consideration. Two important questions arise out of the proceedings. First, the question as to what constitutes sufficient specification of the offence in a search warrant under the particular terms of the Act and the LEPR Regulation. Second, the question as to the requirements upon applicants to disclose information when applying for the issue of a search warrant. (The latter concerns the challenge on the basis of bad faith to which I have earlier referred).33 I note that significant delay has occurred between the filing of the summons on 1 July 2008 and the hearing of the matter in March 2009. It is not relevant that Magistrate Wahlquist was reluctant to “go behind the warrant itself” (transcript of proceedings, 2 June 2008, p. 2) and that the prosecutor did not oppose the committal proceedings being adjourned to permit this challenge. The learned magistrate did have power to determine the validity of the warrant.34 However, be that as it may, I consider that for reasons identified above, the issues raised by the present proceedings do warrant the exercise of this Court’s jurisdiction. A determination of the issues by this Court of such issues will not, of course, be finally determinative of issues concerning the admissibility of evidence obtained under the warrant in question. That will be a matter for the trial judge to consider in the exercise of the discretion under s 138 of the Evidence Act.35 Accordingly, having examined and determined the particular circumstances in this case, I consider that there is proper basis upon which this Court should assume jurisdiction.The relevant provisions of the Act36 Section 47 of the LEPR Act (cf Search Warrants Act, s 5) provides for the power to apply for a warrant:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        (1) A police officer may apply to an authorised officer for a search warrant if the police officer believes on reasonable grounds that there is or, within 72 hours will be, in or on any premises:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a thing connected with a particular indictable offence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a thing connected with a particular firearms offence, or 
          
         
         
          
          (c) a thing connected with a particular prohibited weapons offence, or 
          
         
         
          
          (d) a thing connected with a particular narcotics offence, or 
          
         
         
          
          (e) a thing connected with a particular child pornography offence, or 
          
         
         
          
          (f) a thing stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    37 Section 48 of the LEPR Act (cf Search Warrants Act, s 6) contains the power to issue a warrant: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        An authorised officer to whom an application for a search warrant is made may, if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for doing so, issue a search warrant authorising any police officer: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) to enter the premises, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) to search the premises for things of a kind referred to in section 47 (1).” 
        
       
      
    38 Under s 76 of the LEPR Act (cf Search Warrants Act, s 23), “a warrant is not invalidated by any defect, other than a defect that affects the substance of the warrant in a material particular”.39 As noted earlier, s 66 of the LEPR Act provides that “a warrant is to be in the form prescribed by the regulations,” in contrast to the former s 14 of the Search Warrants Act which required that “a search warrant shall be in or to the effect of the prescribed form.” 40 Regulation 6(1)(a) of the LEPR Regulation states “Form 9 is the form for a Part 5 search warrant.” Accordingly, for the purposes of s 66, the terms of Form 9 forms part of the statutory prescription. (Under the previous Search Warrants Regulation 1999, regulation 5 specified Form 3 as the form for a Part 2 search warrant.)41 Form 9 in the LEPR Regulation contains the following:- 
     
      
       
        
       
       
        
        “2* To search those premises for any of the following things: [List and describe the things to be searched for with particularity. If space is insufficient, continue overleaf or attach a separate sheet.] 
         
         
          
          The police officer has reasonable grounds for believing that those things:  
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a)* are connected with the offence(s) of:  
          [Specify relevant offences.] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b)* are stolen or unlawfully obtained.” 
           (emphasis added) 
          
         
        
       
      
    42 The instruction “Specify relevant offences” is of significance.43 Form 3 in the Search Warrant Regulation 1999 contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        2. there to search those premises for any of the following things: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ............................................................ 
           
          ............................................................ 
           
          ............................................................ 
          
         
         
          
          being things that the police officer has reasonable grounds for believing:  
           
           
          (a) are connected with the offence(s) of: 
           
          ............................................................ 
          
         
         
          
          (b) are stolen or unlawfully obtained.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    44 There was no instruction as to specifying the offence. AnalysisValidity of the search warrant 
     
      
      (1) Public and private interests 
      
    45 The inviolability of a person’s home has been recognised in English law since the 18th century. The grant of search warrants in respect of stolen goods was the first exception to this principle. General warrants, which did not particularise the person affected or the object of the search, were struck down by the common law courts in the mid-18th century for being “totally subversive of the liberty of the subject” (Wilkes v Wood (1763) Lofft 1 at [18]; see also Entick v Carrington (1765) 2 Wils KB 275 and Money v Leach (1765) 1 Black W 555). Consequently, the House of Commons condemned general warrants. 46 The law of entry, search and seizure in Australia is of course, now governed by statute. However, the notion of the sanctity of a citizen’s home, free from unlawful interference, remains a fundamental concept which is inherent in the protections afforded by the LEPR Act. Whilst the issue of search warrants is properly to be considered to be a means for securing the public interest in preventing and prosecuting crime, the execution of a search warrant nonetheless necessarily results in interference with individual rights. The law accordingly strives to balance public and individual interests so that whilst the State may obtain evidence relating to the commission of crime in the administration of justice, citizens are also protected from illegal or improper invasions of their civil rights by law enforcement authorities: Lawrie v Muir [1950] SLT 37; Crowley v Murphy (1981) 52 FLR 123. (2) The need to specify an offence with particularity47 Before dealing with the requirements under the LEPR Act and LEPR Regulation as they operate in the present case, I will record below general matters from the case law concerning the requirements for specificity of offences. In this context, to safeguard the individual’s rights, it has been held that a warrant should “refer to a particular offence and authorize seizure by reference to that offence” (R v Tillett; Ex parte Newton (1969) 14 FLR 101 at [113]). See also Crowley v Murphy (supra).48 One test which has been formulated in this regard is whether the description of the offence in the warrant is “sufficiently clear to enable the person where premises are being searched to know the exact object of the search”: R v Tillett; Ex parte Newton (supra) at 113; Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Masters v Cloran (supra).49 However, as the High Court explained in George v Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 104, “the description of the object of the search is a reference point for delimiting the scope of the warrant” at 118. Particulars of an offence(s) establishes a “nucleus for the search” by which both the citizen whose premises are subject to the warrant and the officer executing the warrant: Parker v Churchill (1985) 9 FCR 316 at 319.50 In light of the legislature’s concern to protect individual interests, strict compliance with statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is necessary: George v Rockett (supra) at 110-111. However, that said, a warrant should, like other documents, be read fairly and not perversely: Different Solutions Pty Limited v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (No 2) [2008] FCA 1686 at [108].51 There is a degree of variance in the authorities as to the degree of particularity required in a search warrant: Optical Prescription Spectacle Makes Pty Ltd v Withers (1987) 13 FCR 594 at 596. This may be attributed, at least to some extent, to differently expressed statutory requirements and the particular wording of the warrant in those cases. However, a commonality of approach can be discerned in relation to the continuing concern of the legislature and common law courts to strictly confine the exception to the inviolability of an individual’s right to property and privacy arising from a validly issued search warrant. 52 The following principles may be distilled from the cases:  
     
      
      (a) The requirement to identify the offence in a search warrant has been held to apply regardless of whether the legislation states a specific requirement to do so:  
      Douglas v Blackler  
      [2001] NSWSC 901 at [12].  
       
       
      (b) The question of whether a warrant meets the statutory requirements must be viewed objectively by reference to its contents:  
      Wright v Queensland Police Service 
       (2002) 2 Qd R 667 at [32]. 
       
       
      (c) Where the warrant fails to specify  
      any 
       offence, such a failure will invalidate the warrant:  
      Warner v Elder 
       (NSWSC, 23 April 1997, unreported);  
      Carver v Clerk of the Court, Local Court at Blacktown 
       (NSWSC, as per Black AJ 13 March 1998, unreported). 
       
       
      (d) The question whether there is sufficient particularity is a question to be resolved by looking at the warrant in its entirety:  
      Ryder v Morley  
      (1986) 12 FCR 438 at 444. This includes the items to be searched for:  
      Beneficial Finance Corporation v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police 
       (1991) 31 FCR 523 at 525.  
       
       
      (e) In  
      Brewer v Castles (No 2) 
       1 FCR 55; 52 ALR 577, it was held to be sufficient to specify the offences quite generally, one being “ 
      s 86(1)(e) of the Crimes Act, to wit, conspiracy and defraud the Commonwealth 
      ”. Despite the generality of such a description, Beaumont J found that it was sufficiently definite to indicate the nature of the documents to be seized. 
       
       
      (f) The practical application of the test may vary from instance to instance:  
      Arno v Forsyth 
       (1986) 9 FCR 576 at 595. 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In  
        Arno v Forsyth 
         (supra), the warrant authorised the seizure of an extremely wide range of documents over a period of six years. The Federal Court rejected the argument that the statement of the offences reduced the generality of the warrant. The warrant referred to specified sections in various enactments with a short description. The first three groups of offences simply referred to conspiracies to defraud the Commonwealth, whilst the group of fourth and fifth offences provided no detail which indicated the nature of the acts alleged. The description in relation to the conspiracy charges did not identify the persons, times, places or manner of the offences committed. In looking at the warrant as a whole, the Federal Court found that in the circumstances, the warrant was bad for generality.  
        
       
       
        
        There is some difficulty in reconciling the outcome in  
        Brewer v Castles (No 2) 
         (supra) with  
        Arno v Forsyth 
         (supra), at least in so far as the conspiracy offences are concerned. In this respect, however, to be noted is that the warrant in  
        Arno v Forsyth 
         covered a very wide period (six years) in relation to a complex matter said to involve tax avoidance schemes. It was said in this context that the warrant failed to identify relevant persons and it was the combination of circumstances that were held to be relevant, Lockhart J stating at 591 as follows:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          …These are all matters which must be considered in deciding whether a warrant is bad for generality. Of course, the existence of any of those matters taken in isolation, does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the warrant is defective. In each case the warrant must be looked at as a whole and all of its provisions taken into account 
          .” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (g) The “ 
      nature of the offence 
      ” has to be stated sufficiently:  
      New South Wales v Corbett 
       (2007) 230 CLR 606 at [106] as per Callinan and Crennan JJ. Their Honours there indicated that the nature of the offence had to be identified so as to enable the issuing justice to understand the objects of the search to appreciate the boundaries of the authorisation to enter, search and seize. See also Gleeson CJ at [1] and Gummow J at [3].  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Corbett  
        (supra) concerned an application for warrant made pursuant to s 5(1)(b) of the  
        Search Warrants Act 
         (now repealed), which required an applicant for a search warrant to have reasonable ground for a belief in respect of “ 
        a thing connected with a particular firearms offence 
        .”  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The application for the warrant in  
        Corbett 
         did contain a reference to a section in the  
        Firearms Act No 25/1989  
        Sect 5(a). However, that legislation had been repealed and replaced by the  
        Firearms Act 
         1996. The provision in question appears in s 7(1) of the latter Act in materially identical terms.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Callinan and Crennan JJ found that the application stated an “ 
        intelligible offence 
        ”, namely possession of a firearm (at [106]). It was the nature of the offence which was crucial, not the reference to repealed legislation. The reference did not detract from the nature of the offence or render the description of the object of the search unintelligible or ambiguous. Therefore, the application and warrant were not invalid. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (h) The description of the offence in a search warrant need not be made with the precision of an indictment:  
      Beneficial Finance Corporation v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police 
       (supra) at 533. In determining whether a warrant describes an offence with sufficient particularity, it is, of course, to be appreciated that at the time the warrant is issued, the matter is at an investigatory stage and there often will not be evidence capable of satisfying a court at trial:  
      Arno v Forsyth 
       (supra) at 590. It is the function of the warrant to obtain such evidence.  
      
     
     
      
      (i) This is particularly evident in complex crimes, such as taxation frauds, which often involve numerous persons and entities, and therefore difficulties associated with the gathering of documentary evidence to support the laying of charges:  
      Arno v Forsyth 
       (supra) at 491 per Lockhart J.  
      
     
     
      
      (j) Where a section in a criminal statute provides for the commission of a somewhat indeterminate number of offences, the mere reference in a warrant to the section may be held to one which fails to describe the particular offences in relation to which the seizure is authorised:  
      Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Masters v 
        
      Cloran 
       (supra) per Lockhart J at 153-154.  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In  
        Cloran 
         (supra), the warrant was issued pursuant to s 10 of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1914 (Cth). The recital of the warrant referred to “ 
        commission of offences against s 70 of the Crimes Act 
        ”. However, the operative part of the warrant was silent as to the particular offence and did not refer to the description given in the recital. The warrant, accordingly, was held to be bad for failing to describe the particular offences.  
         
         
        Lockhart J held that even if the operative part of the warrant did incorporate the description of the offence in the recital, it would still be invalid for failing to specify the offence. This was based on the nature and structure of the provisions of s 70 of the  
        Crimes Act 
        , which provides for the “ 
        commission of a somewhat indeterminate number of offences 
        ” (as per Lockhart J at 154). Accordingly, it was observed in that case that it would be impossible to know what the offences alleged to be committed against s 70 were with any degree of particularity or precision.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (k) Where warrant legislation requires that a search warrant state “ 
      brief particulars of the offence 
      ”, it has been held that the bare specification of the offence is insufficient: 
       Wright v Queensland Police Service 
       (supra) at [32]). 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In  
        Wright v Queensland Police Service 
         (supra), it was contended that a warrant issued under the  
        Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 
         2000 (Qld) was defective. The warrant stated the offence as follows, “ 
        Section 123 Criminal Code – Perjury 
        ”. Section 73 of the  
        Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 
         2000 sets out the matters which a search warrant must specify, including at s 73(1)(b)(i), “ 
        brief particulars of the offence for which the warrant is issued”. 
          
         
         
        Holmes J held that although it would be unwise to formulate what brief particulars should comprise, merely naming the offence could not constitute “ 
        particulars 
        ” for the purposes of the section (at [32]). However, at a minimum, his Honour observed that the warrant should state the name of the alleged offender, and where the identity of the offender is unknown, some details of the offence (at [39]).  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (l) A wrong citation of a section of legislation does not invalidate a warrant which clearly sets out in terms the substance of the offence:  
      Parker v Churchill 
       (1985) 9 FCR 316 at 320. That decision was approved on appeal:  
      Parker v Churchill 
       (1986) 9 FCR 334 at 335.  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Jackson J said that such an error would only invalidate the warrant if it had the result that the warrant did not specify the offence or made the warrant ambiguous so that it was not possible to tell what offence was referred to:  
        Parker v Churchill 
         (supra) at 340. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The warrants in  
        Parker v Churchill 
         (supra) were made pursuant to s 10 of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1914 (Cth). They referred to a section of the  
        Taxation Administration Act 
         rather than a section of the  
        Sales Tax Assessment Act 
        . However, the description in the warrant stated in otherwise intelligible terms an existing offence and the warrant was accordingly held not to be invalid on this basis.  
         
         
        The warrants also alleged that certain named individuals were in breach of s 231 of the  
        Income Tax Assessment Act 
         1936 in that they “ 
        at various times”  
        over a period of six years 
          
        evaded payment of income 
          
        tax. Jackson J held that this description of the offence was “ 
        in the broadest terms 
        ” and therefore the warrant failed to state the offence with sufficient particularity:  
        Parker v Churchill 
         (1986) 9 FCR 334 at 249.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (m) Where the warrant describes an offence which does not exist, or which is not known as the words used, it has been held that the description is not adequate:  
      Bradrose v Commissioner of Police, ex parte Bradrose 
       (1989) 2 Qd R 304. 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In  
        Bradrose 
         (supra), the warrant under consideration referred to “ 
        the offence of false pretences 
        ” as opposed to “ 
        Obtaining property by false pretences; Cheating 
        ”. Although often identified by a shorthand description, it was held that it was not an offence described under the  
        Criminal Code 
         (Qld). Such a description of the offence, it was observed, would prevent the persons affected by the warrant from knowing the exact object of the search.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (n) A warrant may be sufficiently particular if it specifies the substance of the offences in question, even if the name of the Act by which the offence is created is not disclosed:  
      Williams v Keelty 
       [2001] FCA 1301; (2001) 184 ALR 411 at [143].  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In  
        Williams v Keelty 
         (supra), the warrants were issued pursuant to s 3E of the  
        Crimes Act  
        1914 (Cth). The warrants recorded the section numbers of the offences without reference to the relevant Act, the  
        Corporations Act 
        . However, the warrant did specify the substance of the offence.  
        
       
      
    (3) The search warrant in the present case53 The requirement “specify relevant offences” in the form prescribed by the LEPR Regulation is a more limited one than a requirement to provide “brief particulars of the offence”, the latter being the requirement under the legislation considered in Wright (supra). “Particulars” of an offence when specially required go beyond identifying or naming an offence and require information about an offence, such as where and when an offence had been committed. See the discussion in Wright (supra) at [32]. 54 A requirement to specify a relevant offence carries the meaning of a requirement to name or identify an offence.55 For that purpose, subject to the specific terms of a statutory provision, an offence may be named or identified by a reference to the provisions of an Act that creates a particular offence. In the present case, reference was made to sections 10 and 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act accompanied by a short description of “possess prohibited drug” and “supply prohibited drug” respectively. 56 No argument has been raised in these proceedings that those particulars in the warrant were ambiguous, vague or obscure. 57 The offence stated in s 10 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act is that “a person who has a prohibited drug in his or her possession is guilty of an offence”. Possession of a prohibited drug is the only offence created by that provision. 58 Section 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act provides for variations of the offence of “supply of prohibited drugs”. The primary offence can be found in subsection (1), “a person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.” The remaining subsections of the provision deal with offences of supply of a prohibited drug according to the age of the person supplying the drug, the age of the person to whom it is supplied and the quantity of the drug supplied. Sections 32, 33 and 33A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act stipulate the penalties for these offences. The Crown Advocate submitted that the effect of s 25 is to create one offence, “supply of prohibited drug”, with aggravating features rather than several discrete or separate offences. This is to be contrasted with the provisions considered in Cloran (supra), which contained a “somewhat indeterminate number of offences” (at 154). Not only did each subsection give rise to four separate offences based on the words “publish” and “communicate”, there also existed numerous possible combinations of people involved in the offence. In the present case, it was possible to know with a high degree of accuracy that the offence referred to in the warrant concerned or involved the “supply of prohibited drug”, even though the offence may have been aggravated by the presence of more specified features.59 As noted above, the issue of specifying the offence with sufficient particularity must be considered by looking at the warrant as a whole: Ryder v Morley (supra). This includes the specified items to be searched for. The warrant in this case identified the things to be searched for with a high degree of particularity, including the type of drug (“(ice) Crystal Methamphetamine” and “(speed) Amphetamine”), money associated with the sale of prohibited drugs, drug ledgers and things connected with the sale of prohibited drugs. 60 Having regard to the LEPR Act, the short description of the offences, together with the references to the relevant provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, leads to the conclusion that the particulars furnished satisfied the statutory requirement to “specify relevant offences”, and were free of any ambiguity or uncertainty.  
     
      
    61 The issues pursued in the amended summons with respect to the alleged unlawful execution of the warrant and delivery up orders do not arise for decision. Those claims are contingent on a finding that the warrant was invalid for the failure to sufficiently specify the offences. 
     
      
       
      Conclusions 
       
      
    62 For the reasons discussed above, I am of the opinion that the warrant was valid. 
     
      
    63 Accordingly, on that basis and having regard to the fact that the ground of bad faith/fraud considered in the judgment in respect of which I have made a non-publication order has been rejected, the amended summons should be dismissed and I so order. 
     
      
    64 I will hear the parties as to costs.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Robert Pavan pleaded guilty to an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of cocaine. Encompassed within that offence were three separate transactions, each involving approximately a kilogram of cocaine. In each case the offender’s role was to identify purchasers of that large quantity and facilitate the supply of that cocaine from a Mr Big to someone who would then on-supply the drug, perhaps then in turn to others in the chain, before the drug was ultimately distributed to users.2 The offender’s conduct extended over a relatively short time, but it was nevertheless gravely criminal. The offender took a significant role in the drug supply transactions, identifying purchasers and supervising the supply and payment. It is accepted that he must receive a significant period of imprisonment in order to reflect the criminality of his conduct. 3 He is now sixty years of age. He has some criminal history but there is nothing remotely approaching the seriousness of his present offending. His previous criminal history seems to have been related to his conduct involved in the racing industry. There were tendered today an impressive series of references from friends and family. It appears that the offender is in many respects a man of good character. He is prepared to go very much out of his way to assist his friends and family and has for many years been devoted and dedicated to his family’s upbringing. 4 When his first wife left he took over the sole care of his three children. He remarried but his second wife also left at about the same time that his daughter’s marriage broke down. In those circumstances his dedication to his children and grandchildren has been far beyond average. He managed to reach fifty-six years of age with only minor matters on his criminal history. That is testament to his underlying character and suggests among other things that he has good prospects of rehabilitation, and is unlikely to re-offend due in no small measure to the substantial support he will receive on release from custody.5 The offender became involved in these transactions after meeting a man by the name of Hatfield. He was one of the Mr Bigs I referred to earlier. Hatfield together with two others, Leslie Mara and Michael Hurley, were involved in large-scale cocaine importation and distribution. Having a large quantity of cocaine in their possession, they needed to sell it for profit. Part of that process required the identification of prospective purchasers and the handing over of the cocaine and the receipt of money.6 The offender said that he owed on Hatfield’s behalf a significant sum of money, and that Hatfield suggested that one way that the money could be recouped was if the offender became involved in the first of the transactions. That was the supply of a kilogram of cocaine to two men, Hinch and Dowe, on 23 February 2005. 7 It was the offender who caused Mr Dowe to be recruited to the chain of drug supply. To put matters more clearly, it was the offender who identified Dowe as a prospective purchaser and then made arrangements for the handing over of the cocaine and the receipt of the money. The offender was present when the actual transaction took place, supervising it and making sure that all went to plan. How the offender was able to identify someone who wanted to buy a kilogram of cocaine was not made clear.8 The other two transactions were broadly similar in that the offender identified a Mr Stephens as someone who was involved or interested in obtaining two kilograms of cocaine. On two separate occasions the offender arranged the supply of about a kilogram of cocaine to Mr Stephens for the payment of significant sums of money. These transactions would likely not have taken place were it not for the offender’s involvement. He had a very significant role in what occurred.9 Rather than sentencing him according to labels such as “principal” or “courier”, I will sentence him for what he has done and that is, as I have described earlier, obtaining the purchaser, arranging transactions and supervising them.10 The offender was himself using cocaine at the time. A suggestion that he was not a user at the time appearing on one of the reports appears to be a mistake, but this was not a case of a user dealer becoming involved in drug transactions simply to facilitate his or her drug use. This was a case of an offender involving himself in large scale drug supply for financial advantage, even if that financial advantage may have been relatively small.11 The offender said that he spent the money he received on living expenses. That the offender would involve himself in such serious criminality just to help his living expenses is puzzling, especially given the age at which he first committed this serious offence. He explains that it was at a time of some crisis in his life. His second marriage had just broken down, as had his daughter’s. That scarcely explains what occurred. Marriages break down with regularity. People find themselves at times of crisis for all manner of reasons. Yet very few of them supply three kilograms of cocaine as a result. Certainly the offender was at a low point when he committed these offences, but it does not explain what he did in any way.12 Since being arrested on 9 May 2005, the offender has performed very well in custody, and that is consistent with what I described as his underlying character. He has expressed what he described as remorse and contrition both in relation to the effect of drugs in the community, and also to the effect of his incarceration on his family, a matter which I gather is of great concern to him.13 As I mentioned the offender pleaded guilty. The question of the appropriate discount to reflect the utilitarian value of that plea is somewhat complicated. The matter has something of a history, part of the complication in this matter arising from the conduct of the law enforcement authorities and various challenges to that, going all the way to the High Court. It is not necessary for me to recount that history.14 In broad terms, the authorities say that for a plea at committal the appropriate discount is one of twenty-five per cent. For a plea at first arraignment in this court, the appropriate discount is fifteen per cent. Because of the complicated nature of the present proceedings, this is a matter where the discount should be somewhere in the middle. The utilitarian value of the plea is somewhere in the middle of those two circumstances I have mentioned. I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by twenty per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea.15 The seriousness of this offence is obvious from the way I have described it. It is also made clear by the fact that the maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment. That is an appropriate reflection of the terrible consequences of conduct of this kind, where people with seemingly no or little regard to the lives and welfare of other citizens involve themselves in large scale drug transactions for financial advantage. Also demonstrating the seriousness of the offence is the fact that it carries with it a standard non-parole period of fifteen years. That, of course, is not of direct application because of the plea of guilty but it reminds as a guide post to the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case.16 It of course is appropriate to an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, and of course the “range” is not a single point. I am satisfied that it is appropriate to describe the three transactions in this offence as being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 17 Many others involved in these drug transactions have been sentenced, one of them by me. Of course, their conduct and their subjective circumstances were different, but I have been referred to the sentences imposed on Dow, Finch and Stephens in the course of the submissions.18 The principles of parity do apply, such that I should ensure that the offender is not left with a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence imposed upon the others. As I said, there are many differences between their cases and this, the most important of which is that the offender was involved in three separate transactions, more than Finch, Dow or Stephens. It is significantly more serious for the offender to have involved himself in the further supply of one kilogram when comparing the sentence imposed upon him to the sentence I earlier imposed upon Stephens. The supply of a kilogram of a dangerous drug such as cocaine is not something lightly set aside and ignored.19 It is important to emphasise also that it is not a simple case of, on three occasions the offender doing a single illegal act. Each time he facilitated the supply of drugs, many separate acts were required, negotiating, planning and organising the deal. 20 There has been no challenge to the submission on behalf of the offender that I would find special circumstances. This will be his first time in custody. The sentence I will impose upon him must necessarily be lengthy and he will be assisted by support upon his release from custody. It is appropriate that the sentence date from 9 May 2005, the day on which the offender was arrested.21 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of seven and a half years. This will expire on 8 November 2012, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. I set a total sentence of twelve years.

     Judgment 
    Introduction[1] These proceedings were listed at the same time as proceedings 5370 of 2008 (Lassanah v State of New South Wales [2009] NSWDC 73) for the purpose of an application by the defendant for summary judgment on the basis that the matter complained of was published on an occasion of absolute privilege.[2] The matter complained of in these circumstances consisted of words spoken by constables of the New South Wales Police Force at McEvoy Street, Waterloo near McDonald’s on or about 5 September 2008 when the police officer said to the first plaintiff “you’re robbing women”, “you’re a thief”, “you have stolen from women”. He was arrested and charged, although the charges were not proceeded with. At the same time, the police officer said to the second plaintiff “you’re under arrest – you’re a piece of shit – you’re fucked – you’re going to gaol”. The second plaintiff was then arrested and charged, although the charges have not been proceeded with.[3] The factual situation in these proceedings is almost identical to that in Lassanah v State of New South Wales. Police have been called by a person who asserts that a criminal offence has been committed and in the course of carrying out their activities the police are alleged to have made these statements.[4] For the reasons set out in my judgment in Lassanah, the application for summary judgment must be dismissed. I also consider, for the same reasons, that the same costs order should be made.Orders(1) Defendant’s application for summary judgment dismissed.(2) Costs to be plaintiffs’ costs in the cause.(3) The parties have leave to bring in Short Minutes of Order for a timetable for these proceedings.

   JUDGMENT1. John Varga has pleaded guilty to a serious crime. He is an elderly man in his early seventies who has a significant health problem. The question in sentencing him focuses on how I take into account his age and health in fixing an appropriate sentence for the serious crime he has committed.2. The crime is cultivating enhanced indoor cannabis plants. It is a crime under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. S 23(1A) creates the crime and under s 33 of the same Act, Parliament has fixed a maximum of fifteen years imprisonment for this crime. So it is a very serious offence that Mr Varga has committed. 3. This is what happened. Mr Varga was a man in need. He had what he acknowledges was a serious gambling problem. He ran up a gambling debt on what he described as horses and dogs of something like $7,000. He was approached by a man known as Paul. Paul told him that if he took over the lease of a house and lived there for six months then his gambling debt would be cancelled. 4. Mr Varga agreed to this arrangement. The arrangement was not as straight-forward as it sounded and Mr Varga agreed not only to take over the lease of the house but to look after the cannabis plants that were concealed in the garage of the house. When police discovered the plants there were some nineteen plants. There was a sophisticated arrangement of lighting to generate the growth of the plants. There were other signs that it was a sophisticated enterprise. In addition to the plants, police found what are described as two drying beds each containing some cannabis head which was drying. In addition to the nineteen plants they found nearly four kilograms of dry cannabis. 5. Police discovered who Mr Varga was and about a month after police discovered the plantation, Mr Varga, who had seen his solicitor Mr Bergagnin, very wisely contacted the police on 11 August 2008 through his solicitor. He and Mr Bergagnin attended Liverpool police station a few days later where Mr Varga was interviewed and made full admissions. He said that he went to the house every day and stayed overnight. He was not required to pay anything towards his accommodation. He looked after the plants and knew that at the end of the period, his $7,000 gambling debt would be cleared.6. Police estimate the total value of the nineteen plants was around $100,000 and the amount of cannabis head about $40,000. It is obvious from what I have described that this was a sophisticated crime designed to produce handsome profits for the principal organiser of the crime. That description is the basis of one of the submission of Mr Paish who appears for Mr Varga today, namely that his client is not a principal in this offence but was the kind of person often chosen by principals to become involved in these sorts of crimes. Mr Varga was a vulnerable man because of his age and health and particularly because of his gambling debt. 7. The assessment of how serious this crime is needs to be seen not only in the light of the sophistication of the arrangement and the maximum penalty but also of Mr Varga’s limited role as what Mr Paish correctly described as “the night watchman”. 8. I have made some reference to Mr Varga’s health. He has a heart condition. The heart condition was serious enough to require surgery in 2006. He has recovered from the surgery but not without complication and the most recent report dated 6 April 2009 from his cardiologist refers to some complication in recovery described as a leak. 9. A helpful pre-sentence report has been prepared about Mr Varga. It points out that he is now seventy-three and lives with a friend at Bronte. He was born in the country formerly known as Yugoslavia. He had a disrupted childhood as a result of the Second World War. His father was killed by the Nazis in 1943. His mother raised the family of four. Mr Varga came to Australia over fifty years ago. He has been married twice and is amicably separated from his second wife. Apparently one of the problems in the relationship was his gambling habit. 10. He is a trained motor mechanic and has worked all of his life in that area including in the Snowy Mountains Scheme and in the Solomon Islands. He has never had a personal problem with drugs or alcohol but, as I mentioned, he has this gambling problem which has led him into this criminal behaviour. The author of the pre-sentence report notes that Mr Varga “expressed regret for becoming involved in a project of this nature.” It notes that he has not been convicted which is confirmed by his criminal record which is part of exhibit A and records no convictions.11. The author of the pre-sentence report assessed the likelihood of Mr Varga’s re-offending as low and thought that he was unlikely to require supervision. It assessed him as unsuitable for Community Service Order because of his medical condition and as eligible and suitable for periodic detention. However it also noted that he would be probably unfit to do the work which is normally a part of a Periodic Detention Order but would be able to attend the centre for the period of incarceration. 12. Mr Paish acknowledges that it is a serious offence and must attract a sentence of imprisonment. This is a realistic and correct acknowledgment. This is a serious crime carrying a significant maximum penalty. It is a crime which Mr Varga participated in and which would have resulted in the distribution within the community of a significant amount of prohibited drugs. 13. Mr Varga became involved in that crime in order to relieve himself of the financial discomfort of his own gambling debt. To my mind this is a crime which must be punished by a sentence of imprisonment but Mr Paish argues that the sentence should be either suspended or be made the subject of a Periodic Detention Order. He says that his client’s limited role in the cultivation of the plants together with his age and health and prior good character point towards the sentence being suspended or served by way of periodic detention.14. He argues that the more desirable option is a suspended sentence because of the circumstance that as a result of his health Mr Varga would not be able to undertake the work which normally accompanies a Periodic Detention Order. This is referred to in the pre-sentence report. The consequence of that, Mr Paish argues, is that Mr Varga would not get the benefit from the concession that other offenders would receive during a Periodic Detention Order that after they have worked for a certain period of the term of the order, they would be relieved from attending. In Mr Varga’s case he would have to attend for the full period of the order because he cannot undertake the work which accompanies the order.15. Mr Kiru who appears for the prosecution acknowledges that neither a suspended sentence nor a Periodic Detention Order would be erroneous. They are both, he says, within the range. He draws my attention to a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v DB [2001] NSWCCA 320 where an elderly man with a heard condition had his sentence of five years reduced to three years. However I do notice that the offence in that case was far more serious including a sexual assault of the offender’s own grandson when the child was seven years old. That carried a maximum of twenty-five years imprisonment. 16. I think Mr Paish has succeeded in his submission. I think for the reasons he advances the sentence of imprisonment should not be served full-time nor should it be served by way of periodic detention. I should add that I regard an appropriate sentence as one which would be within the range which would attract a suspension order. Taking into account where the offence lies in the range of seriousness and Mr Varga’s age, I regard a penalty of two and a half years as an appropriate sentence. Because he has pleaded guilty at what Mr Kiru fairly acknowledges is the earliest available opportunity, I propose to reduce that sentence by twenty five per cent to about twenty-two and a half months imprisonment. In addition I take into account his good character and the likelihood that he will not re-offend, I regard an appropriate sentence as being one of twenty months imprisonment which I will suspend. HIS HONOUR: Would you stand up Mr Varga I am going to sentence you now. 17. For the crime of cultivating enhanced indoor cannabis plant I convict you of that offence and I impose a sentence of imprisonment of twenty months. Under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole of the period of twenty months and I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for the period of twenty months.  The conditions of the good behaviour bond are: 1 That you be of good behaviour and  2 That you notify the registrar of this court of any change in your residential address 3 That you attend this court if called upon to do so.HIS HONOUR: Have a seat Mr Varga. Now anything in the remarks on sentence which need correction, any factual errors?KIRU: In relation to the form 1, your Honour should mention the form 1 was taken--HIS HONOUR: You’re quite right thank you.KIRU: And also destruction order. Your Honour I’m seeking a destruction order for the drugs.HIS HONOUR: That’s section 20 - it’s under the Drug Misuse yes okay thank you. Anything else?KIRU: No.HIS HONOUR: And what about the form of the order that’s the conditions of - I’m not going to give him supervision. They don’t recommend it.KIRU: No your Honour not necessary. HIS HONOUR: Nothing okay. Mr Paish I do need to take into account and in fact sign the form 1. Destruction of drugs.PAISH: Yes your Honour and indeed I implicitly understood your Honour to be taking that form 1 matter into account when your Honour assessed the starting sentence of two and a half years.HIS HONOUR: Yes, you’re right. 18. I add that in fixing the range of two and half years as the initial sentence I was also taking into account the offence of possessing a prohibited drug which is on the list of additional charges filed with the papers under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which I have signed and dated. I order that the drugs be destroyed and Mr Paish any other conditions of the bond - I don’t think so.PAISH: I notice in the last case it was specifically asked that if there be a call-up it come before your Honour but it’s a matter for your Honour.HIS HONOUR: It is, they send me a form. I usually call offenders up before me.PAISH: Then I don’t think that needs to go in any order.HIS HONOUR: No it doesn’t, no. All right. Mr Varga I’ve got to explain this to you. You’ve got a prison sentence. The prison sentence is twenty months. Do you understand that? OFFENDER: Yes.HIS HONOUR: All right. So I’ve sentenced you to gaol for twenty months but I’ve suspended that so it doesn’t operate but there is a condition and that condition is that for twenty months from today you have to behave yourself, no more trouble.OFFENDER: Yeah ..(not transcribable).. HIS HONOUR: Good. Now if you change where you live, your address.OFFENDER: I didn’t change yet but I--HIS HONOUR: You’re going to?OFFENDER: Intend to.HIS HONOUR: All right. When you do that--OFFENDER: Yeah.HIS HONOUR: --you’ve got to write to this court and tell the Registrar what your new address is. Do you understand that?OFFENDER: Yeah, yes.HIS HONOUR: All right. Mr Bergagnin will tell you who to write to. Now a suspended sentence, you also have to behave yourself, no more trouble, you understand that?OFFENDER: Yes I understand--HIS HONOUR: All right. If you do get into trouble again you’ll come back before - I know you won’t but I’ve got to tell you this - if you do you come back before me again and it’s very hard for me not to send you to gaol.OFFENDER: Yeah I--HIS HONOUR: This is not just like an ordinary good behaviour bond. This is one where I’ve imposed a gaol sentence and if you breach the bond, if you misbehave yourself, come back to me, the law says that I pretty well have to send you to gaol. OFFENDER: Yep.HIS HONOUR: Do you understand that?OFFENDER: And ..(not transcribable).. HIS HONOUR: Very serious offence which you’ve committed, very serious but I’ve listened to what Mr Paish said and I’ve decided that a suspended sentence is the right sentence in this case. I’m confident you won’t offend again. You’ve lived in Australia for 50 years and had a very good record of no convictions and that now - you’re claiming the benefit of that and I’m giving you the benefit of your good behaviour for the last 50 years as a citizen of this country. Do you understand?OFFENDER: Yeah I do. HIS HONOUR: All right.OFFENDER: Thank you very much. HIS HONOUR: Okay anything else gentlemen.PAISH: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: No. Mr Kiru?KIRU: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Thank you both for your assistance.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 11 July 2008, following his plea of guilty to a single count on an indictment, of aggravated detention of a person with intent to hold for ransom. S 86(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years for such an offence. 
     
      
    3 Puckeridge DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 6 years, made up of a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of term of 3 years. He (by implication) found that special circumstances, pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”), existed, justifying departure from the proportion between the head sentence and the non-parole period there specified. In sentencing the applicant, his Honour took into account, pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, two further offences identified on the Form 1, committed at the same time and as part of the same criminal enterprise as the offence on the indictment. These were an offence of demanding money with menaces, and another of administering a stupefying drug. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    4 The indictment alleged that the offence of detention was committed between 21 and 24 June 2006. In fact, as his Honour found, and as the Form 1 recorded, all offences were committed over a period of somewhat less than the indictment would suggest, of approximately twenty-four hours, beginning on the evening of 22 June 2006.  
     
      
    5 The circumstance of aggravation was that the offence of detention was committed in company (in fact, in the company of three others). 
     
      
    6 At about 9.30 on the evening of 22 June, the applicant and one of the co-offenders, Gokhan Oluklu, drove to the home of the victim, Emilio Commisso (then aged 19 years). It was their stated intention to travel to the city to attend a strip club. Commisso and his father were known to all offenders. They had been suppliers of cocaine to all offenders. 
     
      
    7 The applicant and Oluklu drove Commisso to a home unit in Rockdale occupied by another co-offender, Walid Ghareeb. The applicant, Oluklu and Commisso entered the unit. Ghareeb was present, with the fourth offender, Ali Maksoud. Commisso supplied all offenders with cocaine, which they used together. 
     
      
    8 Commisso was then attacked, initially by being slapped across the face (by Maksoud) and threatened. Ghareeb and Maksoud ordered him to make a telephone call to obtain $100,000. They told him that if he did not do so (by obtaining it from his father or brothers) they would kill him. They dictated to him a form of words to be used, which included a direction not to report the matter to police. They then told Commisso that he could make the telephone call the next morning, but that he would have to remain in the unit until then.  
     
      
    9 Until their arrival at the home unit, the applicant was unaware of any intention to demand money from Commisso. However, he actively participated in what then ensued. Ghareeb and Maksoud had earlier discussed demanding money from Commisso. 
     
      
    10 At some stage Commisso noticed a semi-automatic pistol on a coffee table. He did not see which of the offenders placed it there. 
     
      
    11 At Maksoud’s direction, Oluklu barricaded the front door. Some of the men began playing with the gun. They issued Commisso with more threats (of torture, and of having his fingers cut off) if the money were not forthcoming. 
     
      
    12 Oluklu and Maksoud left the unit for a time, leaving the applicant and Ghareeb in charge. Ghareeb made more threats. Oluklu and Maksoud returned to the unit. They forced Commisso to take two tablets, which later proved to be of a variety of anti psychotic drugs that had been prescribed for Ghareeb. This constituted the second offence on the Form 1, of administering a stupefying drug. The applicant actively participated in this, by giving Commisso water with which to take the tablets. 
     
      
    13 Commisso lost consciousness, and remained unconscious until 8.45 the following morning, when he was woken by Maksoud. At Maksoud’s direction Commisso telephoned his father. Oluklu gave him, in writing, instructions as to what he was to say. Commisso complied. He spoke to his father, who contacted police. At about 11.05, the money not having arrived, Commisso again telephoned his father to inquire of progress. Police arrived at the unit and arrested the applicant and Oluklu. Ghareeb and Maksoud had by then left the unit. They were arrested later. 
     
      
    14 The applicant has remained in custody since that date. 
     
      
       
      The proceedings on sentence 
       
      
    15 The proceedings against all four offenders were heard together. Each entered a plea of guilty to the same charge, of aggravated detention with intent to hold for ransom, and asked that the same two offences be taken into account. All except Oluklu gave evidence. Some called family members to give evidence. Each of the offenders who gave evidence was asked about the events of 22 June, and the circumstances of the offences. 
     
      
    16 In respect of each of Ghareeb, Maksoud and the applicant, the judge had the benefit of a comprehensive psychological report. He was therefore in possession of detailed material concerning both the objective circumstances of the offences, the role played by each of the participants (with the possible exception of Oluklu) and the subjective circumstances of each of the participants (again with the possible exception of Oluklu). 
     
      
    17 In his evidence, the applicant said that, not only did he use cocaine with Commisso and his three co-offenders on the evening of the offence, but that he also used amphetamines. He said that, prior to the demands being made of Commisso by Ghareeb and Maksoud, he had been unaware of any plan to make such demands, and had initially thought that what was happening was a joke. He went along with it because he anticipated receiving a share of the proceeds, although he did not know how much that would be. The applicant said in evidence that, when he travelled with Ghareeb and Commisso to the home unit, he believed that they were going to a strip club. His Honour appears to have accepted the applicant’s evidence. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    18 Evidence of the applicant’s subjective circumstances was put before Puckeridge DCJ by way of a pre-sentence report from the Probation and Parole Service (written by Mr Michael Single, and dated 1 November 2007), a report of Mr Watson-Munro, a consultant forensic psychologist, the evidence of the applicant and that of his brother. From that material the following emerges. 
     
      
    19 The applicant was born in November 1986. He was 19 years of age at the time of the offences. He had some, relatively insignificant, criminal history, consisting of three convictions for common assault, malicious damage to property, affray and fail to leave a registered club when requested by staff to do so. As these were all dealt with at the same time, in July 2005, I infer that they were part of a single episode. Despite the character of the offences, I say they appear to be relatively insignificant because the applicant was fined a total of $600, and placed on a good behaviour bond for 2 years. Later in 2005, he was convicted of failing or refusing to undergo a breath test and driving while suspended. Again, he was fined and subjected to a bond. 
     
      
    20 Mr Watson-Munro described the applicant as “co-operative though highly anxious …”. 
     
      
    21 The applicant was born in Australia, of Lebanese parents, the eighth of eleven children. At a very early age he was diagnosed with diabetes, for which he is insulin dependent. According to Mr Watson-Munro, he had been a professional footballer for a time, but his diabetic condition prevented him from continuing with that career. (It may be of some significance that this is not mentioned in the employment history recounted in the pre-sentence report.) He became depressed and began using cocaine. He does not appear to have worked since then. The two reports also give different accounts of his employment history: according to Mr Single he had acquired the necessary qualifications to work on construction sites, but had had minimal employment, a full time position for eight months and casual employment for six months. According to Mr Watson-Munro’s history, he had had a job with one of his brothers for about twelve months constructing spa pools. 
     
      
    22 The applicant made one attempt to overcome his drug addiction, by travelling to Lebanon, but this resulted in the transfer of addiction to cocaine to addiction to steroids. On his return to Australia he was met by Commisso, who supplied him with cocaine, which reactivated his addiction. 
     
      
    23 During his time in custody on remand, his father, also diabetic, died at the age of 50. The applicant was not permitted to leave the gaol to attend the funeral. He experiences significant feelings of guilt for the death.  
     
      
    24 Mr Watson-Munro reported (on 4 November 2007) that, since being in custody, he has detoxified and now has ambitions to re-enter the workforce. Mr Single reported that, since his incarceration, he had been charged with ten “institutional misconducts”, of which two were dismissed for lack of evidence. He said that the applicant had had contact with Psychology Services with respect to a “Behaviour Management Plan”, because of his conduct, but that his behaviour had improved sufficiently for him to be released from that Plan. 
     
      
    25 The applicant gave some evidence about the circumstances of his misbehaviour in prison, attributing it to his diabetes, and his emotional reaction to his father’s death. 
     
      
    26 Mr Watson-Munro considered that the applicant had symptoms of adjustment disorder. He is of limited intellectual capacity and Mr Watson-Munro considered him to be vulnerable to peer dynamics. Mr Watson-Munro thought that his expressions of regret over the offence were genuine. 
     
      
    27 The applicant’s brother gave evidence of a close family, supportive of the applicant, who were, until his arrest, unaware of his drug problem. (This last is a little difficult to reconcile with the applicant’s excursion to Lebanon in an attempt to escape drugs.) 
     
      
    28 The brother spoke of the difficulties experienced by the applicant with respect to his diabetes. 
     
      
    29 Also before the court was an affidavit of the applicant’s solicitor. He deposed that the applicant is spending his time in segregation, and is considered to be at great risk if returned to the general prison population. 
     
      
       
      The Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    30 Puckeridge DCJ sentenced all four offenders on the same day. He carefully assessed the relative participation of each, and their subjective and objective circumstances. He sentenced Ghareeb, Maksoud, and Oluklu identically, each to imprisonment for 6 ½ years, made up of a non-parole period of 3 ½ years and a balance of term of 3 years. Each of their sentences was reduced by reason of the pleas of guilty, from the notional starting point of a total sentence of 8 years – a little under 20%. He imposed the lesser sentence mentioned above on the applicant, of imprisonment for 6 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years. 
     
      
    31 Two factors that gave rise to the discrepancy were, it appears: 
     
      
    · that the applicant was the youngest of the four offenders. (Both Ghareeb and Maksoud were 26 years of age at the time of the offence; Oluklu, at 20, was only 3 months older than the applicant.) 
     
      
    · that the applicant “was in a lesser position in the detention of” Commisso. 
     
      
    32 His Honour took the view that the applicant’s role was, on the agreed facts, significantly less than that of the co-offenders. 
     
      
    33 Also relevant were the circumstances related in Mr Watson-Munro’s psychological report, and the applicant’s medical condition. His Honour accepted that the applicant did not know of any plan to detain Commisso until he went to the home unit, but became involved as the events there unfolded. 
     
      
    34 His Honour declared that, absent the applicant’s plea of guilty, he would have imposed a total sentence of 7 ½ years. By reason of the plea of guilty, he reduced this by 20%. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of the application 
       
      
    35 Two grounds are pleaded. They are: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in relation to the sentences imposed on his co-accused. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The sentence is manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
       
      Ground 2: Manifest excess? 
       
      
    36 It is convenient to deal with the second ground first. 
     
      
    37 In support of this ground, essentially two points were made. The first relied upon a 1979 decision of this Court, R v Collett & Robson (NSWCCA, unreported, 7 June 1979, per Roden J). In that case Roden J identified a number of circumstances relevant to the assessment of the objective gravity of a charge of detention. These were (I paraphrase): 
     
      
    · the duration of the detention; 
     
      
    · the extent of fear or terror occasioned, the manner of treatment and what is demanded of the victim by the captors; 
     
      
    · the purpose of the detention; 
     
      
    · the extent (if any) to which third parties were subjected to ordeal or anguish by reason of fear for the welfare of the victim. 
     
      
    38 I am unable to see that this list supports the ground argued on behalf of the applicant. In respect of each factor, the offence was one of considerable seriousness. The duration of the detention was twenty-four hours; Commisso was aware of the existence of a firearm (although his Honour was expressly unable to find that he was aware that it was, in fact loaded – that, to me, makes little difference. Commisso must have assumed that the pistol was loaded.) 
     
      
    39 The detention was for the purpose of securing to the offenders a large sum of money. Commisso’s father, at least, was aware of the detention and the threats that had been made. (In respect of this last matter, Puckeridge DCJ held, correctly, that the fact of Commisso senior’s drug dealing did not diminish the anguish.) 
     
      
    40 This Court was also referred to various findings of fact made by Puckeridge DCJ. These included: 
     
      
    · that Commisso went willingly to the premises; 
     
      
    · that Commisso provided cocaine to the offenders; 
     
      
    · that each of the offenders was heavily addicted to drugs; 
     
      
    · that the detention continued over twenty-four hours; 
     
      
    · that the pistol was loaded, but that there was insufficient evidence to infer that Commisso knew this. (I have already commented on this.) 
     
      
    41 This was, in my opinion, a serious offence with few, if any, redeeming features, or mitigating factors. Reference to the matters identified does not persuade me that the sentence imposed was in any way excessive. 
     
      
    42 The second matter raised on behalf of the applicant in support of this ground concerns sentencing statistics from the Judicial Commission of NSW. These showed that, of offences against s 86(2) committed in company, 82% of offenders were sentenced to full-time imprisonment. Of these, the sentences ranged from 18 months to 8 years. In only one case was 8 years imposed, the next highest being imprisonment for 6 years. That sentence was imposed in 28% of cases. The non-parole periods ranged from 12 months to 48 months. The statistics do not appear to relate to cases where pleas of guilty have been entered, and may well include convictions after trial – without any discount referable to a plea of guilty. A non-parole period of 3 years was in the top 24% of sentences. 
     
      
    43 These statistics would suggest that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was at the upper end of the range of sentences imposed in respect of offences against s 86(2) committed in company. But that, to my mind, is entirely fitting. The offence is also, with the features I have mentioned, at the upper end of offences of its kind. I am not persuaded that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Parity 
       
      
    44 By the second ground it was suggested that the applicant has (and is entitled to have) a justifiable sense of grievance when his sentence is considered in relation to those imposed upon the co-offenders. The argument was that the divergence between his culpability and that of the co-offenders warranted a more significant divergence in sentence than was allowed. 
     
      
    45 Relevant findings of the sentencing judge were said to be: 
     
      
    · that the applicant was not aware of the intention to demand money from Commisso when he travelled in the car with him and Oluklu to the home unit; 
     
      
    · that once at the home unit he consumed cocaine; 
     
      
    · that he played a lesser role than the others in the detention; 
     
      
    · that the applicant was vulnerable to peer group pressure and this may have influenced him in his participation; 
     
      
    · that the applicant was heavily influenced by drug taking and had consumed amphetamines and cocaine at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    46 Reference was also made to the subjective circumstances advanced on behalf of the applicant. 
     
      
    47 I do not accept that the applicant’s use of cocaine or of amphetamines, in any way diminishes the seriousness of this offence; in any case, with respect to this parity argument, the use of cocaine applied to all offenders. It does not differentiate the applicant from the co-offenders. The different assessment of his participation is, however, in a different category; and does (and did) warrant a degree of amelioration of the sentence. So also did his age (in contrast with Ghareeb and Maksoud, at least), and his vulnerability. 
     
      
    48 Moreover, all co-offenders had more extensive criminal records than the applicant (although these are not recorded in any detail in the Remarks on Sentence) and both Maksoud and Oluklu were on parole at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    49 No mention was made by his Honour of the circumstances in which the applicant is serving his period of imprisonment (in segregation). Although it is not clear, there is no reason to conclude that any of the other co-offenders is similarly serving his term. 
     
      
    50 In all of the circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that the applicant ought to have been sentenced in a way that gave greater recognition to the important differences between his case and those of Maksoud and Oluklu. I refer in particular to the age difference (the applicant’s relative youth), to the fact that he was not involved until the last minute and had no part in the planning or preparation, and the very important circumstance that the offences of those two offenders were seriously aggravated by having been committed while they were on parole. 
     
      
    51 It is therefore necessary to re-sentence. Against that possibility, this Court received additional evidence, that, in effect, updated the applicant’s personal circumstances. That material really does no more than confirm that the subjective case is much as was put before the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    52 It is not necessary to interfere with the balance of term. I would reduce the non-parole period by 6 months. 
     
      
    53 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      leave to appeal granted; 
       
       
      sentence imposed in the District Court quashed; in lieu thereof, the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, to commence on 23 June 2006 and expire on 22 December 2008, and a balance of term of 3 years, expiring on 22 December 2011.  
       
       
      The applicant is entitled to immediate consideration for release on parole. I note that, although the applicant was sentenced on 11 July 2008, the notice of application for leave to appeal is dated 31 October 2008, and was received in the Registry on 13 November 2008. The application was heard on 17 March 2009.

    3 HOWIE J: The appellant was tried before a jury in relation to sexual assault offences allegedly committed against four complainants. Each of the women had been separately assaulted in bushland in suburban Sydney on different occasions between 3 January 2006 and 17 January 2007. The only issue at the trial was whether the appellant was the person responsible for the assaults against all or any of the complainants. 
     
      
    4 The appellant was convicted by the jury of all the offences on the indictment and sentenced to a total term of imprisonment for 10 years with an overall minimum period of custody of 8 years. The appellant has appealed against his convictions and the Crown has appealed against the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    5 In respect of the last series of offences, those committed against the complainant JG on 17 January 2007 (“the JG offences”), the substantial, if not only, evidence against the appellant was that which the Crown relied upon as either tendency or coincidence evidence arising from the other counts on the indictment. In other words, before the appellant could be convicted of the JG offences, the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had committed offences involving one or more of the other complainants and then reason that, because he committed those offences, he was the person who committed the JG offences. Whether there was any evidence to support that reasoning other than the similarity of the attacks upon one or more of the complainants was a matter of some contention on the hearing of the appeal. 
     
      
    6 Ultimately it was argued on behalf of the appellant that there was insufficient evidence upon which the jury could safely engage in the reasoning relied upon by the Crown in respect of the JG offences. This was either because the evidence was not sufficiently cogent to support tendency or coincidence reasoning or its probative value as such was outweighed by unfair prejudice arising from the admission of the evidence of the other complainants so that it should have been rejected under s 101 of the Evidence Act. There was also complaint about the reasons given by the trial judge (Puckeridge DCJ) in admitting the evidence and in the directions given to the jury about how they should use it. 
     
      
    7 The appellant contends that there should be a verdict of acquittal entered by this Court in respect of the counts in the indictment relating to JG and an order for retrial in respect of the other counts. 
     
      
       
      Crown Case 
       
       ( 
      A) Complainant LW: Counts 1 and 2 
      
    8 At about 7 am on 3 January 2006 LW was walking along a track near the Great Western Highway at Emu Plains. This was bushland leading to Knapsack Bridge. A man rode past her on a black racer bike. She said hello but the man did not reply. She kept walking. She had gone another 100 metres when the man grabbed her shoulders from behind. There was a struggle and the man threw her to the ground by grabbing her bra strap. Her singlet top tore. She kicked at him and warned him that other persons walked along the path. 
     
      
    9 She got to her feet and the man said, “Show me your tits”. She refused and he threw her to the ground again (Count 1). He told her that, if she showed them to him, he would let her leave. She said she would if he allowed her to stand up. She got to her feet and lifted her top and bra. The man said, ”Let me touch them” and touched her right breast (Count 2). She unsuccessfully tried to kick him. The man moved away saying, “It wasn’t worth it anyway, keep running”. He then left. 
     
      
    10 LW said that her attacker was about 170 cm tall, tanned and without body hair. She told police he was about 25 years old, muscular and with an Australian accent. He was wearing a red and yellow bike top and black tights with straps over his shoulders like a weightlifter. He was wearing a white helmet and sunglasses. 
     
      
       
        
        (B) Complainant BP: Count 3 
        
       
      
    11 At about 6am on 18 February 2006 BP was walking on a path between the Great Western Highway and Warrimoo Railway Station heading toward the station. She heard the sound of a bike behind her and moved to the side to let it past. A man ran in front of her blocking her path. 
     
      
    12 The man said, “Show me your tits”. She tried unsuccessfully to pass him. She asked him to let her past. He said, “Show me your tits, you can still catch your train, I won’t hurt you”. She screamed. The man grabbed her shoulder and said, “Shut up or I’ll slap you”. The man told her. “Show me your tits, you can still catch your train. Just do it now. No-one can hear you.” He then pulled down her purple top and bra. He moved his face toward her breasts and looked at each one. He then ran off. 
     
      
    13 She said the man was Caucasian and appeared Australian. He was in his late 20’s with a fair complexion, average build and a goatee. He was wearing a bicycle helmet, wrap-around sunglasses, a lycra blue and yellow t-shirt and lycra blue and yellow cycling shorts. He was about 179cm. 
     
      
    14 On 23 February 2007 BP was shown a photo array with number 13 being the appellant. She was unable to recognise any person. 
     
      
    15 A man named Harris who was walking his dog observed the incident. Harris described the man as Caucasian, tall and thin in a white or pale short-sleeved top. He said that the man looked quite young. 
     
      
       
        
        (C) Complainant MO’D: Counts 4, 5 and 6. 
        
       
      
    16 About 10am on 19 December 2006 MO’D went for a run on a track in Lane Cove National Park in bushland heading towards Brown’s Waterhole. She saw a man sitting on the ground next to his bike. They exchanged greetings and she kept jogging. About 10 to 15 minutes later she again saw the man standing next to his bike across the path. She slowed down and he asked for the time. It was 10.45. 
     
      
    17 The man said, “Show me your tits.” She refused and tried to pass him but he stepped in her path. He again asked to see her “tits”. Again she refused and he threatened to throw her off the bridge they were standing on. He approached and she moved back. He stumbled and approached her again saying, aggressively, “Don’t do that again, it’ll just cause you more problems”. The complainant kicked him and ran off but he cut her off. She started screaming and he said,” Shut up, someone might hear you. If someone comes then I’m going to have to hurt both of you”. 
     
      
    18 The complainant told him that she did not want to be raped. He said, “I’m not going to rape you, just show me your tits”. She lifted her top revealing a crop-top covering her bra. He said, “Is that all?” When she did nothing to reveal any more, he punched her to the stomach. She fell to the ground onto her back, causing scratches to her legs, back and stomach. (Count 4) While she lay on the ground screaming, he came over and put his hands under her clothing, touching her breasts. (Count 5) He told her to shut up and said, “All right, now show me your cunt”. She screamed louder and held her legs together. He told her to shut up and then put his hand over her mouth. (Count 6) He then removed his hand and said, “Oh, you’re not worth it bitch”. He went back to his bike and she started to run. When she looked at her watch it was 10.51. 
     
      
    19 She described the man as late 20s, probably more into his 30s. He was wearing a riding helmet, grey or black, and sunglasses. She was not sure of his nationality but did not think he was Caucasian but sounded Australian. He was not blonde and had olive/yellowish skin. He was about 6 feet, stockier with a squarer jaw. He was wearing a red t-shirt and dark shorts. His bike was dark perhaps a mountain bike. She was shown a photo array including a photo of the appellant and chose a photo of another person. The person in the photograph could not have been the attacker as he was working in Port Kembla. DNA evidence from the complainant’s top matched that of the appellant. 
     
      
       
        
        (D) Complainant JG: Counts 7 to 11 
        
       
      
    20 At about 9am on 17 January 2007 JG was jogging in Marsfied on a track leading to Brown’s Waterhole when she saw a man jogging toward her. She saw him again about half an hour later. He asked her where she was going, and then said, “Lift up your top”. He was blocking her way. She asked him why and he said that he wanted to take her photograph. She tried to run away and he told her not to. She started screaming and he told her to stop as there was no one around. 
     
      
    21 He took out an object that she thought was a mobile phone, “a black shiny thing” with a silver strip along the edge and a rectangular shape. He told her to lift her top or “I’ll punch you in the stomach”. He said “Just lift it up. Do you want me to tear it off and you’ll walk half naked?” She lifted her top and he held the mobile phone in front of her breasts. She turned her face away to avoid being photographed. 
     
      
    22 He then told her pull down her shorts. She removed her shorts and underwear. He told her to turn around and bend over. She complied and he started to rub the lips of her vagina with his fingers. (Count 7). He then inserted his penis into her anus. (Count 8) It was painful and she told him he was hurting her. He said, “Would you rather suck my cock?” He withdrew his penis and turned her to face him. She started to kneel but he told her to stand. She put her mouth on his penis. (Count 9) 
     
      
    23 He took his penis out of her mouth and turned her around. He told her to lift up her leg but she did not. He then inserted his penis into her anus again. (Count 10) He then withdrew his penis and turned her to face him. She was on her knees and he grabbed her on the shoulder and pushed his penis deep into her mouth. She tried to pull back but he kept hold of her head. (Count 11) She managed to move her head and spat. She asked if he was finished and he asked whether she was going to report him to the police. She said, “What’s the point, I don’t know anything about you.” She then turned to dress and he jogged away. 
     
      
    24 JG described her attacker as about 30-35 years old, 175-180 cm tall, very strongly built with olive or tanned skin with pronounced jaw and stubble. He was wearing a casual cream shirt and beige shorts. The complainant was shown a photo array on 15 February 2007. She selected a photo that was not the appellant but was the same photo as chosen by M O’D. DNA evidence did not implicate the appellant. 
     
      
    25 According to police investigations the appellant was working at Belrose on 17 January 2007 between 12.12pm and 8.01pm. 
     
      
       
        
        Evidence relating to the appellant 
        
       
      
    26 On 22 January 2007 two police officers were walking along the track towards Brown’s Waterhole. They saw the appellant sitting next to a bike using a mobile phone. They saw him again later and spoke to him. They asked where he worked and he said, “Work, I’m a storeman at Frenchs Forest”. He was Caucasian, 175cm tall with sold build and was very tanned. He was wearing lycra biking clothing. He had a pair of sunglasses in his backpack. 
     
      
    27 The appellant was a member of the Penrith Triathlon Club. He used to wear lycra cycling clothing. He had two bike helmets. A search of his unit located various items of lycra cycling clothing and two bikes one without wheels. On 22 January he gave his girlfriend a black Nokia mobile phone after she had lost hers. He was generally clean-shaven although occasionally he had a couple of days stubble. 
     
      
       
      Conversations with police 
      
    28 On 6 February police spoke to the appellant in Lane Cove National Park. He was wearing lycra cycling clothing and sunglasses. He had tanned skin and an olive complexion. He had stubble. He said he went there once a week. He started work at 1 pm in Belrose. On 9 February the appellant was arrested for an offence against MO’D. He was told that police were investigating an indecent assault on 19 December 2006 and a sexual assault on 17 January. He refused to be interviewed. 
     
      
    29 Later he was told police were investigating an indecent assault on 19 December 2006 at Lane Cove and an indecent assault on 3 January 2006 at Emu Plains. He said, “What the fuck!” He shook his head when asked if he wanted to be interviewed regarding an indecent assault on 18 February 2006 at Warrimoo. When asked if he wanted to be interviewed about a sexual assault on 17 January 2007, he said, “No fucking hell”. He was charged with offences arising from incidents on 19 December and 17 January. 
     
      
    30 After being told that his DNA matched that found on the victim of the assault on 19 December, the appellant said, “I think you and me should have a talk”. He told the police that he did not want to be recorded on tape. He said that he wanted his girlfriend, Rebecca, present as he had been with her for 8 years. As it was early in the morning, police said they would talk after they had all had a sleep. The appellant said, “When we talk either tonight or tomorrow, how much can you do, how far can you go?” He was asked what he meant and he replied, “You know, where we can talk. When can we do this on the tapes?” The appellant agreed to speak with police the next morning at Parramatta when Rebecca was present. 
     
      
    31 However the appellant then made the following statements: 
     
      
       
        
        “They were split decisions I made, they were wrong. They were split-second decisions. I have issues, you know, I have anger issues. They were wrong. I shouldn't have, I know it was wrong“. 
         
         
        “Warrimoo. That's good. You caught my attention with that. That's good. That's real good. Two guys in suits that caught my attention, but when you mentioned Warrimoo that was good. I knew that you have been doing your work on me. Warrimoo I can tell you about waiting on the path sitting on a seat on a path near the road. I can tell you, you got my attention with that, the search warrant now that was a good move. I knew you guys were serious”. 
         
         
        “These issues, these issues with Rebecca that's the problem. These issues with Rebecca led to these attacks. Relationships. I have problems and that's what happens. These issues are the problem”. 
         
         
        “Whenever this happens I want Rebecca here. She knows, I told her and she knows. I want Rebecca sitting right here when we do this. If not tonight then tomorrow or whenever. When we do this I want Rebecca to be here. This will take time. When we do the interview it will be long. I can tell you time, dates and places. We will have plenty of breaks and it will be long. We can't do it tonight, it's too late. I need Rebecca here…. Rebecca has the phone. I gave her the phone…..the phone you asked me for. I gave it to her because she needed a phone and she has it” 
         
         
        “I can tell you about the footpath sitting there beside the road at Warrimoo, the clothes I was wearing. The interview will take all day. We'll need heaps of time. I need some form of help. I have anger problems. This has happened when me and Rebecca have had dramas…. I mean I can tell what happened and the dates and stuff but you might need help with it. I mean I have trouble in the order. I remember it all, but I get the order wrong, so I don't know if you guys can handle it or you'll need help”. 
         
        
       
      
    32 The next morning at Parramatta the appellant spoke to Rebecca and then refused to be interviewed. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
        
        The appellant’s case 
        
       
      
    33 The appellant gave evidence that from June 2006 he was working in Belrose and he rode his bike there from Wentworthville every working day. He had driven only twice when it was raining. He worked from midday to 8pm. He arrived at about 11.15am. He denied driving to work on 17 January 2007 when JG was attacked. 
     
      
    34 He disputed much of the evidence given by police including meeting officers on the path at Terry’s Creek on 22 January. He said he met them at the access gate at the M2. He used to take a break there and often used his phone. He denied entering the park there and had never been to Brown’s Waterhole. He could not explain how his DNA came to be on the clothing of M O’D or LW. 
     
      
    35 He denied ever having been to Warrimoo and did not know where it was. He denied the evidence given by police as to his statements about Warrimoo. He said he refused to be interviewed although he requested to see Rebecca. He only spoke to police in an attempt to obtain bail. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
        
         
          
        Ground 1. His Honour erred in refusing to sever counts 7 to 11 from the indictment 
         
         
         Ground 2. His Honour erred in admitting the evidence of the offences contained in counts 1 to 6 as tendency evidence in the trials of counts 7 to 11. 
         
         
         Ground 3. His Honour failed to give adequate reasons for his rulings in relation to refusing to sever counts 7 to 11 and for admitting the evidence of the offences contained in counts 1 to 6 as tendency evidence in the trials of counts 7 to 11. 
        
       
      
    36 These grounds were argued together. The complaint is that the trial judge should not have permitted a trial of counts 7 to 11, the counts relating to JG, jointly with counts 1 to 6, the counts relating to the other three complainants. The appellant argues that the jury could not use any evidence relevant to counts 1 to 6 to determine that he committed the assaults upon JG. He contends there was no evidence fit to be used by the jury of any tendency arising from the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offences in counts 1 to 6 that could identify the person responsible for those offences as also responsible for the offences in counts 7 to 11. 
     
      
    37 The Crown served on the appellant notices under ss 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act dated 16 October 2007. The notices specified that the appellant had a tendency “to act in a particular way, namely sexually or indecently assault females at early times in the day in a secluded bush track locations in the manner set out below”. There were then set out a number of columns. In the first labelled “similarity/tendency” a number of attributes of the attacker or the attacks, such as “Demand to lift top” or “Offender described as having tanned skin”. There were then columns labelled with the name of each of the complainants under which was a reference to the statement of the complainant in which the attribute was to be found. If the attribute did not apply to a particular complainant, there was “N/A” written in the complainant column against the particular attribute.  
     
      
    38 The appellant sought to have four separate trials, one in relation to each of the complainants. A hearing was held before the trial judge in what was described as a voir dire on 27 February 2008. The Crown tendered written submissions that included the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Tendency Evidence 
         
         
        11. The Crown seeks to adduce evidence of a tendency of the accused to act in a particular way and to have a particular state of mind, namely: 
         
        
       
      
    · to frequent secluded bushland locations where vulnerable females (because they were alone) might be expected to be present;· to verbally and/or physically threaten such females in order to get them to comply with his demands;· to have a particular interest in their breasts;· to sexually assault them against their will; and· to do so knowing they were not consenting or willing participants. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    39 On that date the trial judge indicated that he would allow a trial of all eleven counts on the indictment to proceed. The reasons were brief and in effect simply stated that the evidence had, in the words of the relevant sections, “significant probative value” and that “the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect on the accused”.  
     
      
    40 On 5 March 2008 the Judge delivered a further judgment that dealt with a number of issues including the admissibility of the admissions allegedly made by the appellant to police. In relation to the tendency evidence his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        All four of the complainants are expected to give evidence, which can be summarised as follows: 
         
         
          
          (i) each victim was jogging or walking. 
           
           
          (ii) it occurred early to mid-morning on a weekday, 
           
           
          (iii) similar initial greetings, 
           
           
          (iv) the offences occurred in a recreational reserve/park, 
           
           
          (v) the offender demanded of one of the victims to lift her top and demanded three of the victims to ""show me your tits"", 
           
           
          (vi) threats of violence and actual punches to certain of the complainants, 
           
           
          (vii) the offender at the time of the alleged offence for counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the proposed indictment said to be wearing a bike helmet and sunglasses. 
          
         
        
       
       
       
      
    41 Later his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The Crown has submitted that the evidence referred to in the notice pursuant to section 97 show a tendency on the part of the offender to ride a bicycle in bushland reserve and to accost young women walking in the reserve and demand of such women by use of threats that they expose their breasts in his presence. In relation to the counts 7 to 11, the Crown also submits that the evidence sought to be adduced would show a tendency on the part of the offender to have a fixation with breasts. 
         
         
        It is further submitted by the Crown that the modus operandi of the offender could show that it was the same offender and the same person who had the same tendency to act in the same manner or a similar manner. 
        
       
      
    42 And later still: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I was concerned that counts 7 to 11 of the proposed indictment concerned a victim who was not accosted by a person wearing a bike helmet or sunglasses. However, the description given by the victim [JG] was not dissimilar to the broad description by other victims and the offence took place in the same area where the victim [M O’D] was assaulted; not in the exact same area but the same locale. Although the same demand was not made of the victim [JG] as was made of the other three complainants, she was asked to lift her top and the offender stated he wanted that to occur in order to photograph her breasts. I accept the submission made by the Crown that the circumstances of the sexual assaults on [JG] commencing in the manner in which they occurred showed a tendency on the part of the offender to have some obsessive fixation with breasts. 
         
         
        In my ruling of 27 February 2008 I stated that I considered the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect on the accused. The accused has submitted that the jury might unfairly use the evidence of tendency to wrongly identify the accused as the offender. I consider that warnings will be required to be given to the jury that whilst the tendency evidence might be relevant as to whether it was the same offender who committed the offences, that, of itself, would not identify the accused as the offender. The danger generally as to identification would have to be emphasised to the jury. Such directions would, I consider, diminish any prejudicial effect of the evidence and as I stated in my ruling of 27 February 2008 the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused. 
        
       
      
    43 As the issue was ultimately dealt with at the trial the only basis upon which the evidence relevant to counts 1 to 6 became admissible on counts 7 to 11 was by tendency reasoning. Tendency evidence is admissible only if it complies with s 97 of the Evidence Act. That section, as at the time of the trial, was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        97 The tendency rule  
         
         
        (1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if:  
         
          
          (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, or  
           
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.  
          
         
         
        (2) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:  
         
          
          (a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or  
           
          (b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.  
          
         
        
       
      
    44 The other provision dealing with the admissibility of tendency evidence is s 101 of the Evidence Act. That section was relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution  
         
         
        (1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98. 
         
         
        (2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. 
         
        
       
      
    45 It is unnecessary to consider in any detail the application of s 97 to evidence tendered by the Crown as evidence of tendency. The section was subject to considerable analysis by Simpson J in R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338. There her Honour wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [33] It is also useful to articulate the exercises involved in a decision to admit or reject evidence tendered as tendency evidence under s 97(1). Some precision in that analysis, also, is required. It is necessary to bear in mind: — 
         
          
           
          (i) the actual probative value to be ascribed to a particular piece of evidence is committed to the tribunal of fact (in this case, the jury); 
           
          (ii) even where the judge is the tribunal of fact, it is not ordinarily possible finally to determine the actual probative value of any piece of evidence until the evidence in the case is complete. This is explicitly recognised in s 97(1)(b), which envisages that the evaluation of the probative value of the evidence in question is to be made having regard to other evidence “to be adduced”, and implicitly by the use of the subjunctive “would not” in s 97(1)(b). 
           
          (iii) whether a particular piece of evidence is capable of being ascribed probative value is to be determined by the trial judge; this is to be done by reference to the test prescribed in the definition of “probative value” contained in the Dictionary and involves an assessment of the extent to which that evidence could rationally affect (ie is capable of rationally affecting) the probability of the existence of a fact in issue; 
           
          (iv) the task that a trial judge undertakes under s 97(1) involves a two-step process: firstly, the assessment of the extent to which the evidence in question has the capacity rationally to affect the probability of the existence of a fact in issue; and, secondly, (where the judge concludes that the evidence has that capacity) an assessment and prediction of the probative value that the jury might ascribe to the evidence. The evidence is not to be admitted if the judge concludes that the evidence, either alone or in conjunction with other evidence already adduced or to be adduced, would not have significant probative value, ie if the judge concludes that the jury would not regard the evidence as having probative value, and to a significant degree (in the sense explained by Hunt CJ at CL in Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457). If the determination is that, notwithstanding that the evidence would have probative value, its probative value would not be significant, then the evidence is not admissible. 
          
         
         
        [34] I have not, to this point, said anything about the identification of the “fact in issue”, the probability of the existence of which is said to be affected by the evidence under consideration. In some cases precise identification of that fact, or those facts, might be critical to the process. In this case, no attention was paid to that identification. It must be assumed that the fact (or facts) in issue to which the evidence was directed was (or were) whether the appellant had, on each or any occasion, conducted himself as alleged by the complainant. 
         
         
        [35] Two things emerge from the above. One is that the s 97(1) exercise is predictive and evaluative, and is not a scientific exercise with a clear or rigid answer, or with only one correct answer — reasonable minds will, on occasions, arrive at different results following the evaluative and predictive exercise. The other is that, where evidence “to be adduced” is relevant to the exercise, the exercise must be undertaken on the assumption that that evidence will be given substantially as anticipated. 
         
        
       
      
    46 The applicant relied upon her Honour’s judgment to support an argument that it is not sufficient under s 97 that the trial judge simply determines that the evidence has sufficient probative value to meet the test in the section, but also should make a determination of the full extent of its probative value at that point. But it is unnecessary to determine whether the judge at the s 97 admissibility stage must determine the full weight to which a jury might give to tendency evidence because under s 101(2) a weighing process must be undertaken of the probative value of the evidence as against its prejudicial effect upon the accused. That will require the judge to assess both aspects of the evidence that have to be weighed in the balance; the probative value that a jury might assign to it as against the potential of the fact that the jury might misuse the evidence in a way for which it was not admitted. 
     
      
    47 The test to be applied under s 101(2) was considered in R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700. Although counsel for the appellant sought to rely upon decisions of the High Court under the common law, including Pfenning v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461, in support of his arguments as to the admissibility of the evidence in the present case, it is unnecessary for the resolution of the appeal to consider those decisions in any detail. They are now merely the application of common law principles to particular factual situations, although they may provide guidance to the type of prejudice that may arise if such evidence were admitted. The Court in Pfenning was, and the provisions of s 101 are, concerned with resolving the dilemma that arises when a court is faced with the admission of probative evidence that is highly prejudicial. In Ellis this Court determined that the test in s 101(2) was generally to be applied in resolving that dilemma rather than the common law test expounded in Pfenning. 
     
      
    48 However, there was a recognition in the judgment of the Chief Justice in Ellis that there might be cases where, in the words of the headnote, “on the facts, it would not be open to conclude that the statutory test for admissibility is satisfied unless the common law test is also satisfied”. The applicant contended that this was such a case, so prejudicial was the evidence and so slight its probative value. It was argued that the evidence ought not to have been admitted by the trial judge unless he were satisfied, applying the test in Pfenning, that there was no other rational explanation for the tendency evidence other than that the applicant was guilty of the offences in counts 7 to 11. That of course was not the test the trial judge applied. 
     
      
       
        
        The trial judge’s reasons 
        
       
      
    49 Simpson J pointed out in the passage quoted above that, as the trial judge is to undertake an evaluative assessment of the probative value of the evidence, minds might reasonably differ as to the outcome of that assessment. The same has been said of the application of s 137 of the Act. Both in respect of a determination made under s 101(2) and a determination made under s 137 a review of that determination by this Court can only be performed in accordance with the principles laid down in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. 
     
      
    50 The applicant contends under Ground 3 above that the Judge failed to give sufficient reasons for determining to admit the evidence. Even if that assertion were made out, it would not have the effect of rendering the decision to admit the evidence nugatory. However, the reasons given by the trial judge may disclose error in the exercise of the discretionary judgment to admit the evidence under the House principles or the failure to give adequate reasons may mean that this Court could not rely upon the judge’s determination and would have to reach its own conclusion as to whether the evidence ought to have been admitted. 
     
      
    51 With respect, it must be said that the reasons given for admitting the evidence are significantly less than satisfactory. It seems to me that his Honour never really came to grips with the real issue involved in the prejudicial nature of the evidence. Nor did he analyse to any degree the nature of the tendency evidence being relied upon by the Crown. The first judgment merely repeated the phrases used in the relevant sections without the Judge indicating in any way how the evidence satisfied the tests of admissibility to which he referred. 
     
      
    52 In the second judgment the Judge considered the significance of the tendency evidence and its prejudicial effect but not in any great depth. His Honour identified the prejudicial nature of the evidence as being that the jury might use it “to wrongfully identify the accused as the offender” in counts 7 to 11. On a very superficial level that is so but it is the reason for the possibility of a wrongful identification that is important. The real danger was that the jury may incorrectly reason that, because the offender committed one or more of the offences in counts 1 to 6, he also committed the offences in counts 7 to 11 simply because he had a propensity to attack women on secluded paths or had some other propensity of a general nature that was insufficient by itself to sustain a conviction for the JG offences. 
     
      
    53 The Judge saw the means of overcoming the prejudice he identified by two directions he would give the jury. The first was to direct the jury that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “……while the tendency evidence might be relevant as to whether it was the same offender who committed the offences, that, of itself, would not identify the accused as the offender”. 
        
       
       
      The second was to give the jury directions warning them of the danger of identification evidence. 
       
      
    54 The first direction would not focus attention on the real prejudice of the evidence, that is that the jury might misuse it as general propensity evidence without considering whether the tendency for which it was admitted, that is “a tendency on the part of the offender to have some obsessive fixation with breasts”, either arose on the evidence or, if it did, was sufficient, by itself or when taken with other evidence, to identify the applicant as the offender. 
     
      
    55 Ultimately it was a circumstantial case against the applicant in relation to the counts against JG, subject to what the jury might make of the admissions allegedly made by the applicant. That is a matter to which I shall return shortly. But the jury would have to be satisfied that there was no reasonable possibility that it was some person other than the applicant who attacked JG. Unless the Judge determined what other evidence there was, if any, that the prosecution could rely upon to identify the appellant as the attacker of JG and the probative value of that evidence, it was no answer to the prejudice arising from the admission of the evidence that the tendency evidence was not itself sufficient to give rise to a conviction on counts 7 to 11. If the other evidence had little probative value by itself, then the likelihood was that the prejudicial aspect of the tendency evidence would still outweigh the combined probative value of the tendency evidence and the other evidence in the prosecution case. 
     
      
    56 The second direction was of little, if any, relevance. Presumably his Honour had in mind the directions required to be given in a case of identification evidence, where the evidence is visual or aural identification. The Evidence Act says nothing about identification by means such as the use of coincidence or tendency reasoning or by circumstantial evidence generally. Nor does the common law. The courts have not developed any special knowledge about such identification evidence about which a jury needs to be warned under s 165 of the Evidence Act or otherwise. In the present case the only danger that arose in the identification of the applicant as the offender was the danger in the use of the tendency evidence. A general direction about the danger of identification evidence would be more likely to confuse the jury than assist in overcoming the prejudice arising from the admission of the tendency evidence. 
     
      
    57 Further, the trial judge never attempted to determine the probative value of the evidence other than to the degree it was necessary to pass through the s 97 gate of admissibility. Unless he performed this task he could never properly carry out the weighing exercise required under s 101(2). But in any event, as I have indicated, his reasons reveal that he failed to address the real issue involved in the determination of whether the evidence should be admitted. Further, in deciding that he could ameliorate any prejudicial effect of the evidence, the Judge took into account an irrelevant consideration, being the effect of a direction or warning in relation to the danger of identification evidence. 
     
      
    58 The Judge’s determination to admit the evidence, as disclosed by his reasons, was erroneous. In order to determine whether a miscarriage of justice arose, this Court must consider for itself whether the evidence in relation to counts 1 to 6 ought to have been admitted in respect of counts 7 to 11. 
     
      
       
        
        Admissibility of the tendency evidence 
        
       
      
    59 The Crown points out, rightly, that the admissibility of tendency evidence cannot be considered in a vacuum. The decision whether to admit the evidence must be considered in light of the other evidence relied upon by the Crown to prove that the accused was the person who attacked JG. If the tendency identified stood alone in identifying the appellant as the offender in the JG offences, it would have to be sufficiently peculiar or singular to amount to what has been described as a “hallmark” or “signature” of the appellant such that it would offend common sense to exclude it. 
     
      
    60 But one of the difficulties in the present case is appreciating exactly what was the tendency being relied upon by the Crown as distinct from the general circumstances in which the tendency was displayed. As Simpson J noted in R v Nassif [2004] NSWCCA 433 at [51] “the more numerous the claims of tendency evidence, and the more specific, the stronger the probative value. And thus the more likely the admission of the evidence”. But, of course, the converse is true. The more general the tendency relied upon, the less likely is it to have sufficient probative value to outweigh the prejudicial effect arising from propensity evidence generally. 
     
      
    61 In the trial judge’s judgment, quoted above, the tendency was described as “to have some obsessive fixation with breasts”. Yet the Crown’s description of the tendency in its written submissions on the voir dire hearing on the admissibility of the evidence had a number of attributes being: to frequent secluded bushland locations where vulnerable females might be located; to verbally and or physically threaten such females to get them to comply with his demands; to have a particular interests in their breasts; to sexually assault them against their will; and to do so knowing they were not consenting or willing to participate. 
     
      
    62 In my opinion, the tendency evidence obtains no more probative value simply by adding general factors to describe the tendency that have by themselves little significance. The result may be simply to distract a jury from that task of determining whether there is a tendency that has been proved from one set of facts, here from the evidence led on counts 1 to 6, and is present in another set of facts, here in the evidence to support counts 7 to 11. Much of the Crown’s description of the tendency was surplusage; it identified four attributes that were in truth only one, if the attribute was compendiously described.  
     
      
    63 Stripped to its fundamental elements, the Crown was alleging a tendency to sexual assault females in secluded locations with a particular interest in their breasts. The Crown was driven to generalise the tendency because of the difficulty of finding a specific tendency from the evidence in counts 1 to 6 that could be applied in counts 7 to 11. The evidence to prove the appellant committed the offences in counts 1 to 6 was coincidence evidence. The facts giving rise to the coincidence were: a man of 20 to 30 with athletic build and tanned skin dressed in cycling clothing with helmet and dark glasses and a bike accosted lone women on isolated bush tracks and asked them, “Show me your tits” before attempting to sexually assault them by the use of threats or force. 
     
      
    64 However, the Crown could not rely upon coincidence evidence arising from counts 1 to 6 to prove counts 7 to 11 because there was none: the facts of the attacks upon JG were insufficiently similar to those surrounding the attacks upon the other three complaints. For example, the Crown could not rely upon the offender being dressed in cycling attire including helmet and sunglasses, and with a bike. Nor could it rely upon the type of the sexual assaults committed or the nature of the threats made or the words used. But in generalising a tendency derived from counts 1 to 6 to try to make it apply to counts 7 to 11 the probative value of the evidence was very significantly reduced. 
     
      
    65 A tendency to sexually assault females in secluded locations could not in my opinion have “significant probative value” to justify admission under s 97, even accepting that the gateway through that section is not particularly demanding. There is nothing peculiar about such a tendency that would identify a person with such a tendency as the offender against JG putting aside any other evidence of a persuasive nature to identify that offender. It would be more peculiar and, therefore, of significantly greater probative value, if the offender had a tendency to sexually assault females in the presence of members of the public. The addition of “bushland” to the “secluded location” in the description of the tendency was to my mind of no particular significance. 
     
      
    66 In my opinion the tendency did not gain significant probative value by the additional fact that the offender also had an interest in the victim’s breasts, however that interest might be described. I do not find it peculiar and, hence of any particularly significant probative value, that a person who has a tendency to sexually assault females has a particular interest in what is the most prominent part of the female anatomy. 
     
      
    67 I might have been prepared to accept that the use of the words, “Show us your tits” as the opening gambit by the offender in each of the four assaults would have given rise to a tendency with sufficient specificity or peculiarity that it could survive the application of s 101(2). But the Crown was in a difficult position because the interest in breasts had to be generalised as there was no significant similarity in how that interest was demonstrated between counts 1 to 6, on the one hand, and counts 7 to 11, on the other. 
     
      
    68 In my opinion the tendency relied upon by the Crown, when stripped to its essence, could not meet the test in s 97. But, in any event, if that were the only evidence upon which the Crown could rely to prove that the appellant was the offender in the JG assaults, it would fail the application of s 101(2). The major difficulty for the Crown was that there was little to connect the JG offences with those committed against the other complainants. The singular fact of the offender in the earlier matters being dressed in cycling apparel and accompanied by a bike was absent, a matter which obviously concerned the trial judge. 
     
      
    69 The prejudicial effect of the tendency evidence was clearly very high. Even though it was insufficient itself to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was the same offender who attacked JG has attacked the other complainants, it was consistent with a characteristic displayed by the offender in the attacks upon the four complainants in a vague, general sense. There was a very real risk that a jury would give the evidence of such a tendency more weight than it deserved by finding that the kind of person who committed one or more of counts 1 to 6 was also the kind of person who committed counts 7 to 11 and for that reason convict the appellant. 
     
      
    70 The evidence was so prejudicial that I doubt that it could have been made admissible even had there been other reliable evidence to suggest that it was the appellant who attacked JG. That is because I do not believe that the evidence had any more probative value than evidence of an offender’s criminal record that showed he had committed similar offences in the past. However, the tendency evidence, such as it was, should be considered against other evidence that the appellant committed the JG offences. 
     
      
       
       
       
        
        Other evidence including the admissions 
        
       
      
    71 There was a similarity in the description of the offender given by JG and that of the appellant. However, it should be noted that JG did not identify the photograph of the appellant but picked a photograph of a person who had been identified by M O’D and yet could not have been the attacker in either case. It should be noted that despite the offender having intercourse with JG there was no DNA evidence connecting the applicant with JG. 
     
      
    72 There was evidence that the appellant had been seen in the general vicinity of the attack upon JG by police after that attack, on 22 January, and the jury found he was the person who attacked M O’D in the same locality. He was also seen and spoken to by police in the Lane Cove National Park on 6 February. He was working in Belrose on the date of the attack upon JG according to police. Of course on both occasions when police had seen him and also when he had allegedly attacked M O’D he was in bicycle clothing or at least had a bicycle helmet and bike. The Crown tried to overcome this difficulty by suggesting that the applicant had driven to work that day instead of cycling, as was his normal habit. But this explanation did not overcome the fact that the evidence of the JG offences lacked a significant characteristic of the offender in the three other attacks and a characteristic of the appellant when he had otherwise been seen in the area, the presence of a bike and cycling paraphernalia. 
     
      
    73 The Crown in this Court placed much reliance upon the alleged admissions. On 9 February 2007 Detective Shepherd arrested the appellant for the M O’D offence. At the police station Det Fitzgerald informed him that he was investigating an indecent assault on 19 December 2006, the M O’D offence, and a sexual assault on 17 January 2007, the JG offences. He then refused to be interviewed. He was later informed of an investigation of an indecent assault on 3 January 2006 at Emu Plains and he responded, “What the fuck?” He was later informed that the police were investigating an indecent assault on 18 February 2006 at Warrimoo. He again refused to be interviewed. When asked if he wanted to be interviewed about a sexual assault on 17 January 2007, he said, “No fucking hell”. He was later charged with the M O’D offence and an offence against JG and said, “Whatever”. 
     
      
    74 It was after the appellant was informed of the match of his DNA with the offence of 19 December that he had the conversation that has been set out earlier in this judgment and during which the Crown alleged he made certain admissions. None of those admissions explicitly refers to the JG offences. The Crown submits that it was open to the jury to conclude that what he said was a response to the four allegations that had been put to him at various times at the police station. The appellant referred in the alleged admissions to “split decisions” and that his issues with Rebecca “led to these attacks”. He also said “I can tell you time, dates and places”. 
     
      
    75 I do not believe it was reasonably open to a jury to find that by inference the appellant was admitting to each of the four attacks that had been mentioned to him as opposed to two or three of them. If such an inference was open, it was a very slight one. It could not possibly support a conviction of the appellant for the JG offences, with or without the tendency evidence. In my opinion the tendency evidence either by itself or taken with other evidence available to the Crown should not have been admitted. 
     
      
    76 As in my opinion the first two grounds of appeal should be upheld there is no need to deal with the other grounds. Because the tendency evidence should not have been admitted, there should have been a separate trial of counts 7 to 11 from counts 1 to 6. Although some question arose in my mind initially as to whether this Court should order a re-trial on counts 1 to 6, on reflection I do not believe the proviso can be applied in respect of the convictions for those offences even though the case against the appellant on those charges was, in my opinion, overwhelming. I am not satisfied there has been no miscarriage of justice in respect of counts 1 to 6 by reason of counts 7 to 11 and the evidence of JG being before the jury. 
     
      
       
        
         
        Ground 5. The jury’s verdict on counts 7 to 11 were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence 
        
       
      
    77 Because on my view the tendency evidence should have been rejected, the remaining evidence was insufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who was the offender in counts 7 to 11. Although there was some similarity in the appearance of the offender in the JG attacks with the appellant, JG had identified another person despite the fact that the offender was not disguised. The conversation with the police at the police station was not in my opinion capable of being found beyond reasonable doubt to amount to an admission of each of the four incidents that the police had raised at different times with the appellant. 
     
      
    78 It follows in my opinion that the jury ought to have found the appellant not guilty of counts 7 to 11. 
     
      
    79 In light of that opinion there is no reason to deal with the other grounds of appeal that are concerned with alleged misdirections or failures by the trial judge in directing the jury as to the manner in which they were to approach the tendency evidence and the significance of the admissions. These are not matters that could affect a retrial as the directions in respect of the tendency evidence or the relevance of the admissions would not arise. 
     
      
    80 Because the appeal against the convictions should be allowed, there is no need to consider the adequacy of the sentences imposed. However, if the appellant is again convicted after trial of counts 1 to 6, the trial judge should not feel bound to follow the sentences imposed by Judge Puckeridge or be limited by them. On its face it is difficult to understand how his Honour could have justified imposing concurrent sentences for offences against different complainants. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
      
    81 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The appeal against the convictions is allowed and the convictions quashed. 
         
         
        2. The sentences imposed in the District Court are quashed. 
         
         
        3. On counts 7 to 11 there is a verdict of acquittal. 
         
         
        4. There is to be a retrial of counts 1 to 6.

    JUDGMENT1 A jury was empanelled yesterday to try Mr Smith on the nine charges of child sexual assault contained in the indictment. A court officer properly drew to my attention that a routine form completed by one of the jurors referred to that juror’s occupation as “OVERSEAS LAWYER/JUDGE”. The court officer has also drawn to my attention that on the database of current juror details for that juror kept by the Office of the Sheriff, the occupation is described as “LAWYER.”2 I drew to the attention of counsel in this trial that information. It has prompted an application by Mr Porter, who appears for Mr Smith, to discharge that juror. He argues that if that application is successful then I should, in addition, discharge the other eleven jurors and not proceed with a jury of eleven.3 His application is made under s53B of the Jury Act 1977 and this judgment concerns the reasons why I accept his submission. Mr Porter primarily relies on s53B (b) which provides that a court may discharge a juror if relevantly it appears to the court that the juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case because of “any reasonable apprehension of bias.”4 Further information was provided to counsel to the effect that the juror in question comes from Bangladesh. 5 I should add here that a preliminary issue arose as to whether that juror, because of the juror’s stated occupation, was in fact not qualified to serve as a juror because the juror was ineligible under s6(b) of the Jury Act and Schedule 2. Schedule 2 refers to a “judicial officer (within the meaning of the Judicial Officers’ Act 1986)”, to “an Australian lawyer (whether or not an Australian legal practitioner)” and to “any person who has been a judicial officer within the meaning of the Judicial Officers’ Act”.6 I am satisfied that the juror is not judicial officer or former judicial officer because on the face of the information we have, the juror was from overseas and the Judicial Officers’ Act of New South Wales would not be applicable to that juror.7 I am also satisfied that the juror is not an Australian lawyer. That term is defined in the definition section - namely s4 - of Legal Profession Act 2004 and s5 of that Act. Those provisions plus the definition of “corresponding law” as contrasted to the definition of “corresponding foreign law” satisfies me that a person who describes themselves as an overseas lawyer is not an Australian lawyer.8 Returning to the consideration of s53B, Mr Porter argues that there is a reasonable apprehension that the juror might be biased. He argues this in several steps. His research indicates that Bangladesh is a country which has retained the death penalty and that the death penalty is applicable in that country for offences such as the offences being tried in this case. Mr Porter can find no reference to a jury system. The inference which he says is available, and I accept that it is, is that a judicial officer in Bangladesh may well try cases such as this, and if the trial results in a conviction, may impose the death penalty.9 We do not know of course whether the juror in question was such a judge who tried such cases, but I accept from Mr Porter’s argument that we must assume that that is the case.10 Mr Gibson who appears as Crown Prosecutor argues that what I have set out so far is not a sufficient basis for concluding that there is any reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the juror. He argues, correctly I think, that there is no logical connection so far which would suggest that a person acting as a judge in Bangladesh in the circumstances which I have described might be regarded as biased.11 However, there are a number of other considerations. The first is that none of us knows, and time has not permitted us to find out, whether the legal system in Bangladesh is such that the burden of proof is on the prosecution and that a person cannot be convicted unless the tribunal is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of their guilt. I think it is likely that that is the case because the Bangladeshi legal system is based from, my own knowledge, on the British system, like ours, but I cannot confidently conclude that that is the case.12 An additional factor relates to the evidence in this very case. The Crown Prosecutor proposes to call tendency evidence. He opened to the jury yesterday describing the nature of that evidence. It will be evidence from another female child. The complainant in this trial is a female child. The Crown will call evidence from another female child who will say that she was sexually assaulted by Mr Smith in similar circumstances. The circumstances are such that the Crown will argue that they demonstrate a tendency on Mr Smith’s part to have a sexual interest in young girls and to perform sexual acts with them in his own home and to risk the danger of discovery. They also display a tendency, so the Crown will argue, to perform those sexual acts in a particular area of the victim’s body.13 The difficulty which that proposed evidence raises, so far as this juror is concerned, is said to be this by Mr Porter. Because of that juror’s assumed legal knowledge, the juror may reason that the tendency evidence would not be led unless it had been led in a trial in which Mr Smith was prosecuted and convicted. That reasoning would be correct I am informed. I am told that the person who will give the tendency evidence gave evidence in another trial against Mr Smith and the result of the trial was a conviction and Mr Smith served a custodial sentence after that conviction. The tendency evidence will not include any reference to it leading to a conviction nor will it be part of the Crown case that Mr Smith has a record, which includes a previous conviction for an offence such as this.14 Mr Gibson argues that that factor is not relevant to my consideration under s53B(b) on the question of reasonable apprehension of bias but could be relevant, he fairly acknowledges, to clause (d) in that it may be a “reason affecting the juror’s ability to perform the functions of a juror.”15 I am not convinced that it would affect the juror’s “ability” to perform the juror’s functions. I have not had the benefit of giving considered attention to the expression “ability” in that clause, but I expect that it is a reference to physical or mental ability in the sense of capacity. 16 However, I regard the factor of the tendency evidence as having an impact so far as the reasonable apprehension of bias is concerned. I have been assisted by Mr Porter referring me to the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Czajkowski and Shepherd [2002] NSWCCA 530. Sheller JA - with whom Wood CJ at CL and Sully J agreed - set out the relevant law regarding apprehended bias. At [19] Sheller JA said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “This court has held that the test is whether ‘the parties or the public  
        might  
        entertain a reasonable apprehension that the jury  
        might  
        not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the issues involved in the proceeding.’” 
         
        It was described in another case acknowledged by Sheller JA as “a test of possibility upon possibility” and his Honour observed that the “test will be at its most strict for a criminal trial.”  
        
       
      
    The test involves, as Mr Porter argued, a low threshold.17 I consider as relevant the following factors(a) that one of the jurors was a judicial officer in Bangladesh;(b) that Bangladesh has a death penalty for offences such as this;(c) that it appears there is no jury system in Bangladesh 
     
      
      (d) that we have no information about the burden and standard of proof in Bangladesh; and 
       
      (e) that there is to be led in the prosecution case tendency evidence but no evidence of any previous conviction of Mr Smith. 
      
    18 That combination of factors lead me to conclude - in the terms used by David Kirby J in R v Bright (2000) 114 A Crim R 466 at [28] - that a “fair minded and informed member of the public, might entertain a reasonable apprehension that he or she might not bring an impartial unprejudiced mind to the resolution of questions involved in the trial.”19 Accordingly I propose to grant Mr Porter’s application to discharge the juror in question.20 Mr Porter makes a further application, now that I have granted his first application. His further application is that I should discharge the other eleven. Mr Gibson has helpfully referred me to a decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Luland v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 64. In a judgment in which Bell J, as her Honour then was, and Hoeben J agreed, Sully J set out factors which his Honour regarded as relevant in determining an application such as this. Included amongst the factors was that a trial judge “was required imperatively to take account of the fact that at common law a person accused of having committed any serious crime is entitled to trial by a jury of twelve of his peers and no less a number of them.” That passage appears at [31]. Although the Jury Act permits trials of fewer than eleven, his Honour said that it “is always important to bear in mind that the section does not simply abrogate that fundamental common law entitlement.”21 Another factor which Sully J said is relevant is the factor of delay. This trial has a history of significant delays in the following sense. Briefly, the history is that this matter commenced as a trial on 28 July 2008. That trial did not proceed because of an appeal by the prosecution to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The matter was listed again to proceed on 9 February 2009. After several days of evidence the jury in that trial was discharged. It commenced again on 16 February 2009 but there was an anomaly so far as the selection of jurors from different panels was concerned. The trial started yet again before me on Monday of this week, 27 April 2009. Two problems arose after a day or so. One was that one of the jurors had come in on behalf of his wife who was in receipt of the summons. The second problem was that there appeared to be a somnolent juror within the jury. She had difficulty keeping her eyes open during my opening remarks and the Crown Prosecutor’s opening. The trial which is the subject of this judgment commenced yesterday. This trial has, to use the words of Sully J in Luland’s case an “unfortunate antecedent history.”22 Mr Smith has a right to be tried as expeditiously as might be justly practicable. On the other hand he has a right to an opportunity in that trial for his fate to be determined by twelve jurors. It is he, through his counsel, who emphasises that right. 23 There is a public interest in the trial going ahead and in the issue being determined. Insofar as that public interest obviously reflects the need for witnesses to be called, I note that the evidence of the complainant in this case is to be given by playing her evidence pre-recorded from one of the earlier trials and also in the form of an interview with the police. I do note that the person who will give the tendency evidence will also give it by a pre-recording but will also be required to come and give evidence.24 Through his counsel Mr Smith appears to regard as important the factor of being tried by twelve persons. Regrettable as it is I think on balance that that consideration so early in this trial should weigh in favour of discharging the whole jury. I do that bearing in mind that it is now Thursday and that fresh panels can be assembled in this court this coming Monday for the trial to commence. 25 Therefore I propose to discharge the jury.

     Judgment 
    1 GROVE J: I agree with R A Hulme J. 
     
      
    2 BUDDIN J: I agree with R A Hulme J. 
     
      
    3 R A HULME J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence for a charge of robbery in company imposed by his Honour Judge Conlon SC sitting in the District Court at Bega. His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 26 March 2007. The offence is against s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900 and the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years.4 At the same time his Honour imposed a sentence in identical terms upon a co-offender, Nathan James Streat. 5 The sole ground of appeal asserts that the applicant “has a legitimate sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed upon himself with that imposed upon his co-offender”.Facts6 The facts of the offence may be briefly stated as the parity contention is solely concerned with the respective personal circumstances of the applicant and the co-offender. The two men attended a service station on the Princes Highway at Coila at about 6.00pm on 26 March 2007 where they entered and approached the female owner. Streat produced a steel bar and held it at waist height while demanding that she hand over money. As she removed the cash drawer from the cash register and placed it on the counter she told them that they could take what they wanted. Streat removed about $1,500 in cash. 7 The applicant then asked for tobacco. She replied that she did not have any. He then said, “I’m sorry, I’m not going to hurt you but I need to do this”. He then took some packets of cigarettes and some cigarette lighters from a display and a bag of $1 coins from the counter. At this point the woman heard her three young grandchildren in the house adjoining the service station. Concerned that they might become involved in the incident she moved toward the doorway but the applicant gently placed his hand on her shoulder and moved her back to where she had been standing, saying, “Don’t’ go back there, stay here”. The two men then left.8 The victim immediately rang triple-0. Police located their vehicle south of the Moruya township. There was a pursuit and they were eventually stopped and arrested. They were taken to Batemans Bay police station where attempts to speak to them were unsuccessful because they appeared unwell and affected by drugs. 9 The sentencing judge took into account the vulnerability of the service station owner and that a metal bar had been used to put her in fear. He accepted that the offence was not planned but “opportunistic”. His assessment was that the offence fell within the mid range of objective seriousness for an offence of its type. There is no challenge to that assessment.Subjective features10 The applicant was born in March 1982 and so he was aged 25 at the time of the offence. He had a criminal history that the sentencing judge regarded as not entitling him to any leniency. It includes offences in New South Wales in 2003 to 2007 of taking and driving a conveyance without the owner’s consent, larceny, stalking or intimidation, damaging property, contravening an apprehended violence order, possessing housebreaking implements, goods in custody, stealing in a dwelling and breaking out, assault, drug possession and having a knife in a public place. He also had a history of convictions in Victoria in 1999 to 2002 for offences including entering a building with intent to steal, receiving stolen goods, possessing a dangerous article, theft, burglary and car theft. The applicant had been released from prison on the expiry of his last sentence just 4 months prior to the offence. The Crown has pointed out, rightly in my view, that it would have been open to the sentencing judge to view such a record as indicating that retribution, deterrence and protection of the community warranted a more severe penalty being imposed: Veen (No 2) v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477.11 There were many unfavourable features attending the applicant’s upbringing. His parents separated when he was about 3 years old. He was raised by an alcoholic father who travelled the country on the carnival/show circuit. To the author of the Pre Sentence Report he described his father as his “best friend” despite occasions of physical and emotional abuse. He also experienced times of living on the streets where he was exposed to alcohol and drugs. His father died in 2003 and he was then reunited with his mother who had a long history of addictions and physical and mental health problems.12 The applicant was educated to the level of Year 9, having been schooled by correspondence, and subsequently completed some short TAFE courses. His employment history, however, has been limited to casual fruit picking.13 The applicant used cannabis from the age of 12 and amphetamines from 18. This continued up until his arrest for the present matter. The applicant told the Probation and Parole Officer that he had been using ice methamphetamine in the four months between his release from gaol and his re-incarceration and in that time had only slept four times. He claimed to have been under the influence of ice for the week leading up to the offence and to have little recollection of it. The officer expressed the view that the applicant demonstrated a degree of understanding regarding his addictions and said that he had expressed interest in addressing these through a residential rehabilitation program.14 There is a history of mental health problems. The applicant has had numerous admissions to a mental health facility in Coffs Harbour and has at times been prescribed antidepressant medication. A psychiatric report in 2004 noted psychotic and mood symptoms and, although significant drug and alcohol issues complicated a diagnosis, the author expressed the opinion that the applicant suffered an antisocial personality disorder.15 Two reports by Dr Stephen Allnutt were tendered to the sentencing judge. It was noted in those reports that the applicant had first seen a psychiatrist at age fifteen when he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and was placed on dexamphetamines, which he took until the age of 18. The history included eight or nine admissions to psychiatric hospitals, the last in 2006 following a suicide attempt. There had been previous suicide attempts. 16 Dr Allnutt’s first report contained a guarded diagnosis of the applicant suffering from a psychiatric disorder with mood and psychotic characteristics, aggravated and compounded by long-term substance abuse. He did not believe a mental illness defence was available but was unable to be definitive about the possible contribution of the applicant’s psychiatric symptoms to the offence. The doctor provided a second report five months later, during which time the applicant had been on antipsychotic medication. In this report he ventured the diagnosis that the applicant “suffers from a psychiatric disorder in the form of a mental illness consistent with either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder”. He also concluded that at the time of the offence “he was experiencing psychotic symptoms aggravated by substance abuse” and that “his judgment was impaired due to the combination of intoxication and mental illness”.17 The author of the Pre Sentence Report noted that the applicant expressed sympathy for the victim and that he had verbalised some understanding of the possible effects that she may be feeling and wished to write to her a letter of apology.Co-offender18 It is necessary to say something about the co-offender, Nathan Street. He was born in May 1984 and so he was a little more than 2 years younger than the applicant. He had a criminal history in New South Wales that included offences of larceny, assaulting and resisting police, obtaining money be deception, taking and driving a conveyance without consent, drug possession, having a knife in a public place, break, enter and steal, making explosives, stealing in a dwelling, receiving stolen property, goods in custody, malicious wounding and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He had been imprisoned a number of times and was last released almost a year before the offence. At the time of the offence he was subject to a good behaviour bond for an offence of driving whilst disqualified. The comment I made about Veen (No 2) in relation to the applicant’s record applies equally to Mr Streat’s record.19 Mr Streat was the youngest of seven adopted siblings and was raised in a stable family environment in the Coffs Harbour area. There was a diagnosis of ADHD in his early teens following problematical behaviour as a child. He was prescribed a variety of antidepressants. At one point when he was taking Zoloft he became suicidal but when that medication was replaced with another there was an improvement. He left school at sixteen and then commenced a TAFE course in motor mechanics but had difficulty finding employment in that field. His most recent employment was in repairing cars and bikes for his landlord in lieu of rent. 20 He was described as having a long history of polysubstance abuse dating back to his early teens. Alcohol and drug abuse commenced at the age of about twelve. By fifteen he was using speed, ecstasy and LSD but mainly amphetamine. Progression to ice methamphetamine lead to further chaos in his life. Like the applicant, he had been abusing methylamphetamine and similar drugs in the four months prior to the offence. He described himself as “coming down” and being desperate to acquire more drugs when he committed the offence.21 The sentencing judge quoted the following from the report of a psychologist: 
     
      
       
        
        “Rowan has a long criminal and antisocial history in his short life. While he has had a generally supportive and positive family life, his overarching feelings of victimisation and lack of assertiveness (a passive-aggressive nature) have created a myriad of problems including school difficulties, criminal behaviour and ultimately addiction to drugs. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The negative consequences of his behaviour have been enormous. His family relationships have suffered, he has lost the opportunity for education, he has been incarcerated, he has lost relationships, been exposed to hepatitis C, lost jobs, he has lost his ability to have a licence for years to come.” 
        
       
      
    22 Both the Pre Sentence Report and the psychologist’s report indicated that Mr Streat had little insight into his offending behaviour but it was noted that he was motivated to seek treatment in relation to his drug and alcohol issues, the former report including that he was motivated to participate in a residential rehabilitation program.Consideration of issues on the application23 The principal argument advanced by Ms Cox, who appeared for the applicant in this Court but not the court below, is that the personal circumstances of the two offenders were so different that the imposition of identical sentences gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance because the applicant should have received a lesser sentence than his co-offender. She relied upon Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606. See also Postiglione v The Queen (1996-1997) 189 CLR 295 and the useful summary of parity principles in Delfino v R [2008] NSWCCA 18 at [62] – [63]. 24 Reference should also be made to R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [71]. There Barr and Howie JJ referred to the caution that should be exercised in this Court before determining that one offender has a justifiable sense of grievance in a case where the same judge sentenced two offenders at the same time and gave detailed reasons for imposing the sentences that he or she did by having regard to the relative criminality and subjective circumstances of each as well as to the relevant sentencing principles.25 Ms Cox submitted that there were the following features in the applicant’s case that warranted a lesser sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) A harsh, deprived and nomadic childhood 
         
         
        (2) A criminal history that lacked the matters of violence in the co-offender’s record 
         
         
        (3) Demonstrated remorse 
         
         
        (4) Lesser moral culpability for the offence because judgment was impaired, in part, by mental illness 
         
         
        (5) Harsher conditions of custody because of mental illness 
         
         
        (6) The applicant, in contrast to the co-offender, was not on conditional liberty at the time of the offence 
        
       
      
    26 The first three of those matters, to my mind, were not of such significance that discrimination between the two offenders in sentence was mandated. The major subjective features of the two men concerned their drug addiction and, in the case of the applicant, mental illness. I am mindful of the submission of Ms Cox that it was the cumulative effect of these six features that warranted a lesser sentence for her client but whether considered in isolation, or in conjunction with the other matters, these three matters do not support the contention in a material way. In relation to the second matter concerning the respective criminal histories of the two, I set out the nature of their previous convictions in some detail earlier at [10] and [18] in order to demonstrate that they both have bad records for men of their age, including some matters of violence. Analysis and comparison of the fine detail of their convictions does not advance the applicant’s cause.27 Dealing next with the contention concerning the applicant’s moral culpability for the offence, it is noted that the learned sentencing judge found as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The courts have continuously recognised the principle that the fact that an offender is suffering a mental illness or disability may mitigate the culpability of the offender … However, it cannot be said in my view that in the present case the offender Withers was acting without knowledge of what he was doing or that his actions were wrong. Indeed I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offence was committed by both offenders out of their need to satisfy their addictions. The criminal culpability of both offenders is identical. In my view it is appropriate that I take into account Withers’ mental health issues as referred to in the reports of Dr Allnutt when I come to the question of special circumstances. 
        
       
      
    28 This passage immediately follows quotation from the second report of Dr Allnutt where the doctor expressed the view that it was “reasonable to conclude” that the applicant “suffers from a psychiatric disorder in the form of a mental illness consistent with either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder”, and that whilst no mental illness defence was available, the doctor believed that the applicant’s judgment was impaired due to a combination of intoxication and mental illness. The doctor did not express a view as to the extent to which either of those features contributed to the impairment of judgment. 29 There is support in the authorities for the sentencing judge adopting the approach in the passage of his remarks just referred to. The bare fact of a diagnosis of mental illness did not automatically produce the result that the sentence should be reduced: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 per Gleeson CJ at 68. The extent to which it contributed to the impairment of judgment referred to by Dr Allnutt was incapable of quantification and so it cannot be said that it was not open to the sentencing judge to conclude that the applicant acted with knowledge of what he was doing and that it was wrong. The manner in which the applicant acted during the course of the robbery was indicative of this.30 Ms Cox was taken to a passage in the transcript of the proceedings on sentence where counsel then appearing for the applicant conceded that it would be open to the sentencing judge to consider that the motivation of both offenders in committing the offence was related to their abuse of drugs rather than, in the case of the applicant, to mental health issues as well. Ms Cox then made a similar concession but nevertheless pressed her contention that the mental illness of her client was relevant in other ways and maintained her submission that it warranted a distinction in the sentence imposed when compared to the co-offender.31 One of the mostly commonly cited authorities on the question of the relevance of an offender’s mental condition on sentence is R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 where Sperling J said at [33] – [36]: 
     
      
       
        
        33 Mental illness may be relevant – and was relevant in the present case – in three ways. First, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced; there may not then be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced:  
        Henry 
         at [254];  
        Jiminez  
        [1999] NSWCCA 7 at [23];  
        Tsiaras  
        [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400;

        Pearson 
         [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43].  
         
         
        34 Secondly, mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration:  
        Pearce 
         (NSW CCA, 1 November 1996, unreported);  
        Engert 
         (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 per Gleeson CJ;  
        Letteri 
         (NSW CCA, 18 March 1992, unreported);  
        Israil 
         at [22];  
        Pearson 
         at [42].  
         
         
        35 Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person:  
        Tsiaras 
         at 400;  
        Jiminez 
         at [25];  
        Israil 
         at [26].  
         
         
        36 A fourth, and countervailing, consideration may arise, namely, the level of danger which the offender presents to the community. That may sound in special deterrence;  
        Israil 
         at [24]. 
        
       
      
    32 Ms Cox submitted that the applicant’s mental illness was relevant in the third way described by Sperling J. I have earlier referred to Dr Allnutt’s opinion as to the applicant’s mental illness. It is appropriate to mention some of the symptoms set out in his reports. There is reference to auditory hallucinations and at times probable grandiose and persecutory delusional beliefs. There was a long history of depressive disorder with depressed mood and suicidal ideation. Paranoia was detected with, for example, the applicant thinking that his food was being poisoned. The applicant had been on antipsychotic medication for an extended time when Dr Allnutt saw him for his second interview. The report of that interview includes that the applicant had signed himself into the “non-association” section of the gaol because he had been feeling paranoid. He was worried about a certain ethnic cluster amongst the inmates. He had avoided watching television whereas previously he claimed to have been receiving subliminal messages from television. When he listened to the radio he heard messages through the songs with something about lotto numbers. He thought there was a government conspiracy to damage his frontal lobes. He was experiencing panic attacks.33 The conclusions expressed by Dr Allnutt about the applicant’s mental illness were based not only upon what the applicant told him but also upon an extensive review of clinical notes, assessments and other documents generated in the preceding four years.34 I am of the view that Ms Cox has made good her contention that the custodial experience for the applicant will weigh more heavily upon him because of his mental illness. It has impacted upon his placement within the gaol because of his fears of other inmates arising from his paranoid delusional beliefs. It clearly has, and will, impact upon his ability to socialise with other inmates.35 This is not a case in which the fourth of the matters referred to by Sperling J in Hemsley is relevant. The countervailing consideration of the protection of the community generally becomes relevant in a case in which the offender’s moral culpability for the offence is reduced because of a lesser capacity to reason, or appreciate the wrongfulness of the conduct, or to exercise appropriate powers of control. In such a case the emphasis upon denunciation and general deterrence might be reduced but the protection of the community may receive greater emphasis: see Engert at 71. But these are not considerations in the present case. 36 The sentencing judge took the applicant’s mental illness and need for rehabilitation in respect of his drug issues into account in reducing the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period. In my view, the applicant’s mental illness was relevant generally, and should not have been confined to a consideration of the length of the non-parole period. Parole for the applicant is a matter for the Parole Authority to determine and it cannot be assumed that he will be released immediately upon the expiration of the non-parole period. The conditions of the applicant’s custodial experience potentially transcend the non-parole period and, theoretically at least, may have a bearing on the whole sentence.  
     
      
    37 The Court was not referred to any authority that indicated that the mental illness of an offender, relevant in the way it is in this case, should be confined to the assessment of the non-parole period. Indeed, there is authority to the contrary that in an appropriate case it may be relevant to the assessment of the total sentence as well as the non-parole period: see the discussion in the judgments of Grove J in Regina v Szabo [2003] NSWCCA 341 at [14] – [16] and of Hulme J in Fisher v R [2008] NSWCCA 103 at [38] – [39].38 That leaves the last of the contentions raised on behalf of the applicant, that at the time of the offence the co-offender was subject to a s 9 good behaviour bond in respect of an offence of driving whilst disqualified. The sentencing judge referred to this but said nothing as to whether he regarded it as being an aggravating factor. In those circumstances it may be inferred that he did not take it into account in that way. That is consistent with a remark he made in the course of submissions that he did not regard it as a matter of “great significance”. The Crown submitted that there was no error in this respect. Assuming, but without deciding, that in the context of all of the circumstances of the case of Mr Streat that this was a matter of such importance that an increase in the sentence to be imposed upon him was required, with the myriad of factors the sentencing judge was required to take into account I do not think this matter was one that required anything more than a marginal distinction in sentencing the two offenders.39 A final matter to note is the stance taken by the Crown in the proceedings before the sentencing judge. It was the judge who first raised the question of parity. Counsel for the applicant was in a difficult position in making submissions on the topic because he was appearing for both offenders. The representative of the Crown submitted that the judge should find that the motivation of both offenders was drugs rather than mental illness. He continued, however, to submit: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Withers has got a somewhat stronger subjective case. He wasn’t on a bond at the time he committed this, he has a demonstrated mental illness, and indeed the Crown concedes special circumstances in this case, if only because of his mental illness. ... And he has also demonstrated more remorse. So even just in relation to those factors his subjective case is somewhat stronger. 
        
       
      
    40 The judge did not deal with this submission in his remarks. It must be noted, however, that his judgment was ex tempore and allowance must be made for the high workload of District Court judges, particularly when called upon to dispose of long lists of cases on country circuits.41 In this Court the Crown submitted that the applicant received the benefit of his mental illness being taken into account by a generous reduction of his non-parole period to sixty percent of the head sentence. It was submitted that it would be double counting to take that issue into account in reducing the head sentence as well. However, if the mental illness of the applicant were taken into account in relation to the overall sentence, it would necessarily follow that there would be an impact upon the length of the non-parole period and that is not to double count. It is also not double counting to take the applicant’s mental illness into account in moderating the length of the total term because of the effect it has had, and will have, upon the harshness of the custodial experience, and then also take it into account in setting the non-parole period because of the need for a longer period of parole supervision to monitor the applicant’s compliance with treatment and medication. Conclusion42 I have concluded that the mental condition of the applicant was a matter that stood in mitigation over and above the value attributed to it by the sentencing judge. It warranted a distinction in the sentences imposed upon the two offenders. The distinction should not have been great, but there should have been one nonetheless. Viewed objectively, there is a basis for the applicant to have a justifiable sense of grievance. A lesser sentence was warranted and should have been passed.43 I have taken into account the affidavit of the applicant on the issue of resentencing. It provides further confirmation of the difficulties he has experienced in the custodial environment as a result of his mental illness. On resentencing I would find special circumstances for the reasons indicated above. An additional reason is the need for the applicant to undertake such counselling and programs as may be considered necessary in relation to his abuse of illicit drugs. I would maintain the same ratio of non-parole period to total sentence as in the original sentencing order.44 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal is granted 
       
      2. The appeal is allowed 
       
      3. The sentence is quashed and in lieu the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years 8 months with a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year 10 months. Such sentence to date from 26 March 2007 with the applicant becoming eligible for release on parole on the expiration of the non-parole period on 25 November 2009.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The respondent, Daniel Cheh, pleaded guilty to one count of specially aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence contrary to s 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. The circumstances of aggravation were that the respondent knew that persons were present in the premises and wounding. The maximum penalty for the offence is 25 years imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment. The respondent was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months with a balance of term of 1 year 3 months. 
     
      
    2 When sentencing the respondent her Honour also had regard to a matter on a Form 1. That matter, a deemed supply of 12.4 grams of methylamphetamine, was a breach of s 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 for which the maximum penalty is a term of imprisonment for 15 years. 
     
      
    3 At the same time as her Honour was sentencing the respondent for the substantive offence she was also asked to sentence the respondent pursuant to s 98 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for the breach of a s 9 bond in relation to an offence of destroy or damage property. The respondent had been sentenced for this offence on 16 January 2007, a little over one month before the subject offence, which was committed on 26 February 2007. The property in question was the back window of the complainant’s car. The bond included a condition that the respondent not assault, molest, harass or otherwise interfere with the complainant. For the breach of the bond her Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months which was wholly subsumed by the sentence for the primary offence. 
     
      
    4 The respondent and the complainant, Chantelle Pieterse, had previously been in a relationship from which there was one child who was twenty months old at the time of the offence. The relationship had come to an end. The complainant had formed a new relationship with Adrian Jackson. On the evening of 26 February 2007 Ms Pieterse and Mr Jackson were retiring to bed when they heard a noise like a window or door being opened. Ms Pieterse asked Mr Jackson to investigate while she stayed at the entrance to her bedroom. Mr Jackson walked down the hallway and saw the respondent through the hallway kitchen door standing approximately three steps away. The respondent came at Mr Jackson and grabbed him around the forearms. Mr Jackson managed to get out of his grip and continued to push him off. The respondent continued his aggression towards Mr Jackson calling out “Are you fucking her?” in an aggressive manner. Mr Jackson replied “No” and the respondent said “Get the fuck out of the house.” 
     
      
    5 The respondent started to push Mr Jackson towards the front door. Mr Jackson then turned around and opened the front door and walked outside. The respondent followed Mr Jackson to the main driveway and pushed him to the ground. Mr Jackson could smell alcohol on the respondent’s breath. Mr Jackson continued to defend himself and used his arms to push the respondent away. The respondent then walked back into the house. 
     
      
    6 The respondent next went to Ms Pieterse’s bedroom. She was trying to secure her door but could not resist the respondent. He said to her “You’re gonna fucking die tonight bitch.” She replied “Please don’t do it. Please don’t do it.” At this point the respondent dragged Ms Pieterse to the kitchen by grabbing hold of her hair and pulling her. Ms Pieterse struggled with the respondent and tried to push his arms off her. She was terrified and kept trying to get away but was unable to do so. 
     
      
    7 The respondent went to the kitchen door and took hold of a black handled steak knife. He repeated “You’re gonna die bitch.” Ms Pieterse who had fallen to the floor slid against the wall and the respondent stabbed her twice in the chest. She pleaded with the respondent “Please don’t kill me.” The respondent kept saying “I’m gonna hang myself now and you’ll end up like me.” 
     
      
    8 It was then that their son could be heard calling out “Mama” from his bedroom. The respondent stood over the complainant and said “I don’t know why you are doing this to me. I thought we can be a family again if you want.” She replied “I promise you we can be together as long as you don’t kill me and hurt me more than you have.” The respondent still had the steak knife in his hand; he raised it above his shoulder and brought it down towards Ms Pieterse’s throat. She grabbed the blade of the knife in her left hand; the blade cut deeply into her hand and then broke off from the handle. 
     
      
    9 By this time the child had come from his bedroom and was near the kitchen entrance saying “Dada, Dada, Dada, Dada.” The respondent stopped assaulting the complainant and started crying. He fell on top of Ms Pieterse who pushed him off and picked up her son. She ran out the front door to the nearest house with lights on where she saw one of her neighbours, Mr Jackson and another neighbour. She told them she had been stabbed in the heart and asked for an ambulance to be called. Mr Jackson had already called 000. 
     
      
    10 Ms Pieterse was taken to Liverpool Hospital and treated for two stab wounds to the chest and punctured lungs. She was also treated for a deep cut to her left hand. 
     
      
    11 Shortly afterwards the police went to the home of the respondent where he was arrested. They also found a suicide note which he had written on a coffee table. There were also a number of beer bottles.  
     
      
    12 When interviewed at the police station the respondent said he had been drinking the whole afternoon and denied that he had been to the complainant’s house. He denied having assaulted her. He said he could not remember anything because of the amount of alcohol that he had been drinking. 
     
      
    13 The respondent is presently 33 years of age. He has a limited criminal history but it does include offences for drug and alcohol related matters and for violence. He has been consistently employed since leaving school and completed a business course. However, prior to the offence his employment ceased, apparently due to his increasing use of alcohol. Although the respondent pleaded guilty at committal there was a dispute in relation to the facts and both he and the complainant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. Her Honour preferred the complainant’s version of the facts. 
     
      
    14 The respondent began his first long term relationship in 1996. There was a child born of that relationship who died of meningitis in 2002 when aged 2½ . The couple separated. The respondent was adversely affected by his son’s death. As a consequence he increased his alcohol consumption to in the order of a case of beer and a bottle spirits each day. 
     
      
    15 In 2003 the respondent formed a relationship with the complainant. However, there were difficulties between them which resulted in the complainant taking out two apprehended violence orders against the respondent since 2004. Since entering custody the respondent has been diagnosed with depression. He had previously been diagnosed with this condition before the offence and had been prescribed medication which he did not continue. He told a psychologist that “it was easier to go to a bottle shop.” Since his incarceration he has received on-going treatment and is medicated. This has had beneficial effects and the evidence suggests that he is coping with being in gaol. 
     
      
    16 The respondent has expressed remorse for the fear experienced by his victim and his son who witnessed the violent event. 
     
      
    17 The Crown submitted that the sentence which her Honour imposed was manifestly inadequate. It was submitted that her Honour erred by failing to properly assess the objective seriousness of the offence, failed to pay due regard to the principles in Veen v The Queen [No 2] (1988) 164 CLR 465, erred by giving undue weight to the plea of guilty and the subjective features of the respondent, erred in her application of special circumstances and erred by failing properly to take into account the need for specific and general deterrence. 
     
      
    18 Her Honour’s remarks on sentence are inadequate in a number of respects. After finding the relevant facts and recording subjective matters, including the respondent’s difficulties with depression and alcohol, her Honour considered the submissions of both the Crown and of the respondent. Her Honour concluded that the seriousness of the offence was enhanced by the fact that the respondent was on conditional liberty when it was committed which was a short time after the imposition of the s 9 bond. Her Honour concluded that there was no planning involved in the offence but that the respondent was severely affected by alcohol at the time. She identified the fact that he did not take a weapon with him to the complainant’s house but opportunistically found a weapon in the kitchen drawer.  
     
      
    19 The Crown submitted to her Honour that the actual trauma suffered by the complainant was such as to be an aggravation of the offence. However, her Honour concluded that it was an element of the charge as was “the force used or threatened” which her Honour concluded was also “part of the charges which are part of the offence.” Her Honour concluded that Ms Pieterse suffered a significant injury and was in hospital for a period of time including some time in intensive care. Her Honour also found that Ms Pieterse suffered mental and physical trauma from the assault. 
     
      
    20 With respect to the issue of the objective seriousness of the offence her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In looking to objective seriousness it seems to me that this falls somewhere in the mid-range of objective seriousness and perhaps slightly below the mid-range of objective seriousness. I take into account in particular the subjective features to which I have referred and also in relation to the age, background, the employment prospects and also the prospects of rehabilitation which I believe will be available to this offender. I accept his contrition to be real. It is his first time in prison. It appears that he has been well behaved and it also appears that he has engaged in the courses in an effort to engage in rehabilitation processes prior to his release from gaol.” 
        
       
      
    21 Her Honour then continued with a discussion of the purposes of sentencing and concluded with a discussion of the appropriate discount. Her discussion of the latter issue was confused and erroneous. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The purposes of sentencing of course are not only of punishment of an offender for the crime committed but also in relation to general deterrence. Clearly offences of break and enter committing a serious indictable offence which are aggravated by the factors which I have set out in this matter are matters that are prevalent in the community and are matters that require condemnation. The protection of the community is needed and also there should be denunciation of the conduct of an offender. It is necessary to make the offender accountable for his actions but it is also necessary to promote his rehabilitation. I recognise the harm which has been done to Ms Pieterse in the actions by the offender and her substantial wounding and as I have said I accept her evidence in relation to the continuing sequelae in that regard. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender pleaded guilty at an early time although I am aware that there was the necessity of a hearing necessitating both the offender and Ms Pieterse giving evidence in relation to what were disputed facts. That was something which I take into account in looking to the utilitarian discount afforded by the plea of guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        To that end and taking into account the special circumstances which I find being the need for rehabilitation, the fact of his remorse and also because of the mental illness, the alcohol problems and the like I believe a discount in the range of twenty five per cent to be appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    22 As I have indicated there are multiple problems with these remarks. Her Honour in considering the objective seriousness of the offence did not apparently have regard to the principles discussed by this Court in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. It would be unnecessarily repetitive for me to incorporate into these reasons the description in Way of the sentencing task required to be undertaken by a judge who must consider a standard non-parole period. They were carefully considered by the joint judgment of the court which must be continually borne in mind by sentencing judges: (see also Simpson J in R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575). Although her Honour described the offence as “falling somewhere in the mid-range of objective seriousness and perhaps slightly below the mid-range of objective seriousness” her Honour did not explain, in any satisfactory way, her reasons for this conclusion. The conclusion itself was inadequate; the offence was either within the mid-range or it was not and her Honour should have turned her mind to this question with precision. I have previously commented on these problems in R v Knight; R v Bivanua NSWCCA (2007) 283 see [4]; 176 A Crim R 338; and the discussion by Howie J at [39]. The lack of attention given to the task which the sentencing judge was required to undertake compared with the emphasis her Honour gave to subjective matters suggest that an error may have occurred.  
     
      
    23 The suggestion of error is confirmed by the concluding paragraph in the extract from her Honour’s remarks. Although the respondent pleaded guilty, entitling him to a reasonable discount on his sentence, her Honour failed to quantify the discount appropriate for his plea. Instead, in the concluding paragraph which I have extracted above her Honour provides a global twenty-five percent discount for, so it would seem, the plea of guilty together with matters relating to rehabilitation, remorse, mental illness and alcohol problems. This reasoning was misconceived, no separate “discount” being available for these various matters. 
     
      
    24 To my mind the offence was serious and but for the respondent’s psychiatric illness fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness. The respondent entered the complainant’s premises at night and threatened, insulted and ultimately attacked Mr Jackson. He then set about the attack upon Ms Pieterse. In the course of that attack he not only put her in terror but inflicted serious stab wounds to her chest, in particular her lungs and hand. He carried out this attack while his young child was in the house. The child came from his bedroom calling out and must himself have been severely traumatised by what occurred. Although the offence did not appear to be entirely planned, the respondent did not take a weapon with him, it was nevertheless a serious physical attack. It would seem that his original motivation in going to Ms Pieterse’s premises was to see his son before then killing himself. He did not, at least initially, intend harm to Ms Pieterse. It is apparent that the respondent was affected at the relevant time by serious depression and had problems with alcohol. His psychiatric condition was likely to have been initiated by the death of his son and it remained untreated. No doubt his sense of loss at the break up of the relationship and his abuse of alcohol, which may have impaired his judgment, contributed to his behaviour. 
     
      
    25 Although it was submitted to the sentencing judge that the level of the applicant’s mental health and alcohol abuse was such as to reduce his moral culpability her Honour does not explain any finding which she made in this respect. However, when her Honour ultimately expresses her conclusion as to the appropriate sentence she said that she had regard to the applicant’s “mental illness”. It would seem probable that her Honour had in mind the finding of the psychiatrist Dr Lucire, that the applicant was suffering from depression. Mr Taylor expressed a similar conclusion. Her Honour had previously said “I note that the evidence of the offender was that at the time of committing the offence he had formed an intention to commit suicide to the extent that he had written a suicide note and had also prepared a noose, but that he had determined to visit his small child to say goodbye before going ahead with that course.” Her Honour would appear to have regarded the mental illness of the offender according to the psychological and psychiatric evidence as being merely a subjective circumstance which in combination with other subjective circumstances would entitle the respondent to a discount of 25%. The sentencing judge should have found that the respondent’s actions were significantly influenced by his mental illness and that this was a matter relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    26 With respect to subjective matters the sentencing judge was satisfied that the respondent was genuinely remorseful and contrite. It would seem that with appropriate treatment his psychological state has returned to reasonable balance and it may be accepted that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. Although the offence was committed when the respondent was subject to a bond, in reality this formed part of the sequence of events culminating in the crime for which he was being sentenced. 
     
      
    27 The respondent pleaded guilty at an early stage. However, because the respondent did not accept a number of the elements of the Crown case it was necessary for the sentencing judge to conduct a hearing to resolve factual disputes. A discount in the order of twenty percent would in my judgment be appropriate for the utilitarian value of his plea.  
     
      
    28 The standard non-parole period for the offence is 7 years. Although by reason of the plea it is not of direct relevance it provides a guidepost to the sentence which should be imposed in the present case. In sentencing the respondent it was also necessary to have regard to the drug offence on the Form 1 for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 15 years. 
     
      
    29 It is apparent that the respondent has a need for psychiatric treatment and is likely to require psychiatric or psychological counselling into the future. His rehabilitation will need to be carefully monitored and his mental health on release maintained. Accordingly, a finding of special circumstances was appropriate so as to ensure that an adequate period of supervision is available upon his release from custody. 
     
      
    30 It is appropriate to view the respondent’s crime as a manifestation of violence in a domestic situation. Although the parties were no longer residing together they were required to relate to each other in the interests of their small child. Just as this Court has expressed concern that appropriate sentences be imposed for violence within the home it is also necessary to ensure that the objective of general deterrence is achieved when sentencing a former partner for violence committed to the other person (see R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; (2006) 164 A Crim R 179 and R v Burton [2008] NSWCCA 128). However, of significance in this case is that this Court has consistently adopted the view that when an offender’s actions are affected by mental disability the objective of general deterrence is of less significance: R v Engert (1996) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 per Gleeson CJ; Letteri (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 March 1992 per Badgery-Parker J). 
     
      
    31 Because this is a Crown appeal it is necessary for this Court to be mindful of the principles governing such appeals. They were described by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 and have been so frequently repeated that I need not further refer to them.  
     
      
    32 I have found this a difficult matter to resolve. The circumstances of the offence were serious. The complainant suffered severe injury and must have been terrified. Mr Jackson had also been put in fear. But for the applicant’s mental illness a longer sentence than was imposed would have been appropriate. 
     
      
    33 The evidence before the sentencing judge confirmed that the respondent committed his crime at a time when he was debilitated by psychiatric illness. He was abusing himself by excessive drinking and his life was generally falling apart. He was on the verge of suicide. The evidence before this Court indicates that he is making progress within the prison system, his psychiatric condition has been treated and he has come to understand the serious nature of his offending. Mindful of the respondent’s psychiatric condition and the inhibitions on this Court in intervening in a Crown appeal against sentence I have ultimately come to the opinion that the Crown appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
    34 JAMES J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    35 ADAMS J: I have read the judgment in draft of the Chief Judge at Common Law and agree with it and his Honour’s proposed orders. I wish, however, to add some remarks of my own. 
     
      
    36 The learned sentencing judge summarised the evidence about the respondent’s mental state in a way that indicated that she accepted it, going on to say –  
     
      
       
        
        “It has been submitted to me that the level of his mental illness and alcohol abuse are such as to reduce his moral responsibility  
        in respect of subjective circumstances 
         by providing an explanation as to his behaviour and it has also been pointed out that he has shown some responsibility since being in custody and has made plans for the future and has had family support.” (Emphasis added.) 
        
       
       
      Following a reference to the need to take into account the plea of guilty in considering the appropriate “utilitarian discount”, her Honour said –  
       
       
        
        To that end and taking into account the special [I think her Honour meant  
        subjective 
        ] circumstances which I find, being the need for rehabilitation, the fact of his remorse and also because of the mental illness, the alcohol problems and the like, I believe a discount in the range of twenty-five per cent to be appropriate”. 
        
       
      
    37 As the Chief Judge has pointed out, the subjective circumstances mentioned by her Honour are not factors to be taken into account when assessing the utilitarian discount; nor can any particular value be attributed to them in any similar way. The utilitarian discount for a plea of guilty or, say, for assistance to the authorities, is to be applied after all the other relevant features of the case have, by way of instinctive synthesis, led to a particular sentence. The discount, in principle, is to be applied to what would otherwise have been the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    38 Having regard to the indicative significance of the standard non-parole period, it is now important to identify with rather greater specificity than was once thought necessary the relevant objective, as distinct from the subjective circumstances of an offence to which such a period applies. A helpful (if I may say so with respect) description of the different considerations is given in Regina v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168; [2004] NSWCCA 131 by Spigelman CJ at 186, [86] –  
     
      
       
        
        “Some of the relevant circumstances which can be said ‘objectively’ to affect the ‘seriousness’ of the offence will be personal to the offender at the time of the offence but become relevant because of their causal connection with its commission. This would extend to matters of motivation (for example duress, provocation, robbery to feed a drug addiction), mental state (for example, intention is more serious than recklessness), and mental illness, or intellectual disability, where that is causally related to the commission of the offence, in so far as the offender’s capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act, or to exercise appropriate powers of control has been affected:  
        Channon v The Queen 
         (1978) 20 ALR 1 and  
        R v Engert 
         (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. Such matters can be classified as circumstances of the offence and not merely circumstances of the offender that might go to the appropriate level of punishment. Other matters which may be said to explain or influence the conduct of the offender or otherwise impinge on her or his moral culpability, for example, youth or prior sexual abuse, are more accurately described as circumstances of the offender and not the offence.” 
        
       
      
    39 As the Chief Judge has pointed out, the respondent’s mental illness in this case – given its undoubted contribution to the nature of the offending – was part of the objective circumstances of the case, with the consequence that its objective seriousness was significantly reduced from a middle of the range case.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender was indicted for the murder of Zoran Vujinovic (""the deceased"") at Round Corner, Dural on 2 November 2007. His plea of guilty to manslaughter entered on 19 March 2009 was accepted by the Crown in discharge of that indictment on the basis of medical evidence that established that his capacity to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition attracting the operation of s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    2 The offender and the deceased were both members of the Serbian community and had first met in about 1995 when the offender came to Australia. The deceased had come to Australia from Croatia with his mother on 9 February 1994. The offender attended Chester Hill High School and the deceased went to a school nearby. They subsequently lost contact until about two and a half years prior to the death of the deceased when their acquaintanceship was renewed. The deceased was concerned at that time in the cultivation of cannabis and the offender became involved in these activities through his association with the deceased. On 23 April 2007, upon the instructions of the deceased, the offender leased premises in Old Northern Road at Dural that were subsequently used for the hydroponic cultivation of that plant. 
     
      
    3 Both the offender and the deceased were involved in the cultivation of the plants. The deceased also told the offender that he had to sell tablets that were known as ""Nexus"", an hallucinogenic drug said to be well known at raves and dance parties. The offender was reluctant to sell these tablets and told the police that he borrowed money to give to the deceased to create the impression that the money was the proceeds of sales.  
     
      
    4 On the afternoon of 2 November 2007 the offender drove to the rented house at Dural. He did so approximately once every two days or so. The deceased lived close by in Old Northern Road, Glenorie and attended the premises every day. He arrived about one hour later. At about 9.00pm on the evening of that day the offender retrieved a shortened rifle from an upstairs bedroom in the house. He came down to the kitchen where the deceased was then located and shot him twice in the head. After shooting the deceased the offender left the premises with the firearm and met up with a friend for a drink at a hotel in Parramatta. He told the friend that he had just killed the deceased. The offender and the friend then drove to the Fairfield Police Station at about 10.40pm where the offender told the constable on duty that he had just killed someone. He handed the firearm wrapped in a jacket to the constable. The offender was arrested and taken into custody, subsequently interviewed and later charged with the murder of the deceased. He has been in custody since that time. 
     
      
    5 When interviewed the offender adhered to his confession and cooperated fully with the interviewer and with the investigating police. They had earlier attended the premises at about 11.15pm on the same evening and found the body of the deceased on the floor in the centre of the kitchen. He was fully clothed and was wearing two pairs of latex gloves. He was in a semi-foetal position and there were resealable plastic bags on the floor behind his legs containing cannabis. A roll of duct tape was on the floor in front of his face. 6 Examination at post mortem showed that the deceased had two gunshot entry wounds to his head. One was located on the left side of the forehead above the left eyebrow. There was no surrounding stippling, soot deposits or a muzzle imprint around this wound. The second gunshot wound was behind the deceased's left ear. That wound was surrounded by powder stippling. The muzzle of the firearm was approximately 10cm away from the deceased when the second shot was discharged. Police observed various quantities of harvested cannabis in the house and equipment consistent with its cultivation and supply. 
     
      
    7 There were no witnesses to the death of the deceased. The factual account of what happened came entirely from the offender. That account was wholly consistent with the physical evidence discovered by investigating police at the scene and with the results of the post mortem examination. 
     
      
    8 The offender took part in an electronically recorded interview with the police in the early hours of the morning of 3 November 2007. He said that he had done a terrible thing and had killed a man. He told the police that he was not a dangerous man but that in killing the deceased he did not have a choice. He said that it was him who killed the deceased and nobody else. 
     
      
    9 He said that he went to the house on the day of the shooting and had been there approximately long enough to smoke a packet of cigarettes before the deceased arrived. He said that he had to be at the house because the deceased had told him to be there. He said that he was scared of the deceased who had threatened to kill his family if he did not do as he was told. The deceased wanted him to ""sell drugs to the kids"".  
     
      
    10 The gun used for the killing belonged to the deceased. He kept it next to a bed in the house. The offender had first been shown the gun by the deceased about two months earlier. It was loaded at that time. While waiting for the deceased to arrive at the house the offender was thinking and planning how to ask the deceased to let him go so that he could lead a normal life.  
     
      
    11 The offender said that the thing that led him to get the gun on the day was that the deceased had told him to forget about his wife and daughter. He said, ""He molested me so many times"". The context in which these things were said appears from other material in the record of interview, which in summary amounts to a recitation of attempts by the offender to break free from the influence of the deceased and the deceased's threats to the offender and his family if he decided or attempted to do so. On occasions when the offender had asked the deceased to let him go, the offender said the deceased would just laugh at him and would say that he ""didn't give a shit"" about the offender's wife or child. 
     
      
    12 The offender described how he felt when he shot the deceased. He said, ""I was so scared that he was going to do something to me. I felt relief when he fell down. I felt big time relief, big time, big time relief. Sorry to say that. I'm honestly, I'm sorry to say that"". He said later, ""He took my life. I didn't took [sic] his life. He took mine"". 
     
      
    13 From there the offender went to an Irish pub in Parramatta where he remained drinking for about half an hour with his friend. He left the gun in his friend's car at this time. He said that he had decided to turn himself in to the police as soon as he shot the deceased.  
     
      
    14 He told the police that meeting up with the deceased again after a number of years occurred by chance and was something that he regretted. He said, ""I wish I broke my legs that . . .day, both of them"". They started going for coffee together after that and somehow it got to the stage where the offender felt that he could not leave. The offender was at that time a production supervisor in full time work and was held in high regard by his employer. About five or six months before the incident he had been offered a better job on higher wages with another employer, which he accepted. However, because of all the things that were happening to him with the deceased he was unable to concentrate on that work and in his words he ""blew it"". He said he missed a lot of days because of things he had to do ""down there"". For example, he had to drive the deceased to various locations to deliver packages or do so himself. He was not paid for this. He said that he made these deliveries for the deceased without getting paid because he was scared for his life and his family. He said he was scared less for himself than for his wife and daughter and his brothers. The deceased had threatened to kill what the offender described as ""the entire of my family"". 
     
      
    15 Significantly the offender said that the most recent time that the deceased had threatened him in this was the day of the shooting. He had said to the offender to forget about his wife and daughter. The deceased had said to him, ""Fuck them"". The offender said that he ""didn't have a choice"". He said, ""I didn't have any more money, didn't have any more anything to give him"". He described his life under the influence and pressure from the deceased as ""disaster"". He said, in effect, that even if he had a theoretical choice between the work that he was doing for the deceased and a life with his wife and daughter, it was in truth no choice at all because he had to do what the deceased told him to do. 
     
      
    16 On the day of the shooting the deceased and the offender conversed at the house in Serbian. After being told that he had to choose between his family and the deceased, he told the police, ""That was it. I couldn't stand, something blocked. I couldn't stand it. That was it. That was it"". From that point the offender went upstairs to get the gun. He said that at that point he ""was thinking about [his] baby daughter, about [his] baby"". He said, ""I was thinking about my baby. I wasn't thinking about me"". 
     
      
    17 The offender was asked what he had been thinking about when he approached the deceased with the gun. He said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Nothing. About my daughter. When he fell, I felt the relief that he can't hurt my baby. I wasn't happy. I don't feel sorry for him. I feel sorry for others. I feel sorry for other people. All my family, his family."" 
        
       
      
    18 The offender was asked whether he regretted the fact that he had shot the deceased. The offender replied, ""I didn't have a choice. I didn't have a choice"". Later, in the context of asking to be placed in a cell by himself, the offender said, ""I murder"". This is referred to below in the context of contrition and remorse. 
     
      
    19 Sergeant Whitton had been rostered on duty at the Fairfield Police Station on the evening of 2 November 2007. He described seeing the offender at the station when he returned from another call at about 11.10pm. The offender was then seated on the floor and was wearing handcuffs. He said that the offender appeared very upset. His eyes were red as if he had been crying. He continually stared at the walls. He repeatedly asked for a drink and a smoke. At one point he heard the offender say, ""I can't sell drugs to kids, I have a ten months [old] daughter"". Sergeant Whitton said that he heard the offender say several times that he did not wish to sell drugs to kids. The offender said to the sergeant at one stage, ""I shoot once. Then he was down. Then I go one more. To make sure"". The offender demonstrated firing a gun with his hands as he said these words. 
     
      
    20 The offender was born in Serbia on 26 October 1975. He is married with a young daughter. His parents are still alive and live in Sydney. They have three sons of whom the offender is the eldest. The family came to Australia on 18 August 1995 as refugees from the war in Bosnia. The offender's father had been a serving police officer for 22 years before coming to Australia. His mother has since written and published a series of books in the Serbian language that have been sold and distributed mainly in her homeland. The offender's first brother is a financial controller and TAFE lecturer and is soon to qualify as a CPA. The offender's younger brother is also an accountant working in banking. He has represented Australia playing indoor soccer. He gave evidence and described the family as very close. He said that the offender had on many occasions described to him what he had done as something he was going to have to live with for the rest of his life and as ""something he will never be able to avoid"". The offender was made bankrupt following his arrest with debts of approximately $50,000. 
     
      
    21 The offender did not give evidence before me. Apart from the offender's brother there was no other oral evidence. 
     
      
    22 Section 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 provides that murder is to be reduced to manslaughter where a person's capacity to understand events, or to judge whether the persons actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, provided that the impairment was ""so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter"". This was formerly referred to as ""diminished responsibility"". The scope of the defence has narrowed since legislative amendment in 1997 but the cases concerning diminished responsibility remain relevant on the question of sentence. 
     
      
    23 As in the case of manslaughter by reason of provocation, what is ordinarily involved in substantial impairment cases is a conclusion that the taking of human life was the consequence of a deliberate and voluntary act, performed with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, or with reckless indifference to human life: R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, unreported). The abnormality of mind diminishes but does not negate the offender's responsibility: R v Blacklidge (supra); R v Dawes [2004] NSWCCA 363 at [34]; R v Low (1991) 57 A Crim R 8 at 17.  
     
      
    24 It is clear in the present case that the offender acted with an intention to kill. The firing of the second shot, and the offender's expressed reason for doing so, is a further indication of this if any further indication were needed. It becomes necessary for me to consider the degree to which the offender's mental condition was impaired beyond that required to make out the partial defence. While a high degree of impairment suggests a corresponding reduction in or diminution of culpability, it may also raise the spectre of future dangerousness. I note immediately that the Crown makes no submission that the offender poses any risk to the general community and I would find even in the absence of such a concession that the offender's propensities that led to the commission of the present offence were at all times specifically directed only to the deceased. 
     
      
    25 Dr Olav Nielssen prepared a psychiatric report dated 26 February 2009 regarding the offender, who he interviewed for that purpose at Parklea Correctional Centre on 18 December 2008 and again by audiovisual link on 29 January 2009. He took a history from the offender that is consistent with those matters to which reference has already been made. 
     
      
    26 The offender told Dr Nielssen that the deceased was ""a good person to know because everybody was scared of him"". The offender told the doctor that he knew the deceased to be a violent and aggressive person when he was a teenager and was feared by people who knew him in Australia. He reaffirmed his regret at having renewed contact with the deceased in about 2005 even though at that time in 2005 it appeared to the offender that the deceased had changed and ""seemed like normal guy"". 
     
      
    27 Dr Nielssen was told that the deceased took the offender to a house and showed him a hydroponic cannabis operation but threatened to harm him if he told anyone about it. At a later meeting the deceased slapped him and said ""what you think I show you . . . wake up . . . it's not a game . . . I know all about you"". The offender told the doctor, ""at this point my nightmare starts"". The deceased used a mixture of manipulation and threats to get him to participate in his drug growing activity. He said, ""there was not much pressure at first but I didn't know how to get rid of him"". 
     
      
    28 The deceased subsequently increased the pressure on the offender and required him to rent the house. The deceased told him, ""one last favour and then I'll let you go"". The offender told Dr Nielssen that he had associates who could kill him and kill his family. He repeated the story of having borrowed money to provide to the deceased as if it were the proceeds of drug sales. The offender said that he became increasingly concerned and anxious about his situation and worried that if things went wrong he could end up in gaol or disgraced. The deceased was increasingly aggressive and assaulted him several times. When asked why he did not simply leave the situation he told the doctor that he was ""too scared"" and felt as though he could not escape. 
     
      
    29 The offender reported a history of suicide in his mother's family (his maternal great grandmother) and in his father's family (his paternal great uncle). The offender reported intrusive, unwanted recollections of his wartime experiences in Bosnia including evacuation to a village close to the front line and seeing injured troops. He also reported a distressing memory of hearing a person being interrogated and then murdered in the cellar of a house where he had taken shelter. 
     
      
    30 He also reported symptoms of depression in the period before the offence, including disturbed sleep, anxiety and morbid thoughts, including thoughts of suicide, although he denied seriously contemplating this because of his family. He took ecstasy and drank in the mornings to help control his anxiety. He did not seek treatment. 
     
      
    31 The offender said that he had not been a heavy drinker until about six months before the offence and had not used illicit drugs until shortly beforehand. His alcohol intake increased to between half a bottle and a bottle of scotch per day, including drinks in the morning to help control anxiety. He had not abused illicit drugs until several months before the offence when he started taking ecstasy given to him by the deceased to sell. He estimated that he had taken a total of about 50 such tablets. 
     
      
    32 Dr Nielssen diagnosed the offender to be suffering from a substance abuse disorder in remission and adjustment disorder with depressed mood. Part of the detailed opinion that he offered is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The diagnosis of adjustment disorder, or a clinically significant level of depression in response to a life event, was based on [the offender's] account of severe anxiety and depression in the months before the offence. It is difficult to separate the effect of the reported intimidation by [the deceased] from the effect of drugs that are known to trigger symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, the distress reported by [the offender] when recounting the events more than a year afterwards suggests that at least part of his symptoms were due to his circumstances. 
         
         
        [The offender] demonstrated an adequate understanding of the charges [sic], the evidence in the case, and was assessed as being able to understand legal advice, including advice regarding legal procedure and to be able to follow any proceedings in a general sense without the assistance of an interpreter. 
         
         
        [The offender] did not report committing the offence in response to symptoms of mental illness and was not thought to have a major mental illness. 
         
         
        He had an underlying condition within the meaning of Section 23A of the Crimes Act in the form of a depressive illness arising from his circumstances in the months before his arrest. His mood state is evident in his attending a police station to confess and the quality of his answers in the ERISP. Severe depression can result in a morbid appraisal of a person's view of their circumstances and impairment in problem solving and in their capacity to consider alternative courses of action. 
         
         
        [The offender] was assessed to be moderately depressed at the time of the recent interview and to be likely to benefit from treatment for depression with either counselling or with antidepressant medication."" 
        
       
      
    33 Dr Jeremy O'Dea examined the offender at the request of the Crown at the Parklea Correctional Centre on 11 March 2009 over the course of approximately two hours and prepared a report dated 17 March 2009. It is sufficient to observe for presently relevant purposes that Dr O'Dea recorded histories in categories referred to by Dr Nielssen that were identical or substantially similar to those recorded in Dr Nielssen's report. This included a history of the events leading up to the offence and the commission of the offence. Dr O'Dea did not diagnose the offender as suffering from a major psychiatric illness at the time of his examination but went on to express the following opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        ""41. However, he gave a history, supported by others and the ERISP, of a Depressive Disorder in the 2 to 6 months leading up to the alleged offence, and at the time of the alleged offence, that he related directly to the stressors of his association with the [deceased] and the alleged threats made by this person against [the offender's] family. This Depressive Disorder is likely to be best understood as an Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood. 
         
         
        42. He also gave a history in this 6 months period of alcohol and presumed amphetamine use disorder. His history of substance abuse leading up to the alleged offence is likely to have significantly contributed to the development of his Depressive Disorder. In addition, and from his account of his substance use on the day of the alleged offence, it is highly likely that he would have been intoxicated at the time of the alleged offence. 
         
         
        43. At the time of our interview it was apparent that [the offender] was continuing to suffer from symptoms of depression in response to his current predicament, despite his history of substance use disorder being in apparent remission. 
         
         
        44. [The offender's] Depressive Disorder may be considered an underlying condition within the meaning of Section 23A of the New South Wales Crimes Act 1900, with his reported depressed state at the time of the alleged offence constituting an abnormality of mind that may have, at least to a significant extent, impaired his ability to control himself at the time of the alleged offence. 
         
         
        45. However, his reported alcohol and other drug intake at the time of the alleged offence was also likely to have substantially and significantly [affected] his mental state and substantially and significantly impaired his ability to control himself at the time of the alleged offence. The relative contribution of his alcohol and other drug use to his mental state at the time of the alleged offence and to his ability to control his actions in relation to the alleged offence, compared to the contribution of his psychiatric diagnosis of a Depressive Disorder in understanding his mental state at the time, is difficult to quantify but likely to be significant. 
         
         
        46. Regardless of the outcome of the criminal proceedings, [the offender] will require ongoing support to help him cope with the stressors he now faces."" 
        
       
      
    34 In R v Low (supra) at 18-19, Lee CJ at CL said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A finding of diminished responsibility may occur in many many circumstances, excessive alcoholism causing brain damage, injury to the brain, mental condition arising in various ways and giving rise to delusions and the like, but such conditions do not deny the legal responsibility of the person concerned for criminal acts and the legislation has required that such a killing shall be seen as an unlawful homicide. The taking of life in circumstances other than in self-defence or by accident, is regarded in our community as a grave crime and notwithstanding the concession that a lesser crime than murder is committed when there is diminished responsibility under s 23 
        A 
        , it is wrong to approach the matter on the footing that the killer, in such circumstances, is necessarily to be treated as if he lacked any capacity to control his will so as to refrain from causing the death of his victim. I repeat what was said by Sir Laurence Street in Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402.  
         
          
           
          'It has been said that manslaughter, perhaps beyond any other crime, is protean. The circumstances leading to the felonious taking of human life being regarded as manslaughter rather than murder can vary infinitely, and it is not always easy to determine in any given case what should be done in the matter of sentence. At the start it should be recognised that the felonious taking of a human life is recognised both in the Crimes Act 1900 and in the community at large as one of the most dreadful crimes in the criminal calendar. The courts have, however, over the decades gradually manifested a willingness to recognise factual contexts which provide some basis for understanding the human tragedies that can lead to the taking of a life. The manifestation of this humanitarian tendency is necessarily attendant by the utmost caution. It can be seen to be constantly written in the decisions of reports and in the enactments of the legislature that the taking of a human life is a grave action calling for a correspondingly grave measure of criminal justice being meted out to the guilty party.  
           
           
          In a case such as the present, where there is material justifying a degree of understanding and of sympathy towards the appellant, the task of sentencing is particularly difficult. It is necessary to evaluate the demands of the criminal justice system, the expectations of the community at large, the subjective circumstances of the person coming forward for criminal judgment and the interest of society in protecting itself and its members from criminal activity amounting, as in the present case, to the taking of a life.'  
          
         
         
        That latter paragraph, in my view, is entirely appropriate to sentencing when s 23 
        A 
         of the Crimes Act is called into question and, as I have said, it is quite wrong to take a view that merely because there is an element of diminished responsibility, which substantially impairs a person's judgment, that that is the end of the matter and that a light sentence must inevitably follow. "" 
        
       
      
    35 In my view this evidence demonstrates that the offender's degree of impairment was approaching the higher end of the spectrum. The degree of impairment that is required to come within the terms of s 23A must itself be substantial so that any comparison of cases to assist in determining where the level of impairment falls is to be limited by definition to cases of substantial impairment in the first place. Although the impairment may be less than total it must be more than trivial. The medical evidence suggests a strong connection between the offender's depressed mental state and the intimidation that he experienced at the hands of the deceased. His continued rumination about it as long after the event as his first consultation with Dr Nielssen was in the doctor's mind a strong indicator of the connection between the offender's condition and the circumstances that led to the commission of the offence. 
     
      
    36 It is not sufficient for the condition to be transitory or ephemeral. In this case the Crown conceded that the medical evidence indicated that the impairment from which the offender was suffering had an impact upon his ability to think clearly and to control his actions and that the condition had existed certainly over the days leading up to the offence if not for a week or so. I bear in mind that it has been held that medical evidence is not of great assistance in determining whether the impairment is substantial and that it is ordinarily a matter of common sense for the tribunal of fact: R v Trotter (1993) 35 NSWLR 428. 
     
      
    37 At one level it may seem odd that the offender, faced with the constant and overpowering intimidation to which the deceased subjected him, did not simply seek assistance from the police about it. However, two things need to be noted and compared. First, the offender was involved in the deceased's illegal activities that would have exposed him to potential criminal sanctions if he had gone to the police. Secondly, however, and in my view most significantly, the fact that the offender chose to take the life of the deceased as an alternative course of conduct, and thereby to expose himself to the certainty of far greater and more serious consequences, itself bespeaks as a matter of common sense that the level of impairment that afflicted him must have been very substantial indeed. As the Crown specifically acknowledged in the course of oral submissions, the medical evidence suggests that his thinking was so clouded by the time of the commission of the offence by his depressive state that the alternative course, which to a casual observer appears so logical, was beyond his (then) ability or capacity to work out, and became tragically coupled with the fact that he was unable to control his actions. In the words of the Crown's submissions, what may seem obvious ""in the cold light of day"" was not obvious or even apparent to the offender in the days leading up to and including the day of the commission of the offence. 
     
      
    38 I take it to be common ground in this case that I should find ""special circumstances"" within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 having regard to the opinions expressed by both Dr Nielssen and Dr O'Dea that the offender requires ongoing support to cope with the stressors that he now faces and probably also treatment for depression with either counselling or with antidepressant medication. It is important in my opinion that the offender has continuing medical support upon his release to ensure that his mental health is adequately and constantly monitored and where appropriate treated accordingly. It is also important to note that this is the offender's first time in gaol and indeed his first experience of any sort with the criminal justice system. It follows that the sentence that I intend to impose will entail a not insubstantial period on parole under supervision. 
     
      
    39 There are also a number of matters that are in the offender's favour that I take into account. These include his guilty plea, the fact that he has no prior criminal history, his expressions of remorse and contrition and his good prospects of rehabilitation. These are considered in more detail below. 
     
      
    40 Section 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 requires the Court to take account of the fact that the offender pleaded guilty and the time when he did so. In the present case the offender's plea of guilty to manslaughter was not entered until the day upon which his trial upon an indictment for murder was due to commence. In this respect it should be noted that he was not examined by a psychiatrist with a view to assessment of his mental state for the purposes of s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 until late in 2008 and early 2009 and that a report from Dr Nielssen was not available for consideration by the offender or his legal advisers until late February this year. The Crown's offer to accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter did not itself emerge until following receipt of Dr O'Dea's report on 17 March this year within two days of which the offender's plea was entered. 
     
      
    41 The Crown readily and in my view properly conceded that in terms of the utilitarian value of the offender's plea of guilty, the offender and his legal advisers could not in practical terms have entered the plea very much earlier than it was in fact entered in the circumstances. Moreover, the Crown also conceded that it had been given an indication in the weeks leading up to the trial that the offender intended to plead guilty to manslaughter in front of the jury so that the utilitarian value of the plea had to be considered as well by reference to the fact that the Crown did not have to prepare the matter upon the basis that there was a possibility of an acquittal. That was a matter that the Crown said specifically should be taken into account. The Crown submitted that a discount of somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent would be appropriate. 
     
      
    42 Mr A Webb of counsel who appeared for the offender submitted that the circumstances of this case were such that a discount of 25 per cent was appropriate. The offender's plea had a significant utilitarian value not so much for its timeliness as for its relationship to the offender's early admission that he had committed at least the physical acts that caused the death of the deceased. The extent to which the resources of the State had to be devoted to a lengthy investigation and prosecution was significantly modified by the offender's early admission that he had killed the deceased and his relatively early indication that he would plead guilty to manslaughter in front of the jury. 
     
      
    43 In my opinion a discount of 25 per cent is in order in this case. See R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.  
     
      
    44 The offender was entirely without a prior criminal history of any kind whatsoever. It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that his involvement with the deceased in the cultivation of cannabis disentitled the offender from being characterised as a person of good character. He preferred to describe the offender as someone who was not of unblemished good character. The Crown conceded however that it was only the offender's initial involvement in the deceased's drug related activities that was relevant for the purposes of this submission because at the later stages of his involvement the evidence makes it clear that the offender's participation was effectively against his will.  
     
      
    45 The Crown specifically acknowledged that there was no likelihood of reoffending and no suggestion of future dangerousness. There is no identifiable risk to the community from which it should be protected. Accordingly, the sentence to be imposed should not be increased beyond what is proportional to the crime because of some anticipated or theoretical risk of recidivism. The offender's history warrants no departure from this principle. Personal deterrence is a matter that I consider to be of no present relevance. 
     
      
    46 The offence was objectively serious, involving as it did a decision to take a human life. In the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality, general deterrence is a factor that is to be given less weight than otherwise would be the case. The offender is not someone whose acts offer up the foundation for producing an informative example that might illuminate the role of deterrence in the sentencing equation. Of course, considerations of general deterrence cannot ever be completely disregarded or treated as irrelevant: see R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48; R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. However, in the circumstances of the present case I think that it is appropriate to proceed upon the basis that considerations of general deterrence and retribution should be given a much reduced significance. In so saying I have not disregarded the matters referred to by Badgery-Parker AJ in R v Privett [1999] NSWSC 1076 at [2] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[2] The sentencing process is founded on well established principles which for present purposes I can conveniently take from the judgment of Allen J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Finlay J agreed) in  
        Regina v Camilleri 
         (8 February 1990, NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported):  
         
          
           
          'In seeking to determine in any case the sentence appropriate to a particular crime it is always of importance to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively. Unless that is done the other facts requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence cannot be given their rightful place. A sentence imposed must be commensurate with the seriousness of the crime in the sense that it should, having regard to the all the proved circumstances, accord with the general moral sense of the community. It should also serve as a sufficient deterrent both to the offender and to others. The purpose of that deterrence is to prevent the commission of such offences, and whilst justice and humanity require that the previous character and conduct and the probable future life and conduct of the individual offender should be given most careful consideration, those are factors which are necessarily subsidiary to the main consideration which determines the appropriate amount of punishment, that is the protection of the public. The fundamental purpose of punishment is the protection of society. Unless those basic principles of sentencing are adhered to, errors will occur.'"" 
          
         
        
       
      
    47 The good character of an offender is something that may be taken into account in mitigation of penalty. Whereas the courts have indicated that the categories of offences, in relation to which less weight should be given on sentence to evidence of prior good character, are not closed, I do not consider that the present offender is anything other than a person of prior good character. He has no criminal record. References tendered on his behalf from his former employers speak in glowing but credible terms about him as a trusted and loyal employee. I do not consider that his fractured involvement in the illegal activities of the deceased disqualify the offender in this case from any benefit that may be available to him as a person otherwise of previous good character. 
     
      
    48 In the same sense I do not consider that the sentence to be imposed should be structured in a way that factors in the recognition of a need for rehabilitation. The offender's medical condition and the need for ongoing treatment, as already mentioned, are matters that I have taken into account. There are not evident in the offender any entrenched attitudes or pathological tendencies that pose a threat to the community in general or anyone in particular or that require correction. Indeed, consistent with his expressions of contrition and remorse, the offender has ably demonstrated the existence of considerable and obviously painful insight into the nature and seriousness of his offending conduct and its effect on others. 
     
      
    49 The offender was assessed by Justice Health shortly following his incarceration. The progress notes relating to entries made by a mental health nurse were tendered in evidence before me. One entry made on 19 November 2007 is instructive and is partly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Dusan was a little teary initially but assured me he is feeling better, has a lot to live for and is well. His wife and daughter are visiting regularly. He is not as concerned about other inmates – just now upset with what he has done. He is expressing remorse and concern for the victim's mother. Keeps digressing to express regret, remorse and ask himself why he did such a thing."" 
        
       
      
    The Justice Health clinical or progress notes contain other references in cognate terms. 
     
      
    50 The offender also surrendered to the police within hours of committing the offence and made a complete admission of his involvement in all physical aspects of the crime. As referred to earlier, he even spoke in terms of ""murder"", which I take for present purposes to be his admission of the commission of the act that caused the death of the deceased. It is inconsistent with any attempt to lessen the significance of what the offender had done or with an attempt to construct an assessment or appraisal of his role that was impermissibly or inappropriately favourable to him in the face of evidence to the contrary. The only deficiencies evident in the way that the offender assisted the police are to be found in the emotional and psychiatric constraints under which he laboured, which were evident immediately following his attendance at the police station and during the conduct of the ERISP.  
     
      
    51 Indeed, in this last respect the ERISP records several occasions when the offender speaks in terms about his feelings for the family of the deceased in light of what he had done. These expressions of remorse are patently genuine, as the recorded interview makes plain. The observations made by the practitioners at Justice Health are eloquently and forcefully redolent of this as well. It is not beside the point also to observe that the offender spoke to these practitioners about taking his own life as a response to what he had done. 
     
      
    52 Although the offender did not give evidence before me, I had the opportunity to observe him in court during the sentencing proceedings. In particular I noticed his reaction during the evidence given by his brother concerning the fact that he had taken the life of another person and would have to live with that fact for the rest of his own life. The offender was weeping almost uncontrollably at one stage in a way that was in my opinion responsive to what was occurring and undoubtedly genuine. 
     
      
    53 The mother of the deceased was present during the sentencing hearing and spoke to me in an emotional and moving way from the public gallery. She also prepared a victim impact statement that I have read. The death of the deceased is undoubtedly a terrible and unending fact of life for her now and I have the greatest sympathy for her and for the rest of her family. Nothing that I have said in the course of delivering these remarks should be taken as in any way derogating from or diminishing the importance of the life of the deceased in the eyes of his family and friends who remember him. I am however mindful of the principles referred to in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 and R v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510, and I must conform to them. 
     
      
    54 Taking into account all the objective facts and all of the subjective circumstances I consider that the following sentence should be imposed. Dusan Maric, you are convicted of the manslaughter of Zoran Vujinovic. I sentence you to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 2 November 2007 and expiring on 1 November 2012, with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 2 November 2012 and expiring on 1 May 2015. The earliest date of eligibility for parole is specified as 1 November 2012.

      JUDGMENT (No. 1) (Re application by Accused for a non-publication order and determination whether prohibition in s.11 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 should apply to trial - see T10) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: The trial of the Accused is shortly to commence upon a charge of manslaughter of their infant child. Before the point has been reached where a jury is empanelled, counsel have drawn to my attention the provisions of s.11 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. Senior Counsel for each Accused have submitted that the effect of that provision is that there ought be no publication of the name of the deceased child, or anything which may tend to identify the deceased child, including the names of the Accused. 
     
      
    2 It was submitted that the Court should make a non-publication order with respect to those matters, for more abundant caution, to reinforce the provisions of the section itself. 
     
      
    3 It has been said that s.11(1) of this Act is self-executing, and that it is unnecessary and generally inappropriate for the Court to make a pseudonym or other order for the purpose of serving the policy objectives of the provision: Application by John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited re MSK, MAK, MMK and MRK [2006] NSWCCA 126 at [26]. 
     
      
    4 The Crown has submitted that an order ought be made under the section that would permit the publication of the name of the deceased child. That publication is opposed by Senior Counsel for each of the Accused. 
     
      
    5 I accept that s.11 creates a statutory scheme which extends, on its face, to a deceased child victim. So much is apparent from s.11(1A)(b), s.11(4)(d), s.11(4F) of the Act. The Act itself creates a scheme whereby publication or broadcasting of matters which would identify the child may be permitted if one of the circumstances in s.11(4) of the Act is demonstrated.  
     
      
    6 I note that s.11(4)(d) permits publication or broadcasting of the name of the deceased child with the consent of a senior available next of kin of the child in certain circumstances. Section 11(4F) provides that a senior available next of kin for this purpose, does not include a person charged with an offence with respect to the child. Indeed, s.11(4F) provides that a senior available next of kin who is charged with the offence cannot give consent or object to the publication or broadcasting of the name of the deceased child. Despite the terms of that subsection, I have of course heard counsel for each Accused on the application which, amongst other things, involves the proper construction of the provision. 
     
      
    7 The Crown points to s.11(4)(b)(i), which permits publication or broadcasting of the name of the person in the case of a person who is a child under the age of 16 years at the time of publication or broadcasting, with the consent of the Court concerned. For present purposes, that Court is the trial Court and it is for me to consider whether such consent ought be granted.  
     
      
    8 Section 11(4A) provides that ""the consent of the Court referred to in subsection 4(b)(i) shall not be given except with the concurrence of the child (or if the child is incapable of giving concurrence) where the Court is of the opinion that the public interest so requires"". Thus, the question comes down to whether the publication of the name of the deceased victim in this case is something which, in the opinion of the Court, the public interest requires. 
     
      
    9 The Crown submits that the concept of public interest in this section ought be considered against the background of the statutory purpose of the provision, which is essentially to protect against publication the names of child defendants, victims and witnesses.  
     
      
    10 The Crown points to the open justice principle, bearing in mind that this is a trial by jury on indictment in this Court, which ordinarily proceeds in open Court with no restriction on publication, except insofar as it is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice. The Crown submits there is no factor in this case which would suggest that publication ought not occur, and that the public interest in open justice is such that it ought be permitted. 
     
      
    11 It is submitted on behalf of the Accused that s.11 creates a presumption against publication and that, unless the Court is positively satisfied that it is in the public interest that publication occur, then the section ought operate to prevent it. It is pointed out that the position can be re-visited later in the trial or, if there is conviction, after conviction. It is submitted for the Accused that, although there is no child victim alive who may be directly affected by the publication or broadcast of the trial, the existence of the section within the statutory scheme bearing upon this trial is such that the provision, and its effect, ought not be displaced lightly. 
     
      
    12 I have had regard to the submissions which have been advanced by the parties. I accept that the primary purpose of s.11 is to protect the interests of child defendants, victims or witnesses from the impact of any publication which may occur. Of course, the section itself, as I have said, extends to deceased child victims, and thus it cannot be said that that aspect is external to the section.  
     
      
    13 It is necessary to consider the circumstances of the particular case to determine whether publication ought be permitted. That issue can be approached upon the basis that the deceased child clearly is not in a position to be affected by any broadcast or publication and the Accused, being the parents of the deceased child, have no right to object to the publication, at least to the extent that that is expressly provided for in s.11(4F) of the Act. 
     
      
    14 The Courts have made clear that the concept of “public interest” is a broad one. Ordinarily, the trial of persons for alleged serious crimes take place in open Court, before a jury, with no restriction upon the publication of the evidence. Section 11, of course, restricts that, but it ought be borne in mind that s.11 itself is a type of exception to the open justice principle. Where the child is deceased, it seems to me that the Court would look at the circumstances of the case to assess what the public interest requires.  
     
      
    15 The public interest ordinarily requires a trial in open court, with the open justice principle applicable, and with what is said in the trial, subject to any other specific application being made, being available for publication or broadcast. 
     
      
    16 It is clear that the circumstances of this case will involve evidence which will be challenging, in a number of respects, concerning the state of health of the deceased child, at times leading up to her death. It seems to me that the general public interest in open justice, in a case such as this, is a powerful factor and in my view ought lead to the conclusion that the Court should consent to publication or broadcasting of the name of the child. I am satisfied that, in the circumstances of this case, the public interest so requires. 
     
      
    17 Accordingly, I so direct. The effect of that is that the prohibition contained in s.11 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 does not apply to this trial.

      JUDGMENT (No. 5) (Re application by various media interests to publish or broadcast a number of photographs within Exhibit B; see T123) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: Application is made, through counsel, by Nationwide News Pty Limited, Fairfax Media Limited and the Nine Network Limited for the release of certain photographs which are in evidence in the trial, so that those photographs may be published or broadcast in conjunction with reporting of these proceedings by the media.  
     
      
    2 The application is confined to photographs 1 to 6 and photograph 15 in Exhibit B. 
     
      
    3 The Crown did not object to the application. Senior Counsel for each Accused have opposed the application. It remains a matter for me, as the trial Judge, to determine the application. 
     
      
    4 Although no reference was made to them in submissions, I should note that s.314 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides for media access to court documents for the purpose of compiling a fair report of the proceedings for publication, and that Supreme Court Practice Note SC Gen 2, entitled ""Access to Court Files"", touches upon similar ground to that raised on this application. 
     
      
    5 At the outset, I observe that there is no impediment to members of the media having access to the exhibits in the trial, including all the photographs in Exhibit B, for the purposes of compiling, for publication, a fair written report of the proceedings. The trial is proceeding in open court and there is no impediment to the media publishing the evidence given, and submissions made, in the presence of the jury. The present issue involves the additional step of the release of photographic exhibits so that they may, in turn, be reproduced in the media as part of a report of the proceedings. 
     
      
    6 As the trial Judge, I have a discretion whether to release the photographic exhibits for further publication in this way: R v Xu (No. 1) (2005) 152 A Crim R 17; R v Benbrika (No. 26) [2008] VSC 452 at [4]. It is necessary to consider the circumstances of this case to determine how that discretion should be exercised. 
     
      
    7 The Accused, Thomas Sam and Manju Sam, are standing trial for the manslaughter of their daughter, Gloria, who died on 8 May 2002, at the age of nine months. The Crown alleges that the Accused are guilty of manslaughter by way of gross criminal negligence arising from their failure to treat, or properly treat, or arrange for treatment of conditions from which Gloria suffered from November 2001. 
     
      
    8 On 4 May 2009, I declined to make a non-publication order sought by the Accused with respect to their names, and I acceded to a Crown submission that publication of the name of the deceased child ought be permitted in this case under s.11(4)(b)(i) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987: R v Sam (No. 1) [2009] NSWSC 542. I was of the opinion that the public interest required such a course in this case. In this respect, I had regard to the open justice principle and the rationale underlying s.11, being the protection of child witnesses, victims and defendants. In circumstances where the child victim was deceased and the parents were standing trial for her manslaughter, I considered that the underlying purpose of s.11 would not be undermined by an order that the provision not apply in this case. 
     
      
    9 Like Basten JA in Leach v R (2008) 183 A Crim R 1 at 3 [3]-[4], I consider that where the child victim is no longer alive as a result of an alleged criminal act, the purpose of the prohibition contained in s.11 is by no means self-evident. It is clear, however, that s.11 applies to such a case. Thus, it was necessary for me to determine whether the Court should permit publication by application of the public interest test in s.11(4A) of the Act. 
     
      
    10 The photographs in Exhibit B, which are the subject of this application, are a selection only of the photographs of Gloria which are in evidence. Photographs 1 - 6 were taken between 18 July 2001 and 14 October 2001 and depict an apparently happy and healthy baby. Photograph 15 was taken on 13 February 2002 and depicts visible signs of the condition affecting the child, albeit with the child sitting on a chair and with the condition not being as graphic as it is in the remaining photographs within Exhibit B. The media do not seek to publish other more graphic photographs within Exhibit B. 
     
      
    11 Ms Chrysanthou, counsel for the media interests, submits that the photographs form part of the evidence tendered in open court and that publication of them ought be permitted, as part of the process whereby the media may report the proceedings. Emphasis was placed upon the open justice principle, and it was submitted that the administration of justice will be enhanced if the media is able to publish the photographs. It was submitted that the photographs are in evidence, and that the jury have seen them, and that no good reason exists for the media not being able to publish them. It was submitted for the media interests that the order which I made under s.11 points to the public interest in the publication of the identity of the child, and that the photographs are but a different form of evidence concerning her identity, being pictorial as opposed to the written word. 
     
      
    12 As I have mentioned, the Crown does not oppose the present application and makes no further submission with respect to it. 
     
      
    13 Senior counsel for each Accused oppose the application. Each points to the heightened emotional aspects of this trial, and the risk of distracting jurors by reports which combine photographs of the deceased child with reports of what the Crown allege happened to her, in the hands of each of the Accused.  
     
      
    14 How should the Court exercise its discretion in this case? The Court has regard to the open justice principle. That principle has been described as a fundamental axiom of the Australian legal system: John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v Ryde Local Court (2005) 62 NSWLR 512 at 525 [60]. 
     
      
    15 In R v Richards (1999) 107 A Crim R 318, Spigelman CJ observed at 324 [37]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The public interest in the open administration of justice has frequently been reiterated. The apparent duty of the courts in administering justice according to law is to ensure that justice is done. All else is subservient to the discharge of this duty. In the ordinary course, court proceedings are conducted in public and exposed to the cathartic glare of publicity. Publicity of proceedings is one of the great protections against the exercise of arbitrary power and a reassurance that justice is administered fairly and impartially. As Lord Hewart put it in  
        Sussex Justices; Ex parte McCarthy 
         [1924] 1 KB 256 
        , ‘Justice must not only be done but be seen to be done’.” 
        
       
      
    16 The present trial is proceeding before a jury. The subject matter of the trial is emotionally challenging for all concerned, including the jury. Before empanelling the jury, both the Crown Prosecutor and I referred to the challenging nature of the trial given its subject matter (T13-14).  
     
      
    17 I infer that any publication or broadcast of the photographs, the subject of this application by the media, would juxtapose the photographs of a healthy child with a report of the decline in health and fate of the child. It might be expected that such images would be repeated, from time to time, as the trial progressed.  
     
      
    18 I have determined that the public interest requires publication of the name of the deceased child so that s.11 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 does not apply.  
     
      
    19 The principal concern which I have with the present application is the likely tendency of media publicity to distract the jury from their single-minded attention to the evidence adduced in this courtroom. I have directed the jury to disregard media coverage of the trial (T31) and to avoid discussion with family and friends of the issues in the trial (T32). These are orthodox directions to a jury in a criminal trial.  
     
      
    20 This is a trial with a very significant emotional element. The jury will be directed in due course (again in accordance with orthodox principle) concerning their duties and obligations, as a jury, to act impartially and dispassionately, and that they must not allow sympathy or emotion to sway their judgment. 
     
      
    21 Should the media be permitted to publish or broadcast photographs of the child, there is a real concern that the emotional aspects surrounding the public reporting of this trial will be heightened, and heightened substantially, and on an on-going basis until the trial is concluded. Of course, the jury have seen the photographs in question. They will be familiar to them. However, that is not the issue. The concern is the potential distraction of the jury by a heightened emotional level of reporting, accompanied by visual images of the child. This process, in my view, would tend to increase the level of enquiry and scrutiny from family and friends of the jurors, which could only operate to distract them, or tend to distract them, from their duties and obligations as jurors. 
     
      
    22 The risk of publicity during a trial is a well-known phenomenon in the criminal law. As the Court of Criminal Appeal observed in Skaf v R [2008] NSWCCA 303 at [28]:  
     
      
       
        
        “If a trial has previously attracted or is likely to attract publicity, judges are careful to remind jurors that they are to ignore any publicity. The contemporary view is that it is not necessary for the jury to be sequestered with exposure to the media thereby eliminated. We accept that jurors will be faithful to the directions given by the trial judge and, if they happen upon a media discussion of the events, will be able to discriminate between the evidence and media reporting of the events.""  
        
       
      
    23 The Court of Criminal Appeal in Skaf v R referred to statements by McHugh J in Gilbert v The Queen [2000] 201 CLR 414 at [31]-[32], where his Honour observed that a criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath. His Honour observed that on this assumption, which is fundamental to the criminal jury trial, the common law countries have staked a great deal. If it was rejected or disregarded, no one could have confidence in any verdict of a criminal jury, or in the criminal justice system, whenever it involves a jury trial. 
     
      
    24 The Court of Criminal Appeal observed in Skaf v R at [29], that the obligation which the law accepts is that an accused person's trial must be fair. The Court referred to a statement of Mason CJ in Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] 168 CLR 23 at 33-34 that it should not be overlooked that the community expects trials to be fair. 
     
      
    25 In Fittock v The Queen [2003] 217 CLR 508 at 515 [21]-[22], McHugh J referred again to the role of jurors. His Honour observed at 515 [21]:  
     
      
       
        
        “It is of course fundamentally important that juries decide cases impartially on the evidence and in accordance with the trial judge's directions.""  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      McHugh J observed, at 515 [22], that there was a time, not long ago, when juries were sequestered, but that the jury system has been evolving for centuries and that: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “Today, the ordinary rule is that, at the end of each day's hearing, jurors are free to resume their usual activities. Usually they are given a warning not to discuss the case with outsiders. If the trial judge learns that a juror has discussed the case with an outsider, the judge may discharge the juror and sometimes the jury itself. But it is a matter for the discretion of the judge who will consider what justice and the appearance of justice require.” 
        
       
      
    26 The jury is not sequestered in this trial. I should approach the present application upon the basis that the jury will follow directions which have been, and will be, given. However, the Court should be concerned to minimise the distracting impact of any publication to ensure that jury directions have effect and are not undermined in this case. 
     
      
    27 All of this serves to emphasise, in my view, the need for the Court, on the present application, to have regard to the impact upon the level of publicity of this trial if the photographs to which this application relates are allowed to be published. In my view, they would provide a significant distraction and place at risk the fair trial of the Accused. 
     
      
    28 I return then to the discretionary determination to be made. To prevent the media, during the currency of the trial, from publishing the photographs is, in my view, a small limitation upon the media's ability to publish the proceedings. I am satisfied that the publication of the photographs would tend to distract the jurors from their task, and that this is not in the interests of justice, the prime consideration which must guide the exercise of discretion on this application.  
     
      
    29 It remains open for application to be made, at a later time after verdict, with respect to publication of the photographs. In the circumstances of the case, and in the exercise of discretion, for the reasons which I have given, I am not prepared, at this time, to release the subject photographs contained in Exhibit B to the media so as to permit their publication or broadcast. 
     
      
    30 The application is declined.

    JUDGMENT1. Application is made by the Crown Prosecutor under section 291A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 for a direction that the proceedings be held in camera during the evidence to be given by the next witness. 2. The next witness whose name I will not record in this judgment is aged sixteen. She will give what I expect will be evidence to be relied upon by the prosecution as tendency evidence. I am informed that her evidence will be of alleged sexual assaults by the accused against her. I am also informed that she has all ready given evidence in a separate prosecution of this accused. That prosecution resulted in his conviction. In that prosecution the next witness was the complainant. Because she was a complainant in those proceedings she gave evidence in camera in accordance with section 291 of the Criminal Procedure Act.3. For the reasons that Parliament thinks it is appropriate that a complainant’s evidence be given in camera, I regard it as appropriate to close the Court during the evidence of the next witness who was formerly a complainant and entitled to a closed court and is now giving what I expect will be similar evidence in separate proceedings. 4. Accordingly under section 291A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 I direct that the proceedings be held in camera during the evidence of the next witness. I exempt from my direction a support person identified by the Crown Prosecutor who is the witness’s grandmother.

   JUDGMENT1 Timothy Adam Newton has appealed to this Court from sentences imposed in the Local Court. On 27 November 2008 he was sentenced by a Magistrate at Parramatta Local Court for five offences. He appeals saying that those sentences were too severe. 2 The point argued by Mr Leary who appears for Mr Newton is a fairly straightforward point. Mr Leary argues that the sentences were all dated from one date and failed to take into account a period of pre-sentence custody of about twenty-one days.BRYAN: Sorry your Honour that should be one month and 21 days.HIS HONOUR: That explains my note, 1M, yes. I was trying to work out what it is.HIS HONOUR: One month and twenty-one days. The sentences all dated from 24 April 2008. It is agreed between Mr Leary and Ms Bryan who appears for the respondent Director of Public Prosecutions that if the appeal on that point is upheld the correct date for the sentences to commence would be 3 March 2008. 3 I need to say briefly a little about what happened and about the crimes which were committed for which Mr Newton was sentenced. Three of the crimes were committed on 28 December 2007. There was an offence of possessing a prohibited drug. That is a crime under s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. For that crime Mr Newton was sentenced to six months fixed term to date from 24 April 2008. There is a crime of possessing a prohibited weapon without a permit which is again s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1988. For that crime the magistrate imposed a sentence of three months to date from 24 April 2008. Finally, there was an offence of possessing ammunition without a permit or authority. That is an offence against s 65(3) of the Firearms Act 1996 and for that crime the sentence imposed was six months fixed term imprisonment.4 On the day that he committed these crimes, 28 December 2007, police noticed Mr Newton was in a car in Surry Hills. They spoke to him, they became suspicious, they found that he had in his possession a lot of money in one-hundred dollar and fifty-dollar bank notes. They searched him and found a small plastic bag containing the drug MDMA acknowledged by Mr Newton to be “just a bit of speed”. They searched his car and found two black-coloured swords made of metal with sharpened edges which Mr Newton said he has for defence and also nine live bullets which he said somebody had given to him.5 The other two crimes for which he was sentenced on 27 November 2008 were intentionally or recklessly damaging property by fire. That is a crime under s 195(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. For that crime the magistrate sentenced Mr Newton to fifteen months imprisonment with a non-parole period of ten months to date from 24 April 2008. He was convicted of the same crime but regarding different property and received the same sentence. Both of those sentences were concurrent. 6 Once again it is important to note what happened which brought about those charges. The offences arose because of a domestic dispute between Mr Newton and his then girlfriend. The crimes were committed on 8 March 2008. After an argument had occurred at about half-past eight in the evening both Mr Newton and his girlfriend went in different directions but what Mr Newton did was to get all of his girlfriend’s belongings, including clothes, jewellery, photographs and furniture and put it in the driveway of the place where they were living at the time. He put the property very close to the house and the garage of the property and also near a car belonging to the neighbour. Police thought he used some sort of accelerant and lit the fire. The police described the fire as quickly gaining intensity and generating a huge amount of heat. The heat was so much that it damaged the garage and house of the place where Mr Newton was living with his girlfriend and the car parked next door. He was seen standing at about half-past ten that night watching the fire. The car suffered major heat damage to the entire right side of the car as well as to other parts. The garage door of the house where Mr Newton was living was damaged as well as the driveway. The damage to the house and driveway amounted to some $12,000 and the damage to the car to just over $2000. These two offences gave rise to the two charges that I have referred to. Mr Newton pleaded guilty to both charges.7 As can be seen from my description of the sentences they all dated from the same date. This was the basis of Ms Bryan’s submission that the appeal should be dismissed. Her argument was that receiving concurrent sentences for all five crimes already included a substantial element of leniency. The crimes were committed on two separate occasions, the crimes involving the fire damaged property belonging to two different owners. 8 I think her point is a very good one. Nevertheless I propose to take the unusual step of upholding the appeal for this reason. Mr Newton was apparently unrepresented before the magistrate when he was sentenced for these crimes. It was an oversight on the part of a no doubt busy magistrate whereby the sentences were not backdated to take into account the one month and twenty-one days of custody served by Mr Newton regarding these crimes. In my opinion it is important that any offender clearly sees that their custodial sentence has taken into account any period which they have already spent in custody which is directly attributable to those offences. This is particularly so if that offender was unrepresented at the time. 9 For that reason I propose to allow the appeal and to adjust those sentences accordingly despite the fact that it will make even more lenient the series of sentences which Ms Bryan correctly describes as already lenient.10 Accordingly the formal orders which I make in determining these appeals against sentence are these. Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review Act) 2001 I determine these appeals against sentence by varying each of the sentences. The variation is that each of the sentences will commence from 3 March 2008. In all other respects I confirm the orders of the magistrate.BRYAN: Court pleases.HIS HONOUR: Now I will probably separately, it’s a separate exercise, impose sentence. So you won your appeal Mr Newton, those sentences have been back-dated to 3 March.APPELLANT: Thank you your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Now I’m going to sentence you for the other matters, and once again there will be some talking and I will impose the sentenceFOR SENTENCE SEE SEPARATE TRANSCRIPT11 All right, I now return to my judgment in the appeal. I varied the magistrate’s sentences to commence them on 3 March 2008. As a result of that variation the sentences are adjusted as follows. For each of the offences of damaging property by fire Mr Newton is sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment. I fix a non-parole period in each case of ten months to commence on 3 March 2008 and to expire on 2 January 2009. The balance of the term is five months to commence on 3 January 2009 and to expire on 2 June 2009. For each of the offences of possessing a prohibited drug and possessing ammunition Mr Newton is sentenced to six months imprisonment to commence on 3 March 2008 and to expire on 2 September 2008. For the offence of possessing a prohibited weapon Mr Newton is sentenced to three months imprisonment to commence on 3 March 2008 and to expire on 2 June 2008.HIS HONOUR: So Mr Newton to explain that to you. Your sentences for all of those charges from the magistrate are backdated to 3 March 2008, do you understand that?APPELLANT: Yeah.HIS HONOUR: Three of them have expired for the drug, the ammunition and the weapons. They have all expired, the six months expired on 2 September last year and the three month ones on 2 June last year: they’re finished. And your non-parole period for the two fire damage ones have expired, they expired on 2 January this year. But you’re still serving the balance of parole for the two fire ones and your sentence for the two fire offences finishes on 2 June 2009, the other two 15 months sentences. So you got 15 months for the fire offences, they start at 3 March 2008 and so they expire on 2 June 2009.APPELLANT: Yeah.

    3 PRICE J: This is an appeal by the Crown against what is said to be the manifest inadequacy of a sentence imposed upon the respondent in the District Court at Parramatta on 14 November 2008. 
     
      
    4 The respondent had pleaded not guilty to a single count on an indictment that [he] on 15 December 2004 at Oxley Park did break and enter a dwelling house situated at 71 Canberra Street, and did commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely, assault Dean Phillips, thereby occasioning to him actual bodily harm, in circumstances of aggravation namely, at the time the said Abdullah Terkmani was in company with an unknown male. This was an offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. On 25 August 2008, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. 
     
      
    5 The Judge sentenced the respondent to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 27 August 2008 and expiring on 26 August 2010 with a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 27 August 2010 and expiring on 26 August 2012. 
     
      
    6 An offence contrary to s 112(2) is punishable by 20 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment applies.  
     
      
    7 There is one ground of appeal which is that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. The Crown submitted that there were a number of discrete errors by the Judge which provide some explanation for the manifest inadequacy of the sentence. The Crown argued that: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) His Honour was in error as to the applicable maximum penalty.  
         
        (ii) His Honour was in error in finding that this offence did not fall within the middle of the range of objective seriousness but fell below it and thus was in error in departing from the standard non-parole period on that basis. 
         
        (iii) His Honour was in error in not taking into account as an aggravating factor the threatened use of a weapon.  
         
        (iv) His Honour failed to reflect general deterrence in the sentence. 
         
        (v) His Honour placed too much emphasis on the respondent’s youth and prospects of rehabilitation.  
        
       
       
      None of these matters were advanced by the Crown as separate grounds of appeal.  
       
      
     FACTS 8 When sentencing the respondent, the Judge found the following facts (ROS 1-2):  
     
      
       
        
        “It was about 7.30 on the night of 15 December 2004. Dean Phillips was at home with a friend, Kristina Wren. Mr Philips’ house mate, Anthony Halliwell was away for the weekend. Mr Phillips heard the front door bell ring. He ignored it. It kept ringing. Mr Phillips looked through the front window and saw a man – the jury found beyond reasonable doubt that it was Abdullah Terkmani – standing outside the house. He was standing there with somebody else. Mr Phillips recognised neither of them. The men were demanding to know where Tony Halliwell was. Mr Phillips told them to go away and that he was going to call the police. What happened then must have been a shocking experience for both Mr Phillips and Ms Wren. It is a householder’s nightmare. Mr Terkmani went next and got a brick from a pile of bricks. He threw it through the front window of Mr Phillips’ home. He then produced a knife. He tried to get into the house through the broken window. The other man stayed on the porch while this was happening. Mr Phillips tried to resist Mr Terkmani getting in. The other man helped by pulling the curtain back. Mr Terkmani got in. He demanded that Mr Phillips open the door for his accomplice. Mr Phillips did so, opening the back door. The other man came in. Then they both started punching Mr Phillips with their fists. Mr Phillips fell to the ground and they continued to assault him. 
        
       
       
        
        The result of the assault was that Mr Phillips ended up with a black eye, a bleeding nose and a tooth that went through his top lip. This left him with blurred vision and a sore jaw. The men kept looking for Anthony Halliwell. The other man produced a syringe. He demanded that Mr Phillips and Ms Wren remove their shirts but they refused. Mr Terkmani who was in another part of the house came back at that time and suggested that they leave. The other man threatened the two with the syringe but then left with Mr Terkmani. A neighbour called the police who arrived a short time afterwards.  
        
       
       
        
        Mr Terkmani got away but was detected to be the offender because he had left DNA on the brick.” 
        
       
      
     Respondent’s subjective case 
     
      
    9 The respondent, who was born on 9 May 1985, was 19 years at the time of the commission of the offence and 23 years old at the time of sentence. He did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence and his subjective case was placed before the Judge by way of the tender of a Probation and Parole Pre-Sentence report. The report disclosed that the respondent was raised by his parents in a stable family environment. He left school in Year 10 but later completed a panel beating course at TAFE. The respondent had maintained relatively consistent employment as a panel beater. The respondent’s employer considered him to be a reliable and competent employee and was prepared to offer him a full time position upon finalisation of the court proceedings.  
     
      
    10 Ms Lalopoulos, the author of the report, stated that the respondent continued to maintain his innocence. She opined that the respondent had positive familial support and the support of the previous employer. The respondent, she stated, had displayed a degree of naivety when discussing the seriousness of the offence. He had strong work and family ethics.  
     
      
    11 The respondent’s criminal history relevantly reveals convictions at Fairfield Local Court on 21 July 2003 for offences of assault officer, resist police officer and intimidate police officer. For each offence, the respondent was convicted and ordered to perform 100 hours community service. On 24 September 2007, the respondent was convicted at the Gosford Local Court for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and placed on a good behaviour bond for 2 years under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This offence was committed after the offence the subject of this appeal. Dealing with the Appeal  
     
      
    12 The first discrete error alleged by the Crown is that the Judge stated in his sentencing remarks that the offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment whereas the maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment. The Crown contended that although his Honour indicated that the main issue he needed to resolve in the sentencing exercise was whether or not he was to apply the standard non-parole period, it was of some consequence to the sentencing exercise that his Honour started his deliberations with this fundamental error. 
     
      
    13 The transcript records that the Judge said (ROS at 1): 
     
      
       
        
        “I am sentencing Abdullah Terkmani for a very serious crime. The crime is aggravated break enter and commit serious indictable offence. The serious indictable offence is assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The crime is against s 112(2) of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900. The crime carries a maximum sentence fixed by Parliament of fourteen years imprisonment. Not only that, Parliament has fixed to this crime what is called a standard non-parole period. The standard non-parole period for this crime is five years.” 
        
       
      
    14 The respondent, however, did not concede that the transcript was accurate as neither the Crown nor the respondent’s counsel had remarked on the asserted error at the time of sentence. Alternatively, if the transcript was accurate, the respondent argued that it could not be assumed that the Judge structured the sentence around the wrong figure as specific reference had been made by the Crown and defence counsel to the correct maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment during the proceedings on sentence.  
     
      
    15 The transcript of the Judge’s remarks on sentence before this Court records that the remarks have been “revised”. The usual practice is for a sentencing judge to be given the opportunity to peruse a draft of his sentencing remarks to ensure that it accurately reflects what was said and to revise the draft to remove imperfections. When that has been done, the transcript is marked “revised”. It is evident that the usual practice has been adopted in this case and this Court is entitled to act on the basis that the transcript correctly records what was said by his Honour.  
     
      
    16 The Crown and counsel for the respondent drew his Honour’s attention to the maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment during sentencing submissions on 7 November 2008. The respondent was not sentenced until 14 November 2008. His Honour’s remarks on sentence were not delivered ex-tempore but were reserved. Notwithstanding the correct identification of the maximum penalty by counsel, I do not think that his Honour’s incorrect announcement was a matter of inadvertence. In my respectful opinion, the Judge erroneously had in mind that the maximum prescribed penalty for the offence was 14 years imprisonment when he came to impose sentence.  
     
      
    17 His Honour correctly identified the standard non-parole period as being 5 years and said (ROS at 1): 
     
      
       
        
        “The main issue that I need to resolve in sentencing Mr Terkmani is whether or not I apply the standard non-parole period.”  
        
       
      
    18 It seems that the Judge’s concentration on the standard non-parole period diverted his attention away from the maximum penalty. Sentencing Judges should bear in mind that consideration of the correct maximum penalty is not made irrelevant by the presence of a standard non-parole period and is fundamental to a determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed: Regina v Shankley [2003] NSWCCA 253. The standard non-parole period is but one aspect of a sentence: MLP v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 271. The maximum penalty serves as a yardstick or a basis of comparison between the case before the Court and the worst possible case: Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048 at [31].  
     
      
    19 The next criticism by the Crown was his Honour’s characterisation of the offence as being “just below the middle of the range of objective seriousness”. The Crown argued that it was not open to the Judge on the evidence to come to that conclusion. Another complaint was that his Honour did not take into account the threatened use of a weapon as an aggravating factor. It is convenient to deal with these arguments together.  
     
      
    20 During his sentencing remarks, the Judge recognised that he was obliged to consider where the offence lies on the scale of objective seriousness. There was, however, some confusion when he asked the Crown after commencing his remarks on sentence to identify the circumstance of aggravation that was “relied upon by the Crown in the prosecution.” It seems that the Judge was referring to the circumstance of aggravation that was specified in the indictment which was that the offence was committed in company. The Crown appearing on sentence had not instructed in the trial and the following exchange occurred (ROS at 4): 
     
      
       
        
        “Crown: But the notes I’ve got here was offender in company, offender knew persons in premises, knife, co-offender had a syringe, corporal violence -- 
        
       
      
     His Honour: Okay, all right.  
     
      
       
        
        Crown:  
        Threatened use of a weapon, a knife”  
        (italics added) 
        
       
      
     The Judge then recommenced his remarks on sentence:  
     
      
       
        
        “As will be apparent from the exchange which has just occurred I am not clear what the circumstance of aggravation was that was relied upon by the Crown before the jury but it could have been any one of a number of factors which [the Crown] has pointed to.  
        They include the following 
        .” (italics added)  
        
       
      
    21 The Judge then remarked that the offender: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) was in company; 
        
       
      
     (b) knew there were persons inside the house; 
     
      
     (c) was armed with an offensive weapon; 
     
      
     and that the offence: 
     
      
     (d) was committed in the home of the victim;   
     
      
       
        
        (e) was planned and regardless of the fact that it was not well planned as Mr Halliwell was not at home it was still not spontaneous or opportunistic.  
         
        
       
      
    22 The Judge took into account as part of the aggravating feature of the offence being committed in company that the co-offender produced a syringe. His Honour declined, however, to take that into account as a separate offensive weapon being used in the offence as he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent knew that his co-offender had a syringe when they entered the house and was absent when it was produced. In his Honour’s view this aspect of aggravation was modified a “little” by the fact that the respondent suggested that he and his co-offender leave the house. The Judge also expressly took into account that: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) the actual offence committed was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm carrying a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the offence was committed over a relatively short period of time and was reasonably short in scope.  
        
       
       
        
        (iii) there was clearly some motive for the two offenders looking for Mr Halliwell. There was a purpose in the offenders entering the house and in his Honour’s recollection “that purpose may have been related to their opinion about the character or behaviour of Mr Halliwell.” (ROS at 6)  
        
       
       
        
        (iv) the brick being thrown through the window must have been a terrifying experience for the occupants.  
        
       
      
    23 The Judge then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “With all those factors I need to determine where the case lies in the range of objective seriousness. My own impression when listening to the argument presented by Mr Gibson and Mr Todd was that this case clearly fell within the middle range of objective seriousness. However, I have since consulted some judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal on this offence. Those judgments lead me to what I respectfully regard as the surprising conclusion that this offence does not fall within the middle of the range of objective seriousness but falls below it.”  
        
       
      
    24 The Judge then discussed the decision of this Court in Regina v Joel Tory, Regina v Luke Tory [2006] NSWCCA 18 and said (ROS at 7):  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        In Mr Terkmani’s case the offence was similarly of fairly brief duration, although perhaps not as brief as two minutes. I expect the infliction of the bodily violence was spontaneous and unplanned in the sense that the men announced before they came in that they were looking for Anthony Halliwell. Although the motivation in this case was not as clear it was in  
        Tory’s 
         case,  
        there is some similarity in that the men were focused on finding a man whom they regarded as having a bad character 
        .” (italics added)  
        
       
      
    25 Whilst it is not entirely clear what his Honour meant by his reference to “a bad character”, there was evidence in the trial that the respondent and his co-offender had been yelling before they broke into Mr Phillips’ home “Where’s Tony, Tony the woman basher.” They were not referring to Mr Phillips but to Mr Halliwell. Mr Phillips repeatedly told them that Mr Halliwell was away at his girlfriend’s place up the coast which the respondent and his co-offender ignored.  
     
      
    26 The Judge went on to discuss the decisions of this Court in Regina v Millar [2005] NSWCCA 202 and Regina v Price [2005] NSWCCA 285 and said:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        But for those authorities I would have found that this offence fell within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. However, because the offence was committed over a relatively short period of time, because the planning was limited and the violence spontaneous, I regard the case as falling just below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.” 
        
       
      
    27 The impact that the decisions of this Court to which his Honour referred had on the determination of where in the scale of objective seriousness the offence lay is surprising as there was a deal of difference between the motives for the home invasions in those cases and the respondent’s offending. In Regina v Joel Tory; Regina v Luke Tory, the two offenders who broke into the house and assaulted the victim were motivated by the genuine belief that the victim had acted inappropriately towards the 14 year old sister of one offender and a genuine desire to protect her from criminal conduct (both sexual and drug use) that had the potential to cause significant harm. 
     
      
    28 In Regina v Millar, the motive for the offence was the offender’s concern and anxiety for the welfare of his 18 year old daughter whom be believed was being assaulted by the victim a 38 year old man. In Regina v Price, the offender was motivated by the belief that the victim had assaulted his father.  
     
      
    29 In the present case, the victim had no relationship with the respondent and his co-offender. He had the misfortune to live in the same house as the person for whom the offenders were looking. There could be no justification whatsoever in the present case for the breaking into the home and the savage attack upon Mr Phillips.  
     
      
    30 A determination of where the subject offence lies on the scale of seriousness of an offence of its type is essentially one of fact and as such is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v King (1936) 55 CLR 499: see R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 140 at [36]. The Crown, as has been indicated, contends that the Judge’s finding was not open on the evidence. Before further consideration is given to this issue, it is appropriate to consider whether the Judge failed to take into account as an aggravating factor the threatened use of a weapon.  
     
      
    31 The actual or threatened use of a weapon is an aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence: s 21A(2)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    32 During his testimony in the trial Mr Phillips relevantly gave the following evidence (T 20 25/8/08): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Q. And what did he [the respondent] do with the knife? 
        
       
       
        
        A. He started waving it around, I grabbed my curtains. I was just  
         
        waving the curtains around trying to keep it away and whatnot and he just kept on going. 
        
       
       … 
       
        
        Q. And you said that the person was waving the knife around and you were waving the curtains back? 
        
       
      
     A. Yep.” 
     
      
    And further (T 21 25/8/08): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Q. Now I think you said that the person who threw the brick asked you to open the back door? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yeah he had – he was inside, he had the knife, holding the knife up to me and made me open the back door up to let the other fellow come in 
        .” 
        
       
      
    33 There was ample evidence for the Judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent had used the knife to threaten the occupants of the house. The following exchange with the respondent’s counsel during the sentencing proceedings indicates that his Honour was apprised of that fact (T 7-8 7/11/08): 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour: …And the objective features in this case include company, knowing someone was inside, it’s not just breaking and entering and stealing the wallet or something. He’s waving a knife and the co-offender produces a syringe.  
        
       
      
     Todd: Yes  
     
      
       
        
        His Honour: Now sure your client terminated the activity in the house but he didn’t say “stop” which –you’ve just got him saying he said, “Let’s go, let’s go” and it’s the home, it’s the victims home. It’s not a break and enter into some commercial premises. This guy’s at home with his girlfriend and somebody climbs through a window waving a knife with somebody else who produces a syringe. 
        
       
       … 
       
        
        Todd: --- of course, he’s waving the knife, he doesn’t carry on with that to the extent that it could have happened which is to use that knife upon the people. So --  
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: That would be an example, you would say, of something which is --  
        
       
      
     Todd: Taking it higher.  
     
      
     His Honour: Yes.”  
     
      
    34 The Crown had earlier informed the Judge that as an aggravating feature, the offence involved the threatened use of a weapon, that entry was gained whilst the respondent “was waving the knife inside the window to force the victim back and away from the window to allow his entry.”  
     
      
    35 In the passage quoted at [20] above, the Judge was reminded during his sentencing remarks of the threatened use of a weapon and in referring to the factors the Crown pointed to, his Honour used the words “included the following”. Although he did not then expressly refer to the threatened use of a weapon as an aggravating factor, I am not persuaded that he failed to take that matter into account.  
     
      
    36 Notwithstanding the curious way that the Judge came to characterise the offence as falling just below the middle of the range of objective seriousness, I do no think that such a finding was not available to his Honour. No complaint was made by the Crown about his Honour’s findings that the offence was committed over a relatively short period of time, the planning was limited and the violence spontaneous. Although other minds might differ about where on the scale of objective seriousness this offence lies, I am unpersuaded that the finding was not open on the evidence.  
     
      
    37 The Crown also argued that the Judge failed to reflect general deterrence in the sentence and pointed out that the Judge did not mention the need for general deterrence in his sentencing remarks. The Crown submitted that it appeared that the Judge failed to turn his mind to this consideration.  
     
      
    38 Another complaint by the Crown was that the Judge placed too much emphasis on the respondent’s youth and prospects of rehabilitation. The Crown submitted that the Judge failed to mention that the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation would have to be guarded because he continued to maintain his innocence and had not expressed remorse. It was argued that this was a violent crime of considerable gravity which was committed by the respondent who was an adult. The respondent on the other hand submitted that the Judge was very experienced in criminal matters and there was no foundation for suggesting that his Honour failed to turn his mind to the question of general deterrence. The weight to be ascribed to the respondent’s subjective matters, was, it was argued, a matter for the Judge in the exercise of his discretion.  
     
      
    39 This was an offence which involved considerable violence, the victims’ home was invaded and they were both placed in fear. As the Judge said (ROS at 2):  
     
      
       
        
        “…[it] must have been a shocking experience for both Mr Phillips and Ms Wren. It is a householder’s nightmare.”  
        
       
      
    40 For an offence of this kind, the deterrent elements of sentencing must not be overlooked. The Judge did not refer to general nor specific deterrence in his sentencing remarks. A failure by a sentencing judge to make express reference to general deterrence does not of itself constitute error but might indicate that a proper consideration has not been given to the need for the sentence to act as a deterrent to the public.  
     
      
    41 The respondent was 19 years old at the time of the commission of the offence. The Judge accepted that the entry into the house which was “a dangerous and ill-considered move … probably stemmed from or had a lot to do with the [respondent’s] age.”  
     
      
    42 His Honour referred to the respondent’s considerable family support, his good employment history and having strong work and family ethics. He concluded that the respondent had good prospects of rehabilitation although that conclusion was “a little guarded because of the fact that Mr Terkmani committed another assault last year which led to a conviction in the Gosford Local Court of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.” His Honour found that the respondent’s age and prospects of rehabilitation provided him with reasons to depart from the standard non-parole period. All of these findings were open to the Judge on the evidence.  
     
      
    43 Whilst the relatively young age of an offender and his prospects of rehabilitation are important considerations in the sentencing exercise, it was incumbent upon the Judge not to give undue weight to these considerations in the balancing process and to have proper regard to the serious objective circumstances of the offence and to all of the seven purposes of punishment set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I do not think, however, that his Honour failed to appropriately turn his mind to the consideration of general deterrence.  
     
      
    44 In written submissions, the Crown raised the issue of incorrect double counting by the Judge by contending that the same subjective features of the respondent’s age and prospects of rehabilitation had been used to depart from the standard non-parole period and then to vary the statutory proportion of the non-parole period. I reject this submission. Whilst the Judge found special circumstances in the respondent’s youth, first time in custody and prospects of rehabilitation, there was no inappropriate double counting. It was the respondent’s age of 19 years at the time of the offending which was used as a justification to depart from the standard non-parole period and his age of 23 years at the time of sentence as a special circumstance. The work of youth and rehabilitation had not been fully done when they were taken into account in determining the application of the standard non-parole period: see R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 166 at [110]. In any event, the Judge was entitled to find as a special circumstance the respondent’s first time in custody.  
     
      
    45 Although the Crown has made good one of its arguments, the sole ground of appeal is the manifest inadequacy of the sentence. A summary of the principles relevant to Crown appeals by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70] is often quoted and I do not think it is necessary to repeat that summary here.  
     
      
    46 Attention was drawn by the respondent to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics. As the Judge noted in his sentencing remarks the statistics reveal that over 50 per cent of the sentences imposed for offences against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act were 4 years or less with over 50 per cent of non-parole periods being 2 years or less. Little assistance, however, may be derived from this statistical material as it includes sentences for offenders who pleaded guilty. Furthermore, as the serious indictable offence relied upon in an indictment will vary, a s 112(2) offence will cover a diversity of offending. The Crown also referred in written submissions to a number of cases none of which suggest to me that the sentence in the present case was plainly outside an appropriate range of sentence.  
     
      
    47 In my respectful opinion, the sentence imposed by the Judge was lenient and was probably influenced by his Honour’s misunderstanding of the maximum penalty. I would not myself have imposed such a sentence at first instance. Whilst at the bottom of the range of an appropriate sentence, I am not, however, persuaded by the Crown that in the present case a sentence of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years is definitely outside that appropriate range of sentence.  
     
      
    48 I am not satisfied that the Crown appeal should be upheld. Accordingly, I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

    JUDGMENT1. I had intended, in directing the jury, to give a direction about an apparent absence of complaint on behalf of the complainant. The last alleged offence was committed on 1 January 2005 and the complainant was interviewed by the police on 25 June 2007. There is no evidence of any complaint to any other persons between those two occasions, however it is common ground that there exists material, not in evidence in this case, to the effect that the complainant did complain to other persons before she was interviewed by the police.2. It seemed to me that s 294 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 applied. That is the relevant provision to apply in this case. That section applies according to subs (1) when evidence“is given or a question is asked of a witness that tends to suggest: (a) an absence of complaint in respect of the commission of the alleged offence by the person on whom the offence is alleged to have been committed, or (b) delay by that person in making any such complaint.”3. It is common ground that the complainant herself was not cross-examined to suggest an absence of complaint on her part or any delay in complaining on her part. However the evidence, as it stands, of the gap between the latest alleged incident on 1 January 2005 and the interview with the police about two and a half years later, amounts in my opinion to evidence that “tends to suggest” either an absence of complaint or a delay in making complaint on the part of the complainant. It is not a difficult statutory test to satisfy with the evidence in this trial.4. However Mr Gibson, who appears as the Crown Prosecutor in these proceedings, argues that s 294(2)(c) applies to prohibit me giving the warning that I had intended to give regarding a delay in complaining. That relevantly provides that in a case where this section applies, the Judge: “(a) must warn the jury that absence of complaint or delay in complaining does not necessarily indicate that the allegation that the offence was committed is false, and (b) must inform the jury that there may be good reasons why a victim of a sexual assault may hesitate in making, or may refrain from making, a complaint about the assault, and (c) must not warn the jury that delay in complaining is relevant to the victim’s credibility unless there is sufficient evidence to justify such a warning.” 5. Mr Porter, who appears for the accused, argues that there is sufficient evidence to justify a warning that a delay in complaining is relevant in this case to the complainant’s credibility. He points in his cross-examination of the complainant to evidence which discloses that she did not keep any notes or a diary about what had happened and that her recollection of the most recent incident was a lot better than the previous two incidents which are charged against the accused.6. There is also evidence that there were a lot of areas which the complainant could not remember. There is also evidence that the complainant’s memory about the time of one of the offences was not too good.7. Mr Porter also points to evidence in the case that the complainant visited the accused’s house every school holidays over some three years and claims that the sexual assaults occurred regularly. Mr Porter argues that such evidence is relevant to the complainant’s credibility, and Mr Porter points to the definition of credibility contained in the Evidence Act 1995. That definition of course is one which is relevant for the purposes of the Evidence Act as provided in s 3 of that Act. Mr Porter argues that the definition of credibility of a witness is sufficiently wide to make it clearly applicable to any context where the word is used. It includes a witness’s ability to observe or remember facts and events about which the witness is giving evidence.8. Mr Gibson, on the other hand, argues that the expression ‘credibility’ as used in s 294(2)(c) has a more limited meaning. Its meaning, he says, must be seen in the context of the subsection. S 294(2)(a) for example, provides that the warning which must be given relates to an allegation being false. Mr Gibson argues that credibility is limited to an allegation being false or fabricated. 9. I accept Mr Gibson’s submission. The law about delay in complaint in Australia took much of its subsequent initiative from a decision of the High Court in Kilby v The Queen (1973) 129 CLR 460, and to the Chief Justice’s remarks about whether to believe a witness who has failed to make a complaint at the earliest reasonable opportunity. 10. More recently in Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606 at [12], the High Court said that evidence of recent complaint was “admissible because of the general assumption that the victim of sexual offences will complain at the first reasonable opportunity and that, if complaint is not then made, a subsequent complaint is likely to be false”.11. It seems to me that the expression credibility used in s 294(2)(c) is in that sense and there is in this case no sufficient evidence in my opinion to justify the warning. There has been nothing put to the complainant about any delay in her complaint being connected to a false or fabricated complaint - that is of course not a criticism of Mr Porter who conducted his case in accordance with his instructions and with the, as I said, common position that there is material which is not in evidence about complaint.12. Accordingly – and in compliance with s 294(2)(c) - I do not propose to warn the jury that delay in complaint in this case is relevant to the complainant’s credibility.

    JUDGMENT1. In the course of this trial I received a note from the jury which I marked for identification 6. The note reads: “Your Honour I would like to request a copy of the transcript of the record of interview DVD of [the complainant].”[The complainant] is the complainant in this case. As I have made clear to anybody in the court, her name is not to be published outside the court, nor is she to be identified in any other way. This was a trial that - sorry it was three zero - what was the section?CROWN PROSECUTOR: 306 capital ‘I’ was it?HIS HONOUR: Capital ‘I’. Yes it’s not after a new trial being ordered is it, it’s a--CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: And Mr Gibson the complainant’s evidence was admitted under 306U wasn’t it?CROWN PROSECUTOR: The pre-trial, the recorded pre-recorded interview yes.HIS HONOUR: Correct.CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s right.HIS HONOUR: I will return to the judgment now. 2. In this trial the complainant’s evidence was admitted pursuant to a number of provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Under s 306U the complainant, who was at all relevant times a child, gave evidence in chief partly in the form of a recording made by an investigating official of an interview between the complainant and the official. 3. That interview was recorded on video tape; the video tape was marked for identification 2 and played to the jury. The jury were supplied with copies of the transcript of that interview which they had access to during the recording but the transcripts were returned at other times. In addition, because this was a re-trial, the Crown Prosecutor elected to use the provisions of s 306I of the Criminal Procedure Act and tendered as evidence in these proceedings, a record of the original evidence of the complainant. The complainant had given evidence in a previous trial. That evidence was given on 12 February 2009. The record was in the form of a DVD and it too was marked for identification. The jury did not have a transcript of that evidence whilst they were viewing and listening to the DVD. 4. The request by the jury for a copy of the transcript of the record interview, although referring to DVD, I took to mean a transcript of the interview with the police. In determining how to respond to the request by the jury I have been referred to and considered the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in R v NZ (2005) 63 NSWLR 628 and the decision of the High Court of Australia in Gately v The Queen (2007) 232 CLR 208. 5. NZ was a case where evidence was adduced by the Crown of the complainant and other young witnesses by way of playing various video tapes of interviews between the witnesses and police officers. In each case further examination in chief and cross-examination was conducted by questioning the respective witnesses. The video tapes of the interviews were tendered and admitted as exhibits. Transcripts of each of the interviews were provided to the jury. The video tapes were made available with the rest of the exhibits to the jury when they retired.6. The principal judgment of the court was delivered by Howie and Johnson JJ who analysed the relevant provisions of the then Evidence (Children) Act 1997 and authorities touching upon the provision to juries of video tapes which had been used as evidence in chief. Their Honours concluded at [194] that there was “no basis upon which the tape should become an exhibit because once it is played to the jury as the evidence-in-chief of the witness, it becomes part of the court record just as does a recording of the viva voce evidence of any other witness”. Their Honours drew support for that conclusion from the wording of the provisions which were relevant in that case. Their Honours contrasted the wording of the relevant provisions of the Evidence (Children) Act in that case with s 306B of the Criminal (Procedure) Act which provided that - 
     
      
      “The prosecutor may tender as evidence in the new trial proceedings a record of the original evidence of the complainant”. 
       
      
    7. Section 306B referred to by their Honours is in relevantly the same terms as s 306I which is the relevant provision in this case. I have not been asked to rule on the question of whether the DVD of the examination-in-chief and cross-examination of the complainant in this case should have been admitted into evidence as an exhibit. The parties agreed and I concurred that the DVD should be marked for identification. This occurred and, as I said, the video tape of the police interview was also marked for identification.It is not necessary to resolve that question by this judgment. 8. On the one hand, the contrast referred to by Howie and Johnson JJ between the two relevant statutory provisions suggests that where s 306I is being applied, as in this case, it is appropriate for the record to be admitted as an exhibit itself.9. On the other hand, there are powerful considerations referred to by Hayne J in Gately for such a course not to be adopted. Even if it were admitted into evidence as an exhibit, there would be a strong case for withholding it from the jury room as an exhibit, a power which Howie and Johnson JJ consider and regard as appropriate to exercise in certain circumstances.10. But, as I say, in this case the request has been for transcript. Howie and Johnson JJ discuss the provision of transcript in their judgment. At [204], their Honours say as follows -  
     
      
      “In the normal case of a witness giving all evidence viva voce and where a request is made by the jury to be reminded of the  
       
      evidence-in-chief of the witness, the judge has two options. The judge can use his or her notes or the transcript to refresh the jury of the salient aspects of the evidence or the judge could provide the jury with the transcript”. 
       
      
    Their Honours went on to observe in the same paragraph that they would expect that “normally a judge would not comply with a request to be reminded of part of the evidence of a witness simply by furnishing the jury with the transcript of that part of the evidence of the witness without requiring that the jury should also have the transcript of the cross-examination or at least reminding the jury of the cross-examination of the witness”. Their Honours observed that that should be done in order to maintain balance and fairness so that the jury should not pay regard to the evidence-in-chief without being reminded of the attack made upon the reliability of the evidence by the defence. Their Honours concluded at [206] as follows -  
     
      
      “We believe that no different approach should be adopted in relation to the evidence-in-chief given by the playing of a video tape. If the jury wants to be reminded of the evidence the judge could, instead of replaying the tape, offer them assistance either by summarising the whole of the evidence including all or part of the 
       
      cross-examination or by providing the jury with the whole or part of the transcript of the evidence of that witness. What is done depends upon the nature of the jury’s request and how that might be addressed with balance and fairness”. 
       
      
    Their Honours went on to observe - 
     
      
      ”If the tape is to be replayed or the transcript provided, the judge should caution the jury about their approach and warn them that because they are hearing the evidence-in-chief of the complainant repeated a second time and well after all the other evidence, they should guard against the risk of giving a disproportionate weight simply for that reason and should bear well in mind the other evidence in the case”. 
       
      
    11. Although I did not give them that specific warning, this was not a case where they reviewed the video tape or the DVD but they were supplied with a copy of the transcript. I did warn them that they had to read all of the transcript including the challenges which were made in cross-examination of the complainant.12. For the reasons which I have just given, I regard it as appropriate to respond to the jury request by providing them with a transcript not only of the record of interview with the police but with a transcript of the evidence-in-chief, cross-examination and re-examination of the complainant which was given at the previous trial.All right, that’s my judgment and I think we’ve now disposed of Mr Smith’s case. He’s coming back in July for the second proceedings. Nothing else?CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right, Mr Smith can be taken down.

   The Trial1 On 11 May 2009, the accused filed an election to be tried by judge alone and the DPP consented. I was satisfied that, before making the election, the accused had sought and received advice from a barrister.2 When arraigned on 12 May 2009, the accused pleaded not guilty to the following offences, each of which allegedly occurred on 2 September 2008 at Lavington: 
     
      
      1. Break and enter a dwelling house and commit larceny in the company of P and M. 
       
      2. Intentionally damage a freezer, carpet and wardrobe the property of the complainant.  
       
      3. Intimidate the complainant with the intention of causing her to fear physical or mental harm. 
      
    3 The accused pleaded guilty to a fourth offence of stealing a bottle of alcohol in the complainant’s dwelling.Outline of Evidence4 The accused lived in the same street as the complainant. On the night of 1 - 2 September 2008, there was a party at the flat of the accused and his sister. P and M were present. The accused became very intoxicated. Late in the night, a female partygoer observed the accused holding a black plastic object containing a set of five coloured lights. She heard the accused say something like ""I'm going to go across the road to sell these lights to Brett"". He mentioned trading the lights for drugs. The accused walked out of the flat holding the lights. He began to run across the road towards a block of flats. As he started running, P and M followed behind him.5 At about 4 a.m. on 2 September 2008, the complainant was at home asleep. She was woken by the sound of voices outside her bedroom window, which was close to the locked front door of her residence. Within seconds of hearing the voices, she heard the front door bang. Later, it was discovered that the front door lock had been forcibly broken. 6 Two young men (P and M) came into the complainant’s bedroom, demanding drugs and demanding to know the whereabouts of ""Ben"". They became ""manic"", yelling and moving in and out between her bedroom and the lounge room, which was immediately outside the bedroom. She realised that a third person (the accused) was in the lounge room. She could hear noises consistent with shuffling and things being opened, although she could not see what the accused was doing. Then he walked past her bedroom door and she saw that he was carrying a bottle of Malibu. About 30 seconds later, the accused stood in her bedroom door holding an object (consistent with the set of lights) under his arm and ""smirking"". Unlike the P and M, he didn't yell or rifle through her property. The three men left. 7 Within a short time, P and M returned. One punched the complainant and the other kicked her. One threatened her with a knife and the other threatened her with an uplifted ironing board. One threatened to kill her. The two young men then left.8 A neighbour observed the accused. He was carrying a bottle of Malibu and standing at the front door to the complainant’s residence. When asked what he was doing, the accused said ""One of me mates doors just got kicked in. Some young kid’s done it"". He ran off.9 The accused ran back to his flat and handed the lights to the female partygoer, saying ""Quick, take these inside."" She observed that P and M had returned. 10 When police arrived at his flat, the accused admitted attending the complainant's residence. He told Sergeant Watson: 
     
      
      ""We went over there to buy speed. My friend used to live there, Ben. He was in G. block. They went in saying where’s the drugs, where’s the drugs. They just kicked the front door in and smashed the place. I was there, she was so scared that girl. I saw what they did. I went in so you probably want to arrest me and take me to the station."" 
      
    11 The accused was arrested. He participated in an electronically recorded interview.12 I set out the principles of law that I apply and the findings that I make concerning relevant contested facts for the purpose of arriving at verdicts.General Directions13 The three charges to which the accused has pleaded not guilty have been tried together as a matter of convenience. Each charge must be considered separately and a separate verdict returned on each charge.14 The Crown has the task of proving the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt. The accused is presumed to be innocent of each charge unless the Crown proves him guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Suspicion must play no part in my function as the judge of the facts. If I feel that the accused may be guilty and even if I feel that he probably is guilty, as long as I have a reasonable doubt about his guilt on a particular charge I must return a verdict of not guilty on that charge.15 The Crown must prove each legal element or ingredient of a charge beyond reasonable doubt. The Crown need not prove the truth of each statement of each Crown witness. 16 In this trial, there is no dispute that P and M committed each of the offences to which the accused has pleaded not guilty. The contentious issue is whether the accused was part of a joint criminal enterprise to commit those offences. The Crown case on joint criminal enterprise depends on circumstantial evidence. Consequently, in this trial the critical issues are: 
     
      
      1. Whether the only available rational inference is that the accused was party to a joint criminal enterprise to break, enter and steal from the complainant’s premises.  
       
      2. If so, whether the crimes of intentional damage and intimidation were within the scope of the common purpose of the foundational crime of break, enter and steal. 
      
    Joint Criminal Enterprise17 The model direction in relation to a ""straight forward joint criminal enterprise"" is found in R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 556 – 557. 18 A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express. It may be inferred from all the circumstances. The circumstances in which two or more persons participate in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them to then and there to commit the crime.19 A person may participate in a joint criminal enterprise although he or she does not commit be agreed crime itself. If the person is present at the time when the crime is committed and is ready to give aid if required, that is sufficient to render the person a joint criminal participant. Mere presence alone is insufficient.20 Where the Crown charges an offence other than the offence the subject of the alleged joint criminal enterprise (an incidental offence), the Crown may rely upon ""extended joint criminal enterprise"". The Crown must show that the incidental crime was within the scope of the common purpose, ie that it was within the contemplation of the accused as a possible incident of the agreed joint criminal enterprise. The Crown must identify the mode by which it is contended that the incidental crime was within the scope of the common purpose. The scope of the common purpose is to be determined by a subjective test: McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108, Taufahema v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 152.Aggravated Break Enter and Steal21 In relation to an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal, the Crown must prove four legal elements beyond reasonable doubt.22 First, the Crown must prove that there was a breaking and entry into premises. To break into premises means to forcibly gain access. There was uncontested evidence that P or M broke the locked front door of the premises by kicking or otherwise forcing it open.23 To enter premises means to go inside the premises. There was uncontested evidence that P, M and the accused each went into the premises and remained within the premises for some minutes.24 The second element to be proved beyond reasonable doubt is that the premises were a dwelling house. “Dwelling house” includes any building intended for occupation as a dwelling and capable of being so occupied. There was uncontested evidence that the complainant and her friend occupied the premises, and the premises appeared to be designed for that purpose.25 The third element is that a serious indictable offence, namely larceny, was committed in the premises. The Crimes Act defines ""serious indictable offence"" as an indictable offence punishable by imprisonment for at least five years. Larceny is an offence so punishable. Therefore, it is a ""serious indictable offence"".26 To steal property means to take property without the consent of the owner, intending to permanently deprive the owner of her property. The Crown must establish some physical movement of property, that the owner did not consent to removal of the property, and that, when the property was moved, the offender moved the property with the intention (for the purpose) of permanently removing the property from the owner. There was uncontested evidence that P and M removed valuable property (including a mobile telephone, handbag and contents, digital camera valued at $400 and the DVD player) from the premises without the complainant’s consent. She acquiesced only because she was fearful. Through sheer good fortune, some of the property was later recovered. The only available inference is that, at the time when they removed the property, P and M intended to permanently deprive the complainant of the property.27 The fourth element is that there was a circumstance of aggravation, namely that the offence was committed ""in company"". Inter alia, if a person makes his presence known to a victim so that the victim is confronted by the combined force or strength of two or more persons, then that will suffice to prove the element of ""in company"" even if, as it happened, the person did not intend to physically participate in the offence: R v Brougham (1986) 43 SASR 187 at 191, R v Jacobs and Mehajer [2004] NSWCCA 462. There was uncontested evidence that P, M and the accused were present together in the complainant’s residence and that the presence of all three was made known to the complainant.28 Based on uncontested facts that I accept, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offence of break, enter and steal in company was committed by P and M. 29 The contentious issue is whether the accused was party to a ""straight forward joint criminal enterprise"" to commit that ""foundational offence"".Intentional Damage30 The Crown must prove two elements beyond reasonable doubt.31 First, the Crown must prove that damage was occasioned to a freezer, carpet and wardrobe the property of the complainant. Damage includes ""physical derangement"", but it is not necessary that the physical arrangement be permanent, or even lasting: Director of Public Prosecutions v Fraser [2008] NSWSC 244. There was evidence that a freezer was kicked and dented, the bedroom wardrobe door was kicked in and ""dented off"" its rails, and bottles of white wine were smashed into the carpet (inferentially, staining the carpet). Although the photographs do not clearly corroborate the complainant's evidence about damage, as her evidence was uncontested I find that there was minor damage to the nominated possessions, sufficient to amount to damage at law.32 Second, the Crown must prove that the damage was caused intentionally, i.e. that the perpetrator deliberately caused the damage. The complainant gave evidence that the two young men (P and M) appeared agitated and angry (she used the word ""manic"") when they failed to find ""Ben"" in the premises. From the deliberate and otherwise pointless nature of the conduct that caused the damage (kicking and smashing) and the fact that the evidence of agitation, I infer that the perpetrator/s must have intended to cause the damage that resulted. 33 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offence of intentional damage was committed by P and/ or M. 34 As the offence of intentional damage flowed from the foundational offence of break, enter and steal in company, the first contentious issue is whether the accused was party to a joint criminal enterprise to commit the foundational offence. If so, the second contentious issue is whether the offence of intentional damage was within the scope of the common purpose associated with the foundational offence.Intimidation35 The Crown must prove two legal elements beyond reasonable doubt.36 First, the Crown must prove intimidation. Intimidation includes harassment or molestation and any conduct that causes a reasonable apprehension of injury. For the purpose of determining whether conduct amounts to intimidation, any pattern of violence may be taken into account: s 7 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. The prosecution does not have to prove that the complainant actually feared physical or mental harm: s 13(4). In this case, taking into account the forcible breaking into the complainant's premises in the early hours of the morning, the verbal and physical threats that were made to the complainant when P and M returned to the premises undoubtedly amounted to intimidation.37 Second, the Crown must prove that the intimidator acted with the intention (purpose) of causing the complainant to fear physical or mental harm. Pursuant to section 13 (3), a person intends to cause fear of physical or mental harm if he or she knows that his/her conduct is likely to cause fear in the other person. Having regard to the nature of the conduct, which involved direct and unambiguous threats to the complainant by both P and M, it must be inferred that each intended to cause fear.38 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that P and M committed the offence of intimidation.39 As the offence of intimidation flowed from the foundational offence of break, enter and steal in company, the first contentious issue is whether the accused was party to a joint criminal enterprise to commit the foundational offence. If so, the second contentious issue is whether the offence of intimidation was within the scope of the common purpose associated with the foundational offence.Lies40 The Crown contends that the electronically recorded interview is a ""pack of lies"" in which the accused tried to distance himself from the joint criminal enterprise. The Crown relies upon lies as evidence of guilt. In particular, the Crown relies on the following aspects of the electronically recorded interview.  
     
      
      (1) The accused said that he went to the premises to obtain drugs from ""Ben"", who was living at the premises two months earlier. Upon arrival, the accused realised that Ben that must have moved out (questions 61 and 96). However, it was the complainant's uncontested evidence that she resided in the premises from January 2008. 
       
      (2) The accused said that, after he realised that Ben did not live at the premises, P and M kicked the door open and ran in. The accused determined that he would not become involved and informed P and M of his intention (questions 115, 315). However, the accused admitted entering the premises and remaining within the premises for five minutes (question 211). 
       
      (3) The accused said that, in the presence of the complainant, he told P and M that they should leave (questions 105 and 110) and that he apologised to the complainant and reassured her that he was not involved (questions 210, 214, 231). However, the complainant gave no evidence of hearing such statements. 
       
      (4) The accused said that he did not steal anything. He now admits to stealing the Malibu bottle. 
       
      (5) The accused told the neighbour that a ""mate’s door"" had been kicked in. However, the accused did not know the complainant. 
      
    41 A lie may be taken into account as evidence of consciousness of guilt only if it is a deliberate lie that relates to a material issue, it reveals knowledge of an aspect of the relevant offence, and the Court is satisfied that it represents an attempt to avoid implication in the relevant offence. If these requirements are not satisfied, then the lie is merely taken into account in relation to credit.42 In relation to lie (4), I am satisfied that the lie evidenced consciousness of guilt in relation to the offence of stealing the Malibu bottle. However, it reveals no knowledge of anything beyond stealing from within the dwelling.43 Lie (1) may not be a deliberate lie. Perhaps the defendant was just confused. The accused is inarticulate, he was extremely intoxicated at the time of the incident, and he was intoxicated and/or otherwise unwell at the time of the interview.44 As to the other lies, they are deliberate untruths. They reveal knowledge of uncontroversial aspects of the offence of break, enter and steal. For example, they reveal that the accused was present. They also reveal that the accused felt ""guilty"" about being present at the incident. He may have felt guilty because he led P and M to the premises where they wreaked havoc. However, the lies say nothing about whether the accused was a party to a joint criminal enterprise and they shed no light on the scope of any common purpose.Right to Silence45 The accused did not give evidence. He was entitled to exercise his ""right to silence"" and I draw no adverse inference from the fact that he did so. I am aware that his silence cannot be used to bolster the prosecution case.Circumstantial Evidence46 The Crown case on joint criminal enterprise was a circumstantial case. I am required to consider the established circumstances as a whole for the purpose of determining whether the only available rational inference is an inference that the accused was a party to a joint criminal enterprise to break, enter and steal from the premises in the company of P and M.47 Relevant circumstances include the circumstances that the accused attended the premises with P and M and, on his own admission, entered the premises and remained therein for about five minutes. The complainant did not hear any knock preceding the forcible entry. She was woken by the sound of voices. After the three men entered her premises, the complainant heard noises consistent with the accused searching for valuables in the lounge room. The accused stole the Malibu bottle. 48 Another circumstance upon which the Crown relies is that the accused stood at the complainant's bedroom door ""smirking"" and watching the two young men ransack the room. Given the accused’s presentation in Court and the fact that interpretation of facial expressions is always value-laden, I am not prepared to draw the inference that he was ""smirking"" in approval of the conduct of P and M.49 The Crown also relied upon the circumstance that the accused told lies in the electronically recorded interview. I have determined that the established lies cannot be relied upon as evidencing consciousness of guilt in relation to participation in a joint criminal enterprise.50 The accused contends that, on the evidence, there is an available rational inference that he went to the premises in a highly intoxicated state for the purpose of seeing ""Ben"", a person from whom he had previously acquired drugs. He intended to exchange lights for drugs. To the extent that his behaviour was irrational, it can be explained by intoxication. P and M decided to accompany him because they were interested in acquiring drugs from Ben. Of their own volition, they decided to break into the premises and, when Ben was nowhere to be found, they proceeded to ransack the premises, intimidate the complainant and steal her property. The accused did not participate, although he did use the opportunity to pilfer a bottle of Malibu.51 At first blush, this scenario seems bizarre. For the reasons advanced by the Crown in support of its argument about lies, I place little reliance on the accused’s statements in the electronically recorded interview. However, the scenario advanced by the accused does gain significant support from the evidence of two Crown witnesses. Importantly, the female partygoer heard the accused say that he was going to see ""Brett"" for the purpose of exchanging lights for drugs and she saw an object resembling the lights in his possession before he left and after he returned. Police found lights of a similar description at the residence of the accused. Further, according to the complainant, P and M demanded to know the whereabouts of ""Ben"", and when it became clear that he was not at the residence they became ""manic"". The complainant confirmed that, while he was present, the accused behaved quite differently from P and M. She also confirmed that he was holding an object consistent with the lights. Because the accused’s scenario is supported by the evidence of the complainant and the partygoer, I find that there is an available rational inference which is consistent with the accused being present at the break, enter and steal otherwise than as a joint criminal participant.52 Further, I note that there is insufficient evidence that any common purpose extended to the incidental crimes of intentional damage or intimidation. In this case, the intentional damage was caused by the gratuitous acts of agitated young men and was not associated with stealing property. P and M were responsible for the intimidating conduct. Such intimidation is not ordinarily or necessarily associated with an offence of break, enter and steal. The intimidation occurred primarily after the accused had left the premises.53 I return a verdict of not guilty on each of the three offences.

   1 The accused pleaded guilty to the offence that, between 1 November 2006 and 19 November 2007 at Griffith, he committed an act of indecency towards the complainant.2 On 13 May 2009, the accused pleaded not guilty to the offence that, between 1 November 2006 and 19 November 2007, he assaulted the complainant and at the time of the assault committed an act of indecency on the complainant by rubbing his penis against the complainant, the complainant being under 16 years of age.3 On 11 May 2009, the accused elected to be tried by a judge alone and the DPP consented. I was satisfied that, before making the election, the accused had sought and received advice from a barrister.4 The Crown tendered the record of a chat log on a computer belonging to the accused, and a record of interview between the police and the complainant. The Crown led short oral evidence from the complainant's mother and the officer in charge of the investigation. The accused called no evidence.The Evidence5 The complainant’s mother was acquainted with the accused, a swimming teacher. In early 2007, the complainant's mother engaged the accused to coach the complainant in swimming. 6 The accused invited the complainant and the complainant’s brother to his home for the purpose of playing computer games. The complainant's mother agreed. The complainant was very interested in computer games. Up to April/May 2007, the complainant attended the home of the accused on a number of occasions for the purpose of playing computer games.7 On 23 July 2008, police interviewed the complainant. He told them that, on occasions when he played computer games, the accused exposed his penis and masturbated in the complainant’s presence. The complainant denied that anyone had touched him on the legs, hips or butt in an inappropriate manner (questions 586 to 591). When asked whether the accused had done anything else to upset him, the complainant said ""he didn't do anything that would make me think he was a paedophile"" (question 520).8 On 15 December 2007, police seized a computer from the home of the accused. It contained a conversation dated 11/18/2007 between Matt> Jet Boats were awesome! When do I get to go again? and syd@hush.al (Exhibit A) as follows: 
     
      
      “Syd: hows (the complainant)? 
       
      … 
       
      Matt: hes getting so hot …he hasn’t been around in a while – I see him at swimming 
       
      … hes seen my cock a few times … ‘by accident’ Lol …he was lying on my bed playing xbox and I just walked into the room with cock hanging out of pants ‘pretending’ all was normal … looked a few times …Lol 
       
      Syd: you where so trying to tune him hehe 
       
      Matt: hell yeah I am … 
      I brushed up against him with my cock as well 
       Lol …very suttle … nothing at first, then he sat up n folded his legs 
       
      …” (emphasis added) 
      
    “Lol” means ""laughs out loud"".General Directions9 The Crown has the task of proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The accused is presumed to be innocent. As long as I have a reasonable doubt about the accused’s guilt I must return a verdict of not guilty.10 The Crown does not have to prove the truth of each statement of each Crown witness. The Crown must prove each legal element of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. 11 In making findings of fact I must rely upon the evidence and apply my common sense.12 An accused person is entitled to exercise the ""right to silence"" and decline to give evidence. I can draw no adverse inference from the fact that the accused exercised that entitlement. The fact that he did so cannot be used to bolster the Crown case.Elements of Aggravated Indecent Assault13 The Crown must prove three legal elements beyond reasonable doubt.14 First, the Crown must prove that the accused assaulted the complainant. At law, any intentional (deliberate, not accidental) and unlawful physical contact with another person is an assault. Physical contact is not unlawful if it is the type of physical contact that is generally acceptable as part of ordinary daily life, eg a tap on the shoulder to attract attention. Even a slight touching may constitute an assault at law.15 The Crown alleged that the accused intentionally and unlawfully touched the complainant by deliberately brushing against the complainant with his penis. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, if such contact did occur, it constituted an assault, as it was both intentional and unlawful. The accused did not argue otherwise.16 Second, the Crown must prove that an act of indecency occurred at the time of the assault. The same act may constitute both an assault and an act of indecency. The Crown relied upon the brushing of the penis as constituting both an assault and an act of indecency. An act is indecent if ordinary members of the community would regard it as indecent because the act has an unacceptable sexual connotation, taking into account all the circumstances, including the age and relationship of the people in question. 17 I have no doubt that, if an adult male deliberately brushes his penis against the body of a 10 year-old boy, then he performs an act that has an unacceptable sexual connotation according to the standards of ordinary members of the community. The accused did not argue otherwise.18 The aggravating circumstance upon which the Crown relied was that the complainant was less than 16 years old at the time of the offence. As the complainant was born in 1997, he is not yet 16 years of age.19 Because of the complainant's age at the date of the alleged offence, no issue of consent arises.Tendency Evidence20 Despite the absence of notice, certain evidence was admitted without objection. The evidence comprised the plea of guilty to the charge of act of indecency, admissions made in the chat log, and the police interview with the complainant in which the complainant detailed occasions when the accused had acted indecently by exposing his penis and masturbating in the complainant's presence. 21 I cannot use the evidence as tendency evidence unless I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence is true. Having regard to the plea of guilty and the fact that the evidence was uncontested, I am so satisfied. 22 The evidence shows that the accused had a tendency to behave in a sexual manner towards the complainant and to harbour inappropriate sexual feelings towards the complainant.23 Evidence of a tendency to behave in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind is not direct evidence that an accused in fact behaved or thought in that way on the occasion the subject of a charge. But it is a circumstance that can be taken into account when determining whether the accused in fact behaved or thought in that way on the occasion the subject of a charge. 24 I cannot reason that, because the accused behaved or thought in an inappropriate sexual way on other occasions, therefore he is a bad person and that, because he is a bad person, it is more likely that he committed the offence.25 When determining whether the accused committed the offence in question, I take the tendency evidence into account as relevant circumstantial evidence. The Admission26 As the chat log was located on a computer at the home of the accused and the chat log speaker was ""Matt"" (the accused’s first name is Matthew), I have no doubt that ""Matt"" was the accused. The accused did not submit otherwise.27 The only contentious issue is whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the reliability of the chat log admission.28 If I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the chat log admission was reliable, I could return a verdict of guilty based on the admission alone: McKay v R (1935) 54 CLR 1; see also R v Hatfield [1999] NSWCCA 340 at [39] – [41].29 The Crown submitted that, as all other relevant statements made by the accused in the course of the chat log were reliable (the statements were corroborated by other evidence), there was no reason to doubt the reliability of the relevant admission. Further, the Crown asked me to take into account the circumstances that the accused had a tendency to act in an inappropriate sexual way towards the complainant and harboured inappropriate sexual feelings towards him.30 The Evidence Act 1995 recognizes that admission evidence may be unreliable: s 165(1)(a). The accused requested that I “warn” myself that the chat log admission may be unreliable and of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it: s 165 (2). 31 I accede to the accused's request. The admission may be unreliable because of the context in which it was made. The conversation between the accused and ""Syd"" concerned their mutual sexual interest in boys. The apparent desire of the conversationalists to give and receive sexual gratification by discussing their sexual involvement with boys gives rise to a risk that the accused may have been bragging, exaggerating or fantasising when he asserted that he had touched the complainant with his penis. 32 In the conversation, the accused asserted that the complainant had responded to the touch by sitting upright and folding his legs. In effect, the accused stated that the complainant had been aware of the touch and had responded defensively. When interviewed by police, the complainant was afforded ample opportunity to disclose inappropriate touching but did not do so. He may have failed to disclose inappropriate touching because of embarrassment. An alternative explanation is that he did not recall any such touching.33 Having regard to the context of the chat log conversation and the complainant’s failure to make a relevant complaint, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the reliability of the chat log admission.34 On the charge of aggravated indecent assault, there is a verdict of not guilty.

    2 JAMES J: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    3 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon her in the District Court on 5 October 2007 following her plea of guilty to a charge that, on 10 December 2006, she imported a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, contrary to s 307.2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). By s 307.2(1) of that Act, a maximum custodial penalty of imprisonment for 25 years is prescribed for the offence. Nield DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months, commencing on 10 December 2006 (the date of the applicant’s offence and arrest). The non-parole period will expire on 9 September 2010. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    4 The applicant is an Australian citizen. In November 2006 she was recruited by a person involved in drug trafficking, for the purpose of travelling to Vietnam and returning to Australia carrying a quantity of heroin. She was given an airline ticket and $3,000 for expenses in Vietnam. She flew to Vietnam, was met at the airport, given heroin for her own use, and taken to a hotel. There she remained for about ten days. On 9 December 2006 she swallowed 53 latex-encased packages containing heroin. As was later shown, the packages contained a total of 332 grams of white powder, which in turn contained 242.3 grams of pure heroin. The applicant flew from Vietnam to Australia the following day. 
     
      
    5 She was arrested at Sydney airport. Initially she agreed, then declined, then agreed again, to undergo an internal search. She was taken to the St George Hospital and underwent a CT scan, which revealed the presence of the packages. During the course of that and the following day the packages were naturally excreted from her body. The value assigned to the heroin was between $81,765 and $692,160 “depending upon how it was sold and its purity at sale.”  
     
      
     
     
      
      Personal circumstances 
       
      
    6 The applicant was born in Vietnam in June 1964, one of ten children. She was 42 years of age at the time of the offence. Her only criminal record consisted of a 2005 offence of possession of a prohibited drug for which she was fined $400; and, in 2004, offences of reckless driving and driving whilst there was present in her blood the prescribed concentration of alcohol (mid-range). 
     
      
    7 In 1997, whilst still living in Vietnam, the applicant met and married her husband. Shortly after their marriage her husband migrated to Australia, and made several applications to sponsor the applicant. These initially failed but were eventually successful. She came to Australia in 2000. The marriage failed in 2003 when her husband discovered that the applicant was homosexual. 
     
      
    8 The applicant’s homosexuality had been recognised before she left Vietnam, where it was unacceptable and regarded as shameful. It appears that that remains the case in the Vietnamese community in Australia. 
     
      
    9 Her mother and four of her siblings live in Australia. Her mother is 81 years of age. One brother suffers from liver cancer. 
     
      
    10 While the applicant retains the support of her mother, her siblings are said to have “turned their backs on her due to the shame she brought on the family”. 
     
      
    11 The applicant has had some employment in Vietnam and in Australia, but was most recently in receipt of unemployment benefits.  
     
      
    12 She told an officer of the Probation and Parole Service, who prepared a Pre-Sentence Report for sentencing purposes, that she was on medication for paranoia. Health records suggest that she is prescribed a drug to enable her to sleep. 
     
      
    13 The applicant began drinking alcohol at age 18. She began using illicit drugs after her entry into Australia, in about 2003. In the years that followed, she used methylamphetamine, heroin, opium, and other, unidentified, drugs. The drug use followed the breakdown of her marriage and her family relationship brought on by the disclosure of her homosexuality. 
     
      
    14 She told the Probation and Parole Service officer that she committed the offence because she owed money as a result of her drug use. She said that her family was threatened and she therefore felt compelled to go ahead with the offence. In evidence in the sentencing proceedings, she said that she owed $20,000, and was promised that, upon her return from Vietnam with the heroin, she would be given money to repay the debt. 
     
      
    15 The applicant said that she suffered from arthritis in both knees, one of which required her to wear a support bandage. 
     
      
    16 On 1 May 2007 the applicant was interviewed by police. She gave certain information. Later (28 September 2007) she signed an undertaking pursuant to s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) to assist the authorities in the prosecution of those who had recruited her, including by giving evidence, and therefore at considerable risk to herself. 
     
      
    17 As at the date of sentencing (and as at the date of the hearing of the application), she had not been called upon to discharge the obligations of this undertaking (although, on the day before the hearing of the application, a trial had been listed, in which it seems, the applicant was expected to be a witness. For reasons not disclosed to this Court, the trial did not proceed). 
     
      
    18 Evidence before the sentencing judge showed that the assistance given by the applicant was “truthful and valuable”, going further than merely confirming what police already knew, and providing previously unknown information, and identifying a person said to be a principal in a drug importing organisation.  
     
      
       
      The Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    19 The sentencing judge recounted the circumstances of the offence, and the applicant’s subjective circumstances. He accepted that the plea of guilty was entered at the earliest appropriate opportunity, and allowed a reduction in sentence attributable thereto of 25%. He recognised that the applicant’s co-operation would have the result that the applicant would serve her sentence in “non-association” and at some risk. He further reduced the sentence for this reason by 33%. 
     
      
    20 He accepted that the applicant’s expressions of contrition were “real and genuine” and that there were reasonable prospects for her rehabilitation. (Up to a point, this was in the face of the Pre-Sentence Report, in which the author expressed concerns about the applicant’s recognition of and insight into the magnitude of her conduct. The author expressed concerns that the applicant had requested a shorter sentence to enable her to care for her mother, whilst failing to explain the impact her offence, if successful, would have had upon the community. It was also the opinion of the author that, should the applicant fail to address the outstanding issues of substance abuse, her risk of re-offending remains high.) Nevertheless, there is no basis on which this Court ought to depart from the findings of the sentencing judge, before whom the applicant gave evidence. These findings are not challenged on behalf of the Crown and must, therefore, be accepted. 
     
      
    21 His Honour found that the role of the applicant was as a courier. He accepted, as was uncontroversial, that the offence was serious, demanding a term of full-time imprisonment, and that general deterrence was an important sentencing consideration. 
     
      
    22 His Honour then concluded that the appropriate starting point for sentencing was a term of imprisonment for 12 years. In accordance with the decision of this Court in R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162, he then reduced that sentence by 25% (3 years) in recognition of the plea of guilty, resulting in a sentence of 9 years, which he further reduced by 33% (another 3 years) in recognition of the co-operation. The resulting sentence was as I have set out above, of a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months. His Honour divided the reduction of 3 years attributable to co-operation/assistance as to 1 year in respect of already provided assistance, and 2 years for what the applicant promised for the future. 
     
      
       
      The application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    23 Only one ground of appeal was pleaded. It was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The notional ‘starting point’ of the sentence [of 12 years] is manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
    24 The applicant’s submissions depended heavily upon two circumstances: the quantity of the drug actually involved (242.3 grams) as against the range that constitutes a marketable quantity (2.00 grams – 1.5 kilograms); and the pattern of sentencing that can be discerned from sentencing statistics and previous cases. 
     
      
    25 Counsel for the applicant drew attention to the range of sentences promulgated by this Court in the (as it then was) guideline decision in R v Wong & Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420; 48 NSWLR 340. But three circumstances call for caution in the application of that decision. First, on appeal from that decision, (Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584) the High Court counselled against overemphasis on the quantity of the drug involved as the overriding or predominant consideration in sentencing; second, the cases considered in Wong & Leung, and Wong & Leung itself, were decided under the regime of drug control legislation of the Customs Act 1901 (where, for example, a trafficable quantity of heroin was 2.0 grams – 1.5 kilograms), and which has been overtaken by the regime laid down by the Criminal Code Act 1995; third, the decisions, and all the cases cited, pre-date the repeal of s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 
     
      
    26 Prior to 16 January 2003, s 16G required a court sentencing a federal offender, in jurisdictions where sentences were not subject to remissions, to take that circumstance into account. New South Wales was such a jurisdiction. It became commonplace to reduce the sentence by about one third: see generally R v Studenikin [2004] NSWCCA 164; 60 NSWLR 1. 
     
      
    27 S 16G was repealed with effect from 16 January 2003. Federal offenders thereafter were not entitled to that reduction. Inevitably, that resulted in an increase in the sentences imposed. 
     
      
    28 Although, as I have said, the High Court in Wong & Leung cautioned against overemphasis on the quantity of the drug involved, quantity remains a significant consideration. Here, the quantity was well above the minimum that constitutes a marketable quantity, and is not to be regarded as minimal. But it is also far below the point at which the quantity would become a commercial quantity (1.5 kilograms). For sentencing purposes, fitting the quantity involved in the specific offence into the range provided by the sentencing legislation is not unimportant. 
     
      
    29 It is, in my view, difficult to compare the decisions that relate to “trafficable” quantities under the Customs Act regime to decisions that relate to “marketable” quantities under the present regime of the Criminal Code Act. And the impact of the repeal of s 16G ought not be overlooked: see R v A [2004] NSWCCA 292. 
     
      
    30 This Court was provided with a list of sentences imposed in other cases. Without more, these reveal little. They do not disclose the quantity of the drug involved, the age or antecedents of the offenders, or the circumstances of the offences. Importantly, nor do they disclose whether a plea of guilty was entered. That is significant, because the starting point of 12 years, the subject of the present argument represents a notional starting point before the reduction allowed for the plea of guilty to which the applicant was plainly entitled. In cases where a plea of guilty was entered, to provide a proper basis for comparison, it would be necessary to know, and factor in, any reduction allowed in that respect. Undoubtedly, some of these sentences would have been imposed following pleas of guilty, meaning that the sentence imposed (as stated) is not reflective of the starting point. 
     
      
    31 The catalogue provided does identify those cases in which a reduction was allowed by reason of assistance to authorities, but does not disclose the nature of the assistance nor the quantification of the reduction. 
     
      
    32 Of more use are summaries of some other cases to which reference was made. These include some relevant circumstances (including the quantity involved, and a calculation of the sentencing starting point prior to the application of any reductions). In many cases, the quantity involved is roughly in the order of that involved in the present case. In only one of the cases cited on behalf of the applicant does the starting point reach 12 years: R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 314. There, the quantity involved was 244.6 grams of pure heroin. At first instance, that involved a sentencing starting point of 12 years, reduced in recognition of a plea of guilty. This Court (Hall J, with whom Sully and Hidden JJ agreed) held that the starting point was manifestly excessive. However, this was in reliance upon the guideline (CCA) judgment in Wong & Leung, prior to the decision of the High Court. In an earlier case (R v Ogochukwu [2004] NSWCCA 473), in respect of an offence involving 217.9 grams of pure heroin, a stated starting point of 11 years was held to be “at the higher end of the range” but not manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    33 On behalf of the Crown it was argued that the sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive. Indeed it was not. But so to frame the question masks the proper approach to the inquiry. If (as is not challenged) the applicant was entitled to reductions of 25% and 33% attributable to her plea of guilty and her (considerable) assistance, then it may well be that a sentence which at first sight and unexplained by those considerations, appears to be within range and even lenient, is, in fact, not within range. The approach taken on behalf of the Crown risks undermining the function of sentence reductions in respect of those two important components. What it does is risk depriving an offender of the full benefit of reductions to which he or she is entitled. Here, the proper question is whether the starting point of 12 years would have been within or outside the appropriate range for this offender and this offence, absent the reduction for the plea of guilty and the assistance. 
     
      
    34 I am aware that in R v SZ [2007] NSWCCA 19, and in Rutkowskyj v R [2008] NSWCCA 10, this Court has held that the focus in a sentence appeal must be the sentence actually imposed, rather than the notional starting point. But in each of these cases, it was held that the reduction allowed was excessive. Here, where it was not contended that the reduction was excessive, justice demands that the focus be on the starting point. 
     
      
    35 The Crown was able to produce an alternative set of precedents, and these paint a different picture to that presented by those provided on behalf of the applicant. R v Dang [2004] NSWCCA 269 involved the importation of 218.6 grams of pure heroin. A starting point of 12 years was held to be within range. R v A [2004] NSWCCA 292 involved an importation of 316.9 grams of heroin and a reduction of “40 to 50%”, giving a sentence of 7 years. The starting point may therefore be calculated to have been between 11 ½ years and 14 years; this was held not to be manifestly excessive. Interestingly enough, that applicant made a decision to travel to Vietnam to collect the drugs in return for reimbursement of travel expenses and a payment of $20,000.  
     
      
    36 In Mirza v R [2007] NSWCCA 257, involving 313.7 grams of pure heroin and a discount of 25%, a sentence of 9 years was held not to be excessive. The starting point can be calculated as 12 years. Again, that offender had left Australia with a specific intention of importing drugs on his return, and that was held to be a matter that significantly aggravated his criminality. 
     
      
    37 Counsel for the applicant also provided such statistics as there are in relation to offences against s 307.2(1) involving heroin. The longest head sentence imposed was of 9 years. However, the statistics to which this Court was specifically referred do not appear to differentiate between cases where there were pleas of guilty, cases where there were reductions for assistance, and do not disclose the quantity of drugs involved. If a 9 year sentence had built into it a reduction of 25%, then the starting point is 12 years. 
     
      
    38 These decisions persuade me that the starting point of 12 years, although towards or even at the top of the available range, was not outside the judge’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    39 Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: The appellant stood trial before Hock DCJ and a jury on the charge that - 
     
      
       
        
        “On 6 April 2006 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales whilst on an aircraft [he] did an act that interfered with a crew member of that aircraft, namely Andrew Stocks.” 
        
       
      
    2 The offence charged lay under the then s 24(1)(a) of the Civil Aviation Act 1988 (C’th). As at 6 April 2006 s 24, since amended, provided - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        24. Interference with crew or aircraft 
         
         
        (1) A person shall not, while in an aircraft: 
         
         
          
          (a) do any act that interferes with a crew member; or 
           
           
          (b) do any act that threatens the safety of the aircraft or of persons on board the aircraft. 
           
          
         
        (2) A person must not tamper with: 
         
         
          
          (a) an aircraft; or 
           
           
          (b) an aeronautical product that is of such a type that tampering with it may endanger the safety of an aircraft or any person or property; 
           
          
         
        if tampering with it may endanger the safety of the aircraft or any person or property. 
         
         
        Penalty: Imprisonment for 2 years.” 
        
       
      
    3 The appellant was found guilty. He was convicted, fined and ordered to enter into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for a period of two years. A related offence (Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 166) of behaviour on an aircraft in an offensive and disorderly manner (Civil Aviation Regulations 1988 reg 256AA(1)) was dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Outline facts 
       
      
    4 The charge arose from events when the appellant and a travelling companion, Mr Guiseppe De Simone, boarded a Qantas flight from Sydney to Melbourne.  
     
      
    5 Evidence in the Crown case was given by Mr Andrew Stocks, who was the customer service manager for the flight, and by Mr De Simone, by the aircraft’s captain Mr Robert Trayburn, by a flight attendant Mr Peter Bultitude, by an aircraft dispatcher Mr Nicolaos Athanassiou, by passengers Messrs Victor Craddock, Dr John Garrity and Mr Matthew Atkins (himself a Qantas pilot), and by a number of persons who became involved when the appellant was asked to leave the aircraft. Not unexpectedly, there were differing recollections of the events. What follows cannot, and does not attempt to, canvass all the evidence or resolve the differences. 
     
      
    6 The appellant and Mr De Simone boarded the flight in the early afternoon. The appellant is a solicitor, and Mr De Simone was his client. Members of the appellant’s family preceded them onto the aircraft.  
     
      
    7 The appellant and Mr De Simone were greeted by Mr Stocks on entering the aircraft. They were travelling economy, and had to pass through the business class section of the aircraft to reach their seats. There was a coat locker near the point of entry, before entrants came to the business class seating. 
     
      
    8 According to Mr Stocks, Mr De Simone asked if he could hang his jacket in the coat locker. According to the appellant and Mr De Simone, the appellant was carrying a suit bag and asked whether he could hang it in the coat locker.  
     
      
    9 Whatever the article and whoever asked, Mr Stocks replied in the negative. According to Mr Stocks, he said that there was a full business class and, as the appellant and Mr De Simone were in economy, the article could be placed in an overhead locker. According to the appellant and Mr De Simone, Mr Stocks said that the coat locker was full and the article could be placed in an overhead locker. Other witnesses gave evidence of hearing the exchange: the recollections of Mr Bultitude and Dr Garrity were broadly in accord with Mr Stock’s evidence, and the recollection of Mr Atkins was broadly in accord with that of the appellant and Mr De Simone. 
     
      
    10 One or other of the appellant and Mr De Simone opened the coat locker. It was not full. Again there were differences in the evidence. Mr De Simone either said to Mr Stocks that he was a liar, or said to the appellant in a manner which could be heard by Mr Stocks that Mr Stocks was a liar: on one version, “a bloody liar”. According to Mr Stocks, Mr De Simone spoke in “a very accusing manner” and pointed his finger at him, and he considered that in accordance with Qantas procedures he had to ask for modification of what he regarded as offensive behaviour and that, if there was not modification, passage should be refused. Mr Atkins recalled a passenger accusing the flight attendant of being a liar because the coat locker was not full, and that the flight attendant tried to calm the passenger down “and obviously made the comment that, ‘If you don’t settle down we could have you removed from the aircraft’,” and that that agitated the passenger even more. 
     
      
    11 There was a further exchange or exchanges between Mr Stocks and Mr De Simone before, at Mr Stocks’ request, the three of them left the aircraft and stood on the aerobridge adjacent to the doorway into the aircraft. Once more there were differences in the evidence. In brief, according to Mr Stocks the appellant and Mr De Simone were aggressive towards him; according to the appellant and Mr De Simone, the aggressiveness went the other way.  
     
      
    12 The effect of Mr Stocks’ evidence was that, in the face of aggression directed towards him, he told the appellant and Mr De Simone that they would not be allowed to travel on the flight unless they modified their behaviour. At some point Mr Stocks went into the aircraft’s flight deck to consult the captain, the door to the flight deck being to the left as one entered the aircraft. According to Mr Stocks, he then said to the appellant and Mr De Simone that things had got out of hand and that, if they were prepared to apologise and undertake that their behaviour would not continue in flight, they would be allowed to travel. Mr De Simone walked back onto the aircraft and to his seat, saying to Mr Stocks that he could talk to his lawyer, the appellant. Mr Stocks told the appellant that he would not be allowed to travel on the flight.  
     
      
    13 Mr Athanassiou was on the aerobridge in connection with the boarding of the aircraft. His evidence broadly supported that given by Mr Stocks. 
     
      
    14 These events were preliminary to the conduct on which the Crown relied for commission of the offence. The situation to this point and thereafter may have stemmed from a misunderstanding of what Mr Stocks had said about the coat locker, but it is plain that the appellant and Mr De Simone were upset. The flight had already been delayed by a baggage handlers strike, which cannot have assisted frayed tempers. 
     
      
    15 The appellant re-entered the aircraft from the aerobridge. According to Mr Stocks, the appellant said that he wanted to speak to the captain and moved towards the door to the flight deck. Mr Stocks shut the door to the flight deck; he said that he “had to reach over and shoulder [the appellant] and slam the front door”. There was no dispute over the request or demand to speak to the captain, but the appellant said that, while he may well have gestured towards the door to the flight deck, he did not think he moved towards it, and that Mr Bultitude had then closed the door. The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Mr Bultitude included a move towards the flight deck and that Mr Stocks closed the door. 
     
      
    16 The interphone from the flight deck rang. Mr Stocks answered it, and then entered the flight deck to report to the captain. Either while he was answering the interphone or while he was in the flight deck the appellant addressed the passengers in the aircraft. He identified himself, and on his own account said that he was being told that he and Mr De Simone could not fly to Melbourne because Mr De Simone had told Mr Stocks that he had lied about the coat locker being full, and that he was upset and had children to collect from school that afternoon in Melbourne. He asked for witnesses to provide their business cards. Mr Bultitude said of this event that the appellant “yelled out to the rest of the passengers, ‘The reason why this aircraft is delayed, because this steward won’t hang my suit pack’.”  
     
      
    17 The appellant went to his seat in the aircraft. Airport personnel, including members of the Australian Protective Services, were called. The airport co-ordinator, Ms Lisa Shanahan, asked the appellant and Mr De Simone to leave the aircraft, but they refused. Mr Stocks said to them that if they left voluntarily no charges would be pressed. Other requests were made and refused, according to evidence given by some of the witnesses with the appellant and Mr De Simone yelling and pointing at Mr Stocks and calling him a liar. Eventually the appellant and Mr De Simone left the aircraft, but only after 10 or 15 minutes.  
     
      
    18 The Crown case as left to the jury was based on the appellant’s conduct from re-entering the aircraft after the discussion on the aerobridge until he left it some time later. Features of that conduct were that he moved to enter the flight deck causing Mr Stocks to close the door to the flight deck, his address to the passengers and his refusal to leave the aircraft despite a number of requests, but the Crown Prosecutor said in his address to the jury that he relied on the whole of the conduct. On the Crown case this conduct in the aircraft was an act interfering with a crew member, Mr Stocks.  
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 1, 2 and 3: An act interfering with a crew member 
       
      
    19 These grounds of appeal, which can conveniently be dealt with together, were - 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The learned trial judge erred in: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) directing the jury that the offence charged could be committed by a person doing an act which interfered with the performance by a crew member of their duties; 
           
           
          (b) failing to direct the jury that the offence required that there be an interference with the crew member irrespective of whether the duties of the crew member were interfered with - 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          and as a consequence there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2. The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) The Appellant in going, or motioning to go, towards or into the flight deck; and/or 
           
           
          (b) The Appellant in walking, or attempting to walk, towards the cockpit door requesting or demanding to see the Captain - 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          was capable of constituting an act which interfered with the crew member of the aircraft (namely Andrew Stocks) and, as a consequence, there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        3. The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury tha: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the Appellant in addressing the passengers in the plane; and/or 
           
           
          (b) the Appellant in making a speech to other passengers - 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          was capable of constituting an act which interfered with the crew member of the aircraft (namely Andrew Stocks) and, as a consequence, there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    20 The judge did not direct the jury in the terms asserted in these grounds, which were not entirely apt to the submissions presented in their support. There was no objection from the Crown to the development which the grounds underwent in submissions. The submissions were concerned with “any act” in s 24(1)(a) and with “interferes with a crew member”.  
     
      
    21 Some background to the summing-up concerning those matters is appropriate. 
     
      
    22 The Crown had particularised as the act for the purposes of s 24(1)(a) the conduct of the appellant from the time the coat locker was opened until the appellant finally left the aircraft. The precise particulars are not in the appeal papers, and conduct on the aerobridge and so not in the aircraft may have been excluded. At the commencement of the trial counsel for the appellant complained, although his application was not made clear, that the conduct was a series of acts and that it was necessary for the Crown better to identify the act which interfered with the crew member. He made passing reference to Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467, which was concerned with latent ambiguity of a complaint particularised by a number of events each of which could make out the offence. The judge accepted the Crown’s position that a course of conduct could be an act, and implicitly that the Crown could present a case on that basis. It was left that the Crown Prosecutor’s opening would make clear what the Crown case was. 
     
      
    23 The Crown Prosecutor opened that the act was the appellant’s “disruptive behaviour from when he opened the business class coat locker pretty much all the way through until he refuses to leave the plane but finishes when he actually does depart”. The conduct on the aerobridge was then excluded. It was said in the opening that “this act” interfered with a crew member, Mr Stocks, “by interfering with his ability to undertake his duties as I have outlined before”. The duties earlier outlined were welcoming and assisting passengers, making sure the cabin was “right for the doors to be closed”, seeing to arming the doors, and ensuring that the aircraft was in a position where it could be pushed away from the aerobridge and proceed to takeoff. 
     
      
    24 Apart from the act being a course of conduct, this brought in a gloss upon interfering with a crew member, through the reference to interfering with Mr Stocks’ ability to undertake his duties. Because the common ground remained on appeal, it is sufficient to say that in exchanges between counsel and the judge it became common ground at the trial that, although s 24(1)(a) did not say anything about performance of duties, in order to give it meaning it should be understood as requiring interference with a crew member in the performance of his or her duties. In due course the judge provided to the jury documents, first MFI 6 and then a slightly amended MFI 7, setting out the elements of the offence and including reference to interference with Mr Stocks in the course of performance of his duties. MFI 7 read - 
     
      
       
       “ 
       TRIAL OF PETER SIMON LUSTIG 
       
       
        
        The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that on 6 April 2006 at Sydney: 
        
       
       
        
        1) whilst on an aircraft the accused did an act;  
        and 
        
       
       
        
        2) he intended, that is, he meant to do that act;  
        and 
        
       
       
        
        3) the act interfered with a crew member of that aircraft in the course of the performance of his duties, namely Andrew Stocks;  
        and 
        
       
       
        
        4) (a) the accused intended that to happen; 
        
       
       
       OR 
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) (i) the accused was aware of a substantial risk that the act would interfere with a crew member of that aircraft in the course of the performance of his duties; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) having regard to the circumstances known to him it was unjustifiable to take the risk.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    25 After the close of the Crown case counsel for the appellant made a no case application. It included that the “fundamental particular” of a “continuum” of conduct from opening the coat locker had been disproved, because the discussion on the aerobridge was not in the aircraft. There was reference, amongst other cases, to Johnson v Miller and Stanton v Abernathy (1990) 19 NSWLR 656, and it was submitted to the effect that, without cavilling with the judge’s earlier ruling, the Crown should be required to “elect” and be held to “a particular act”. The Crown Prosecutor narrowed his case to conduct commencing on re-entry into the aircraft, but affirmed that the Crown relied on “the whole of the conduct” thereafter. The judge refused the no case application, without comment on election. 
     
      
    26 Although MFI 6 had not then been provided to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor’s address to the jury plainly had it in mind. For reasons which will appear, it is appropriate to go to the address in a little detail. 
     
      
    27 The Crown Prosecutor said of an act and interference with a crew member - 
     
      
       
        
        “The first element is that the accused did an act. As the evidence has come out what the Crown relies upon as the act is the disruptive behaviour of the accused from when he re-entered the plane, because the offence has to have occurred on a plane, after the aerobridge argument, all the way through until when he refuses to leave the plane but finishes when he actually does depart. So that includes his conduct where he, on the Crown case, walks towards the cockpit door, causing Mr Stocks to have to reach over him and close the door, his address to the passengers in at least – because he agrees – the first six rows, and his repeated refusal despite at least four or five requests to leave the plane during the period of time he’s seated in his seat. That’s the act that the Crown relies upon. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The third element is that this act interfered with a crew member and as you’ve got the indictment the crew member who’s been identified in this case is Mr Andrew Stocks who was the customer service manager. The indictment doesn’t say this but you can’t just interfere with someone generally, there needs to be something that’s been interfered with. In this case it’s the performance of Mr Stock’s duties. In a minute I’ll go through what those duties were and talk about the evidence in relation to that. The fourth element is that the accused was aware of a substantial risk that his behaviour would interfere with Mr Stock’s performance of his duties and he unjustifiably decided to behave the way he did despite the risk. It’s called recklessness. But the description I’ve just given you is what I say for the purposes of now is what applies. And again I’ll touch upon the evidence as I go through but I say it shows that Mr Lustig was aware of this risk but decided to behave in the way that he did in any event.” 
        
       
      
    28 The Crown Prosecutor referred to evidence of Mr Stocks’ duties and the appellant’s knowledge of them. In the course of doing so he said that the duties “are the duties that the Crown says were ultimately interfered with by Mr Lustig’s behaviour”. 
     
      
    29 The Crown Prosecutor then posed the question, “So did the accused do an act while on an aircraft that he [sic] interfered with these duties of Mr Stocks?” He said it was easiest to start “at the end of the act that the Crown’s pointed out and work backwards”. He dealt with the appellant’s refusal to leave the aircraft despite requests, and with consequent delay. He said that there were “two other important incidents”. One, the “speech … to the other passengers”, was said to show that the appellant knew his behaviour was continuing to delay the aircraft’s departure and that “he was prepared to interfere with Mr Stocks’ duties, at the very least he was prepared to risk that the duties would be interfered with”. What the Crown Prosecutor said concerning the other, described as an attempt to walk towards the cockpit door demanding to see the captain, went in some detail to the facts but did not specifically link the move towards the door to the flight deck with performance of Mr Stocks’ duties. 
     
      
    30 The Crown Prosecutor’s address finished by saying that Mr Stocks could not close the aircraft’s door until the appellant had left the aircraft and, from the time the appellant re-entered the aircraft until he eventually left it, “[Mr Stocks’] duties were interfered with during that whole period of time”. It was said that the jury would conclude that the appellant was aware of at least a substantial risk “that his behaviour was interfering with Mr Stocks’ performance of his duties and without any justification … “. 
     
      
    31 Similar detail of the address of counsel for the appellant is not necessary. He addressed on the basis that there had not been interference with Mr Stocks’ duties, in substance suggesting that there was nothing unreasonable in the appellant’s reaction to (on the defence case) Mr Stocks’ lie and the unreasonable stance thereafter taken by Mr Stocks. He suggested also that it was part of Mr Stocks’ duties to deal with the appellant’s reasonable reaction. The address included the rhetorical question, in relation to asking to see the captain, “how are you interfering with anyone’s duties?”, and in relation to refusing to leave the aircraft that there was “no interference ultimately in the duties of Mr Stocks”. 
     
      
    32 I go then to the judge’s summing-up. 
     
      
    33 When her Honour provided MFI 6 to the jury she said - 
     
      
       
        
        “I will take you through it, members of the jury, and then I will outline to you what evidence the Crown relies on and what is in dispute. The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that on 6 April 2006 at Sydney, first while on an aircraft, the accused did an act and – the ‘and’ is in bold to make clear that the Crown has to prove all four of these elements. (2) He intended – that is, he meant to do that act; and (3) the act interfered with a crew member of that aircraft in the course of the performance of his duties, namely Andrew Stocks. That is the crew member identified. And 4(a) the accused intended that to happen, that is, he intended that the act would interfere with the crew member in the performance of his duties; or alternatively the accused was reckless. I haven’t put the word ‘reckless’ but this is what (b) means – that the accused was aware of the substantial risk that the act would interfere with a crew member of the aircraft performing his duties, and having regard to the circumstances known to him it was unjustifiable, or not justifiable, to take the risk.” 
        
       
      
    34 A fairly lengthy extract from the summing-up should be set out. I underline one passage and put others in italics or in bold, for ease of reference hereafter - 
     
      
       
        
        “It is common ground that the Crown case is based on the accused’s conduct once he re-entered the plane from the aerobridge until he left the plane after he was spoken to in his seat. That is the whole of the accused’s conduct in that time. I am sure that conduct is clear in your mind, but it includes if you find it to be the fact – and this is one area that is in dispute – that he went, or motioned to go towards, the flight deck or into the captain’s cabin, causing Mr Stocks to close or to slam the door to the flight deck. That is one area of dispute to some extent you will recall, and you have heard a great deal of evidence on that topic. 
        
       
       
        
        It includes the accused’s address to the passengers, which you would be well aware is not in dispute and was referred to by the accused in his evidence, and his repeated refusal to leave the plane despite the requests of the various people from whom you heard evidence, Lisa Shanahan and Mr Stocks for example. 
        
       
       
        
        You do not have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did all of those things – that is, each individual act, only that the accused’s conduct whilst on an aircraft satisfied that first element 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        Here I am going to express an opinion which is in accordance with Mr McClintock’s submissions or arguments to you, that there isn’t really much dispute about this first element, and before I leave the first element, in terms of the evidence which you heard as to the entering to the plane, the dispute over the locker, the conduct on the aerobridge – all of that evidence which you heard is placed before you to put this later evidence in context. Otherwise you would be wondering why it was the accused went out to the aerobridge and then in the plane was asking to see the captain, or saying words to that effect. But no part of that earlier evidence is relied on by the Crown and you cannot use any part of the earlier evidence as comprising the act which the Crown says  
        interfered with Mr Stocks in the performance of his duties 
        . Both counsel have addressed in those terms and I am sure that is perfectly clear to you, members of the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        So in essence, the act the Crown relies on is essentially the accused’s conduct from the time that he returned from the aerobridge into the aeroplane.  
        
       
       
        
        Moving now to the second element, which again as Mr McClintock says isn’t really in dispute, the accused intended – that is, he meant to do that act, that conduct, whichever conduct either including moving towards the flight deck or excluding that. Whatever you find, that is one of the findings of fact that y ou may find it necessary to resolve. 
        
       
       
        
        Intention and intent are familiar words and in a legal context they carry their ordinary meaning. What a person intends can be inferred or deduced from his conduct before, at the time and even after he did a particular act. What a person says about his intention may be looked for the purpose of finding out what his intention was at a relevant time. 
        
       
       
        
        Again, members of the jury, it is not as I understand it in dispute the accused intended his conduct, which the Crown relies on in respect of this first and second element. 
        
       
       
        
        The third element is in dispute. The third element, the act  
        interfered with a crew member of the aircraft in the course of the performance of his duties 
         – namely, Mr Andrew Stocks. Interfered also carries in this context its usual meaning, which in a dictionary definition means to come into opposition or collision with something or someone, with the effect of hampering action or procedure. That’s a Macquarie dictionary definition but it carries its usual ordinary meaning, members of the jury. Again, I do not think there is much dispute about this. To come into opposition or collision with someone, in this particular case, with the effect of hampering or hindering action or procedure. 
         
         
        As the duties of Mr Stocks at that time, that is, the time of the accused’s acts, it was at a time when the plane was boarding and the transcript in this respect – and as it was the first day I will just remind you of that. In respect of his duties Mr Stocks said at p 1, Boarding Duties, the question was: 
         
         
          
          ‘Q. You allocate the positions to the flight attendants? 
           
          A. I always had to man the same door. 
           
           
          Q. What were your duties while you were standing there? 
           
          A. Well, after the last person has boarded, the ground staff will come and they will hand you a passenger manifest which has the names of the passengers on it, and any special requirements, again like a medical condition of something that needs to be monitored. After that is handed to me, you then liaise with the captain to see if all his paperwork is completed, and you can close the front door and the aircraft pushes back and flies. 
           
           
          Q. Is there anything special you do when you’re closing the doors?  
           
          A. Before you do that you do a PA saying to the flight attendants, “Please arm the doors.” Arming the doors means the slides are engaged to in case of an incident when a door is armed, the slide will deploy.’ 
           
          
         
        That seems to be essentially his duties, which were to get the plane in the air. That is on the Crown case. Mr McClintock suggested or argued that Mr Stocks had other duties, one of which was to attend to the accused who had a complaint, and therefore the act or the conduct did not  
        interfere with a crew member in the performance of his duties 
        . They are the two arguments about that third element, and that is one of the live issues which you will have to determine, members of the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        Coming now to the fourth element, which again is a live issue, the accused intended that to happen. That is, to be considering this fourth element you will have already decided or determined beyond reasonable doubt that the act did  
        interfere with Mr Stocks 
        . If you were of the view that it did not  
        interfere with Mr Stocks 
        , if you come to the view that the Crown had not established that third element, you would not be considering this fourth element , obviously. So if you were considering this fourth element, that the accused intended that to happen, that is, he intended in the same sense as the second element, he meant that to occur. 
        
       
       
        
        In other words, the way he conducted himself was done with an intention that that conduct would  
        interfere with Mr Stocks, the performance of his duties 
        , they being to get the plane away at that particular time. If the Crown proves that the accused intended for that to occur, then you do not need to consider B, 4(b), which is the recklessness aspect. But the Crown can establish this fourth element in an alternative way – that the accused may not have intended Mr Stocks to be  
        hindered in the performance of his duties 
        , or may not have intended to  
        interfere 
          
        with the performance 
         of Mr Stocks’ duty 
        , but alternatively he was reckless as to that. 
        
       
       
        
        That is, firstly the Crown has to prove the accused was aware of the substantial risk that the act would  
        interfere with the crew member of the aircraft performing his duties 
        . As to that, the Crown relies on the accused’s evidence before you that he had flown many times previously and on the address that he made to the passengers, including the words ‘this plane is delayed, or is being delayed’ which the accused told you about in his evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        That is, of course, a question of fact for you that he was aware of the substantial risk; that is [sic: his] conduct or act would  
        interfere with the performance of Mr Stocks’ duty 
        ; and secondly having regard to the circumstances known to him, it was unjustifiable for him to take that risk. Again, this is a question of fact for you, members of the jury. You need to look at what the accused knew about the circumstances, including but not limited to that he knew that obviously he was on an aeroplane; he knew, if you find it to be the fact, that this plane was about to depart. 
        
       
       
        
        Then you would decide whether objectively you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was not justified in taking the risk; that what he was doing would  
        interfere with Mr Stocks’ duty 
        . I will just repeat that. 
        
       
       
        
        You look at what the accused knew about the circumstances, including that he was on a plane; that the plane was about to depart; and decide objectively whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was not justified in taking the risk. You may find it helpful here to consider if the conduct of the accused in the circumstances was a reasonable response in the circumstances as he knew them to be. 
        
       
       
        
        In the Crown case, it was not a reasonable response to the circumstances as he knew them to be. Mr McClintock argues that it was a reasonable response in the circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown case, as I say, is that it was unjustified for the accused to take the risk, indeed, that you would be satisfied of 4(a) that the accused intended this interference, to cause this interference, but that if he didn’t intend it he acted recklessly in the sense as defined in 4(b)(i) and (ii). 
        
       
       
        
        On the Crown case, no matter what the rights or wrong of the dispute, it was unjustified for the accused to take the risk that his conduct would  
        interfere with Mr Stocks’ duties 
        . On the accused’s argument through Mr McClintock, keeping in mind that the accused does not have to prove anything but the accused’s argument is that you would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was reckless, because he was justified in taking the risk; he had a legitimate grievance which he wanted resolved; he was being asked unreasonably to leave the plane; and he wanted it sorted out then and there. That is another final or live issue for you to decide, members of the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        That almost concludes what I have to say at this point in the summing up, members of the jury. You have the directions of law which fortunately are not particularly complicated in respect of this particular offence, and you have a brief summary of the evidence. As I repeat, if you want to be reminded of the actual evidence of any witness or witnesses, by being provided with the transcript, that can be provided if the foreman would write a note indicating in the note which witness or witnesses’ evidence you require, that will be provided to you.” 
        
       
      
    35 Neither the Crown Prosecutor nor counsel for the appellant took objection to the directions, save that counsel for the appellant asked that MFI 6 in relation to part of the fourth element, recklessness, be changed so that it was necessary that the appellant was aware of a substantial risk that the act would interfere with a crew member of the aircraft “in the course of the performance of his duties” rather than “in performing his duties”. That change was made, resulting in MFI 7, and MFI 7 was provided to the jury. The jury was told that the change was “probably of little moment”, but was made “to be completely accurate”. 
     
      
    36 The appellant specifically accepted in the appeal that the written directions in MFI 7 were correct. His complaint was not that there had been added the gloss of interference with a crew member in the course of the performance of his duties. It was that there had intruded a different notion of interference with performance of a crew member’s duties. It may be noted that the Civil Aviation Act was later amended so that s 24(1) now provides - 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person commits an offence if: 
         
         
          
          (a) the person does an act; and 
           
           
          (b) the act: 
           
           
            
            (i) interferes with a crew member of an aircraft in the course of the performance of his or her duties as such a crew member; or 
            
           
           
            
            (ii) threatens the safety of an aircraft or of persons on board an aircraft.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    37 I go then to the grounds of appeal. Since no objection was taken at the trial, leave is required pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. The Crown submitted that it should be refused, referring to cases emphasising counsel’s responsibility to assist in ensuring that proper directions are given, see for example R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340. The requirements of the rule are not a “mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside”: R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536, see also R v Button and Griffen [2002] NSWCCA 159; (2002) 129 A Crim R 242 at [32]-[35], but it should not stand in the way of correcting a real injustice. I will return to this.  
     
      
    38 The submissions developing the grounds, put in cascading order, can be summarised as - 
     
      
       
      (a) that the jury had been misdirected according to an incorrect notion of interference with performance of a crew member’s duties; 
       
       
      (b) that the jury had been otherwise misdirected as to interference with Mr Stocks in the performance of his duties, and none of the conduct on which the Crown relied could constitute interference with him in the performance of his duties; and 
       
       
      (c) that at the least the conduct of the appellant involving his address to the passengers could not constitute interference with Mr Stocks in the performance of his duties, but the directions left it open to the jury to convict for that conduct alone. 
       
       
      (a) The notion of interference with performance of a crew member’s duties 
       
      
    39 The appellant submitted that there was a distinction between the two notions - 
     
      
    · doing an act which interferes with a crew member in the course of performing his or her duties; and  
     
      
    · doing an act which interferes with the performance of duties by a crew member.  
     
      
    40 Essential to the first notion was interference with the crew member. But, it was said, there could be interference with the performance of duties by a crew member in accordance with the second notion although there was not interference with the crew member: for example, it was said, an assault by one passenger on another during boarding might result in interference with the ability of the crew member to prepare the aircraft for departure while the assault was dealt with, thus delaying departure, but it would not be an interference with the crew member. The appellant recognised that an act could interfere with a crew member and also interfere with the performance of the crew member’s duties, for example physical obstruction of the crew member, although he submitted that the conduct on which the Crown relied could not fulfil either notion (see later in these reasons). He submitted that the jury was told, erroneously in law, that they could convict for interference with performance of duties absent interference with the crew member who had those duties.  
     
      
    41 MFI 7 did not convey that: as I have said, the appellant accepted that the written directions were correct. The appellant argued that, beginning with the addresses and then in the summing-up, there was conflation of the two notions, and that the conflation in the summing-up was the more significant because it followed the conflation in the addresses and failed to correct the intrusion of the incorrect notion of interference with performance of a crew members’ duties. 
     
      
    42 I have set out or described the relevant parts of the addresses and the summing-up. The Crown Prosecutor had largely used the language of interference with performance of Mr Stocks’ duties, and as I have said the address of counsel for the respondent was on the basis that there had not been interference with the duties of Mr Stocks. The judge began with MFI 6, and in what she then said first used the language of interference with Mr Stocks in the performance of his duties, see the passages in italics in the extract from the summing-up earlier set out. However, her Honour later used the language of interference with Mr Stocks’ duties, see the passages in bold. The passage in italics and bold can be seen as a transition. 
     
      
    43 I do not think that the grounds of appeal in this respect should be upheld.  
     
      
    44 The evidence in the Crown case was directed to conduct towards Mr Stocks’ affecting the performance of his duties in relation to preparing the aircraft for its departure, and with the consequences of the conduct in delay because he was not able to do what he would ordinarily have done. Whether all the conduct on which the Crown relied could affect the performance of his duties is another matter, see below; the case as put before the jury was that it could. In the conduct of the trial, there was not a true distinction between interference with performance of Mr Stocks’ duties and interference with Mr Stocks in the performance of his duties; if the former was made out, the latter was also made out. Dominant in the judge’s summing-up was the framing of the relevant elements of the offence in terms of interference with Mr Stocks in the course of performance of his duties, and although the Crown Prosecutor had used other language and the judge came to stray into other language I do not think the jury would have been diverted from considering whether interference with Mr Stocks, as part of interference with Mr Stocks in the course of performance of his duties, should be found beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    45 This finds support in the absence of objection to the summing-up, including by counsel for the appellant whose address implicitly accepted that any interference with the duties of Mr Stocks was through interference with Mr Stocks and took issue with whether there had been interference with Mr Stocks’ duties. Counsel was plainly alive to the correct presentation of the elements of the offence, see the request for the change to the fourth element, and must have considered that in the trial context there was not a material difference in the way the gloss on interference with a crew member was presented to the jury. 
     
      
       
      (b) Interference with Mr Stocks in the performance of his duties 
       
      
    46 The judge told the jury that “interfered” carried its usual meaning, and referred to a dictionary definition involving coming into opposition or collision with Mr Stocks with the effect of hampering or hindering Mr Stocks’ action or procedure. The appellant submitted that more than hampering or hindering of action or procedure was required in law for interference with a crew member. He submitted that moving towards the flight deck did not interfere with Mr Stocks, because Mr Stocks was not touched, obstructed, or impeded; similarly, addressing the passengers and remaining in the seat although asked to leave the aircraft did not involve touching, obstructing or impeding him. It was said that nothing the appellant did prevented Mr Stocks from doing what Mr Stocks thought necessary to perform his duties. The substance of the submission was that interference within of s 24(1)(a) meant direct physical impedance, although not necessarily direct physical contact because it was accepted that (for example) blocking the aircraft aisle so that the crew member could not reach the aircraft’s address system would be interference with the crew member.  
     
      
    47 In my opinion, that is a too limited view of interference with a crew member. Interference with a thing may require physical contact. But not so interference with a person, and so in R v Galvin (1998) 102 A Crim R 568 unlawful interference with a conveyance required tampering with it which was distinguished (at 574) from interference with the driver of a motor vehicle – for the latter, obstruction or hindering in the driver’s operation of the vehicle. A person is animate, and there comes into consideration what the person would have done but for the act said to interfere with him or her. So in the Oxford English Dictionary “interfere” used of a person or persons is given the wide meaning “enter into something without right or invitation, or intending to hinder or obstruct”. Interference can be measured against what would otherwise have been done or attempted to be done; indeed, there can be interference simply by delaying a person in what he or she does.  
     
      
    48 Section 24(1)(a) was general, not restricted to any particular form of interference. By comparison with s 24(1)(b), it was not restricted to interference having safety implications. The Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991 provided for various offences from hijacking downwards, including (s 21) assaulting or intimidating a crew member in a manner “that results in … an interference with the member’s performance of function or duties connected with the operation of the aircraft”, and s 24(1)(a) was not limited to assault or intimidation. The offence under s 24(1)(a) relevantly lay in hindering or preventing the crew member from carrying out the crew member’s duties, and there can be hindrance or prevention although the crew member is not physically impeded, whether by direct physical contact or otherwise. There can be interference with the crew member who cannot reach the aircraft’s address system whether the crew member is physically restrained, is impeded by blocking the aisle, is threatened with a weapon, or is drawn into aggressive disputation; the last may be as effective, and perhaps may be deliberately intended to be as effective, as physical restraint.  
     
      
    49 Those features of the appellant’s conduct involving moving towards the flight deck and remaining in his seat when asked to leave were capable of making out interference with Mr Stocks in the course of performance of his duties. It was open to the jury to find that Mr Stocks was hindered, and for a time prevented, from doing what he would otherwise have done in relation to readying the aircraft for takeoff. If the jury accepted that Mr Stocks shouldered the appellant aside to shut the door to the flight deck, physical obstruction could have been found. 
     
      
    50 Not so the appellant’s conduct involving the address to the passengers. Mr Stocks was on the interphone and or in the flight deck. I do not think it was open to the jury to find that, in addressing the passengers, the appellant hindered Mr Stocks in or prevented him from doing anything. What he did, speaking on the interphone and/or going to and speaking to the captain on the flight deck, was not affected by the contemporaneous conduct involved in addressing the passengers. As I understand it, in submissions the Crown accepted that this feature of the appellant’s conduct could not of itself constitute interference with Mr Stocks in the performance of his duties. 
     
      
       
      (c) The conduct involving the appellant’s address to the passengers 
       
      
    51 It is not necessary to consider whether the Crown’s reliance on the appellant’s course of conduct from re-entering the aircraft until he eventually left it brought defectiveness through ambiguity of the kind considered in Johnson v Miller. No application to that effect was clearly made at trial, and no ground of appeal so asserted. However, the reliance on the appellant’s conduct as a whole meant that in directing the jury the judge had carefully to explain how the course of conduct, with the features of the appellant moving towards the flight deck, his address to the passengers and his refusal to leave the aircraft despite a number of requests, could be found to be an act interfering with Mr Stocks, and how the jury should approach acceptance of some parts of the conduct but not other parts.  
     
      
    52 The Crown Prosecutor had firmly said in his address that the Crown relied on all the appellant’s “disruptive behaviour”, and had said that the act “include[d]” the three features of the conduct to which I have referred. When the Crown Prosecutor was working through the act backwards from the end, the significance given to the address to the passengers was what it showed of the appellant’s knowledge going to intention or recklessness, rather than as interference in itself, but nonetheless it was put forward as an “incident” part of the act. 
     
      
    53 In the summing-up the judge took up the Crown’s reliance on the whole of the appellant’s conduct from re-entering the aircraft until leaving it, with its inclusion of the three features – correctly so, insofar as that was the way the Crown had chosen to present its case. Her Honour then said, in the passage underlined in the extract from the summing-up earlier set out which I repeat for convenience - 
     
      
       
        
        “You do not have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did all of those things – that is, each individual act, only that the accused’s conduct whilst on an aircraft satisfied that first element.” 
        
       
      
    54 At this point there was the need for the careful explanation. If the appellant’s act, for the purposes of s 24(1)(a), was truly the whole of his conduct, the jury did have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did “all of those things” and “each individual act”. That had its own problem: how was the jury to understand “all of those things” and “each individual act”, and what individual acts beyond the three features of moving to enter the flight deck, the address to the passengers and refusal to leave the aircraft despite a number of requests? The jury had been told only that the course of conduct included those features, and what else was involved was left unexplained. If, however, doing one of “those things” or one “individual act” could make out interference with Mr Stocks in the course of his duties, and assuming that attention could be confined to the three featured acts, each of those acts had to be evaluated for its interference with Mr Stocks in the performance of his duties, albeit that the jury was told that it did not have to be satisfied as to each. The complaint made at the commencement of the trial had not borne fruit, but the difficulty underlying it remained. 
     
      
    55 The appellant submitted that there was misdirection, in that the jury was told that it could find the offence proved if satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the address to the passengers alone but (at the least) the address to the passengers was not capable of being interference with Mr Stocks in the performance of his duties. The Crown submitted that the summing-up should not be understood as saying that the jury could find the offence proved if satisfied as to the address to the passengers alone, because her Honour went on to direct the jury that the question was whether the cumulative conduct was an act interfering with Mr Stocks in the performance of his duties. 
     
      
    56 The Crown’s submission was a re-statement of the problem, not a solution to it. As I have said, the appellant’s conduct involving the address to the passengers could not be found to have hindered Mr Stocks or prevented him from carrying out his duties. That the appellant addressed the passengers was really not contentious, although the precise circumstances in which he did so was a matter which the jury had to consider, but the directions did not assist the jury in bringing satisfaction as to that “thing” or “individual act” into satisfaction that the appellant’s conduct as an act was an interference with Mr Stocks in the performance of his duties. There was in my opinion a real risk that the jury would understand that, if satisfied that the appellant had addressed the passengers, from the address to the passengers alone or together with other of the conduct they could find the offence proved. The real risk gives rise to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    57 I return to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. The grounds of appeal so far as developed in (a) and (b) above may not have attracted leave. But the grounds as developed in (c) came back to the complaint made by counsel for the appellant at the beginning of the trial, repeated at the time of the no case application as a submission that the Crown had to elect and be held to a particular act. Counsel could have taken this up again at the time of the summing-up, but it is understandable that the judge’s acceptance that the Crown could present a case of a course of conduct constituting the act for the purposes of s 24(1)(a) was not re-agitated in objection to the summing-up. The source of the difficulty was the way the Crown had chosen to present its case. In the circumstances, the miscarriage of justice if the grounds as so developed were not permitted would in my view be such that leave should be granted. 
     
      
       
        
       
       
      Ground of appeal 5: Telephone records 
       
      
    58 Ground of appeal 5 was - 
     
      
       
        
        “5. The learned trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that: 
        
       
       
        
        a. the evidence established that the person speaking loudly on a mobile telephone was not the appellant, but was Mr De Simone; 
         
         
        b. the jury should not give any weight as ‘context’ to the evidence that the Appellant had been speaking loudly and aggressively on a mobile telephone on the aerobridge;  
         
         
        c. it followed that Stokes [sic: Stocks] was in error in assessing the Appellant’s behaviour in speaking loudly and aggressively on the telephone as justifying a refusal to permit him to fly on the aircraft; and  
         
         
        d. the same error was relevant in the jury’s consideration of whether the Appellant was justified in engaging in the conduct said to constitute the interference with the crew member - 
        
       
       
        
        and as a consequence there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    59 Although the Crown case was based on the appellant’s conduct once he re-entered the aircraft from the aerobridge, there was much evidence of the prior events involving the first entry into the aircraft, the dispute over the coat locker and the subsequent discussions on the aerobridge. The trial judge told the jury that - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … all of that evidence which you heard is placed before you to put this later evidence in context. Otherwise you would be wondering why it was the accused went out to the aerobridge and then in the plane was asking to see the captain, or saying words to that effect. But no part of that earlier evidence is relied on by the Crown and you cannot use any part of that earlier evidence as comprising the act which the Crown says interfered with Mr Stocks in the performance of his duties. Both counsel have addressed in those terms and I am sure that is perfectly clear to you, members of the jury.” 
        
       
      
    60 According to Mr Stocks, when the appellant and Mr De Simone first came to his attention the appellant was “talking quite loudly and forcefully into his mobile phone”. He said that that “alarmed” him, and later described the manner of speaking as aggressive. It was put to him that the person talking on the mobile telephone was Mr De Simone, but he disagreed.  
     
      
    61 Mr Craddock gave evidence of a man speaking loudly and aggressively on a mobile phone, from his description of later events probably the appellant. Mr Bultitude said that one of the men he saw was talking loudly on the phone; contrary to the appellant’s submissions, in his descriptions of the men in later events probably Mr De Simone. Mr De Simone said in his evidence in chief that he was speaking on a mobile telephone while going down the aerobridge to board the aircraft. He said in cross-examination that, because of a hearing condition, he could have been speaking reasonably loudly. When the appellant gave evidence, he said that Mr De Simone “received a telephone call, so he was speaking on his mobile phone” as they came down the aerobridge, and that Mr De Simone was speaking quite loudly. The Crown Prosecutor did not suggest otherwise in cross-examination. 
     
      
    62 After the evidence of Mr Stocks, Mr Craddock and Mr De Simone, but before the evidence of Mr Bultitude, the Crown called Mr Jason Legge, an officer of the Australian Federal Police who had arrested and interviewed the appellant. His evidence included that he had obtained from Qantas some mobile phone telephone records, one stating the billing name of Mr Peter Lustig and the other stating the billing name of De Simone Consulting. Through Mr Legge, evidence was given of a telephone call on what was referred to as Mr Lustig’s phone for about 30 seconds at about 12.49 pm and then the next call at about 1.23 pm, and of a telephone call on what was referred to as Mr De Simone’s phone for a little over two minutes at about 12.49 pm and then the next call at 1.10 pm. The records themselves were not tendered. The call on Mr De Simone’s phone at about 12.49 pm was described in a question with which Mr Legge agreed as a call “to the mobile phone”, and he also agreed that Mr De Simone appeared to be “receiving” that call.  
     
      
    63 The appellant submitted that the telephone records made it clear beyond dispute that Mr De Simone’s mobile phone was in use immediately prior to the first entry into the aircraft. He said that Mr Stocks’ error in ascribing to the appellant the mobile phone call which caused him alarm was plain, and that recognition of the error would not only have detracted from Mr Stocks’ evidence of occasion to refuse passage to the appellant, but also would have strengthened the appellant’s case that he was being treated unfairly and was entitled to seek to speak to the captain and to remain on board the aircraft. 
     
      
    64 The appellant submitted that the telephone records provided a quite different context for the conduct on which the Crown relied, and that in the circumstances it was incumbent on the judge to ensure that the jury did not act upon Mr Stocks’ mis-identification to the appellant’s prejudice. He said that her Honour should have reminded the jury of the evidence of the telephone records, should have directed them that the telephone records established that the person making the loud telephone call was Mr De Simone and not the appellant, and should have directed them they must not give any weight in the context of the events to the erroneous suggestion of the appellant having spoken loudly and forcefully on a mobile phone. 
     
      
    65 It would have been quite wrong for the judge to have directed the jury in this manner. Fact-finding was for the jury, as was the weight to be given to evidence. Even as part of the context, who was speaking on the mobile phone was not a large matter. There was much evidence of the discussion on the aerobridge, of considerably more significance to aggressiveness and to what occurred when the appellant re-entered the aircraft. Who was speaking on the mobile phone can not have been perceived as significant in the conduct of the trial, because neither the Crown Prosecutor nor counsel for the appellant referred in their respective addresses to the mobile phone call as the appellant and Mr De Simone first went down the aerobridge to board the aircraft. Nor did the judge refer to it in her summing-up. Counsel for the appellant made no complaint.  
     
      
    66 Leave is required under r 4, and in my opinion leave to rely on this ground of appeal should be refused. 
     
      
       
      Ground of appeal 4: Unsupportable verdict 
       
      
    67 Ground of appeal 4 was - 
     
      
       
        
        “4. The verdict of the jury is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. 
        
       
       
       PARTICULARS 
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) It was not open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant had done an act(s) which interfered with a crew member of the aircraft (namely Andrew Stocks), whether in the performance of his duties or otherwise. 
           
           
          (ii) It was not open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant lacked justification for performing the act(s) said to constitute the said interference. 
          
         
        
       
      
    68 In large part the ground of appeal rested upon the submissions made in support of grounds of appeal 1, 2 and 3. It was said in substance that the jury could not be satisfied of interference with Mr Stocks when none of moving towards the flight deck, addressing the passengers or refusing to leave the aircraft despite requests involved touching or threatening Mr Stocks, or preventing him from doing what he thought necessary to perform his duties. Rather, it was said, in dealing with the situation even as Mr Stocks perceived it he was carrying out his duties, albeit different duties from those which he would otherwise have been carrying out.  
     
      
    69 For reasons earlier given, I do not accept the limited view of interference with a crew member within the meaning of s 24(1)(a). There was ample evidence on which, if appropriately directed, the jury could have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of interference with Mr Stocks in the performance of his duties. Moving towards the door to the flight deck so that Mr Stocks “had to reach over and shoulder [the appellant] and slam the front door” could of itself amount to interference, and whether remaining in his seat and refusing to leave for some time was hindrance or prevention taking Mr Stocks outside the ordinary performance of his duties so as to amount to interference was for the jury.  
     
      
    70 The further matter in the submissions in support of this ground was concerned with what in particular (ii) was called justification. 
     
      
    71 The jury was directed, through MFI 7, that it was necessary that the appellant either intended that Mr Stocks would be interfered with in the performance of his duties, or - 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) … was aware of a substantial risk that his act would interfere with a crew member of that aircraft in the course of the performance of his duties; and  
         
         
        (ii) having regard to the circumstances known to him it was unjustifiable to take the risk.” 
        
       
      
    72 The alternatives were intention or recklessness. The terms in which recklessness was expressed came from s 5.4(1) of the Criminal Code (C’th). 
     
      
    73 The appellant submitted that the evidence did not permit a reasonable jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, in the circumstances known to him, it was unjustifiable to take the risk of interference with a crew member, Mr Stocks. Even if his conduct would cause what the written submissions described as “a minor delay in having [Mr Stocks] finalise the departure preparations”, it was said that as a paying passenger who was being dealt with unfairly and had done nothing to warrant refusal to fly him, and was given what he knew to be false reasons why he was not to be allowed to fly, he was justified in taking the risk. 
     
      
    74 Apart from passing over the appellant’s intention as distinct from his recklessness, the submission is flawed. First, it assumes that the appellant’s account of events was accepted by the jury, and that his knowledge of the circumstances was found by them accordingly. But there was conflicting evidence, and it was for the jury to decide the facts. Secondly, it misapprehends “unjustifiable” in s 5.4. Whether taking a risk was unjustifiable calls for assessment of the likelihood of the risk eventuating according to its nature and in the circumstances, if the act is done, and whether the risk is one which should have been taken. Whether taking the risk was unjustifiable “requires the jury to make a moral or value judgment concerning the accused’s advertent disregard of the risk”: R v Saengsi-Or [2004] NSWCCA 108; (2004) 61 NSWLR 135 at [70] per Bell J, Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing. To focus on the two features of the conduct in question, moving towards the door to the flight deck would have been likely to have caused Mr Stocks to intervene as he said he did, and refusing to leave the aircraft of itself would in the circumstances have been likely to delay its departure. Even if the appellant was justified in the sense of being in the right, which so far as relevant was a matter for the jury, whether taking the risk was unjustifiable is a different question. 
     
      
    75 It was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended that his conduct would interfere with Mr Stocks in the performance of his duties. There was evidence on which the jury could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was aware of a substantial risk that his conduct would interfere with Mr Stocks, and that taking the risk was unjustifiable. It may be noted that the appellant had flown many times, that there was direct evidence that he knew that the aircraft was being delayed in Mr Bultitude’s account of his address to the passengers, and that if Mr Stocks’ evidence (supported by other witnesses) were accepted the jury could conclude that it was the appellant, not Mr Stocks, who was acting unreasonably.  
     
      
       
      The proviso 
       
      
    76 The Crown submitted that the Court should consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred, and dismiss the appeal pursuant to the proviso in s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It was submitted that the evidence of moving towards the flight deck, and particularly that the clear evidence of refusing to leave the aircraft despite requests, would on this Court’s assessment bring satisfaction of the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt: Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [35]-[36]; Cesan v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; (2009) 250 ALR 192 at [123]. 
     
      
    77 There was conflicting evidence in relation to moving towards the flight deck, and finding with some precision what occurred is necessary and can not be done by us. Whether refusing to leave the aircraft despite requests was interference with Mr Stocks in the performance of his duties involved whether there was hindrance or prevention taking him outside the ordinary performance of his duties, a matter on which the jury’s evaluation was appropriate and which in part involved disputed facts. It is also necessary to consider intention or recklessness, which this Court can not properly do on the disputed evidence. I do not think the proviso should be applied. 
     
      
       
      The result 
       
      
    78 The appellant primarily sought an acquittal on the basis that it was not open to the jury to convict, alternatively a retrial. It was faintly suggested that we should decline to order a new trial because the judge had only imposed a fine and a bond, and because the Crown had contributed to the miscarriage through the way it had chosen to present its case. The view is open that excessive resources of the justice system have been devoted to the charge against the appellant, but the view is also open that, if the offence was committed, it was such as to warrant prosecution, and the sentence was not insignificant. Whether a new trial should not proceed should be a matter for the prosecuting authorities. 
     
      
    79 The foregoing reasons lead to quashing of the conviction and a new trial, and I propose orders accordingly: 
     
      
    80 GROVE J: I agree with Giles JA. 
     
      
    81 HALL J: I agree with Giles JA.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR : These three offenders (all brothers) each stand to be sentenced for the offence of Manslaughter, arising out of the death of Sione Matavesi (the victim) on 6 January 2007. As the following facts disclose, the youngest of the offenders, RT, was directly responsible for inflicting a fatal knife wound to the victim, in defence of his older brothers to an excessive degree. TT and ET are liable for the victim’s death on the basis that they participated in an affray in the knowledge that serious physical injury could result. 
     
      
    2 Before passing to a consideration of the objective criminality of each of the offenders, some general observations are necessary to place the actions of each of the offenders and the victim in their proper context. Emotions were high in both “camps” on the night of the offence, although for different reasons. Two of the offenders, TT and RT, were returning to their home with two friends via North Liverpool Road on the anniversary of the death of another brother, who had been struck by a car on that same road. Mr Matavesi was visiting friends at 28 North Liverpool Rd at the time. He had been consuming large amounts of alcohol and methamphetamine that night in the company of other young males. The two groups came into conflict in the street, where the victim and his associates, who initiated the fight, gained the upper hand and chased the offenders from the scene to their home, about 300 metres away. Both TT and RT were punched by Mr Matavesi. TT was struck in the head with a bottle by a member of Mr Matavesi’s group. 
     
      
    3 Had the skirmish ended there, the offenders’ parents would have their three remaining sons at home, the offenders would be living productive lives within a loving and supportive environment, and Sione Matavesi would know the youngest of his three daughters, born after his death. Instead, in a show of senseless bravado, TT and RT woke ET from his sleep and all three returned to confront Mr Matavesi and his friends. TT and ET had armed themselves with a knife and a sword. These weapons were visible to Mr Matavesi and his friends as the offenders approached, and, in response, the victim’s group also took up swords and knives. Mr Matavesi struck first at ET with a sword, and a general melee broke out. The result was the loss of a young man’s life, a young man who had family of his own, and the loss of the offenders’ liberty.  
     
      
    4 This is yet another occasion for the Court to comment on the abhorrence with which the law regards the use or threatened use of knives and similar weapons, particularly in public, in order to settle a dispute between parties. The resort to weapons during the commission of offences has always been regarded by the courts as an aggravating feature, and for good reason. That long-standing policy is now recognised in s 21A(2)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    5 Notwithstanding the submissions of counsel for ET to the contrary, all three offenders fall within the terms of s 21A(2)(c). The provision speaks in terms of the offence involving the actual or threatened use of a weapon. Even accepting the assertions by ET that he armed himself with a samurai sword (described by the Crown as “conspicuous”) in order to protect himself and his brothers, and that he went to the North Liverpool Rd premises “to hear from them what their excuse was” (Exhibit 4), it cannot be doubted that his actions were interpreted, not surprisingly, by Mr Matavesi as hostile. Thus, despite telling Mr Matavesi that he only wanted to talk, ET was very soon thereafter engaged in a sword fight with Mr Matavesi, during which ET suffered a head wound. This was the beginning of the affray, which underlies ET’s plea to the offence. In that sense, the offence involved the actual use of a weapon by ET, albeit for a short period of time. 
     
      
    6 TT also attempted to use the knife he had brought with him, against Mr Matavesi, but was struck to the head with a blunt instrument and dropped the knife. It was that knife which RT retrieved from the ground and used to stab Mr Matavesi. Both of these offenders used the same weapon in the course of the offence. 
     
      
    7 The objective criminality of ET and TT are indistinguishable, save that TT was subject to a two-year good behaviour bond for a minor property offence. RT’s objective criminality must be greater, given that he was directly responsible for the wound that penetrated the upper left section of the victim’s back, passing between the fifth and sixth ribs into the lower lobe of the left lung, where the pulmonary blood vessels were cut. The blow with the knife was sufficiently forceful to break the handle from the blade. I accept that the actions of all three offenders were provoked by the victim’s aggressive behaviour, and that the victim could not be restrained, even by members of his own group. That factor tempers the objective criminality of each of the offenders and the objective gravity of the offence. 
     
      
    8 RT was seven months short of his 18th birthday at the time of the offence. The principles established by s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 have some limited relevance in his case, given his proximity to adulthood. Punishment and general deterrence are of only marginal lesser weight than in the respective case of his brothers in these circumstances.  
     
      
    9 Allowing for the broad range of circumstances that are capable of constituting the offence of Manslaughter, this offence occupies a position moderately below the middle of the range indicated by the maximum penalty of 25 years. General deterrence and punishment must find expression in the sentence, particularly because of the use of weapons in the context of violent public disorder. However, the subjective circumstances of each offender must also figure in the formulation of the sentence to be imposed in each case. ET and RT had no criminal history at the time of the offence, although RT had committed a break and enter offence before his arrest for this offence. Nothing in the offenders’ backgrounds indicate a propensity to violence ; on the contrary, the family espouses strong Christian values and is highly regarded in the community. This offence appears an aberration in that respect. Neither personal deterrence nor rehabilitation has a significant role to play in the sentencing exercise.  
     
      
    10 There are a number of subjective features which are common to each offender. The offenders’ father (step-father to TT and ET) is from Fiji and is employed as a warehouse worker. Their mother works in a hardware store and is of half Maori origin. Both parents are in good physical and mental health and enjoy a positive and supportive relationship with their three sons and two daughters. All three offenders completed their secondary schooling in Sydney and obtained employment immediately after leaving school. All three offenders claim to have been subjected to racial taunts whilst at school and coped by becoming protective of each other and socialising primarily within the family. They were all deeply affected by the tragic death of their brother Darryl in January 2006. All three offenders report some moderate consumption of alcohol and experimentation with cannabis. However none of the offenders appear to have any substance abuse issues. Alcohol and drugs were not factors in the commission of the offence, at least as far as the offenders were concerned. All three offenders have expressed deep remorse through their mother, and in the case of ET, in the course of evidence. I accept that they are unlikely to re-offend and that their rehabilitation is assured by the support of their family. None of them have served any custodial sentence. 
     
      
    11 I turn to the subjective case advanced on behalf of each offender. 
     
      
    12 TT was 20 years of age at the time of the offence. He sustained a fracture to the right frontal lobe of his skull as a result of the affray on the date of the offence. He spent a number of days in hospital under guard and upon discharge was charged with this offence. It appears that since the offender sustained this head injury, his memory has suffered and he reports severe headaches at least once per week. His current cognitive limitations suggest frontal lobe brain damage. Whilst in custody, this offender has been working for CSI industries as an electrical fitter. He is highly regarded by his former employer as a good worker and a loyal friend. He attends church each week and also Buddhist prayers every second week.  
     
      
    13 ET was 25 years of age at the time of the offence. As the eldest of the brothers he feels a significant sense of responsibility for the commission of the offence, having made the decision to return to the scene of the earlier conflict. ET's natural father went to jail when ET was approximately 7 years of age. Thereafter, he was raised in New Zealand by his grandparents. He came to Australia on his own at the age of 16 years to live with his mother and siblings. After leaving school, he obtained employment on a casual basis, first as an assistant butcher, then as a security guard. A number of testimonials were tendered on his behalf, all of which describe the offender as honest and trustworthy with a gentle disposition. He has been in custody since 9 January 2007. ET suffered a 12 mm skull fracture in the course of the affray and was treated at Liverpool Hospital. 
     
      
    14 RT completed his Higher School Certificate in 2006. His academic performance suffered owing to the death of his brother Darryl in that same year. RT secured some part-time work at his father's place of employment, and was offered full-time work with his uncle in the scaffolding industry. He remained in that employment until his arrest. His employer and former teachers speak well of him. The Juvenile Justice report observes that RT has ""demonstrated considerable ability in applying himself to focus and seek educational attainment whilst managing the stress and anxiety of legal matters. He has completed numerous TAFE, vocational and other courses offered whilst in custody."" His overall behaviour in custody has been described as very good. RT has been in custody since 9 January 2007. 
     
      
    15 The pleas of guilty were entered in the week fixed for trial, before the Crown had marshalled its witnesses and before a jury was empanelled. It is not to the point that discussions about the basis of the pleas did not begin until that time. The CCA has stated a number of times, most recently in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102, that a plea of guilty at or just before the trial date will rarely attract a discount of more than 15%. That is the discount I propose to apply. 
     
      
    16 I accept, and the Crown agrees, that a finding of special circumstances is appropriate in each case, in order to allow for an increased period of supervision in the community following release. Taking into account all of these matters, I propose to sentence as follows :- 
     
      
    17 RT, you are convicted of the Manslaughter of Sione Matavesi. You are sentenced to a non parole period of 3 years 6 months, to date from 9 January 2007, expiring 8 July 2010, with a balance of term of 3 years, expiring 8 July 2013. You are eligible for release to parole on 9 July 2010. I direct that the sentence be served as a juvenile offender. 
     
      
    18 TT, you are convicted of the Manslaughter of Sione Matavesi. You are sentenced to a non parole period of 3 years 3 months, to date from 6 January 2007, expiring 5 April 2010, with a balance of term of 3 years, expiring 5 April 2013. You are eligible for release to parole on 6 April 2010.  
     
      
    19 ET, you are convicted of the Manslaughter of Sione Matavesi. You are sentenced to a non parole period of 3 years, to date from 9 January 2007, expiring 8 January 2010, with a balance of term of 3 years, expiring 8 January 2013. You are eligible for release to parole on 9 January 2010.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Albert James Paddock was charged with the murder of his partner, Barbara Ingram. On 26 February 2009, Mr Paddock pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter, which plea was accepted by the Crown, in full discharge of the indictment. As I will shortly set out, the facts make clear that the basis of the plea of manslaughter is substantial impairment of mind.  
     
      
    Facts 
     
      
    2 There is a statement of agreed facts, which I summarise in the following way. Mr Paddock is 80 years of age and was 78 at the date of the offence (22 May 2007). Ms Ingram was 70 years of age on the date that Mr Paddock killed her. Their relationship had commenced in about 1987 or 1988. The couple lived in a relocatable home at Redhead Beach Holiday Park. Ms Ingram, who had a long-standing history of heart problems (Pulmonary Hypertension and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus [Lupus or SLE]), died of asphyxiation, caused by Mr Paddock suffocating the victim with his hand on her nose and mouth for some period of time with a significant degree of pressure (evidenced by associated injuries to the face).  
     
      
    3 From 2005, the relationship between Mr Paddock and his partner began to deteriorate. They slept in separate rooms, but continued to live together under the same roof. Mr Paddock displayed worsening features of paranoia and dementia. He accused Ms Ingram of having an affair with a Newcastle drug lord and that this drug lord was following him around or had people doing so. Mr Paddock followed her around when she attended exercise classes or at shopping centres, picture theatres and the like. He also questioned Ms Ingram’s 9-year-old grandchild as to the persons to whom Ms Ingram spoke, when she took him to the pictures.  
     
      
    4 In or about June 2006, Ms Ingram expressed the view that she could no longer live with the offender, due to his dominance and his paranoia about her suspected affairs. Ms Ingram had made clear to others that Mr Paddock had not been physically violent, but had engaged in verbal abuse, focussed on the belief that she was having affairs, which had become progressively worse, and that she, Ms Ingram, could take it no longer. Apparently Ms Ingram applied to the Housing Commission for alternate accommodation and had told Mr Paddock that she was intending to move out.  
     
      
    5 Friends and acquaintances noticed the deterioration in the mental condition of Mr Paddock, his obsession with a belief that Ms Ingram was having affairs with other men and his increasing paranoia. Mr Paddock obsessed about the fact that he was being followed and that his life was in danger.  
     
      
    6 In early 2007, Ms Ingram attended the Country Music Festival at Tamworth with her sister, her cousin and another friend. Apparently Mr Paddock engaged a private investigator to follow her as part of the increasing delusion and paranoia that she was having an affair with a drug lord, who was intending to do him harm.  
     
      
    7 Approximately two weeks before 22 May 2007, Ms Ingram spoke with her daughter and told her that she could no longer cope with the paranoia displayed by Mr Paddock. Ms Ingram’s daughter arranged for Ms Ingram to move out in the next two or three weeks and live with her granddaughter. It was proposed that the move would take place on the weekend of 26 and 27 May 2007. This separation was discussed between Mr Paddock and Ms Ingram and, with the help of Ms Ingram’s daughter and another resident of the Park, they compiled (but did not immediately execute) an agreement on the distribution of their property, to the effect that the relocatable home (and any rights to a lease or licence) would be retained by Mr Paddock and the motor car owned by them would be retained by Ms Ingram. Further, personal property at the home would become the property of Ms Ingram.  
     
      
    8 On 19 May 2007, Ms Ingram’s daughter made arrangements for her mother to visit before lunch on 22 May 2007. At or about 10.00am on 21 May 2007, Ms Ingram gave notice to the Park Manager at Redhead that she intended to leave and, at or about 11.30am, she and Mr Paddock attended the local newsagency. At the newsagency they each executed the document relating to property ownership.  
     
      
    9 At about 4.00pm on 21 May 2007, Ms Ingram notified of her inability to attend exercise classes, because she was packing. Ms Ingram died in the early hours of 22 May 2007. Her daughter rang the telephone at the home at Redhead at approximately 9.30am on 22 May 2007 and spoke with Mr Paddock. He told her that her mother was making headway packing, but said she was not there at the time. Further, he told her that her mother was outside talking to a grey-haired older lady, and had gone somewhere with her, and that he did not know when she would be back. He apologised for his behaviour over the previous two years and for the way that he had treated her mother.  
     
      
    10 At or about 2.00pm on 22 May 2007, Mr Paddock rang a friend and told him that he had “got her to sign the paper, … got her to sign the paper, she settled for the car and furniture.” He told the friend, with whom he had made previous arrangements, not to come until Wednesday 23 May 2007 at about 1.00pm. The friend had been shown the location of hidden personal documents, including funeral papers, belonging to Mr Paddock, for the stated reason, being, in case “anything happened to him”. At about 4.00pm on 22 May 2007, Mr Paddock went to a neighbour’s place and purchased four cigarettes from him.  
     
      
    11 At about 8.00pm on 22 May 2007, Mr Paddock telephoned Ms Ingram’s daughter on her mobile and said, to Ms Ingram’s daughter’s partner, words to the effect that Ms Ingram had gone away to assist a sick friend, would be away for a few days, and would not be able to contact her daughter. 
     
      
    12 At about 1.00pm on 23 May 2007, Mr Paddock’s friend arrived at his home, as previously arranged. Mr Paddock unlocked the main and security doors and stood back. He had blood on his face and neck and large lacerations on both forearms. The following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        Friend: “What the bloody hell is going on?” 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Paddock: “I lost it mate, I lost it mate, I killed her, I killed her.” 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Paddock: “Come in.” 
        
       
       
        
        Friend: “No, what’s the smell of gas?” 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Paddock: “I tried to gas myself but it didn’t work. You have guns, go home and get me one.” 
        
       
       
        
        Friend: “No way.” 
        
       
      
    The friend went to the office and asked staff to telephone the police and ambulance.  
     
      
    13 It seems that Mr Paddock had attempted suicide.  
     
      
    14 On being interviewed, Mr Paddock was, to say the least, confused. He initially stated that Ms Ingram came at him with her hands raised and a knife above her head. It is clear from the nature of the injuries and the cause of death that this is not so. Further, he explained the absence of any evidence to that effect, by suggesting that he washed the knife and had put it back in the knife block. Further, Mr Paddock had arranged a number of boxes with parts of notes in each box, which notes, if joined together, disclosed his paranoid delusions, referred to some money in a wallet, and requested to have the boxes and his personal items hidden. Mr Paddock explained that his “poor old brain was mixed up” and told the Police: 
     
      
       
        
        “I thought I’d end up shot one day or night, ‘cause I was dreaming about em [sic] bein’ [sic] in me [sic] bedroom and, and I didn’t know whether they had a gun or not … I was in a bad way when I wrote them.” 
        
       
      
    15 The money in the boxes, or to which the note referred, was for the purpose of paying bills. The note contained a message that the notes, once read, should be burnt.  
     
      
    Mr Paddock’s Medical Condition 
     
      
    16 Mr Paddock has been examined by a number of medical practitioners including a Psychogeriatrician and Neuropsychiatrist and Psychiatrists. Dr Sharon Reutens, Psychogeriatrician and Neuropsychiatrist, diagnosed Mr Paddock as having dementia with delusions and a differential diagnosis of delusional disorder. She recites that “there has been an eight-month history of belief that he was being followed by strangers, and that these people might harm him or kill him. He continues to feel he is being followed, even during his incarceration.” 
     
      
    17 Dr Reutens describes the belief as “not bizarre in nature but they were held with persistence despite alternative explanations being offered. There were no hallucinations, thought disorder or decline in functioning related to the beliefs, rendering the diagnosis of schizophrenia less likely. His psychotic condition was likely to be contributed to by his cataracts – sensory deficits are often found in people with the onset of delusions at a late age.” 
     
      
    18 At the time he was interviewed by Dr Reutens, Mr Paddock was being treated with anti-psychotic medication, but, nevertheless, continued to have little insight into the nature of his beliefs. Dr Reutens opined that Mr Paddock suffered from mild dementia, complicated by delusions which, not unusually in the elderly, occur in the context of sensory impairment (his cataracts significantly affect his eyesight).  
     
      
    19 Dr Nielssen, Psychiatrist, diagnosed Mr Paddock as having a late-onset psychotic illness and probable early dementia. The diagnosis of psychotic illness was based upon Mr Paddock’s account of the bizarre persecutory belief that he was being followed by drug dealers, who planned to shoot him, and the delusional belief that Ms Ingram, his partner, was having an affair with a drug lord.  
     
      
    20 Dr Nielssen considers that it is likely that Mr Paddock’s persecutory beliefs are an early symptom of his dementia. Dr Nielssen took the view that Mr Paddock was fit to enter a plea and fit for trial, but that his mental condition deprived him of the knowledge that what he was doing was wrong, because he believed that he was in immediate danger. The condition, he said, deprived him of the capacity to reason with sense and composure about the consequences of his actions.  
     
      
    21 Professor Greenberg, a Forensic Psychiatrist who was qualified by the Crown for the purpose of assessing Mr Paddock, provided a report and supplementary report. After reciting the history and background of Mr Paddock, Professor Greenberg came to the view that Mr Paddock was suffering from a Delusional Disorder with paranoid features. Further, it was Professor Greenberg’s view that Mr Paddock had early signs of mild dementia. Professor Greenberg came to the conclusion that Mr Paddock had an understanding of the legal “wrongfulness” of his actions, which conclusion is based upon matters outlined in Professor Greenberg’s report.  
     
      
    22 Professor Greenberg, in a supplementary report, commented on Mr Paddock’s risk for future violence. He comments that Mr Paddock continues to have poor insight with regards to his delusional disorder, and comments that Mr Paddock continues to have residual psychotic symptoms, despite being treated with anti-psychotic medications since his entry at the correctional facility. Ultimately, Professor Greenberg regards Mr Paddock as “falling into a low-moderate risk category group for future violence”.  
     
      
    Conclusions 
     
      
    23 The charge to which Mr Paddock has pleaded guilty assumes an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, the culpability for which is ameliorated by the mental condition that Mr Paddock now suffers and suffered at the time that he killed Ms Ingram.  
     
      
    24 Manslaughter is an extremely serious offence. It involves the felonious taking of a human life and the legislature has fixed a maximum sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment, to be imposed in the worst category of case. There is no standard non-parole period. It is clear that Mr Paddock’s actions are not in the worst category of cases for manslaughter. The actions of Mr Paddock put his conduct in the mid-range of culpability, without regard to the subjective features, other than that which is necessary for diminished responsibility.  
     
      
    25 The starting point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty for manslaughter, and a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case, is that every case of manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life. Ms Ingram, while elderly, was entitled to live out her life with her daughter and grandchildren, who have been denied the benefit of their mother and grandmother respectively. Of course, nothing can return her to them and, while nothing I can do will ameliorate the tragedy to them, they should also understand that, but for the mental condition suffered by Mr Paddock, this offence and this death would, most likely, never have occurred.  
     
      
    26 The circumstances that give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the degrees of culpability so wide, that it is impossible to establish a sentencing tariff to be applied to all cases. Manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349; R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397; R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, unreported); Salah v R [2009] NSWCCA 2; Berrier v R [2009] NSWCCA 40.  
     
      
    27 While there is no doubt that the condition of Mr Paddock was a significant factor in the commission of this offence, there is, notwithstanding the evidence of Dr Reutens, no reasonable doubt that Mr Paddock could differentiate right from wrong and was responsible for his actions.  
     
      
    28 As earlier stated, sentencing involves the resolution of sometimes conflicting goals: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. These purposes overlap and cannot be considered in isolation from each other, even though they often point in different directions: Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ. The High Court went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “And so a mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society when he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for a particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects: one which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards a shorter. These effects may balance out, but consideration of the danger to society cannot lead to the imposition of a more severe penalty than would have been imposed if the offender had not been suffering from a mental abnormality.” ( 
        Veen (No 2) 
        ,  
         ibid, at 476-477.) 
        
       
      
    29 As already stated, the maximum sentence is 25 years’ imprisonment and there is no standard non-parole period. Mr Paddock has no criminal history and, but for this offence, is and was unknown to the Police. It seems the only aggravating feature of the offence, beyond what would otherwise be encompassed within the crime of manslaughter occasioned in the manner that this was, is the fact that the victim was elderly and vulnerable. The actual use of violence and the infliction of injury that was substantial, each of which were involved in this offence, are both matters that are elements of the offence itself, and are not aggravating factors. 
     
      
    30 There are a number of mitigating factors that the Court takes into account in determining the appropriate sentence. Although there are some aspects of the conduct of Mr Paddock that suggest some degree of planning, that conduct seems to be, on the balance of probabilities, no more than a manifestation of the paranoia generally displayed by Mr Paddock. As earlier stated, this offence is the first offence committed by Mr Paddock, who has no criminal record and is not otherwise known to the Police. Mr Paddock was, hitherto, a person of good character and the medical evidence suggests that, while there is some risk of re-offending, it is unlikely. Mr Paddock is now on anti-psychotic drugs and, as a consequence, is unlikely to re-offend. That factor must be qualified by the dementia, although there is no evidence to suggest that the dementia, by itself, would trigger conduct of the kind for which Mr Paddock has been charged.  
     
      
    31 Mr Paddock has shown some remorse, evidenced, for example, by the plea, but the quality of it is difficult to gauge. The nature of his psychiatric condition makes remorse difficult for him to display and I do not take into account, to any substantial degree, remorse for the offence, if any, said to be disclosed by Mr Paddock. On the other hand, Mr Paddock was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions at the time they were committed. In that regard, it is important to ensure that such a mitigating factor is not double-counted with the substantial impairment of mind which gave rise to manslaughter, rather than murder.  
     
      
    32 Mr Paddock was arrested and has been in custody since 23 May 2007. The medical evidence suggests that his impairment is to a significant degree more than would have been necessary to give rise to the diminution in culpability associated with the lesser charge. On that basis, the “additional” impairment is required to be taken into account in determining the sentence: R v Keceski (Court of Criminal Appeal, 10 August 1993, unreported). 
     
      
    33 As has been stated on a number of occasions, Mr Paddock’s mental condition must be considered in terms of the sentencing goals. It may well be, and in my view in this case it is the fact, that Mr Paddock’s mental disability entitles him to be regarded as a less suitable vehicle for general deterrence of the community at large. The community cannot expect that a person, with significant mental disability, should be the example by which others are deterred from committing offences.  
     
      
    34 Nevertheless, the fact that Mr Paddock suffers from a mental illness does not mean that a prison sentence should not be imposed, or that the sentence should be less than the circumstances that the case would otherwise suggest. A full-time custodial sentence is appropriate. The treatment of Mr Paddock’s dementia, while less easily treated in prison than in private care, is ultimately a responsibility of the Executive Government. The Executive Government is required to provide for the care and treatment of his dementia, while he is in prison: R v Vachalec (1981) NSWLR 351, per Street CJ at 353-354. If Mr Paddock’s condition deteriorates during the course of the sentence, such that his release ought be permitted on humanitarian grounds, again, it is a matter for the Executive, which is empowered to deal with the situation and grant Royal Prerogative of mercy. Neither is a matter that the Court takes into account in fixing this sentence: R v Jones (1993) 70 A Crim R 449; R v Keir [2004] NSWCCA 106.  
     
      
    35 I turn then to the issue of the plea that was offered by Mr Paddock. Well prior to the plea being entered, namely, on 3 December 2008, following the receipt of the first report of Professor Greenberg on 1 December 2008, Mr Paddock, through his legal representatives, contacted the Director of Public Prosecutions, and raised the issue of accepting a plea to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. Ultimately, on 26 February 2009, when Mr Paddock was initially arraigned for murder, he pleaded not guilty to that charge, but guilty of manslaughter, and the Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. It is a matter for the Crown, as to which of a number of charges is preferred; it is a matter for the accused, as to which charge he pleads guilty; and it is a matter for the Court, as to the sentence to be imposed. The Court is required to take into account the early plea of guilty. A discount is granted for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty: R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. I take into account the early plea of guilty and assess the utilitarian value and the discount for the plea at 20 percent. 
     
      
    36 The Crown submits that there may be circumstances capable of constituting special circumstances, such that the discretion provided for in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 could be exercised. The Court considers that Mr Paddock’s age and circumstances warrant a finding of special circumstances. I do not take account of Mr Paddock’s psychiatric disability, as this would be to double-count the effect of elements and matters already considered, and the amount by which I will reduce the non-parole period is small.  
     
      
    37 I come then to the range available and the appropriate sentence to be imposed. I am most grateful for the extensive material provided to me by counsel who appeared for Mr Paddock and by the Crown. Those cases include R v Hawkins [2001] NSWSC 420 in which O’Keefe J imprisoned an elderly person, in not dissimilar circumstances, to 3 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years. In Regina v Connolly [2001] NSWSC 787, the offender killed his wife, under the delusional and false belief that his wife was being unfaithful to him, and was sentenced for manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. This also was a circumstance not dissimilar to that which is before the Court in the current situation. Similar circumstances arose in Regina v Mabbott [2002] NSWSC 502, R v Antaky [2007] NSWSC 1047 and R v Ferguson [2008] NSWSC 761. I accept the range for sentences suggested by counsel for Mr Paddock and acknowledged as correct by the Crown. I consider that an appropriate commencement point (before the discount for the plea of guilty) for the head sentence is 7 ½ years.  
     
      
    Conviction and Sentence 
     
      
    38 Mr Paddock, you are convicted of the manslaughter of Barbara Beryl Ingram, committed on or about 22 May 2007.  
     
      
    39 I sentence you to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months commencing on the date of your arrest, 23 May 2007, and expiring on 22 August 2011, the balance of term being 1 year and 9 months, expiring on 22 May 2013.  
     
      
    40 You are first eligible for release on 22 August 2011.

     JUDGMENT 
    1. The first defendant challenges the form and capacity of imputations 3(a)(i) and 6(a)(i) as pleaded in paragraphs 3 and 6 of the Statement of Claim and seeks orders for verification of particulars of publication. The claim for defamation is brought only against the first defendant and the second defendant did not participate in the argument. 2. The text of the two matters complained of is set out in my previous judgment (Lassanah v State of NSW [2009] NSWDC 73).3. The imputations pleaded in paragraph 3 are: 
     
     (a) (i) The first plaintiff is a thief. 
      
      
      OR 
      
      
     (a) (ii) The first plaintiff is an attempted thief. 
      
     (b) The first plaintiff intended to steal from the Tag Heuer Boutique Shop. 
      
     (c) (i) The second plaintiff is a thief. 
      
      
      OR 
      
      
     (c) (ii) The second plaintiff is an attempted thief. 
      
     (d) The second plaintiff intended to steal from the Tag Heuer Boutique Shop. 
    4. The imputations pleaded in paragraph 6 are:  
     
     (a) (i) The first plaintiff is a thief. 
      
      
      OR 
      
      
     (a) (ii) The first plaintiff is an attempted thief. 
      
     (b) The first plaintiff intended to steal from the Tag Heuer Boutique Shop. 
      
     (c) (i) The second plaintiff is a thief. 
      
      
      OR 
      
      
     (c) (ii) The second plaintiff is an attempted thief. 
      
     (d) The second plaintiff intended to steal from the Tag Heuer Boutique Shop. 
    5. Mr Caspersonn submitted that neither of the matters complained of state the plaintiffs are thieves, but only that they are being stopped before they attempt to steal.6. Courts must approach the task of striking out imputations with great caution. If reasonable minds may differ as to whether or not the matter complained of is capable of conveying a defamatory meaning, then the application should be refused: Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 186. 7. The first imputation is pleaded with the alternative, lesser imputation as a “fall-back”. The pleader has clearly heeded the warning of Hunt A-JA in Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 255 at [78]:  
     
     “ 
     [78] 
      If a plaintiff chooses to plead an imputation which is by no means assured of success without the alternative of a fall-back imputation, and if the jury does not accept it, there is much to be said — in compliance with Pt 1 r 3 — for the exercise of the discretion to refuse to allow the plaintiff to mend his hand at a second trial by pleading what should have been a fall-back imputation at the first trial and taking the chance that the defendant will not succeed in a plea of truth.” 
    8. Given the context and language of this oral publication, whether the words convey the imputation that each of the plaintiffs is a thief, or only an attempted thief, is a matter for the jury. The first defendant’s application to strike out imputations 3(a)(i) and 6(a)(i) is refused.9. The plaintiffs supplied particulars of publication in paragraphs 2 and 5. These were that the words were spoken by police officers to the plaintiffs within the hearing of each other and within the hearing of unnamed passers by who stopped to watch. The first defendant has sought further particulars but the plaintiffs are unable to name these persons. The first defendant seeks an order that these answers to particulars be verified.10. For reasons that I have set out in more detail in Moses v State of New South Wales (No. 2) [2009] NSWDC 99, in which the same counsel have appeared today, this application is rejected.11. The plaintiffs have been entirely successful in this application and a costs order will be made in the plaintiffs’ favour.Orders (1) Application by first defendant to strike out imputations 3(a)(i) and 6(a)(i) and for verified answers to particulars refused.(2) First defendant pay plaintiffs’ costs of the application.(3) Orders in accordance with the Short Minutes of Order filed in court.(4) Stood over for further directions to Friday 11 September 2009 at 9:00am.

     JUDGMENT 
    1. The defendant brings an application to strike out imputations on the basis of form and capacity and to request further and better particulars of identification. I have heard argument on these issues this morning and now give reasons for the orders I have made.2. The text of the two matters complained of is set out in my previous judgment (Moses v State of New South Wales [2009] NSWDC 74). I shall deal first with the objections to imputations.The first publication3. The first publication concerns a publication about the first plaintiff. The imputations pleaded to arise from the first publication are:  
     
     (a) The plaintiff robbed women. 
      
     (b) The plaintiff is a thief. 
      
     (c) The plaintiff stole from women. 
    4. In the course of argument Mr Dibb agreed that imputations (a) and (c) did not differ in substance, and agreed to withdraw (a).5. How can it be said that imputation (b) and (c) differ in substance? The answer is that imputation (b) sets out a “condition” (namely that the plaintiff is a thief) while imputation (c) sets out an “act” (namely that the plaintiff stole from women). It is settled law that an imputation of “condition” will differ in substance from another imputation setting out a specific act, for the reasons explained by Hunt J in Singleton v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (Supreme Court of NSW, Hunt J, 20 February 1980, unreported). Hunt J clarified the difference as follows: 
     
     “Imputation (b) is conceded by the plaintiff to be no more than a particular instance of the general allegation made by Imputation (a). In the light of this concession, the defendant argues that the two imputations are not different in substance, as required by r 11(3). As any imputation pleaded must be taken to include all other imputations which do not differ in substance ( 
     Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Ltd 
      (1977) 2 NSWLR 749, at 771), it is wrong in principle, it is said, to plead both the general and the particular applications of the same allegation. 
      
      
     In my view, such a principle is stated too broadly. It may be tested by considering what  
     must 
      be proved by way of justification to each such imputation. One of the most oft-quoted cases is that of  
     Bishop v Latimer 
      (1861) 4 LT (NS) 775. The heading to the defendant's report was in the terms: ""How Lawyer Bishop treats his clients"". Proof that the plaintiff had treated one client badly in one particular case was held to be an insufficient justification of the heading, which implied that he so treated his clients generally (at 775). 
      
      
     Another way by which the principle contended for by the defendant may be tested is by considering what  
     may  
     be proved by way of justification to each such imputation. Where the imputation consists of a general allegation, it is open to the defendant to establish the truth of that allegation by proof of matters entirely unrelated to the specific instance identified in the matter complained of. The leading case is of  
     Maisel v Financial Times Ltd  
     (1915) 112 LT 953. The matter complained of reported the arrest of the plaintiff, the director of a company, on a charge of fraud. In his Statement of Claim, the plaintiff relied upon an imputation that he was an unfit person to be the director of any company. The defendant was held by the House of Lords to be entitled to justify that imputation by relying upon a number of other dishonest acts, quite independent of that for which he was said in the matter complained of to have been arrested. For an even more startling example, see  
     McGrath v Black 
      (1926) 135 LT 594. 
      
      
     The question is whether the general allegation is different in substance from the particular. In most cases, in my opinion, it would be. In many cases, the allegation in the matter complained of that the plaintiff was guilty of misconduct on a particular occasion will not support an imputation alleged in general terms.” 
    6. In Boyd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 450 a defendant unsuccessfully made a similar complaint concerning the pleading of an imputation in general terms as well as an imputation of specific conduct. Hunt J noted (at 455) that while a description of one specific incident was usually incapable of supporting an imputation expressed in terms of general application, an article with the heading ‘BOYD IS FAT, SLOW AND PREDICTABLE’ was not just criticizing his play in one football match but his general condition (or lack of it).7. The facts in this case are similar. The first plaintiff in this publication is accused not of one theft but of a number of thefts from women. The first plaintiff is entitled to plead both the general condition and the particular acts because a person who has stolen more than once can be called a thief.8. The defendant’s objection that imputations (b) and (c) do not differ in substance accordingly fails.The second publication9. The second publication concerns a publication about the second plaintiff. The imputations pleaded to arise from the second publication are: 
     
     (a) The second plaintiff is a criminal. 
      
     (b) The second plaintiff is going to go to gaol. 
      
     (c) The second plaintiff has been arrested by the police for criminal activities. 
      
     (d) The second plaintiff is a despicable person. 
    10. The defendant’s objection to imputation (c) is that it does not differ in substance from imputation (b), that it did not arise and that it is not defamatory to say of a person that they have been arrested by the police for criminal activities.11. The second plaintiff’s submissions were threefold. Firstly, imputations are no more than particulars and are no longer the cause of action, so the standard for striking out an imputation is very low. However, if an imputation is not able to be conveyed, does not differ in substance and/or is not defamatory, the fact that imputations now have the status of particulars does not permit them to be pleaded. While a court must approach its task in exercising the discretion to strike out imputations with great caution (Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 186) these requirements still exist.12. Secondly, Mr Dibb submitted that the imputation needs to be read in context of the whole of the matter complained of, which has the statement ‘you’re under arrest” as well as “you’re going to gaol” and that the ordinary reasonable reader would consider being under arrest (but not going to gaol) as carrying a separate sting from being under arrest for an offence which results in going to gaol. Mr Dibb submitted that people can be arrested for offences that do not result in going to gaol, and therefore the imputations did differ in substance. However, the clear thrust of what the police are alleged to have said is that the police have told a person they arrested that he is going to gaol, and to be pleading a fall back imputation of lesser seriousness is not only artificial but does not accurately reflect what is conveyed.13. Thirdly, Mr Dibb submitted that it was indeed defamatory to say of a person that he had been arrested for a criminal offence. However, the High Court of Australia in Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Harrison (1982) 149 CLR 293 at 300-301 explained: 
     
     “As we have seen, there is now a strong current of authority supporting the view that a report which does no more than state that a person has been arrested and has been charged with a criminal offence is incapable of bearing the imputation that he is guilty or probably guilty of that offence. The decisions are, I think, soundly based, even if we put aside the emphasis that has been given to the process of inference on inference that is involved in reaching a contrary conclusion. The ordinary reasonable reader is mindful of the principle that a person charged with a crime is presumed innocent until it is proved that he is guilty. Although he knows that many persons charged with a criminal offence are ultimately convicted, he is also aware that guilt or innocence is a question to be determined by a court, generally by a jury, and that not infrequently the person charged is acquitted. 
      
      
     In this situation the reader will view the plaintiff with suspicion, concluding that he is a person suspected by the police of having committed the offence and that they have ground for laying a charge against him. But this does not warrant the conclusion that by reporting the fact of arrest and charge a newspaper is imputing that the person concerned is guilty. A distinction needs to be drawn between the reader's understanding of what the newspaper is saying and judgments or conclusions which he may reach as a result of his own beliefs and prejudices. It is one thing to say that a statement is capable of bearing an imputation defamatory of the plaintiff because the ordinary reasonable reader would understand it in that sense, drawing on his own knowledge and experience of human affairs in order to reach that result. It is quite another thing to say that a statement is capable of bearing such an imputation merely because it excites in some readers a belief or prejudice from which they proceed to arrive at a conclusion unfavourable to the plaintiff. The defamatory quality of the published material is to be determined by the first, not by the second, proposition. Its importance for present purposes is that it focuses attention on what is conveyed by the published material in the mind of the ordinary reasonable reader.” 
    14. Notwithstanding the need for caution in striking out imputations, this is a clear case of an imputation which is neither conveyed nor defamatory and which, when the matter complained of is viewed as a whole, does not differ in substance from imputation 6C(b). For these reasons I strike out imputation 6C(c).Identification15. The particulars of identification for each publication are set out in paragraphs 3 and 6B of the statement of claim. Each of the plaintiffs pleads that the police officers words were “spoken in a loud voice within the hearing of passers by and residents of premises adjoining George Street, many of whom were standing at and near their front fence observing the police and the plaintiff.”16. In response to requests for particulars, the plaintiffs have indicated that they are unable to name any of these persons and have provided the best particulars that they can. The defendant now seeks particulars of publication of the kind sometimes called ‘Lazarus’ particulars (Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa (1985) 1 NSWLR 188), namely the provision of these particulars with verification.17. The facts in Lazarus were that the plaintiff, while a passenger on a Lufthansa plane, had an altercation with a Lufthansa employee while the plane was on the tarmac at New Delhi airport. The plaintiff claimed he was assaulted and words of a defamatory nature spoken. He could not identify the other persons present who heard the words but they would have included passengers seated in the immediate vicinity. 18. Hunt J ordered the provision of particulars with verification, on the basis that the plaintiff was being granted a considerable indulgence, in part because no particulars at all had been provided and the information “had to be extracted from his counsel during argument” (at 195). In circumstances where the plaintiff asserted the words had been spoken in a foreign location in the middle of the night in front of unknown persons, the question of whether the plaintiff could prove a prima facie case of publication, and the extent of the publication, was a real uncertainty.19. That is not the case here. The particulars given by the plaintiffs are the best particulars they can give; requiring verification of these will only add time and expense to this litigation, especially since the defendant can interrogate on this issue (by which time the plaintiffs may have located a witness). Furthermore, the words were spoken by police officers who are trained to keep records.20. There were strong reasons for making the kind of orders Hunt J made in Lazarus, including the failure of the plaintiff to provide any particulars and the uncertainty of a publication on an aeroplane in a foreign airport. However, the practice of requiring not only particulars of the persons who heard the matter complained of but that these particulars be supplied with verification is one that is now comparatively uncommon. Unlike the fact situation in Lazarus (where the question of whether there was any conversation at all was a live issue) the police clearly said something to the plaintiffs when they apprehended them both so there is a higher degree of certainty as to publication. In addition, the plaintiffs have already provided the best particulars they can in the circumstances.21. The defendant is entitled to interrogate the plaintiffs about publication and can obtain this answer with verification in the course of administering interrogatories. To require the plaintiffs to verify particulars already provided is an unnecessary extra expense to the parties. 22. Accordingly, the defendant’s application for the plaintiffs’ answers to particulars of publication to be verified is refused. 23. The defendant has successfully objected to two of the plaintiffs’ imputations and has pointed out a number of minor housekeeping matters to be corrected in the pleadings, which are reflected in the orders I make. As the defendant has been substantially successful the plaintiffs should pay the cost of the application.Orders(1) Grant leave to the plaintiffs to file Further Amended Statement of Claim in court.(2) The plaintiffs to pay the defendant’s costs thrown away by reason of the amendment.(3) Grant leave to withdraw imputation 4(a).(4) Imputation 6(c) struck out.(5) The plaintiffs to file a First Further Amended Statement of Claim as follows: 
     
     (a) deleting imputations 4(a) and 6(c); 
      
     (b) omitting “where he was charged” and “charge” from paragraph 6D; 
      
     (c) inserting the word “first” before “plaintiff” in paragraph 5A. 
    (6) Defendant’s application for particulars of publication to be verified refused.(7) The plaintiffs pay the defendant’s costs of this application.(8) Orders in accordance with the Short Minutes of Order filed in court.(9) Stood over for further directions to Friday 11 September 2009 at 9:00am.
